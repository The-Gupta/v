Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"The overarching paradigm for the activation of class III and V receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) prescribes cytokine-mediated dimerization of the receptor ectodomains and homotypic receptor-receptor interactions. However, structural studies have shown that the hematopoietic receptor FLT3, a class III RTK, does not appear to engage in such receptor-receptor contacts, despite its efficient dimerization by dimeric FLT3 ligand (FL). As part of efforts to better understand the intricacies of FLT3 activation, we sought to engineer a monomeric FL. It was found that a Leu27Asp substitution at the dimer interface of the cytokine led to a stable monomeric cytokine (FLL27D) without abrogation of receptor binding. The crystal structure of FLL27D at 1.65 A resolution revealed that the introduced point mutation led to shielding of the hydrophobic footprint of the dimerization interface in wild-type FL without affecting the conformation of the FLT3 binding site. Thus, FLL27D can serve as a monomeric FL variant to further interrogate the assembly mechanism of extracellular complexes of FLT3 in physiology and disease.",['open access.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3014-1851', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3420-5947']",20210406,PMC8034431,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'FLT3 ligand', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'receptor tyrosine kinases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"AGAP1 is often considered to regulate membrane trafficking, protein transport and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Recent studies have shown that aberrant expression of AGAP1 is associated with many diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It has been proposed that the GTP-binding protein-like domain (GLD) is involved in the binding of cofactors and thus regulates the catalytic activity of AGAP1. To obtain a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism underpinning AGAP1-related diseases, it is essential to obtain structural information. Here, the GLD (residues 70-235) of AGAP1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Affinity and gel-filtration chromatography were used to obtain AGAP1GLD with high purity for crystallization. Using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method with the protein at a final concentration of 20 mg ml(-1), AGAP1GLD protein crystals of suitable size were obtained. The crystals were found to diffract to 3.0 A resolution and belonged to space group I4, with unit-cell parameters a = 100.39, b = 100.39, c = 48.08 A. The structure of AGAP1GLD exhibits the highly conserved functional G1-G5 loops and is generally similar to other characterized ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), implying an analogous function to Arf GAPs. Additionally, this study indicates that AGAP1 could be classified as a type of NTPase, the activity of which might be regulated by protein partners or by its other domains. Taken together, these results provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of AGAP1 in cell signaling.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2614-8682', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8964-8641']",20210331,PMC8034428,['NOTNLM'],"['AGAP1', 'GTP-binding protein-like domain', 'X-ray crystallography']","['81970132/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81770142/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81800144/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '31800642/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '20JC1410600/Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality', '20152504/Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, Program for Professor of', 'Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning']",['2022/04/01 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Dec 13.,"Fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) at a total dose of 12 Gy is widely used for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); however, there is limited information regarding the optimal number of fractions. To address this issue, Japanese nationwide transplantation registry data were analyzed. Because it was found that TBI was delivered almost exclusively in 4 (n = 1215, 30%) or 6 fractions (n = 2697, 67%), we focused on comparing 4- versus 6-fraction TBI. Compared to 6-fraction TBI, the 4-fraction version was associated with reduced risk of overall mortality (P = .002) and relapse (P = .018), while there was no difference in the risk of nonrelapse mortality (P = .422). The 4-fraction version did not aggravate acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), interstitial pneumonia, or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome of the liver. Chronic GVHD developed more frequently with the use of 4-fraction TBI, although the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was similar. Subgroup analyses revealed that the 4-fraction version provided benefits for patients in non-complete remission (non-CR) but not for those in CR at transplantation. These findings suggest the advantage of 4-fraction over 6-fraction TBI for patients with AML undergoing allogeneic HCT in non-CR.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of 286 CBF-AML patients with intermediate- and adverse-risk genetics in first complete remission following consolidation with chemotherapy (n = 122), auto-HSCT (n = 27), or allo-HSCT (n = 137) between January 2009 and December 2018 at our center.

In the allo-HSCT group, minimal residual disease (MRD) at the second and third months after allo-HSCT could predict relapse in t(8;21) patients (2 months: PCIR = .002; 3 months: PCIR < .001) but not in inv(16) patients. Moreover, positive MRD after 2 courses of consolidation chemotherapy before allo-HSCT was an independent risk factor for survival in CBF-AML patients with intermediate- and adverse-risk genetics, whereas haploidentical donor (haplo-) HSCT could overcome the adverse prognosis (5-year OS, 87%; 5-year PFS, 81%; 5-year CIR, 7%).

In the multivariate analysis, TBI was associated with lower NRM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.86; P = .01), better LFS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98; P =.04), and increased risk for grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.34; P = .02) compared with CT-based MAC. The type of conditioning regimen did not impact RI, chronic GVHD, OS, or GVHD-free, relapse-free survival after adjusting for transplantation-related variables. TBI-based MAC was associated with lower NRM and better LFS compared with CT-based MAC in patients with ALL after haplo-HCT/PTCy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Dec 11.,"Novel high-risk groups have recently been identified in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), including Philadelphia-like, therapy-related, and measurable residual disease after induction therapy. Furthermore, modern targeted therapies have recently been incorporated into ALL management; rituximab for CD20-positive and blinatumomab for measurable residual disease after induction therapy or relapsed or refractory disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is recommended as consolidation therapy for high-risk ALL; however, its relative benefit for these high-risk groups and after novel therapies is unclear. We performed an analysis of posttransplantation outcomes in a cohort of 261 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HCT for ALL at the 3-site Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (January 1, 2008-December 31, 2018). With a median (range) follow-up of 22.4 months (0.5-135.0), the 100-day and 5-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality rates were 6.5% and 26.7%, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and death were 22.6% and 46.2%, respectively. The 1-year estimate of the composite endpoint of graft-versus-host disease/relapse-free survival was 39.3%. We observed no associations of novel high-risk groups or modern targeted therapies with overall survival, nonrelapse mortality, or relapse in multivariable analysis. An increased risk of relapse was observed with T-ALL (hazard ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.09; P = .02) and hypodiploidy/near-triploidy (hazard ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-7.62; P = .04). Our analysis suggests that novel high-risk groups derive a similar benefit from allo-HCT as traditional high-risk adult ALL and that novel targeted therapies do not seem to independently predict for posttransplantation outcomes. It also calls for further exploration of maintenance strategies after Allo-HCT to prevent relapse in high-risk subgroups.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Dec 10.,"BACKGROUND: Adaptive or memory natural killer (NK) cells with epigenetic imprints similar to memory T cells have been shown to develop in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with upregulation of activating receptor NKG2C. These cells have been shown to possess strong anti-tumour efficacy both in-vitro as well as in-vivo. OBJECTIVES: To determine if reconstitution of adaptive NK cells (CD56(dim)NKG2C(+)NKG2A(-)) in patients with advanced leukemia undergoing haploidentical HCT had any impact on disease progression (DP). STUDY DESIGN: The study cohort comprised of 60 patients with advanced acute leukemia, aged 2-65 years, receiving myeloablative PTCy based haploidentical transplantation from CMV seropositive donors, followed by CTLA4Ig-primed donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). They were evaluated for the kinetics of reconstitution of adaptive NK cells, both phenotypic and functional, at days +30,+60, +90 and at regular intervals, to 3 years of follow-up, in relation to DP. Reconstitution of adaptive NK cells was compared with a retrospective cohort of patients in the same protocol receiving DLI without CTLA4Ig. RESULTS: Non-relapse mortality, acute and chronic GVHD were 5.1%, 10.3% and 14.5%. DP was 17.5% at a median follow-up of 28 months. Adaptive NK cells were significantly higher in patients without DP at days+30, +60 and +90 (p = 0.0001), irrespective of CMV reactivation and remained elevated until 36 months post-HCT. These cells maintained their functional competence as measured by robust interferon-gamma production with higher expressions of KIR, NKG2D and CD57, without any increase in PD1 expression. Grafts from donors with higher adaptive NK cells were associated with a lower risk of DP (p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, adaptive NK cell recovery at day +90 had the most favorable impact on DP (HR-0.7). Tregs reconstituted briskly along with the adaptive NK cells and were sustained as well, without compromising the GVL effect. Comparison with a retrospective cohort receiving the same protocol with DLI without CTLA4Ig, showed a superior reconstitution of adaptive NK cells in those receiving CTLA4Ig-DLI (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that myeloablative transplantation from CMV seropositive haploidentical donors augmented with CTLA4Ig-primed DLI might favor early and sustained expansion of functionally competent adaptive NK cells irrespective of CMV reactivation, with a favorable outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

This article reports on the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) Be The Match Registry and its coordinating the provision of unrelated donor (URD) products to domestic and international TCs during the initial 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March through May 2020). Specifically, NMDP data are presented for disease indications for transplant, URD search volumes and availability, graft requests and processing, courier utilization and performance, and conversion rates from formal donor search and workup to graft collection and shipment. Data following the onset of COVID-19 are compared to the immediate 3 months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019 through February 2020) and the same quarter 1 year prior to COVID-19 (March through May 2019). During the initial onset of COVID-19 and compared to 1 year prior, TCs requested and the NMDP performed less donor searches. More multiple URD and direct to workup requests were processed by the NMDP, which likely reflected reductions in donor availability. Yet TCs continued to perform allogeneic transplants for acute disease indications like acute leukemia and myelodysplasia, using more cryopreserved grafts than before COVID-19. In comparison to prepandemic patient cycle conversion rates and durations, the NMDP was able to convert patient cycles at nearly the same or higher rates and in similar or shorter periods of time. Last, despite significant challenges caused by the pandemic, including interruptions in domestic courier services and travel restrictions, graft products were delivered to and received by TCs in similar periods of time than before COVID-19. Taken together, these data show that NMDP service line operations continued to function effectively during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring requests for and delivery of URD products to domestic and international allogeneic HCT recipients.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Polymorphisms in the XPC gene may alter DNA repair leading to genetic instability and oncogenesis. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between the XPC Ala499Val (rs2228000 C>T) and Lys939Gln (rs2228001 A>C) non-synonymous polymorphisms and susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) pathogenesis, disease progression and the response to targeted therapeutic regimen, imatinib mesylate. METHODS: This case-control study included 212 cases and 212 controls, and the genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. RESULTS: Our results showed significant association of variant CT (odds ratio = 1.92, 95% confidence interval = 1.21-3.06, p = 0.003) and TT (odds ratio = 2.84, 95% confidence interval = 1.22-6.71, p = 0.007) genotypes in patients with the XPC Ala499Val polymorphism and CML risk. In addition, these genotypes were associated with CML progression to advanced phases (p = 0.006), splenomegaly (p = 0.017) and abnormal lactate dehydrogenase levels (p = 0.03). XPC Lys939Gln was found to correlate with a poor response to therapy, showing borderline significant association with minor cytogenetic response (p = 0.08) and a poor molecular response (p = 0.06). Significant association of the Ala499Val and Lys939Gln polymorphisms with prognosis was observed (Hasford high risk, p = 0.031 and p = 0.019, respectively). Haplotype analysis showed a strong correlation of variant TC haplotype with poor therapy responses (minor cytogenetic response, p = 0.019; poor molecular response, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results suggest that XPC Ala499Val is a high-penetrance CML susceptibility polymorphism. Both polymorphisms studied are considered as genetic markers with respect to assessing disease progression, therapy response and prognosis in CML patients.","['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9568-450X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3633-3942', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0222-7308', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1483-2927', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5442-3867']",20210428,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Imatinib therapy', '*XPC', '*XPC haplotypes', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*gene polymorphisms', '*prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to identify if HMAs have therapeutic advantages compared with conventional care regimens (CCR) or placebo in elderly AML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November July 15, 2020. Randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy and adverse events associated with HMAs, CCR, or placebo were searched. RevMan 5.3 software was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Seven trials with a total of 1966 participants were included. Meta-analyses showed that the overall survival of HMAs was better than that of CCR [HR=0.76, 95% CI (0.69-0.85), (p<0.01)], and the complete remission rate of elderly AML patients was increased by HMAs compared with CCR [RR=1.46, 95%CI (1.08-1.99), p=0.01)]. HMA treatment showed higher incidence of neutropenia [RR=1.30 (95%CI 1.07-1.59, p=0.008)], thrombocytopenia [RR=1.14 (95%CI 1.01-1.59, p=0.04)], and pneumonia [RR=1.37 (95%CI 1.06-1.76, p=0.02)] compared with CCR. CONCLUSIONS: Although HMAs cause a higher incidence of adverse events such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia, demethylation drugs are well-tolerated and effective for treating AML in the elderly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These bacteria rarely cause infections, but when it occurs, it spreads quickly and has a high mortality. Because diseases are infrequent, the diagnosis is often delayed, and it takes time for suitable treatment to be initiated, leading to increased mortality due to the rapid progression of the disease. After the death of a cougar, serologically positive for feline leukemia virus, at the Center for Medicine and Research on Wild Animals of the Federal University of Mato Grosso, an autopsy was carried out, and fragments of its organs were sent for bacterial culture. Significant lesions were found, mainly in the liver and lungs, and upon bacterial isolation, violet-colored colonies were obtained from all of the referred organs, suggestive of C. violaceum, which was later confirmed by 16S DNA sequencing. The objective of this study was to report a case of death associated primarily with disseminated infection caused by C. violaceum in a FeLV-positive wild cougar in July 2018; no other occurrence in this species has yet been described.",['(c) 2021.

Using data from the National Registry of Childhood Cancers over 1990-2014 in mainland France, we investigated the seasonal variations in childhood AL taken together, and lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid (AML) leukaemia separately. METHODS: Assuming constant variations over 1990-2014, we used a Poisson regression model to evaluate variations in standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) by month of birth or diagnosis. A scan method for temporal cluster detection was used to identify windows of several consecutive months with high or low SIR. The yearly reproducibility of the observed monthly variations was then evaluated. RESULTS: We included 11,528 AL, of which 9493 ALL and 1,843 AML. No seasonal variation was detected for ALL. With a clear seasonal pattern, differences in AML incidence rates were evidenced between January-April and May-December birth periods (SIR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94 and SIR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, respectively). AML incidence variations by month of diagnosis were less clear-cut. CONCLUSION: Based on a large number of cases from a high-quality registry, we did not evidence any seasonality in ALL incidence rates but evidenced seasonal variations in AML incidence rates by month of birth.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7267-1589'],20210407,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer registry', 'Childhood leukaemia', 'Seasonality', 'Standardized incidence rate']",['00089810/Fondation de France'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the miR-93-5p targeted pathogenic markers could be useful for AML diagnosis and potential therapy. We collected 751 miR-93-5p targeted and AML-related genes by integrating the results of multiple databases and then used the expression profile of TCGA-LAML to construct a coexpression function network of AML WGCNA. Based on the clinical phenotype and module trait relationship, we identified two modules (brown and yellow) as interesting dysfunction modules, which have a significant association with cytogenetics risk and FAB classification systems. GO enrichment and KEGG analysis showed that these modules are mainly involved with cancer-associated pathways, including MAPK signal pathway, p53 signal pathway, JAK-STAT signal pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, both associated with the occurrence of AML. Besides, using the STRING database, we discovered the top 10 hub genes in each module, including MAPK1, ACTB, RAC1, GRB2, MDM2, ACTR2, IGF1R, CDKN1A, YWHAZ, and YWHAB in the brown module and VEGFA, FGF2, CCND1, FOXO3, IGFBP3, GSF1, IGF2, SLC2A4, PDGFBM, and PIK3R2 in the yellow module. The prognosis analysis result showed that six key pathogens have significantly affected the overall survival and prognosis in AML. Interestingly, VEGF with the most significant regulatory relationship in the yellow modules significantly positively correlated with the clinical phenotype of AML.

The Path Consistency (PC) algorithm is one of the popular methods to infer the structure of GRNs. However, this group of methods still has limitations and there is a potential for improvements in this field. For example, the PC-based algorithms are still sensitive to the ordering of nodes i.e. different node orders results in different network structures. The second is that the networks inferred by these methods are highly dependent on the threshold used for independence testing. Also, it is still a challenge to select the set of conditional genes in an optimal way, which affects the performance and computation complexity of the PC-based algorithm. We introduce a novel algorithm, namely Order Independent PC-based algorithm using Quantile value (OIPCQ), which improves the accuracy of the learning process of GRNs and solves the order dependency issue. The quantile-based thresholds are considered for different orders of CMI tests. For conditional gene selection, we consider the paths between genes with length equal or greater than 2 while other well-known PC-based methods only consider the paths of length 2. We applied OIPCQ on the various networks of the DREAM3 and DREAM4 in silico challenges. As a real-world case study, we used OIPCQ to reconstruct SOS DNA network obtained from Escherichia coli and GRN for acute myeloid leukemia based on the RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show that OIPCQ produces the same network structure for all the permutations of the genes and improves the resulted GRN through accurately quantifying the causal regulation strength in comparison with other well-known PC-based methods. According to the GRN constructed by OIPCQ, for acute myeloid leukemia, two regulators BCLAF1 and NRSF reported previously are significantly important. However, the highest degree nodes in this GRN are ZBTB7A and PU1 which play a significant role in cancer, especially in leukemia.

The aim of the study was to describe the spectrum of spontaneous neoplastic lesions found in slaughtered pigs and to compare the reported tumor cases with previous published data. Lymphoid neoplasms were characterized and classified using the WHO classification adapted for animals. RESULTS: The most reported neoplasm during this period was lymphoma (28). Within lymphomas, the B-cell type was the most common, being the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (15/28) the most represented subtype. Other submitted non-lymphoid neoplasms included melanoma (7), nephroblastoma (3), mast cell tumor (2), liposarcoma (2), osteochondromatosis (2), papillary cystadenocarcinoma (1), peripheral nerve sheath tumor (1), lymphoid leukemia (1), fibropapilloma (1), hemangiosarcoma (1), hepatoma (1), histiocytic sarcoma (1), pheochromocytoma (1) and osteosarcoma (1).

Most cases occur in children under 2 years-old, presenting a mature B-cell phenotype that uniformly expresses cytoplasmic and surface IgM with lambda light chain restriction, with heterogeneous co-expression of immaturity antigens. Patients do not have MYC rearrangements and all show KMT2A abnormalities, with 76% presenting t(9;11)(p21;q23)/MLLT3-KMT2A. These patients have an unfavorable clinical outcome and a 48% relapse rate.

Subspecies was not reported in all cases, but those identified included Masai (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi), Rothschild (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi), and reticulated subspecies (Giraffe camelopardalis reticulata). Thirteen animals died natural deaths, 15 were euthanized, and 2 were alive at the time of this article. A total of 38 tumors were reported and classified as 18 different diagnoses, including leiomyoma (7), adenoma (4), luteoma (4), lymphoma (4), pheochromocytoma (3), squamous cell carcinoma (3), adenocarcinoma (2), ameloblastic fibroma (1), carcinomatosis of undetermined cell lineage (1), cavernous hemangioma (1), cystic granulosa cell tumor (1), dysgerminoma (1), fibrosarcoma (1), leukemia (1), lipoma (1), pituitary nerve sheath tumor (1), rhabdomyosarcoma (1), and teratoma (1). Multiple concurrent neoplastic lesions were documented in six cases. Mesenchymal tumors (18) were the majority of neoplasms. The most prevalent location, regardless of tumor type, was the female reproductive tract (14). Twenty-four neoplastic lesions were incidental findings at necropsy, whereas eight neoplasms were considered to be the primary cause of death.

The rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 28 days after KTE-X19 infusion was the primary end point. KTE-X19 was manufactured for 54 enrolled patients and administered to 45 (median age, 46 years; range, 18-77 years). No DLTs occurred in the DLT-evaluable cohort. Grade >/=3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs) occurred in 31% and 38% of patients, respectively. To optimize the risk-benefit ratio, revised adverse event (AE) management for CRS and NEs (earlier steroid use for NEs and tocilizumab only for CRS) was evaluated at 1 x 106 cells per kg KTE-X19. In the 9 patients treated under revised AE management, 33% had grade 3 CRS and 11% had grade 3 NEs, with no grade 4 or 5 NEs. The overall complete remission rate correlated with CAR T-cell expansion and was 83% in patients treated with 1 x 106 cells per kg and 69% in all patients.

Epub 2021 Apr 7.,"Background: Jordan faces complex health care challenges due to refugee influx and an aging population. Palliative care planning and delivery require data to ensure services respond to changing population needs. Objectives: To determine the trend in mortality and place of death in Jordan. Design: Population-based study. Setting/Subjects: Death registry data of adult decedents (n = 143,215), 2005-2016. Measurements: Descriptive statistics examined change in demographic and place of death (categorized as hospital and nonhospital). Binomial logistic regression compared the association between hospital deaths and demographic characteristics in 2008-2010, 2011-2013, and 2014-2016, with 2005-2007. Results: The annual number of deaths increased from 6792 in 2005 to 17,018 in 2016 (151% increase). Hospital was the most common place of death (93.7% of all deaths) in Jordan, and percentage of hospital deaths increased for Jordanian (82.6%-98.8%) and non-Jordanian decedents (88.1%-98.7%). There was an increased likelihood of hospital death among Jordanian decedents who died from nonischemic heart disease (odd ratio [OR]: 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.13, p < 0.001), atherosclerosis (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.08-1.13, p < 0.001), renal failure (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, p < 0.001), hemorrhagic fevers (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.13, p < 0.001), and injury (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.33, p < 0.001) in the period 2014-2016, compared with 2005-2007. There were similar increases in the likelihood of hospital death among non-Jordanians in 2014-2016 for the following conditions: malignant neoplasms (except leukemia), nonischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, injury, and HIV, compared with 2005-2007. Conclusions: Country-level palliative care development must respond to both internal (aging) and external (refugee influx) population trends. Universal Health Coverage requires palliative care to move beyond cancer and meet population-specific needs. Community-based services should be prioritized and expanded to care for the patients with nonischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, renal failure, hemorrhagic fevers, and injury.",,,20210407,,['NOTNLM'],"['cause of death', 'epidemiology', 'mortality', 'palliative care', 'place of death', 'refugees']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 7.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown impressive results in chemorefractory B cell malignancies, raising the possibilities of using this immunotherapeutic modality for other devastating hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is an aggressive hematologic malignancy which, like B cell malignancies, poses several challenges for clinical translation of successful immunotherapy. The antigenic heterogeneity of AML results in a list of potential targets that CAR-T cells could be directed towards, each with advantages and disadvantages. In this review, we provide an up-to-date report of outcomes and adverse effects from published and presented clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy for AML and provide the preclinical rationale underlying these studies and antigen selection. Comparison across trials is difficult, yet themes emerge with respect to appropriate antigen selection and association of adverse effects with outcomes. We highlight currently active clinical trials and the potential improvements and caveats with these novel approaches. Key hurdles to the successful introduction of CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of AML include the effect of antigenic heterogeneity and trade-offs between therapy specificity and sensitivity; on-target off-tumor toxicities; the AML tumor microenvironment; and practical considerations for future trials that should be addressed to enable successful CAR-T cell therapy for AML.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4432-2215'],20210407,,,,['Project Agreement No. 9/Bristol-Myers Squibb'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 7.,"PURPOSE: To review the impact of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on fertility in men and women, embryo development, and early pregnancy, and discuss considerations for fertility preservation in patients taking TKIs. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database was performed through February 2021 to evaluate the current literature on imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib as it relates to fertility and reproduction. Published case series were analyzed for pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: TKIs adversely affect oocyte and sperm maturation, gonadal function, and overall fertility potential in a self-limited manner. There are insufficient studies regarding long-term consequences on fertility after discontinuation of TKIs. A total of 396 women and 236 men were on a first- or second-generation TKI at the time of conception. Of the women with detailed pregnancy and delivery outcomes (n = 361), 51% (186/361) resulted in a term birth of a normal infant, 4.3% (16/361) of pregnancies had a pregnancy complication, and 5% (20/361) of pregnancies resulted in the live birth of an infant with a congenital anomaly. About 22% of pregnant women (87/396) elected to undergo a termination of pregnancy, while 16% (63/396) of pregnancies ended in a spontaneous abortion. In contrast, of the 236 men, 87% conceived pregnancies which resulted in term deliveries of normal infants. Elective terminations, miscarriage rate, pregnancy complication rate, and incidence of a congenital malformation were all less than those seen in females (4%, 3%, 2%, and 2.5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Women should be advised to avoid conception while taking a TKI. Women on TKIs who are considering pregnancy should be encouraged to plan the pregnancy to minimize inadvertent first trimester exposure. In women who conceive while taking TKIs, the serious risk of relapse due to discontinuation of TKI should be balanced against the potential risks to the fetus. The risk of teratogenicity to a fathered pregnancy with TKI use is considerably lower. Fertility preservation for a woman taking a TKI can be considered to plan a pregnancy with a minimal TKI-free period. With careful monitoring, providers may consider a TKI washout period followed by controlled ovarian stimulation to cryopreserve oocytes or embryos, with a plan to resume TKIs until ready to conceive or to transfer an embryo to achieve pregnancy quickly. Fertility preservation is also indicated if a patient on TKI is requiring a gonadotoxic therapy or reproductive surgery impacting fertility.","['(c) 2021.

Adolescents and young adults (AYA) have EFS (30% to 45%). Young AYA ALL patients treated with pediatric chemotherapy protocols such as Dana Farber Consortium Protocol (DFCP) experience a better prognosis. This study aimed to assess the efficacy [EFS and overall survival (OS)] and the toxicity of DFCP in the treatment of Egyptian AYA with newly diagnosed ALL. A retrospective study was performed on 41 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (15 and 39 years) who were treated with DFCP. EFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (92.68%) achieved complete remission (CR). Eleven patients (26.83%) relapsed. Ten (24.39%) patients died. One, two, and three years of EFS were 75.61%, 72.91%, and 67.51% respectively. One, two, and three years OS were 85.3%, 77.26%, and 74.39% respectively. Neutropenia was the most common adverse event observed in 100% of patients.

Epub 2021 Apr 20.,"BACKGROUND: Current literature has demonstrated the utility of the MRSA nasal screen as a de-escalation tool to decrease unnecessary anti-MRSA antibiotic therapy. However, data on the applicability of this test in patients with hematologic malignancy is lacking. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with or without a history of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), with pneumonia and MRSA nasal screening with respiratory cultures obtained. The primary outcome was to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of the MRSA nasal screen for MRSA pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) of the MRSA nasal screen and prevalence of MRSA pneumonia. RESULTS: Of 98 patients with AML and pneumonia, the prevalence of MRSA pneumonia was 4.1% with confirmed positive MRSA respiratory cultures observed in 4 patient cases. In patients with confirmed MRSA pneumonia, 3 had positive MRSA nasal screens while 1 had a false negative result, possibly due to a long lag time (21 days) between MRSA nasal screen and pneumonia diagnosis. Overall, the MRSA nasal screen demonstrated 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a PPV of 100% and a NPV of 98.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low prevalence, empiric use of anti-MRSA therapy in those AML and HCT patients with pneumonia may not be warranted in clinically stable patients. For patients in whom empiric anti-MRSA antibiotics are initiated, nasal screening for MRSA may be utilized to de-escalate anti-MRSA antibiotics in patients with AML with or without HCT.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5694-7189', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2034-8528', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8731-105X']",20210420,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'hematopoietic cell transplant', 'methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'pneumonia', 'predictive values', 'prevalence', 'sensitivity', 'specificity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"OBJECTIVE: Steroids play an essential role in treating pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The downside is that these drugs can cause severe side effects, such as adverse psychological reactions (APRs) and sleep problems, which can compromise health-related quality of life. This study aimed to systematically review literature to identify risk factors for steroid-induced APRs and sleep problems in children with ALL. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in six databases. Titles/abstracts were independently screened by two researchers. Data from each included study was extracted based on predefined items. Risk of bias and level of evidence were assessed, using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles were included. APR measurement ranged from validated questionnaires to retrospective record retrieval, sleep measurement included questionnaires or actigraphy. Overall, quality of evidence was very low. Current evidence suggests that type/dose of steroid is not related to APRs, but might be to sleep problems. Younger patients seem at risk for behavior problems and older patients for sleep problems. No studies describing parental stress or medical history were identified. Genetic susceptibility associations remain to be replicated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current evidence, conclusions about risk factors for steroid-induced adverse psychological reactions or sleep problems in children with ALL should be drawn cautiously, since quality of evidence is low and methods of measurement are largely heterogeneous. A standardized registration of steroid-induced APRs/sleep problems and risk factors is warranted for further studies in children with ALL.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

TP-53 controls apoptosis upstream of where BCL-2 and its prosurvival relatives, such as MCL-1, act. Therefore, targeting these prosurvival proteins could trigger apoptosis across diverse blood cancers, irrespective of TP53 mutation status. Indeed, targeting BCL-2 has produced clinically relevant responses in blood cancers with aberrant TP-53. However, in our study, TP53-mutated or -deficient myeloid and lymphoid leukemias outcompeted isogenic controls with intact TP-53, unless sufficient concentrations of BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-2 or MCL-1 were applied. Strikingly, tumor cells with TP-53 dysfunction escaped and thrived over time if inhibition of BCL-2 or MCL-1 was sublethal, in part because of an increased threshold for BAX/BAK activation in these cells. Our study revealed the key role of TP-53 in shaping long-term responses to BH3-mimetic drugs and reconciled the disparate pattern of initial clinical response to venetoclax, followed by subsequent treatment failure among patients with TP53-mutant chronic lymphocytic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. In contrast to BH3-mimetics targeting just BCL-2 or MCL-1 at doses that are individually sublethal, a combined BH3-mimetic approach targeting both prosurvival proteins enhanced lethality and durably suppressed the leukemia burden, regardless of TP53 mutation status. Our findings highlight the importance of using sufficiently lethal treatment strategies to maximize outcomes of patients with TP53-mutant disease.

It is used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in combination with chemotherapy. We describe here two GO-treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases: both patients suffered from a toxic syndrome, which manifested as impaired hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenging and accumulation of hemolysis-related products. Our observations and earlier reports indicated that the reaction was caused by GO-targeted destruction of CD33 + CD163+ monocytes/macrophages, which are responsible for the clearance of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. The rise of plasma lactate dehydrogenase was an early sign of the reaction, and both patients had high levels of free plasma hemoglobin, but plasma haptoglobin and bilirubin levels were paradoxically normal. Symptoms included septic fever and abnormalities in cardiac tests and in the case of the first patient, severe neurological symptoms which required intensive care unit admittance. Therapeutic plasma exchanges supported the patients until the recovery of normal hematopoiesis. The symptoms may be easily confounded with infectious complications-related organ damage.

Like many other age-dependent human diseases, laboratory animal research of CML uses young mice that do not factor in the influence of aging. To understand how aging may impact animal modeling of human age-dependent diseases, we established the first aging mouse model of human CML in BALB/c mice in the advanced age defined by 75% survival. This model was developed by noncytotoxic depletion of bone marrow lineage-positive cells followed by BCR-ABL retroviral transduction and transplantation. CML developed in aging mice shared many similarities to that in young mice, but had increased incidence of anemia that is often seen in human CML. Importantly, we showed that aging of both donor hematopoietic stem cells and recipient bone marrow niche impacted BCR-ABL mediated leukemogenesis and leukemia spectrum. Optimal CML induction relied on age-matching for donors and recipients, and cross-transplantation between young and old mice produced a mixture of different leukemia. Therefore, our model provides initial evidence of the feasibility and merit of CML modeling in aging mice and offers a new tool for future studies of CML stem cell drug resistance and therapeutic intervention in which aging would be taken into consideration as an influencing factor.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6913-5729'],20210406,PMC8087641,,,"['UH3 CA213385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH2 CA213385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS1686871'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated that PC differentiation can be modeled in vitro using complex multistep culture systems reproducing sequential differentiation process occurring in vivo. Here we present a comprehensive, temporal program of gene expression data encompassing human PC differentiation (PCD) using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our results reveal 6374 differentially expressed genes classified into four temporal gene expression patterns. A stringent pathway enrichment analysis of these gene clusters highlights known pathways but also pathways largely unknown in PCD, including the heme biosynthesis and the glutathione conjugation pathways. Additionally, our analysis revealed numerous novel transcriptional networks with significant stage-specific overexpression and potential importance in PCD, including BATF2, BHLHA15/MIST1, EZH2, WHSC1/MMSET, and BLM. We have experimentally validated a potent role for BLM in regulating cell survival and proliferation during human PCD. Taken together, this RNA-seq analysis of PCD temporal stages helped identify coexpressed gene modules with associated up/downregulated transcription regulator genes that could represent major regulatory nodes for human PC maturation. These data constitute a unique resource of human PCD gene expression programs in support of future studies for understanding the underlying mechanisms that control PCD.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5717-3207'],20210406,PMC8102200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"Although chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy produces a high complete remission rate among patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, relapse remains an urgent issue. It is uncertain whether consolidative haploidentical-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is suitable for achieving sustainable remission. Therefore, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging CAR-T therapy to haplo-HSCT. Fifty-two patients with relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent haplo-HSCT after CAR-T therapy were analyzed. The median time from CAR-T therapy to haplo-HSCT was 61 days. After a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the 1-year probabilities of event-free survival, overall survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse were 80.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 69.0-90.9), 92.3% (95% CI, 85.0-99.5), and 14.1% (95% CI, 10.7-17.4), respectively, while the corresponding 2-year probabilities were 76.0% (95% CI, 64.2-87.7), 84.3% (95% CI, 74.3-94.3), and 19.7% (95% CI, 15.3-24.0), respectively. No increased risk of 2-year cumulative incidence of graft-versus-host disease, treatment-related mortality, or infection was observed. A pre-HSCT measurable residual disease-positive status was an independent factor associated with poor overall survival (hazard radio: 4.201, 95% CI: 1.034-17.063; P = 0.045). Haplo-HSCT may be a safe and effective treatment strategy to improve event-free survival and overall survival after CAR-T therapy.","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"To characterize glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein-deficient (GPI[-]) and HLA-class I allele-lacking (HLA[-]) hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) in acquired aplastic anemia (AA), we studied the peripheral blood (PB) of 56 AA patients in remission who possessed both (n = 13, Group A) or either GPI(-) (n = 34, Group B) and HLA(-) (n = 9, Group C) cell populations. Seventy-seven percent (10/13) of Group A had HLA(-) cells in all lineages of PB cells, including platelets, while only 23% (3/13) had GPI(-) cells in all lineages, and the median percentage of HLA(-) granulocytes in the total granulocytes (21.2%) was significantly higher than that of GPI(-) granulocytes (0.28%, P < 0.05). The greater lineage diversity in HLA(-) cells than in GPI(-) cells was also seen when Group B and Group C were compared. Longitudinal studies of seven patients in Group A showed a gradual decrease in the percentage of HLA(-) granulocytes, with a reciprocal increase in the GPI(-) granulocytes in four patients responding to cyclosporine (CsA) and an increase in the HLA(-) granulocytes with a stable or declining GPI(-) granulocytes in three patients in sustained remission off CsA therapy. These findings suggest that HLA(-) HSPCs differ from GPI(-) HSPCs in the hierarchical stage and sensitivity to immune attack in AA.","['(c) 2021.

We hypothesized that combining decitabine with a standard non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT), might decrease the relapse incidence. We conducted a multicenter prospective phase II study (NCT02252107) with 10-day decitabine (20 mg/m(2)/day) integrated in a standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen (3 days fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) with 2 Gray total body irradiation (TBI)). Patients with AML >/= 18 years in 1st (in)complete remission (CR/CRi) with a poor or very poor risk profile, as defined by the HOVON-132 protocol, were eligible. Results: Forty-six patients (median age 60; range 23-74) were included. Median follow up time was 44 months (range 31-65 months). The cumulative 1-year incidence of relapse and NRM were respectively 23% and 11%. Incidence of grade III-IV acute graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) and severe chronic GVHD were 13% and 20%, respectively. One-year OS was 70%. Application of ELN 2017 risk classification to the study cohort revealed a cumulative one-year relapse rate of respectively 31% and 13% for the adverse and intermediate risk patients. To conclude, the 10-day DEC/FLU/TBI conditioning regimen prior to allo HCT in poor risk AML patients is effective and feasible.","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"Safety and efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) consolidation after blinatumomab is largely undetermined. To address this issue, we assembled multi-center data of relapsed refractory (RR) acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients who received alloHCT after blinatumomab. From December 2014 to May 2019, 223 patients who received blinatumomab for RR ALL outside clinical trials were identified. Among them, 106 (47%) patients transplanted post blinatumomab were evaluated for response and toxicity. Ninety-two (87%) patients received alloHCT after achieving CR, while remaining received subsequent salvage prior to undergoing alloHCT. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years post alloHCT was 48% (95% CI: 36-59%) and 58% (95% CI: 45-69%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of GIII-IV aGVHD at 3 months was 9.9% (95% CI: 5.0-16.6%). Similarly, cumulative incidence of moderate to severe cGVHD at 2 years was 34.4% (95% CI: 23.7-45.3%). The overall survival at 2 years was not significantly different in patient who achieved CR with MRD negative (68.4% [95% CI: 28.5-89.1%]) compared to CR with MRD positive (63.4% [95% CI: 47.8-75.4%]) prior to alloHCT (p = 0.8). Our real-world analysis suggests that alloHCT is feasible and effective post blinatumomab in patients with RR ALL.","['(c) 2021.

We hypothesized that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)-based post-remission therapy would improve outcomes of this entity. We examined the frequency and long-term outcomes of adults with Ph-like ALL, particularly focusing on allo-HCT outcomes for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL. Ph-like ALL was determined by anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing. Of the 344 patients, 57 (16.6%) had Ph-like ALL, 197 (57.3%) had Ph-positive ALL, and 90 (26.1%) had B-other ALL. To further evaluate the prognosis of Ph-like ALL, outcome analyses were restricted to 147 patients, excluding Ph-positive ALL. The actual allo-HCT rates in complete remission were 87.7% for Ph-like ALL, 71.4% for B-other standard-risk ALL, and 70.4% for B-other poor-risk ALL. Patients with Ph-like ALL had a higher 5-year overall survival (60.6% vs 27.1%; P = 0.008) than B-other poor-risk ALL subgroup, while no difference was observed compared with B-other standard-risk ALL subgroup. Similar results were noted in a separate analysis for patients receiving allo-HCT in complete remission. In multivariate analyses, B-other poor-risk ALL was associated with poorer outcomes. Our data showed that allo-HCT-based post-remission therapy may have contributed to non-inferior outcomes of adult Ph-like ALL.","['(c) 2021.

We report the long-term health status of 145 HRNB survivors, alive and disease-free 5 years post HDC. Median follow-up was 15 years (range = 5-34). Six patients experienced late relapses, 11 developed second malignant neoplasms (SMNs), and 9 died. Event-free and overall survivals 20 years post HDC were 82% (95% CI = 70%-90%) and 89% (78%-95%), respectively. Compared with the French general population, the standardized mortality ratio was 19 (95% CI = 8.7-36.1; p < 0.0001) and the absolute excess risk was 37.6 (19.2-73.5). Late effects were observed in 135/145 patients (median = 3 events/patient); 103 had at least one severe event. SMNs arose at a median of 20 years post HDC and included carcinoma (n = 5), sarcoma (2), acute myeloid leukemia (2), melanoma (1), and malignant glioma (1). Non-oncologic health events included dental maldevelopment (60%), severe hearing loss (20% cumulative probability at 15 years), hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia (14%), thyroid (11%), cardiac (8%), and renal (7%) diseases and growth retardation (height-for-age z-score </= -2 for 21%). Gonadal insufficiency was near-universal after busulfan (40/43 females, 33/35 males). Severe late effects are frequent and progressive in HRNB survivors needing systematic very long-term follow-up.","['(c) 2021.

FBW7 is widely mutated and FBW7 protein levels are commonly downregulated in cancer. Here, using an shRNA library screen, we identify the HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIP12 as a negative regulator of FBW7 stability. We find that SCF(FBW7)-mediated ubiquitylation of FBW7 occurs preferentially on K404 and K412, but is not sufficient for its proteasomal degradation, and in addition requires TRIP12-mediated branched K11-linked ubiquitylation. TRIP12 inactivation causes FBW7 protein accumulation and increased proteasomal degradation of the SCF(FBW7) substrate Myeloid Leukemia 1 (MCL1), and sensitizes cancer cells to anti-tubulin chemotherapy. Concomitant FBW7 inactivation rescues the effects of TRIP12 deficiency, confirming FBW7 as an essential mediator of TRIP12 function. This work reveals an unexpected complexity of FBW7 ubiquitylation, and highlights branched ubiquitylation as an important signalling mechanism regulating protein stability.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7062-4677', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0652-6447', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2787-1933', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5416-8592', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1557-1143']",20210406,PMC8024278,,,"['FC001039/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'FC001039/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'FC001039/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although treatment with CAR-T cells has produced remarkable clinical responses with certain subsets of B cell leukemia or lymphoma, many challenges limit the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells in solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Barriers to effective CAR-T cell therapy include severe life-threatening toxicities, modest anti-tumor activity, antigen escape, restricted trafficking, and limited tumor infiltration. In addition, the host and tumor microenvironment interactions with CAR-T cells critically alter CAR-T cell function. Furthermore, a complex workforce is required to develop and implement these treatments. In order to overcome these significant challenges, innovative strategies and approaches to engineer more powerful CAR-T cells with improved anti-tumor activity and decreased toxicity are necessary. In this review, we discuss recent innovations in CAR-T cell engineering to improve clinical efficacy in both hematological malignancy and solid tumors and strategies to overcome limitations of CAR-T cell therapy in both hematological malignancy and solid tumors.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8195-4970', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9323-3625']",20210406,PMC8024391,,,['T32 GM008692/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, MLL5 overexpression increased the responsiveness of APL leukemic cells to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation, via regulation of the epigenetic modifiers SETD7 and LSD1. In silico analysis indicated that APL blasts with MLL5(high) transcript levels were associated with retinoic acid binding and downstream signaling, while MLL5(low) blasts displayed decreased expression of epigenetic modifiers (such as KMT2C, PHF8 and ARID4A). Finally, APL xenograft transplants demonstrated improved engraftment of MLL5-expressing cells and increased myeloid differentiation over time. Concordantly, evaluation of engrafted blasts revealed increased responsiveness of MLL5-expressing cells to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation.

MDSCs are produced from myeloid precursors in emergent states and are increased in several hematologic malignancies. We evaluated the differences in the levels and prognostic significance of MDSCs according to the clinical status of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The percentages and numbers of granulocytic (g)MDSCs and monocytic (m)MDSCs in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirates were determined by five-color flow cytometry (HLA-DR/CD11b/CD15/CD33/CD14). The median BM-gMDSC% and PB-gMDSC% of the CML group were lower than those of the complete hematologic response (CHR) and control groups (P<0.001). In the CHR group, patients with major molecular response (MMR) showed higher median BM-gMDSC% than those without MMR (P=0.039). Conversely, the PB-mMDSC number of the CML group was higher than those of the CHR and control groups (P<0.001). Patients with high PB-gMDSC number exhibited superior survival to those with low PB-gMDSC number (P=0.021), and patients with high PB-mMDSC% showed inferior survival to those with low PB-mMDSC%, but there was no statistical significance (P=0.182). Increased gMDSCs at CHR may reflect non-leukemic granulopoiesis, and a high number of PB-gMDSCs suggests better prognosis in CML.

It is a master regulator for transcription of important genes (e.g., Hox genes) for embryonic development and hematopoiesis. However, it is largely dispensable in matured cells. Dysregulation of MLL1 leads to overexpression of certain Hox genes and eventually leukemia initiation. Chromosome translocations involving MLL1 cause ~ 75% of acute leukemia in infants and 5-10% in children and adults with a poor prognosis. Targeted therapeutics against oncogenic fusion MLL1 (onco-MLL1) are therefore needed. Onco-MLL1 consists of the N-terminal DNA-interacting domains of MLL1 fused with one of > 70 fusion partners, among which transcription cofactors AF4, AF9 and its paralog ENL, and ELL are the most frequent. Wild-type (WT)- and onco-MLL1 involve numerous protein-protein interactions (PPI), which play critical roles in regulating gene expression in normal physiology and leukemia. Moreover, WT-MLL1 has been found to be essential for MLL1-rearranged (MLL1-r) leukemia. Rigorous studies of such PPIs have been performed and much progress has been achieved in understanding their structures, structure-function relationships and the mechanisms for activating gene transcription as well as leukemic transformation. Inhibition of several critical PPIs by peptides, peptidomimetic or small-molecule compounds has been explored as a therapeutic approach for MLL1-r leukemia. This review summarizes the biological functions, biochemistry, structure and inhibition of the critical PPIs involving MLL1 and its fusion partner proteins. In addition, challenges and perspectives of drug discovery targeting these PPIs for the treatment of MLL1-r leukemia are discussed.",,,20210406,PMC8022399,['NOTNLM'],"['*Drug discovery', '*MLL1-rearranged leukemia', '*Mixed lineage leukemia 1', '*Protein inhibition', '*Protein structure', '*Protein-protein interactions']",['W81XWH-18-1-0368/U.S. Department of Defense'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"BACKGROUND: Improvements in cancer survival mean that an increasing number of survivors may live long enough beyond their initial cancer to be diagnosed with additional independent primary cancers. The proportion of newly diagnosed cancers that are second- or higher-order primaries and how this proportion has changed over the past several decades were examined. METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were used to identify incident malignant primaries diagnosed between 1975 and 2017. Using the SEER sequence number, the authors tabulated the proportion of all cancers in each calendar year that were second- or higher-order primaries. The average annual percent change (AAPC) was then calculated to assess how this proportion has changed over time. RESULTS: Analyses included nearly 4.9 million incident cancers diagnosed during 1975-2017. The proportion of all cancers that were second- or higher-order increased steadily from 9.77% during 1975-1984 to 21.03% during 2015-2017, reflecting an AAPC of 2.41% (95% CI, 2.16%-2.65%). In 2015-2017, second- or higher-order cancers were most prevalent among cancers of the bladder (28.79%), followed by lung and bronchus (28.07%), melanoma (27.88%), and leukemia (26.10%). The highest AAPCs over the study period were observed for melanoma (4.05%), leukemia (3.51%), and lung and bronchus (3.36%). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of newly diagnosed cancers that are second- or higher-order has grown rapidly over the past several decades and currently exceeds 20%.

Post induction, both these clonal cytogenetic abnormalities persisted. The documentation of this case will help determine the significance of these cytogenetic abnormalities.

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"BACKGROUND: Dasatinib monotherapy has demonstrated modest clinical activity in chronic myeloid leukemia in lymphoid blastic phase (CML-LBP). The outcome of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has dramatically improved with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: The authors reviewed 85 patients (23 with CML-LBP and 62 with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL) who received hyper-CVAD plus dasatinib. RESULTS: In the CML-LBP cohort, 19 had prior chronic myeloid leukemia as chronic phase (n = 17; 74%), accelerated phase (n = 1; 4%), or myeloid blastic phase (n = 1; 4%); 4 (17%) presented with de novo CML-LBP. The BCR-ABL1 transcript was p210 in 22 patients (96%) and p190 in 1 patient (4%). In the Ph-positive ALL cohort, p210 and p190 transcripts were detected in 13 patients (21%) and 48 patients (77%), respectively. Patients with CML-LBP were less likely to achieve deep molecular remission than patients with Ph-positive ALL: the major molecular response (MMR) rates were 70% and 95%, respectively (P = .007), and the complete molecular response (CMR) rates were 55% and 74%, respectively (P = .16). Survival outcomes were similar for CML-LBP and Ph-positive ALL: the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 59% and 48%, respectively (P = .97). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was associated with a better outcome in CML-LBP (5-year OS rate, 88% vs 57%; P = .04). In Ph-positive ALL, the outcome was driven by deeper molecular remission: the 5-year OS rates were 63% and 25% with CMR and MMR, respectively (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of CML-LBP has improved with hyper-CVAD plus dasatinib therapy with survival comparable to that of Ph-positive ALL. Further improvement may be achieved with the use of novel TKIs and targeted agents.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0407-1565', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4533-5176', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119']",20210406,,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin', 'hydrochloride, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD)', 'lymphoid blastic phase']",['CA016672/University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between August 2018 and September 2019, we recruited adults aged >/=18 years who had childhood leukemia/lymphoma. Blood sampling, body composition measurement by bioelectrical impedance analysis and grip strength test were performed. RESULTS: Among 81 adult survivors (34 men and 47 women) with a median age of 25.0 years, 9 (11%) had sarcopenia and 10 (12%) had obesity, of whom, 3 had metabolic syndrome. Sarcopenia was observed in 7 (21%) of 33 survivors with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and 2 (4%) of 48 survivors without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (P = 0.012). The incidence of obesity was significantly higher in the cranial radiotherapy (P = 0.021) and non-transplanted cases (P = 0.042). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sarcopenia (odds ratio, 6.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-32.0; P = 0.03) and cranial radiotherapy for obesity (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-22.4; P = 0.015) were significantly associated. Hypertension was more prevalent among the obese survivors, and higher transaminase levels were found more in both the sarcopenia and obese survivors than in others. CONCLUSIONS: Young adult survivors of childhood leukemia/lymphoma could be at risk of developing sarcopenia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and obesity after cranial radiotherapy. Further studies are required to assess the body composition of long-term survivors to find detailed risk factors of sarcopenia and metabolic syndrome.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Expression of CD5 is rare in B-ALL. METHODS: We studied the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features of 10 cases of B-ALL with aberrant CD5 expression, and compared with CD5-B-ALL. RESULTS: B-ALL with aberrant CD5 expression is rare and predominantly affects men. Patients with CD5+ B-ALL had shorter median overall survival (21 vs 45 months, P = .0003). Expression of CD5 imposed a challenge in the differential diagnoses between B-ALL and other CD5+ B-cell lymphomas with blastic morphology. Dim CD20 and CD45, lack of surface immunoglobulin, expression of CD34 and TdT, negative immunostain for cyclin D1, and absence of t(11;14)(q13;q32) support a diagnosis of B-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: CD5 expression is rare in B-ALL and associated with poor clinical outcome. CD5+ B-ALL represents a distinct entity that needs to be considered in the differential diagnoses of CD5+ B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

Patients with AML with adverse monosomal karyotypes are known to benefit from HMAs, but not cytarabine, a cytidine analog without HMA activity, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The authors investigated the mechanistic effects of HMAs on gene reactivation in AML in the context of the most common monosomal karyotypes, genetic deletion of chromosome 7q and 5q. They identified genes with tumor-suppressive properties, an endogenous retrovirus cooperatively repressed by DNA hypermethylation, and increased genetic losses on hemizygous chromosomal regions versus normal biallelic regions in AML cell models. Treatment with HMAs preferentially induced expression of these hemizygous genes to levels similar to those of genes in a biallelic state. In addition to CpG hypomethylation, decitabine treatment resulted in histone acetylation and an open chromatin configuration specifically at hemizygous loci. By using primary blood blasts isolated from patients with AML receiving decitabine and AML patient-derived xenograft models established from patients with either monosomal karyotypes or normal cytogenetics, Greve and colleagues both validated their findings in primary patient samples and demonstrated superior antileukemic activity of decitabine compared with chemotherapy with cytarabine. These mechanistic insights into how epigenetic therapy beats adverse genetics in monosomy karyotype AML will open new therapeutic opportunities for a difficult-to-treat patient group.See related article by Greve et al., p. 834.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9750-5088', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2192-1346']",,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2021 Feb 15;81(4):834-846.

CAR-T cell-based therapies are now approved for commercial distribution in different countries. Over the years, several modifications were necessary in the CAR structure to get it to its current results. CAR-T strategies still have plenty of room for improvement in order to improve clinical benefits and to overcome some of the limitations that still impair broader application. One main issue is the dysfunctional acquired phenotype, provoked by tumor inhibitory molecules or even exacerbated signaling by the CAR molecule itself. In this regard, Many research groups focus on discrete incremental modifications in each of the CAR molecule domains of the conventional structure looking for better response. Among these redesign strategies are the modulation of the binding affinity, use of costimulatory molecule ligands, and control of intracellular signaling. This review focuses on the newest reports covering structure changes in the CAR molecule capable of eliciting improved responses by transduced cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This success is in great part due to the chosen target antigen, the lineage marker CD19, that is expressed by leukemia blasts and B lymphocytes, which are not crucial. For solid tumors, the challenge is greater because antigen expression is highly heterogeneous within the tumor and even an efficient CAR-T strategy would not kill all tumor cells. Also, many antigens are shared between solid tumors and healthy cells, causing off-target cell lysis and dangerous collateral damage. New antigen sources are emerging as targets, such as viruses, endogenous viruses, and immune checkpoint molecules. New technologies are in search of the ideal target, with antigen combinations the leading candidates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the function of miR-451 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been fully understood. Herein, we focused on the effect of miR-451 in pediatric AML and its regulatory mechanism. MiR-451 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels were tested in bone marrow of pediatric AML patients and healthy controls, and in AML cells and HS-5 cells by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. HL-60 and THP-1 cells were treated with miR-451 mimics, pcDNA-HMGB1, and corresponding controls. The changes in apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated in miR-451 overexpressed AML cells with MTT and flow cytometry. The interaction between miR-451 and HMGB1 was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. After cells were co-transfected with pcDNA-HMGB1 and pc-DNA-ctrl, we investigated apoptosis and autophagy in miR-451 overexpressed cells perturbed by exogenous HMGB1 through MTT, flow cytometry, and Western blot. miR-451's role in drug sensitivity was further measured. Pediatric AML bone marrow and cell lines presented low expression of miR-451 coupled with high expression of HMGB1. HMGB1 was determined to be a functional target of miR-451. MiR-451 overexpression remarkably enhanced apoptosis and reduced autophagy in both AML cell lines, which was reversed by pcDNA-HMGB1 transfection. Additionally, exogenous miR-451 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of HL-60 cells to the chemotherapy drug As2O3. MiR-451 exerted a tumor suppressive effect in enhancing cell death and reducing autophagy of AML cells by targeting HMGB1. MiR-451 might be considered a candidate target for treating pediatric AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin ligases or E3 ligases are well programmed to regulate molecular interactions that operate at a post-translational level. Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex (or SCF complex) is a multidomain E3 ligase known to mediate the degradation of a wide range of proteins through the proteasomal pathway. The three-dimensional domain architecture of SCF family proteins suggests that it operates through a novel and adaptable ""super-enzymatic"" process that might respond to targeted therapeutic modalities in cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Several F-box containing proteins have been characterized either as tumor suppressors (FBXW8, FBXL3, FBXW8, FBXL3, FBXO1, FBXO4, and FBXO18) or as oncogenes (FBXO5, FBXO9, and SKP2). Besides, F-box members like betaTrcP1 and betaTrcP2, the ones with context-dependent functionality, have also been studied and reported. FBXW7 is a well-studied F-box protein and is a tumor suppressor. FBXW7 regulates the activity of a range of substrates, such as c-Myc, cyclin E, mTOR, c-Jun, NOTCH, myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), AURKA, NOTCH through the well-known ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-mediated degradation pathway. NOTCH signaling is a primitive pathway that plays a crucial role in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. FBXW7 regulates NOTCH protein activity by controlling its half-life, thereby maintaining optimum protein levels in tissue. However, aberrations in the FBXW7 or NOTCH expression levels can lead to poor prognosis and detrimental outcomes in patients. Therefore, the FBXW7-NOTCH axis has been a subject of intense study and research over the years, especially around the interactome's role in driving cancer development and progression. Several studies have reported the effect of FBXW7 and NOTCH mutations on normal tissue behavior. The current review attempts to critically analyze these mutations prognostic value in a wide range of tumors. Furthermore, the review summarizes the recent findings pertaining to the FBXW7 and NOTCH interactome and its involvement in phosphorylation-related events, cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. CONCLUSION: The review concludes by positioning FBXW7 as an effective diagnostic marker in tumors and by listing out recent advancements made in cancer therapeutics in identifying protocols targeting the FBXW7-NOTCH aberrations in tumors.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 May 1.,"Ivosidenib is a potent, targeted, orally active, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that has been approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are greater than or equal to 75 years of age or ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, and those with relapsed or refractory AML, with a susceptible IDH1 mutation. Ivosidenib is an inducer of the CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic anion transporting polypeptide-1B1/1B3 (OATP1B1/1B3), and organic anion transporter-3 (OAT3) in vitro. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed to predict drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of ivosidenib in patients with AML. The in vivo CYP3A4 induction effect of ivosidenib was quantified using 4beta-hydroxycholesterol and was subsequently verified with the PK data from an ivosidenib and venetoclax combination study. The verified model was prospectively applied to assess the effect of multiple doses of ivosidenib on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam. The simulated midazolam geometric mean area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) ratios were 0.18 and 0.27, respectively, suggesting ivosidenib is a strong inducer. The model was also used to predict the DDIs of ivosidenib with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, OATP1B1/1B3, and OAT3 substrates. The AUC ratios following multiple doses of ivosidenib and a single dose of CYP2B6 (bupropion), CYP2C8 (repaglinide), CYP2C9 (warfarin), P-gp (digoxin), OATP1B1/1B3 (rosuvastatin), and OAT3 (methotrexate) substrates were 0.90, 0.52, 0.84, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.27, respectively. Finally, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Simcyp modeling platform was qualified to predict CYP3A4 induction using known inducers and sensitive substrates.","['(c) 2021 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Epub 2021 Apr 6.,"Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a rare but serious myeloid malignancy. In a review of reported cases for WHO-defined CNL, CSF3R mutation is found in about 90% cases and confirmed as the molecular basis of CNL. Concurrent mutations are observed in CSF3R-mutated CNL patients, including ASXL1, SETBP1, SRSF2, JAK2, CALR, TET2, NRAS, U2AF1, and CBL. Both ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations in CNL have been associated with a poor prognosis, whereas, SRSF2 mutation was undetermined. Our patient was a 77-year-old man and had no significant past medical history and symptoms with leukocytosis. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy revealed a markedly hypercellular marrow with prominent left-shifted granulopoiesis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA from the BM aspirate of a panel of 28 genes, known to be pathogenic in MDS/MPN, detected mutations in CSF3R, SETBP1, and SRSF2, and a diagnosis of CNL was made. The patient did not use a JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor (ruxolitinib) but started on hydroxyurea and alpha-interferon and developed pruritus after 4 months of diagnosis and nasal hemorrhage 1 month later. Then, the patient was diagnosed with CNL with AML transformation and developed intracranial hemorrhage and died. We repeated NGS and found that three additional mutations were detected: ASXL1, PRKDC, MYOM2; variant allele frequency (VAF) of the prior mutations in CSF3R, SETBP1, and SRSF2 increased. The concurrence of CSF3RT618I, ASXL1, SETBP1, and SRSF2 mutation may be a mutationally detrimental combination and contribute to disease progression and AML transformation, as well as the nonspecific treatment of hydroxyurea and alpha-interferon, but the significance and role of PRKDC and MYOM2 mutations were not undetermined.",,,20210406,PMC8116236,['NOTNLM'],"['AML transformation', 'CSF3RT618I', 'Chronic neutrophilic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used population-based cancer registry data to estimate the subtype-specific risks of second primary lymphoma among patients with first BCL (n = 288 478) or TCL (n = 23 747). We observed nearly fivefold increased bidirectional risk between BCL and TCL overall (TCL following BCL: standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2-5.2; BCL following TCL: SIR = 4.7, 95% CI = 4.1-5.2), but the risk varied substantially by lymphoma subtype. The highest SIRs were observed between Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) (PTCL-NOS following HL: SIR = 27.5; HL following PTCL-NOS: SIR = 31.6). Strikingly elevated risks also were notable for angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (AITL following DLBCL: SIR = 9.7; DLBCL following AITL: SIR = 15.3). These increased risks were strongest within the first year following diagnosis but remained persistently elevated even at >/=5 years. In contrast, SIRs were <5 for all associations of TCL with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.

The effect of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, as treatment for nonmetastatic colon cancer is unknown. Objective: To determine if the addition of celecoxib to adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) improves disease-free survival in patients with stage III colon cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance)/Southwest Oncology Group 80702 was a 2 x 2 factorial design, phase 3 trial conducted at 654 community and academic centers throughout the United States and Canada. A total of 2526 patients with stage III colon cancer were enrolled between June 2010 and November 2015 and were followed up through August 10, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive adjuvant FOLFOX (every 2 weeks) for 3 vs 6 months with or without 3 years of celecoxib (400 mg orally daily; n = 1263) vs placebo (n = 1261). This report focuses on the results of the celecoxib randomization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was disease-free survival, measured from the time of randomization until documented recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary end points included overall survival, adverse events, and cardiovascular-specific events. Results: Of the 2526 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 61.0 years [11 years]; 1134 women [44.9%]), 2524 were included in the primary analysis. Adherence with protocol treatment, defined as receiving celecoxib or placebo for more than 2.75 years or continuing treatment until recurrence, death, or unacceptable adverse events, was 70.8% for patients treated with celecoxib and 69.9% for patients treated with placebo. A total of 337 patients randomized to celecoxib and 363 to placebo experienced disease recurrence or died, and with 6 years' median follow-up, the 3-year disease-free survival was 76.3% for celecoxib-treated patients vs 73.4% for placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio [HR] for disease recurrence or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76-1.03; P = .12). The effect of celecoxib treatment on disease-free survival did not vary significantly according to assigned duration of adjuvant chemotherapy (P for interaction = .61). Five-year overall survival was 84.3% for celecoxib vs 81.6% for placebo (HR for death, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.04; P = .13). Hypertension (any grade) occurred while treated with FOLFOX in 14.6% of patients in the celecoxib group vs 10.9% of patients in the placebo group, and a grade 2 or higher increase in creatinine levels occurred after completion of FOLFOX in 1.7% vs 0.5% of patients, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stage III colon cancer, the addition of celecoxib for 3 years, compared with placebo, to standard adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve disease-free survival.

Refusal of blood components by Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) produces challenges to treatment. In this report we describe the outcome of hematological malignancies of JW patients treated without transfusions. Altogether, eight JW, diagnosed 1994-2015, 6 (75%) females, the median age at diagnosis 40 years (range, 20-78), were included into the analysis. The diagnoses were: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2, 25%), acute myeloid leukemia (2, 25%), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (4, 50%). One patient died without treatment while the remaining 7 patients received treatment, including imatinib in 1 patient with BCR-ABL1+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Five (62.5%) patients received erythropoiesis stimulating agents. Median hemoglobin concentration at diagnosis was 8.7 g/dL (range, 6.3-13.1), and it decreased to 3.2 g/dL (range, 2.6-9.3) during first-line treatment. Median platelet count at diagnosis was 52 x 109/L (range, 15-392). All patients became thrombocytopenic upon treatment reaching median platelet count 8 x 109/L (range, 2-85). Five patients developed respiratory failure. Anemia contributed substantially to the death of 3 out of 6 patients (50%). One patient (17%) developed central nervous system bleeding in the course of thrombocytopenia. Objective response rate was 43%, with 29% complete remissions after first-line treatment. Despite the median overall survival of 15.3 months (95% CI, 0.2-52.2), all but one acute leukemia patients succumbed shortly after the diagnosis. To conclude, the outcome of JW treated because of hematological malignancies without blood transfusions is very dismal, nevertheless, selected patients can obtain complete remissions. Anemia contributes significantly to the death of JW.",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Jehovah's Witnesses"", 'blood transfusion', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'platelet transfusion']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytotoxic effects were determined by incubation of HL-60 cells with various concentrations of examined compounds and combinations thereof, which were then stained with propidium iodide and analyzed using a flow cytometer. To determine the role of oxidative stress in the action of the compounds, co-incubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and parthenolide and/or etoposide was used and the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) was detected. RESULTS: Parthenolide significantly enhanced the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of etoposide. However, in most cases of the combinations of parthenolide and etoposide, their effect was antagonistic, as confirmed by an analysis using the CalcuSyn program. The examined compounds significantly reduced the level of GSH in HL-60 cells. Combination of etoposide at a concentration of 1.2 muM and parthenolide also significantly reduced GSH level. However, in the case of a combination of etoposide at a concentration of 2.5 muM with parthenolide, a significant increase in the level of GSH was obtained compared to compounds acting alone. This last observation seems to confirm the antagonism between the compounds tested. CONCLUSIONS: Parthenolide did not limit the cytotoxic effect of etoposide in HL-60 cells even in the case of antagonistic interaction. If parthenolide does increase GSH levels in combination with etoposide in the normal hematopoietic cells, it could protect them against the pro-oxidative effects of this anti-cancer drug.",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GSH', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'etoposide', 'flow cytometry', 'oxidative stress', 'parthenolide']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our hospital from 2010 to 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were diagnosed with AL during pregnancy. Of whom, eighteen had acute myeloid leukemia, and 3 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Six, eight and seven patients were diagnosed during the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. Six of the 21 patients experienced therapeutic abortion and 1 had spontaneous abortion, whereas 9 gave birth to healthy babies (4 through vaginal deliveries and 5 with Caesarean sections). Four babies had been exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, but no congenital malformations were observed. Sixteen patients received chemotherapy, while 4 patients died before chemotherapy and one was discharged after refusing chemotherapy. The complete remission rate of the 10 patients who began chemotherapy immediately after diagnosis was 80%, compared with 66.7% in the 6 patients who started chemotherapy after abortion or delivery. Three remain alive. CONCLUSIONS: In general, initiation of chemotherapy as early as possible may increase the CR rate. Combined with literature data, we proposed that, for patients diagnosed in early and late stages of pregnancy (>30 weeks), elective termination or induced delivery before chemotherapy may be a good choice for better maternal (and fetal) outcome.KEY MESSAGESAcute leukaemia diagnosed in pregnancy is extremely rare, and its treatment is a clinical dilemma.In general, initiation of chemotherapy as early as possible may increase the CR rate.For patients who are diagnosed in the first trimester or late stage of pregnancy (>30 weeks), elective termination or induced delivery before starting chemotherapy may be a good choice for better maternal (and fetal) outcome.",,,,PMC8032338,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukaemia', '*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*chemotherapy', '*pregnancy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For decades, its only curative method has been intensive induction chemotherapy with or without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and this approach cannot be applied to elderly patients, who make up more than 50% of AML patients. Recent advances in genomics facilitated the elucidation of various mutations related to AML, and the most frequent mutations were discovered in epigenetic regulators. Alterations to epigenetic modifications that are essential for normal cell biology, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, have been identified. As epigenetic dysregulation is an important carcinogenic mechanism and some epigenetic changes are reversible, these epigenetic alterations have become targets for novel drug development against AML.

Leukemia case numbers and age-standardized rates (ASRs) were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the ASR was calculated using a generalized linear model with a Gaussian distribution. The risk factors for death and DALYs due to leukemia were estimated within the comparative risk assessment framework of the GBD study. Globally, the prevalence, age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), and EAPC in leukemia cases in 2017 were 2.43 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 2.19 to 2.59) million, 32.26 (95% UI 29.02 to 34.61), and 0.22% (95% CI 0.13 to 0.31, P<0.01), respectively, during 1990-2017. The trends of the age-standardized incidence, deaths, and DALY rate all significantly decreased globally. The burden of leukemia was higher in males than in female. An increasing leukemia burden was found in high-middle-sociodemographic index (SDI) countries and territories. The burden of leukemia tended to be lower in high-SDI regions than that in lower SDI regions.

Epub 2021 Apr 4.,"Telomere length homeostasis is essential for maintaining genomic stability and cancer proliferation. Telomerase-negative cancer cells undergo recombination-mediated alternative lengthening of telomeres. Telomeres associate with the nuclear envelope through the shelterin RAP1 and nuclear envelope SUN1 proteins. However, how the associations between telomeres and the nuclear envelope affect the progression of telomere recombination is not understood. Here, we show that telomere anchorage might inhibit telomere-telomere recombination. SUN1 depletion stimulates the formation of alternative lengthening of telomeres-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies in ALT cells. In contrast, overexpression of a telomere-nuclear envelope-tethering chimera protein, RAP1-SUN1, suppresses APB formation. Moreover, inhibition of this nuclear envelope attachment alleviates the requirement of TOP3alpha for resolving the supercoiling pressure during telomere recombination. A coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that the SUN1 N-terminal nucleoplasmic domain interacts with the RAP1 middle coil domain, and phosphorylation-mimetic mutations in RAP1 inhibit this interaction. However, abolishing the RAP1-SUN1 interaction does not hinder APB formation, which hints at the existence of another SUN1-dependent telomere anchorage pathway. In summary, our results reveal an inhibitory role of telomere-nuclear envelope association in telomere-telomere recombination and imply the presence of redundant pathways for the telomere-nuclear envelope association in ALT cells.",,,20210404,PMC8064153,['NOTNLM'],"['*RAP1', '*SUN1', '*alternative lengthening of telomeres', '*nuclear envelope tethering', '*telomere-telomere recombination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 5.,"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an anticancer agent used for the treatment ofacute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, 5%-10% of patients fail to respond or experience disease relapse. Based on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1 involvement in the processing of DNA demethylation, here we have tested the in vitro susceptibility of ATO-resistant clones (derived from the human APL cell line NB4) to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine) or high-dose vitamin C (ascorbate), which induces 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-mediated DNA demethylation. ATO-sensitive and -resistant APL cell clones were generated and initially analyzed for their susceptibility to five clinically used PARPi (olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib, veliparib, and talazoparib). The obtained PARPi IC50 values were far below (olaparib and niraparib), within the range (talazoparib), or above (rucaparib and veliparib) the C max reported in patients, likely as a result of differences in the mechanisms of their cytotoxic activity. ATO-resistant APL cells were also susceptible to clinically relevant concentrations of azacitidine and decitabine and to high-dose ascorbate. Interestingly, the combination of these agents with olaparib, niraparib, or talazoparib resulted in synergistic antitumor activity. In combination with ascorbate, PARPi increased the ascorbate-mediated induction of 5hmC, which likely resulted in stalled DNA repair and cytotoxicity. Talazoparib was the most effective PARPi in synergizing with ascorbate, in accordance with its marked ability to trap PARP1 at damaged DNA. These findings suggest that ATO and PARPi have nonoverlapping resistance mechanisms and support further investigation on PARPi combination with hypomethylating agents or high-dose ascorbate for relapsed/ATO-refractory APL, especially in frail patients. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study found that poly(ADP-ribose) inhibitors (PARPi) show activity as single agents against human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells resistant to arsenic trioxide at clinically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, PARPi enhance the in vitro efficacy of azacitidine, decitabine, and high-dose vitamin C, all agents that alter DNA methylation. In combination with vitamin C, PARPi increase the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, likely as a result of altered processing of the oxidized intermediates associated with DNA demethylation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0221-768X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0100-6247']",20210405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coumarin and its derivatives possess anticancer activity against different types of cancers such as prostate, renal, breast, laryngeal, lung, colon, CNS, leukemia, malignant melanoma. In this review, current developments of coumarin-based anticancer agents viz simple coumarin, furanocoumarin, pyranocoumarin, pyrone-substituted coumarin, and their important derivatives have been discussed. The coumarin-triazole, coumarin-chalcone, coumarin-thiosemicarbazone derivatives, and coumarin-metal complexes have been found more potent than coumarin.

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) and can be classified into two types based on the amino acid at position 233 in Tax protein, which probably plays crucial roles in leukemogenesis. We previously revealed that L233-Tax-expressing cells secreted chemoattractants for endothelial cells and formed significantly larger tumors accompanying neovascularization than P233-Tax-expressing cells in athymic mice. In the present study, comparative proteomic analysis of the culture medium of Tax-expressing cells revealed that annexin A3 and probably extracellular matrix protein 1 served as chemoattractants. Conversely, L233-Tax-expressing cells were impaired in the secretion of collagen alpha-1 (I) chain precursor, which participates in tissue tension homeostasis, leading to tumor mass development. The analysis also demonstrated that both L233-Tax- and P233-Tax-expressing cells had deficits in the secretion of potentially antiangiogenic molecules, including pigment epithelium-derived factor and collagen alpha-1 (VIII) chain, and they produced complement component 3, which might participate in tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion. These findings provided novel insights into prognostication of EBL and the function of Tax in leukemogenesis induced by BLV.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Apr 2.,"Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is an extremely rare disease, and although it is reported to have a worldwide distribution, young Asian women are most likely to be affected. Although this disease is generally benign and self-limiting, distinguishing it from other diseases that cause lymphadenopathy (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, and infectious diseases) is challenging. A lymph node biopsy is a definitive diagnostic technique for KFD and only requires skillful pathologists. There are no specific symptoms or laboratory tests for KFD, and more than 50% of KFD patients have suffered from being misdiagnosed with lymphoma, which leads to improper treatment. In this study, lymph node tissue samples from KFD patients were used to reveal their exomes and transcriptomes using a high-throughput nucleotide sequencer. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as candidate KFD markers and were compared with a healthy lymph node exome dataset. The mutation of these genes caused disruptive impact in the proteins. Several SNPs associated with KFD involve genes related to human cancers, olfaction, and osteoblast differentiation. According to the transcriptome data, there were 238 up-regulated and 1,519 down-regulated genes. RANBP2-like and ribosomal protein L13 were the most up-regulated and down-regulated genes in KFD patients, respectively. The altered gene expression involved in the human immune system, chromatin remodeling, and gene transcription. A comparison of KFD and healthy datasets of exomes and transcriptomes may allow further insights into the KFD phenotype.

Epub 2021 Apr 2.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Euphorbia fischeriana Steud. (Euphorbiaceae) is a perennial herb distributed in grassland, hill slopes or gravel hillside, with average altitude of 100-600 m. The whole grass of E. fischeriana is toxic with roots used as folk medicine to treat Zhushui, dyspepsia, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, cough, as well as external applications such as cure of scabies and tuberculosis of lymph nodes. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This systematic review aims to provide a detailed and in-depth summary about the reported advances in traditional uses, clinical applications, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicity of E. fischeriana, so as to offer fresh ideas and broader vision and insights for subsequent studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various scientific data bases such as CNKI, Elsevier, Google Scholar, Pubmed, Science Direct, SciFinder Scholar and Web of Science were searched to collect information about E. fischeriana. Other relevant literatures were searched in 'Flora of China Editorial Committee', ancient books, Ph.D and Masters' Dissertation to get more data of E. fischeriana. RESULTS: A total of 241 chemical constituents have been identified from the roots of E. fischeriana, including diterpenoids, triterpenoids, meroterpenoids, acetophenones, flavonoids, coumarins, steroids, phenolic acids, tannins, etc. Various pharmacological activities have been demonstrated, especially anti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-leukemia activities. Moreover, different investigations about clinical uses and toxicology of E. fischeriana indicated that attention should be paid to its usage and dosage. CONCLUSION: The researches of E. fischeriana are excellent, but gap still remains. As a poisonous traditional Chinese medicine, there are not enough studies on the toxicity of E. fischeriana. In addition, scholars' research on the pharmacological mechanism of E. fischeriana focuses more on the anti-tumor activity, which can be broadened in the future. Presumably, chemical constituents and biological activities of diterpenoids and trace meroterpenoids in E. fischeriana deserve further research in-depth in the future, in order to provide low toxicity and high efficiency lead compounds. Meanwhile, further studies on other medicinal aspects may lay a foundation for the comprehensive development and utilization of E. fischeriana.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We report a cohort of 319 consecutive LGLL patients who presented to our cancer center between 2001 and 2020. A total of 295 patients with T-LGLL and 24 with chronic NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (CLPD-NK) were identified. The median age was 65 years (range, 17-90 years). Eighty-three patients (26.0%) had autoimmune diseases. A total of 119 patients (37.3%) had coexisting malignancies, 66 (20.7%) had solid tumors, and 59 (18.5%) had hematological malignancies. Most coexisting malignancies were diagnosed before the diagnosis of LGLL. Treatment was needed for 57% of patients. Methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide (Cy), and cyclosporine A (CSA) were most used and had similar response rates between 61.5%-74.4%. Cy produced more complete responses (32.3%) compared to MTX and CSA (15.7% and 23.1%, respectively). Thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and female gender (after controlling for autoimmune diseases) were associated with decreased response rates to MTX, CSA, or Cy.

Numerous researches have associated lncRNAs with a wide range of diseases, such as breast cancer, leukemia, and many other conditions. In this work, we propose a graph-based method named PANDA. This method treats the prediction of new associations between lncRNAs and diseases as a link prediction problem in a graph. We start by building a heterogeneous graph that contains the known associations between lncRNAs and diseases and additional information such as gene expression levels and symptoms of diseases. We then use a Graph Auto-encoder to learn the representation of the nodes' features and edges, finally applying a Neural Network to predict potentially interesting novel edges. The experimental results indicate that PANDA achieved a 0.976 AUC-ROC, surpassing state-of-the-art methods for the same problem, showing that PANDA could be a promising approach to generate embeddings to predict potentially novel lncRNA-disease associations.",,,20210405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 1.,"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Author(s).

Epub 2021 Apr 5.,"BACKGROUND: Several important treatment and supportive care strategies have been implemented over the past 4 decades in the management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The authors identified 29,107 patients who were diagnosed with de novo AML between 1980 and 2017 in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were categorized into 5 age groups (ages birth to 14, 15-39, 40-59, 60-69, and >/=70 years) and 4 calendar periods (1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2017). The outcomes of patients who had AML within these categories were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival rates in patients with AML were 9%, 15%, 22%, and 28% in the decades 1980 to 1989, 1990 to 1999, 2000 to 2009, and 2010 to 2017, respectively. Among patients aged 15 to 39 years, the 5-year survival rates were 24%, 41%, 52%, and 63%, respectively; among those aged >/=70 years, the 5-year survival rates were 1%, 2%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. Four-week mortality was surprising high among adults and older patients (range, 20%-45%), even in modern times. Overall, survival continued to improve over the calendar periods and was best in the period from 2010 to 2017. Survival improvement was noticeable across all age groups except patients aged >/=70 years, in whom the estimated 5-year survival rate remained 5% even during the period from 2010 to 2017. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of patients with AML showed incremental improvement over time in a population-based study of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. The introduction since 2017 of targeted therapies among older patients and optimizations in supportive care hopefully will continue to improve outcomes in AML, particularly among older patients.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307']",20210405,,['NOTNLM'],"['Epidemiology and End Results', 'Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'decades', 'early mortality', 'outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Encouraging clinical data have been reported for T cell-based targeting agents, such as anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapies, for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). However, clinical use of both blinatumomab and CAR-T therapies has been limited due to unfavorable pharmacokinetics (PK), significant toxicity associated with cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, and manufacturing challenges. We present here a fully human CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody (TNB-486) for the treatment of B-NHL that could address the limitations of the current approved treatments. In the presence of CD19+ target cells and T cells, TNB-486 induces tumor cell lysis with minimal cytokine release, when compared to a positive control. In vivo, TNB-486 clears CD19+ tumor cells in immunocompromised mice in the presence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in multiple models. Additionally, the PK of TNB-486 in mice or cynomolgus monkeys is similar to conventional antibodies. This new T cell engaging bispecific antibody targeting CD19 represents a novel therapeutic that induces potent T cell-mediated tumor-cell cytotoxicity uncoupled from high levels of cytokine release, making it an attractive candidate for B-NHL therapy.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2804-2697', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0016-4561', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4809-9383', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3994-3861']",,PMC8023237,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bispecific antibody', '*CD19XCD3', '*T-cell engager', '*TNB-486', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*low cytokine release']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 5.,"Stereospecific recognition of metabolites plays a significant role in the detection of potential disease biomarkers thereby providing new insights in diagnosis and prognosis. D-Hdroxy/amino acids are recognized as potential biomarkers in several metabolic disorders. Despite continuous advances in metabolomics technologies, the simultaneous measurement of different classes of enantiomeric metabolites in a single analytical run remains challenging. Here, we develop a novel strategy for untargeted chiral metabolomics of hydroxy/amine groups (-OH/-NH2) containing metabolites, including all hydroxy acids (HAs) and amino acids (AAs), by chiral derivatization coupled with liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS/MS). Diacetyl-tartaric anhydride (DATAN) was used for the simultaneous derivatization of-OH/-NH2 containing metabolites as well as the resulting diastereomers, and all the derivatized metabolites were resolved in a single analytical run. Data independent MS/MS acquisition (DIA) was applied to positively identify DATAN-labeled metabolites based on reagent specific diagnostic fragment ions. We discriminated chiral from achiral metabolites based on the reversal of elution order of D and L isomers derivatized with the enantiomeric pair (+/-) of DATAN in an untargeted manner. Using the developed strategy, a library of 301 standards that consisted of 214 chiral and 87 achiral metabolites were separated and detected in a single analytical run. This approach was then applied to investigate the enantioselective metabolic profile of the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) plasma samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis and following completion of the induction phase of chemotherapeutic treatment. The sensitivity and selectivity of the developed method enabled the detection of trace levels of the D-enantiomer of HAs and AAs in primary plasma patient samples. Several of these metabolites were significantly altered in response to chemotherapy. The developed LC-HR-MS method entails a valuable step forward in chiral metabolomics.",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1892-2495'],20210405,,,,"['R01 CA206210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA231364/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 May 2.,"Recurrent somatic internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene characterise approximately one third of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and FLT3-ITD mutation status guides risk-adapted treatment strategies. The aim of this work was to characterise FLT3-ITD variant distribution in relation to molecular and clinical features, and overall survival in adult AML patients. We performed two parallel retrospective cohort studies investigating FLT3-ITD length and expression by cDNA fragment analysis, followed by Sanger sequencing in a subset of samples. In the two cohorts, a total of 139 and 172 mutant alleles were identified in 111 and 123 patients, respectively, with 22% and 28% of patients presenting with more than one mutated allele. Further, 15% and 32% of samples had a FLT3-ITD total variant allele frequency (VAF) < 0.3, while 24% and 16% had a total VAF >/= 0.7. Most of the assessed clinical features did not significantly correlate to FLT3-ITD numerical variation nor VAF. Low VAF was, however, associated with lower white blood cell count, while increasing VAF correlated with inferior overall survival in one of the cohorts. In the other cohort, ITD length above 50 bp was identified to correlate with inferior overall survival. Our report corroborates the poor prognostic association with high FLT3-ITD disease burden, as well as extensive inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity in the molecular features of FLT3-ITD. We suggest that future use of FLT3-targeted therapy could be accompanied with thorough molecular diagnostics and follow-up to better predict optimal therapy responders.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

PV has the potential to progress to myelofibrosis or an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukemia. Mutational profiling of patients with PV has led to the development of risk stratification tools to determine an individual's risk of developing progressive disease. Although the current goals of PV treatment are to alleviate symptoms and reduce thrombotic risk, there are growing efforts to identify disease-modifying agents which will also prevent progression of disease. Here, we give an overview of the developing prognostic tools and therapeutic landscape for PV, focusing on four drug classes: pegylated interferon-alpha 2, MDM2 antagonists, hepcidin mimetics, and histone deacetylase inhibitors.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Hoffman R et al.'],,20210312,PMC8009192,['NOTNLM'],"['Polycythemia vera', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'prognostic tools', 'treatment']",['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Ronald Hoffman serves as a consultant for Protagonist Therapeutics and receives', 'research support from Novartis and Kartos Therapeutics.

As a springboard to explore new anti-cancer and anti-Alzheimer's chemical prototypes from rare Annonaceae species, the present study evaluated anti-PDE4B along with antiproliferative and anti-cholinesterase activities of the extracts of the Philippine endemic species Uvaria alba using in vitro assays and framed the resulting biological significance through computational binding and reactivity-based experiments. Thus, the PDE4 B2B-inhibiting dichloromethane sub-extract (UaD) of U. alba elicited antiproliferative activity against chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) and cytostatic effects against human cervical cancer (HeLa). The extract also profoundly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Chemical profiling analysis of the bioactive extract identified 18 putative secondary metabolites. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed strong free energy binding mechanisms and dynamic stability at 50-ns simulations in the catalytic domains of PDE4 B2B, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14, and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1 Kelch domain) for the benzylated dihydroflavone dichamanetin (16), and of an AChE and KEAP-1 BTB domain for 3-(3,4-dihydroxybenzyl)-3',4',6-trihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxychalcone (8) and grandifloracin (15), respectively.

In recent years, miR-299-3p has been identified as a biomarker in multiple cancers, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia, thyroid cancer, and lung cancer. However, the regulatory mechanism of miR-299-3p in GC cell progression is still largely unclear. Cell viability and apoptosis tests were performed by CCK8 and flow cytometry assay, respectively. Transwell assay was recruited to examine cell invasion ability. The interaction between miR-299-3p and PAX3 was determined by the luciferase reporter system. PAX3 protein level was evaluated by western blot assay. The expression of miR-299-3p was downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines (MKN-45, AGS, and MGC-803) compared with the normal tissues and cells. Besides, overexpression of miR-299-3p significantly suppressed proliferation and invasion and promoted apoptosis in GC. Next, we clarified that PAX3 expression was regulated by miR-299-3p using a luciferase reporter system, qRT-PCR, and western blot assay. Additionally, downregulation of PAX3 repressed GC cell progression. The rescue experiments indicated that restoration of PAX3 inversed miR-299-3p-mediated inhibition on cell proliferation and invasion. miR-299-3p suppresses cell proliferation and invasion as well as induces apoptosis by regulating PAX3 expression in GC, representing desirable biomarkers for GC diagnosis and therapy.","['(c) 2021 Zhenfen Wang et al., published by De Gruyter.']",,20210323,PMC8005920,['NOTNLM'],"['GC biomarkers', 'GC therapy', 'PAX3', 'gastric cancer', 'miR-299-3p']",,,['Conflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine enrichment of miR-212-5p. The relationship between CCNT2 and miR-212-5p was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot. CCK-8 assay was performed to determine cell viability. Decitabine significantly repressed cell viability, while promoted cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, the expression levels of cyclinD1, CDK4, and Bcl-2 were suppressed in cells with decitabine exposure, but Bax and caspase-3 expression levels were upregulated. Besides, miR-212-5p upregulation had the similar function with decitabine in AML cell proliferation and apoptosis. Subsequently, restoration of CCNT2 attenuated miR-212-5p overexpression-induced effects in Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells.

Double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) was employed to examine and compare serum GPBB, Mb, and BNP levels. Following chemotherapy, the patients presented higher levels of serum GPBB, Mb, and BNP than before chemotherapy treatment. The levels of LVEF (%), E/A, and IVRT were significantly decreased after chemotherapy, while EDT was markedly increased. The cumulative ANT dose was positively corelated to serum GPBB, Mb, and BNP levels while it was negatively corelated to LVEF levels.

Methods: Plasma NPM1A levels were investigated in 80 AML patients, 22 patients with benign hematopathy and 12 healthy donors by qRT-PCR. Additionally, the relationship between NPM1A levels and clinic characteristics were evaluated by Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Plasma levels of NPM1A in AML patients were significantly higher than those in benign hematopathy patients and healthy controls, respectively (both P<0.001). Additionally, high NPM1A level was significantly associated with higher WBC and platelet count (both, P<0.05). Moreover, survival analysis revealed that patients with high NPM1A levels had worse OS (P<0.001) and RFS (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified NPM1A as an independent prognostic predictor for AML (OS: HR=8.214, 95% CI: 2.974-22.688, P<0.001; RFS: HR=4.640, 95%CI: 1.825-11.795, P=0.001).

Feature selection plays a key role in several fields (e.g., computational biology), making it possible to treat models with fewer variables which, in turn, are easier to explain, by providing valuable insights on the importance of their role, and likely speeding up the experimental validation. Unfortunately, also corroborated by the no free lunch theorems, none of the approaches in literature is the most apt to detect the optimal feature subset for building a final model, thus it still represents a challenge. The proposed feature selection procedure conceives a two-step approach: (a) a sparse modeling-based learning technique is first used to find the best subset of features, for each class of a training set; (b) the discovered feature subsets are then fed to a class-specific feature selection scheme, in order to assess the effectiveness of the selected features in classification tasks. To this end, an ensemble of classifiers is built, where each classifier is trained on its own feature subset discovered in the previous phase, and a proper decision rule is adopted to compute the ensemble responses. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, extensive experiments have been performed on publicly available datasets, in particular belonging to the computational biology field where feature selection is indispensable: the acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, the human carcinomas, the human lung carcinomas, the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and the malignant glioma. SMBA-CSFS is able to identify/retrieve the most representative features that maximize the classification accuracy. With top 20 and 80 features, SMBA-CSFS exhibits a promising performance when compared to its competitors from literature, on all considered datasets, especially those with a higher number of features. Experiments show that the proposed approach may outperform the state-of-the-art methods when the number of features is high. For this reason, the introduced approach proposes itself for selection and classification of data with a large number of features and classes.",['(c)2019 Nardone et al.'],,20191118,PMC7924712,['NOTNLM'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Dictionary learning', 'Ensemble learning', 'Feature selection', 'Sparse coding']",,,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The sensitivity of the downregulation of myeloid leukemia factor 1-interacting proteins (MLF1IP) to Tamoxifen (TAM) was tested by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The apoptosis of MLF1IP-mediated resistance was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) with/without TAM. Western blot was used in detecting various kinds of apoptosis and the expression of the protein related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway to study the molecular mechanism of secondary endocrine resistance in Luminal breast cancer. Results: The downregulation of MLF1IP could significantly increase the drug sensitivity of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells and also inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 cells under the stimulation of drugs. Western blot results showed that the expression of Bcl-2-associated X (BAX), Caspase3, Caspase7, and Caspase9 proteins increased when MLF1IP was downregulated. The results of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway revealed that the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) protein expression of MCF7-shRNA was higher than that of MCF7-NC cells, while the expression of p-AKT was lower than that of MCF7-NC cells. Conclusions: (1) MLF1IP-related apoptosis resistance plays an essential role in MLF1IP-mediated secondary resistance of breast cancer cells. (2) MLF1IP promotes AKT phosphorylation by inhibiting the PTEN expression, thus activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and causing the secondary resistance of Luminal breast cancer. (3) MLF1IP can be used as a factor to predict the endocrine resistance of Luminal breast cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Minhua Wu et al.'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8285-3717'],20210316,PMC7990544,,,,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent study demonstrated that PT-Cy combined with other immunosuppressants could further reduce the incidence of GVHD and improve the GVHD and relapse free survival (GRFS). In this prospective phase II study, we evaluated the effect of a new GVHD prophylaxis consist of PT-Cy combined with tacrolimus and low dose anti-thymoglobulin (ATG). A total of 23 patients were enrolled including 20 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and three patients with T cell lymphoma. The median age was 29 years (range, 16~58 years). Patients with HLA-matched related donor (MSD, n=7) received PT-Cy combined with tacrolimus, while patients with HLA matched unrelated (MUD, n = 2) or haplo-identical (Haplo, n = 14) donor received additional ATG at 2.5 mg/kg on day 15 or day 22 after engraftment of neutrophils. As to the acute GVHD (aGVHD), only three patients developed grade I (n = 1) or grade II (n = 2) aGVHD with 100-day incidence of all aGVHD and II-IV aGVHD at 13.0 +/- 5.1% and 9.1 +/- 6.1% respectively. Only two patients had mild and one had moderate chronic GVHD (cGVHD), with 1-year incidence of cGVHD and moderate/severe cGVHD at 15.2 +/- 8.7% and 4.6 +/- 4.4% respectively. A high incidence of CMV reactivation was documented (14/16 with MUD/Haplo donor and 2/7 with MSD) with only 1 CMV disease documented. There were two EBV reactivation without post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) documented. With a median follow-up of 303 days (range, 75~700 days), three patients relapsed leading to 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 12.8 +/- 9.2%. Only one patient died of CMV pneumonia on day 91 with both 100-day and 1-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 4.6 +/- 4.4%. The 1-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and GRFS were 95.5 +/- 4.4%, 82.6 +/- 9.5%, and 68.0 +/- 11.3% respectively. Based on Simon's stage II design, our primary data showed that the PT-Cy+tacrolimus +/- ATG protocol was promising in preventing aGVHD and cGVHD, which may translate into low NRM without increased CIR.

Recently, microRNA-26a (miR-26a) has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of osteosarcoma. However, whether it regulates MDR in osteosarcoma is unknown. We show here that miR-26a expression declines in chemoresistant osteosarcoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and its expression correlates with clinical outcome. In addition, compared with sensitive parental cells, miR-26a expression also declines in osteosarcoma MDR cells, together suggesting a negative correlation between miR-26a expression and MDR development in osteosarcoma. We also show that the enforced expression of miR-26a reverses MDR in osteosarcoma cells, and conversely, miR-26a knockdown confers MDR in chemosensitive osteosarcoma cells treated with doxorubicin, methotrexate, or cisplatin. Mechanistically, miR-26a directly targets the pro-survival protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), and in turn, the enforced expression of MCL1 markedly antagonizes miR-26a-decreased MDR in osteosarcoma MDR cells, therefore demonstrating that miR-26a reverses MDR in osteosarcoma by targeting MCL1. Lastly, miR-26a reverses resistance to doxorubicin in osteosarcoma MDR cells xenografted in nude mice. Collectively, these results reveal a negative role and the underlying mechanism of miR-26a in the regulation of MDR in human osteosarcoma, implying a potential tactic of manipulating miR-26a for overcoming MDR in osteosarcoma chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Li and Ma.'],,20210318,PMC8012539,['NOTNLM'],"['MCL1', 'chemotherapy', 'miR-26a', 'multidrug resistance', 'osteosarcoma']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

governed by multi-factorial regulatory mechanisms including chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, binding of transcription factors to specific loci, RNA transcription and protein synthesis. However, the mechanisms by which such regulatory ""dimensions"" coordinate cell fate decisions are currently poorly understood. Here we quantified the multi-dimensional molecular changes that occur in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) upon depletion of Estrogen related receptor beta (Esrrb), a key pluripotency regulator. Comparative analyses of expression changes subsequent to depletion of Esrrb or Nanog, indicated that a system of interlocked feed-forward loops involving both factors, plays a central part in regulating the timing of mESC fate decisions.

We aimed to explore the population burden of pediatric APL, gathering information from the population-based cancer registry (PBCR) and the diagnosis of APL obtained through incident cases from a hospital-based cohort. The homozygous deletion in glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) leads to a loss of enzyme detoxification activity, possibly affecting the treatment response. Mutations in the RAS pathway genes are also considered to be a key component of the disease both in the pathogenesis and in the outcomes. We have assessed mutations in a RAS-MAP kinase pathway (FLT3, PTPN11, and K-/NRAS) and GST variant predisposition risk in the outcome. Out of the 805 children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are registered in the PBCR, 35 (4.3%) were APL cases. The age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) was 0.03 per 100,000 person-years. One-hundred and sixty-three patients with APL were studied out of 931 AML cases (17.5%) from a hospital-based cohort. Mutations in FLT3, KRAS, and NRAS accounted for 52.1% of the cases. Patients with APL presented a 5-year probability of the overall survival (OS) of 67.3 +/- 5.8%. A GST-theta 1 (GSTT1) null genotype conferred adverse prognosis, with an estimated hazard ratio of 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-6.9. We speculate that the GSTT1 polymorphism is associated with therapeutics and would allow better OS of patients with APL with a GSTT1 null genotype.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Andrade, Feliciano, Sardou-Cezar, Brisson, Santos-Bueno,', 'Vianna, Marques, Terra-Granado, Zalcberg, Santos, Costa, Noronha, Thuler,', 'Wiemels, Pombo-de-Oliveira and the Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Acute', 'Leukemia.']",,20210319,PMC8017304,['NOTNLM'],"['PML-RARA fusion gene', 'acute pediatric leukemia', 'childhood Incidence', 'glutathione S-transferase', 'prognosis']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,['Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Acute Leukemia'],"['Alves SR', 'de Souza Barros PR', 'Basegio RM', 'de Brito PC', 'Cordoba JC', 'Costa I', 'Fialho ECE', 'Fonseca TCC', 'Magalhaes IMQ', 'da Luz Mamede GT', 'Manzo E', 'Marques RF', 'Neves GR', 'Nobrega AG', 'Oliveira CT', 'de Paula Guedes Oliveira R', 'Epelman S', 'da Silva AMM', 'Nunes SL', 'Dos Santos Souza M', 'de Souza RQ', 'Taniguchi ANR', 'Trujillo LG', 'Wanderley AV']","['Alves, Sarkis Renata', 'de Souza Barros, Pereira Renata', 'Basegio, Rosania Maria', 'de Brito, Patricia Carneiro', 'Cordoba, Jose Carlos', 'Costa, Imarui', 'Fialho, Eloisa Cartaxo Eloy', 'Fonseca, Teresa Cristina Cardoso', 'Magalhaes, Isis Maria Quezado', 'da Luz Mamede, Glaceanne Torres', 'Manzo, Eda', 'Marques, Rebeca Ferreira', 'Neves, Gustavo Ribeiro', 'Nobrega, Andrea Gadelha', 'Oliveira, Claudia Teresa', 'de Paula Guedes Oliveira, Renato', 'Epelman, Sidnei', 'da Silva, Ana Maria Marinho', 'Nunes, Silva Luciana', 'Dos Santos Souza, Marcelo', 'de Souza, Regiana Quinto', 'Taniguchi, Adriano Nori Rodrigues', 'Trujillo, Luciana Garcia', 'Wanderley, Alayde Vieira']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the comprehensive large-scale clinical cohort study for clarifying their prognostic significance remains scarce to date. A total of 242 consecutive adult Ph-negative BCP-ALL patients treated in our institute were retrospectively screened ZNF384 fusions at diagnosis by multiplex real time quantitative PCR. ZNF384 fusions were identified in 47 patients (19.4%) and all belonged to B-other ALL (having no high hyperdiploid karyotype, BCR-ABL1, TCF3-PBX1, ETV6-RUNX1, or MLL rearrangement). In the whole cohort, patients with ZNF384 fusions had significantly higher 3-year relapse-free-survival (RFS) and tended to have a higher 3-year overall survival (OS) than those with no ZNF384 fusions (80.1% vs. 52.5%, P = 0.013; 67.6% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.10). For patients receiving chemotherapy alone and received allogeneic-hematologic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were censored at the time of transplantation, patients with ZNF384 fusions had both similar RFS and similar OS to B-other ALL patients with no ZNF384 fusions (RFS: P =0.94 and 0.30; OS: P =0.94 and 0.51). For patients receiving transplantation, those with ZNF384 fusions had significantly higher 3-year RFS than B-other ALL patients with no ZNF384 fusions and their OS were similar (P = 0.022 and 0.24). Only two of 31 patients with ZNF384 fusions and receiving allo-HSCT relapsed, individually occurred 66.8 and 69.8 months after transplantation. Therefore, ZNF384 fusion is common in adult BCP-ALL, which may define a new group from BCP-ALL containing no classical fusion transcript with better prognosis through receiving allo-HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Qin, Jiang, Xu, Wang, Jiang, Dao, Chen, Zhao, Liu, Zhang, Liu', 'and Huang.']",,20210317,PMC8010301,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'B-other', 'Ph-negative', 'ZNF384 fusions', 'adult', 'allogeneic-hematological stem cell transplantation', 'relapse-free survival']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSCT in first complete remission could only be considered for an extremely small fraction of patients with persistent MRD at the end of consolidation or for those who relapse. In the pre-ATO era, relapsed patients were usually treated with readministration of ATRA and chemotherapy as salvage therapy, generally containing high-dose cytarabine and an anthracycline, followed by further post-remission chemotherapy and/or HSCT. ATO-based regimens are presently regarded as the first option for relapsed APL. The selection of the most appropriate post-remission treatment option for patients in second CR (CR2), as well as the modality of HSCT when indicated, depends on several variables, such as pre-transplant molecular status, duration of first remission, age, and donor availability. Although with a moderate level of evidence, based on recent retrospective studies, autologous HSCT would be at present the preferred option for consolidation for patients in molecular CR2. Allogeneic HSCT could be considered in patients with a very early relapse or those beyond CR2. Nevertheless, the superiority of HSCT as consolidation over other alternatives without transplantation has recently been questioned in some studies, which justify a prospective controlled study to resolve this still controversial issue.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sanz, Montesinos and Sanz.']",,20210318,PMC8012800,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukaemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)', 'arsenic trioxide', 'hematopoietic (stem) cell transplantation (HCT)', 'relapse']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, experimental plasma devices used directly to clinical experiments has challenges in technology and methods, especially the difference in killing tumor cells efficiency of these two common plasma sources. Therefore, it is great necessity to explore the differences in treating tumors between different plasma sources. This paper achieved good killing efficiency by using two kinds of cold atmospheric plasma generating devices, namely plasma jet and surface plasma treatment along acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The results showed that the He plasma jet kills leukemia cells more efficiently than surface plasma with the same voltage and frequency and the same time. By GC-TOFMS and metabolomics analysis, this paper compared the differential metabolites of leukemia cells treated by two plasma devices and the key metabolic pathways closely related to differential metabolites. Simultaneously, we found alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism was most correlated with a key differential metabolite, glutamine. It was found that the glutaminase activity of He plasma jet group was lower than that of surface plasma group, which might be a reason for He plasma jet group to kill tumor cells better. It was also worth noting that relative quantity of glucose metabolites of plasma jet treatment group was lower than that of surface plasma treatment group.

We report an unusual case of a primary de novo peritoneal myeloid sarcoma, in association with inv(16)(p13;q22) and clonal heterogeneity at different sites of involvement, that has responded well to AML induction therapy and consolidation treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and high dose cytarabine. Cytogenetics, immunophenotyping, and chromosomal analysis, were each critical in establishing a proper diagnosis as well as helping to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies for this rare entity.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Over 965,000 angioplasties are performed annually in the United States alone. While the technique and equipment have undergone significant revisions and improvement, the medical community will still benefit from more data and guidance on the optimal selection of mandatory peri-operation anticoagulation in specific, high-risk populations. Many of these procedures are performed on high-risk individuals who have an inherently higher risk of hemorrhage or thrombosis. Unfractionated heparin is the most popular choice in the general population, however, its use carries certain limitations. Here we will describe the use of an uncommonly used anticoagulant in a patient being actively treated for leukemia. We will also discuss the unique properties and benefits of the four most frequently used anticoagulants during a cardiac angioplasty. Our team describes the successful use of bivalirudin during an urgent PCI in a 71-year-old female with eight previous stents that was followed by an uncomplicated recovery period. Our experience contributes to a small, but growing, body of evidence that bivalirudin may be a safe choice to use in lieu of unfractionated heparin in patients with underlying oncological disease. Our patient had several comorbidities that significantly increased their risk of bleeding.

As none of these positive and negative studies are controlled, randomized trials are needed to fully define the role of alloHSCT in Ph+ ALL, especially in those with deep molecular response.

In comparison to patients with rejection, tolerant patients display higher level of regulatory B cells (Bregs) expressing granzyme B (GZMB(+)) that have the capability to prevent effector T cells proliferation. However, BANK1 was found to be decreased in these GZMB(+) Bregs. In this article, we investigated seven different transcriptomic studies and mined the literature in order to make link between BANK1, tolerance and Bregs. As for GZMB(+) Bregs, we found that BANK1 was decreased in other subtypes of Bregs, including IL10(+) and CD24(hi)CD38(hi) transitional regulatory B cells, along with BANK1 was down-regulated in activated/differentiated B cells, as in CD40-activated B cells, in leukemia and plasma cells. Following a reductionist approach, biological concepts were extracted from BANK1 literature and allowed us to infer association between BANK1 and immune signaling pathways, as STAT1, FcgammaRIIB, TNFAIP3, TRAF6, and TLR7. Based on B cell signaling literature and expression data, we proposed a role of BANK1 in B cells of tolerant patients that involved BCR, IP3R, and PLCG2, and a link with the apoptosis pathways. We confronted these data with our experiments on apoptosis in total B cells and Bregs, and this suggests different involvement for BANK1 in these two cells. Finally, we put in perspective our own data with other published data to hypothesize two different roles for BANK1 in B cells and in Bregs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Le Berre, Chesneau, Danger, Dubois, Chaussabel, Garand and', 'Brouard.']",,20210318,PMC8015775,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*BANK1', '*apoptosis', '*regulatory B cells', '*tolerance', '*transplantation']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) are two retroviruses that attack the CD4 + T cells and impair their functions. Both HIV and HTLV-I can be transmitted between individuals through direct contact with certain body fluids from infected individuals. Therefore, a person can be co-infected with both viruses. HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), while HTLV-I is the causative agent for adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Several mathematical models have been developed in the literature to describe the within-host dynamics of HIV and HTLV-I mono-infections. However, modeling a within-host dynamics of HIV/HTLV-I co-infection has not been involved. The present paper is concerned with the formulation and investigation of a new HIV/HTLV-I co-infection model under the effect of Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) immune response. The model describes the interaction between susceptible CD4 + T cells, silent HIV-infected cells, active HIV-infected cells, silent HTLV-infected cells, Tax-expressing HTLV-infected cells, free HIV particles, HIV-specific CTLs and HTLV-specific CTLs. The HIV can spread by virus-to-cell transmission. On the other side, HTLV-I has two modes of transmission, (i) horizontal transmission via direct cell-to-cell contact through the virological synapse, and (ii) vertical transmission through the mitotic division of Tax-expressing HTLV-infected cells. The well-posedness of the model is established by showing that the solutions of the model are nonnegative and bounded. We define a set of threshold parameters which govern the existence and stability of all equilibria of the model. We explore the global asymptotic stability of all equilibria by utilizing Lyapunov function and Lyapunov-LaSalle asymptotic stability theorem. We have presented numerical simulations to justify the applicability and effectiveness of the theoretical results. In addition, we evaluate the effect of HTLV-I infection on the HIV dynamics and vice versa.",['(c) Sociedad Matematica Mexicana 2021.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5030-633X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6324-2774']",20210329,PMC8005865,['NOTNLM'],"['CTL-mediated immune response', 'Global stability', 'HIV/HTLV-I co-infection', 'Lyapunov function', 'Mitotic transmission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such patients tend to have few comorbidities suggesting their EM is owing to aggressive underlying disease. We sought to characterize this ultra-high risk population through a retrospective review of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) treated with first-line ASCT. Patients who died within 1 year of ASCT were matched for age, sex, and year of transplant in a 1:2 fashion with a control group. Of 962 transplants performed between January 1, 2007, and May 1, 2019, 41 patients (4.3%) died within 1 year of ASCT from MM-related causes. In a multivariate analysis, anemia, hypercalcemia, high-risk cytogenetics, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were associated with EM post-ASCT. Forty patients (97.6%) received at least 1 novel agent. Most patients with EM post-ASCT received second-line chemotherapy (80.5%), although survival from initiation of second-line chemotherapy was only 2.1 months. The primary reason for not receiving second-line therapy was rapid relapse. Clinical parameters reflecting disease burden, as well as high-risk cytogenetics, are associated with EM post-ASCT. These patients have a dismal overall survival despite significant advances in treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma. Further study of these ultra-high risk patients is required to improve disease management and may give further insights into the biology of relapse and resistance in myeloma.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML cell lines OCI/AML3, MV4-11, and THP-1 with gene mutations up-regulating HOXA9 expression were treated with DB818 and analysed for cell proliferation and gene expression. The effects of HOXA9 knockdown were also evaluated. RESULTS: In the three AML cell lines, DB818 suppressed growth, induced apoptosis, and down-regulated the expression of HOXA9 transcriptional target genes: MYB proto-oncogene, transcription factor (MYB), MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYC), and BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2), while up-regulating that of Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (FOS). HOXA9 knockdown showed similar effects, except for MYC expression, which differed between DB818-treated and HOXA9-deficient OCI/AML3 cells, suggesting an off-target effect of DB818.

Epub 2021 Apr 1.,"African horse sickness virus (AHSV) non-structural protein NS4 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein that is expressed in the heart, lung, and spleen of infected horses, binds dsDNA, and colocalizes with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AHSV NS4 in viral replication, virulence and the host immune response. Using a reverse genetics-derived virulent strain of AHSV-5 and NS4 deletion mutants, we showed that knockdown of NS4 expression has no impact in cell culture, but results in virus attenuation in infected horses. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to investigate the transcriptional response in these horses, to see how the lack of NS4 mediates the transition of the virus from virulent to attenuated. The presence of NS4 was shown to result in a 24 hour (h) delay in the transcriptional activation of several immune system processes compared to when the protein was absent. Included in these processes were the RIG-I-like, Toll-like receptor, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, which are key pathways involved in innate immunity and the antiviral response. Thus, it was shown that AHSV NS4 suppresses the host innate immune transcriptional response in the early stages of the infection cycle. We investigated whether AHSV NS4 affects the innate immune response by impacting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway specifically. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) we showed that AHSV NS4 disrupts JAK-STAT signaling by interfering with the phosphorylation and/or translocation of STAT1 and pSTAT1 into the nucleus. Overall, these results showed that AHSV NS4 is a key virulence factor in horses and allows AHSV to overcome host antiviral responses in order to promote viral replication and spread.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

METHODS: The clinical data of 262 middle-risk young and middle-aged patients with AML treated in our hospital from January 2010 to December 2018 were selected retrospectively. All the patients were reached morphological leukemia-free state (MLFS) after induction chemotherapy, the overall and subgroup clinical data of the selected patients were analyzed. Cox regression model was used to evaluate the independent prognostic factors of middle-risk newly diagnosed young and middle-aged patients. RESULTS: Among the patients less than 40 years old treated by consolidation therapy with PR-CT and allo-HSCT regimens, the 5-year cumulative leukemia-free survival(LFS) rates were 40.92% and 63.51%P=0.01respectively, while those over 40 years old were 23.61% and 49.14%P=0.00, respectively. The 5-year cumulative LFS rates of the patients treated by chemotherapy and achieved early remission and late remission were 63.51% and 41.33% P=0.01, respectively. The 5-year cumulative overall survival(OS) rates of the patients treated by PR-CT and allo-HSCT regimens were 23.65% and 69.32% (P=0.00), respectively, and the 5-year cumulative LFS rates were 26.44% and 52.30% (P=0.01). Among the patients treated by PR-CT consolidation treatment, the MRD-negative and MRD-positive cases were 74 and 60 cases, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse rate in the MRD-negative subgroup was significantly lower than those in the MRD-positive subgroup (P<0.05), the 5-year LFS rate and OS rate of the patients in MRD-negative subgroup were significantly higher than those in MRD-positive subgroup (P<0.05). For the patients treated by allo-HSCT consolidation treatment, the MRD-negative and MRD-positive cases were 66 and 62 cases, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse rate of the patients in MRD-negative subgroup was significantly lower than those in MRD-positive subgroupP<0.05, and the 5-year LFS and OS rates of the patients in MRD-negative subgroup were significantly higher than those in MRD-positive subgroup (P<0.05). The univariate analysis results showed that age, chromosome karyotype, MRD status after reaching MLFS, and consolidation treatment regime were all related to the prognosis of patients (P<0.05). The multivariate analysis results showed that age, MRD status after reaching MLFS, and consolidation therapy were the independent factors affecting the cumulative OS rate of the patients (P<0.05). Chromosome karyotype was an independent factor affecting the cumulative LFS rate of the patients (P<0.05). MRD status and consolidation treatment plan after reaching MLFS were the independent factors affecting the cumulative recurrence rate of the patients (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The OS rate of middle-risk young and middle-aged patients with newly diagnosed AML is independently related to age, MRD status after MLFS and consolidation therapy, while chromosome karyotype is independently related to cumulative LFS, and allo-HSCT consolidation therapy is recommended for middle-risk young and middle-aged AML patients after induction chemotherapy for MLFS, especially for those less than 40 years old and MRD positive before consolidation therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis rates of four HL60 cell groups were detected with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the level of miR-96 in AML children were higher, but MYB lower (P<0.05). Compared with complete remission AML, the level of miR-96 in primary AML was higher, but MYB lower (P<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that, the expression level of MYB in the four HL60 cell groups was different (P<0.05), the lowest was in miR-96 mimics group, followed by miR-96 NC group and inhibitor-miR-96 NC group, and the highest in inhibitor-miR-96 group (P<0.05), while there was no difference between miR-96 NC group and inhibitor-miR-96 NC group (P>0.05). The promotion of over-expression level of miR-96 on the invasion ability of HL 60 cells was confirmed by Transwell assay. MTT assay showed that miR-96 could promote the proliferation of HL60 cells, inhibit the apoptosis of HL60 cells, and the effect was time-dependent manner (r=0.804).

METHODS: A total of 43 children who were newly diagnosed and achieved complete remission after remission induction therapy were enrolled. The children before treatment were included in incipient group, and after treatment when achieved complete remission included in remission group. A total of 39 children with immune thrombocytopenia were enrolled in control group. Three milliliter bone marrow samples were collected from above-mentioned each group. QRT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression of LRP5 and LRP6 in blood mononuclear cells of bone marrow. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of LRP5 and LRP6. According to the protein expression levels of LRP5 and LRP6, the children were divided into low-expression group and high-expression group, and the clinical biological characteristics were compared between these two groups. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Both mRNA and protein expression levels of LRP5 and 6 were upregulated in the incipient group compared with the control and remission group (P<0.05). The mRNA and protein expressions of LRP5 and LRP6 in the high-risk group were higher than those in the medium-risk group (P<0.05), it is the same as in the medium-risk group than the low-risk group (P<0.05). The mRNA and protein expressions of LRP5 and 6 positively correlated with risk degree in the incipient group (rLRP5 mRNA=0.84, P<0.05; rLRP6 mRNA=0.66, P<0.05; rLRP5 protein=0.82, P<0.05; rLRP6 protein=0.76, P<0.05). The white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase in LRP5 and LRP6 high expression group were significantly higher than those in low expression group (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference in other biological characteristics. Kaplan-meier survival analysis showed that in the 43 children 3-year overall survival rate and event-free survival rate was (91.7+/-4.7)% and (87.6+/-5.2)%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The high expression of LRP5/6 may be one of the pathogenesis of childhood ALL, and the degree of LRP5/6 increase may be related to the risk level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: After the treatment of different concentrations of rhTPO (0, 50, 100 ng/ml) for different time (24,48,72 h)the cell proliferation rates of the AML cell lines (Kasumi-1, Skno-1, HEL, HL-60, THP-1) were determined by CCK-8 method. Apoptosis rate of each cell line cocultured with rhTPO was detected by Annexin V/PI method. The relative expression of TPO receptor c-MPL (myeloproliferative clonal antibody) mRNA in AML cell lines was detected by Q-PCR. The expression of c-MPL protein in each cell line was detected by Western blot. The expression of c-MPL antigen in HL-60 cells treated by different concentrations of rhTPO was detected by Flow cytometry. RESULTS: RhTPO showed no promotion to the proliferation of Kasumi-1, Skno-1, HEL, HL-60, THP-1 cell lineshoweverit showed inhibitory effect to cell proliferation (72 h 0 ng/ml vs 100 ng/ml, P= 0.029) and pro-apoptotic (48 h 0 ng/ml vs 50 ng/ml, P=0.0143) in HL-60 cells. In Kasumi-1, Skno-1, HEL and THP-1 cells, there showed no statistically significant differences in apoptosis rate among each groups treated by different concentrations of rhTPO. Each AML cell line showed different levels of c-MPL gene and c-MPL protein expression, but HEL cells showed the highest expression in both of them. After HL-60 cells were treated by different concentrations of rhTPO for 48 hours, there showed no statistical difference in c-MPL antigen expression among each groups. CONCLUSION: RhTPO can not promote the proliferation of Kasumi-1, Skno-1, HEL, HL-60 and THP-1 leukemia cell lines. On the contrary, rhTPO can inhibit HL-60 cell proliferation and promote its apoptosis, and this effect is not related to c-MPL gene expression or protein expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical characteristics, laboratory test and treatment methods of the children were concluded. All patients were followed up to evaluate the effect of treatment. RESULTS: The 19 cases of children included nine male and ten female, the median age of onset was 2 years old. The clinical manifestations showed nonspecific. The median white blood cell of peripheral blood was 15.88x10(9)/L, the median hemoglobin was 67 g/L and median platelet was 16x10(9)/L. An increase of primitive and naive megakaryocytes was found in the bone marrow sample. The immunophenotypes of bone marrow detected by flow cytometry in 19 children were all positive expressed for CD41, CD61. Genetic tests showed that five cases carrying EVI1, including one complicating with MLL/AF10, one patient carrying HOX11, one carrying GATA1, IKZF1 and DDX11 mutations, one patient carrying missense mutation of NRAS, one with missense mutation of KRAS and two cases with high expression of WT1. Karyotype analysis were performed in 11 cases of children, including four with normal karyotype, four with complex karyotypes, one with trisomy 8, one with 7/13 trisomy 21 without Down syndrome manifestations (considered as abnormal somatic karyotype) and one Robertsonian translocation carrier involving chromosomes 14 and 21. Ten children received treatment, including three cases with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after complete remission (CR), two cases with complete donor implantation, and one without implanted but hematopoietic recovered, these three children were followed up for 26, 15 and 12 months respectively and the minimal residual disease (MRD) were all less than 10(-4). Another three cases achieving CR after chemotherapy but relapsed in 5, 10 and 12 months after the onset respectively, and all the three children were died eventually. One children died of pulmonary hemorrhage during chemotherapy and three children died from discontinuation of treatment after non remission. The remaining nine children died because of without chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSION: Non-DS-AMKL was rare in children and difficult to be diagnosed. Determination of MICM classification as early as possible was helpful for diagnosis, and genetic testing played an important role for diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with CR after chemotherapy might be an effective way to cure AMKL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 93 patients with newly diagnosed AML who underwent gene mutation detection by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) from March 2014 to April 2018 in our hospital was analyzed retrospectively. The distribution of mutant genes was summarized and the prognostic factors for intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (IR-AML) were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 93 AML patients, 88.17% had at least one gene mutation, and 53.76% patients showed more than one recurrent genetic mutation. CEBPA showed the highest mutation frequency (20.4%), followed by ASXL1, TET2, NRAS, FLT3-ITD, NPM1, IDH2, DNMT3A, and their mutation frequency were higher than 10%. IDH1/2 and NPM1, ASXL1 and U2AF1, FLT3 and NPM1 often co-occured (P < 0.05). In the prognosis analysis of 57 patients with IR-AML, the IDH2 mutation related with poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.05). The prognosis analysis of IR-AML patients showed that age>/=50 years, WBC >100x10(9)/L, anemia, and CD22(+) were independent risk factors for OS. Age>/=50 years , WBC >100x10(9)/L, anemia, CD34(+), IDH2 mutation were independent risk factors for PFS. CONCLUSION: There are co-occurring mutation patterns between the mutated genes.

METHODS: Fifteen patients with refractory/relapsed AML hospitalized in 5 medical units such as Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University and received one course of CLAG regimen from June 2014 to August 2019 were analyzed retrospectively (specifically: cladribine 5 mg/M(2), day 1 to day 5, continuous 24-hour intravenous infusion; Ara-C 2 g/M(2), 1 time/day, day 1 to day 5, intravenous infusion; G-CSF 300 mg, 1 time/day, day 0 to day 5, subcutaneous injection). RESULTS: Among the 15 patients with refractory/relapsed AML, 9 males and 6 females, the median age was 35 (13-63) years old. FAB classification: 1 case of M1, 3 cases of M2a, 4 cases of M2b (including 1 case with extramedullary invasion), 1 case of M4 with extramedullary invasion, 5 cases of M5, 1 case of HAL; NCCN classification: 6 cases in intermediate risk group, 9 cases in high risk group; 8 cases refractory, 7 cases relapsed. The median time of pre-chemotherapy was 4 (2-8) (of which NO.15 had received 8 cycles of chemotherapy and received CLL1-CAR-T), and the median white blood cell count before chemotherapy was 12.27 (from 0.78 to 5.29)x109/L. After 1 course of treatment with CLAG regimen, 12 patients achieved complete remission (12/15, 80%), and the median duration of CR was 65 days (0-528) days. IV grade leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was found in all the patients after chemotherapy. The median duration of granulocytosis was 20 (14 to 33) days, and 1 patient died. Seven patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The median EFS and OS time of 15 patients was 85 (19-558) days and 117 (19-558) days, respectively. CONCLUSION: The CLAG regimen consisting of continuous intravenous infusion of cladribine shows high CR in the treatment of AML patients, but the duration of CR is short, myelosuppression is sever, so that infection control is the key. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation should be performed as soon as possible after CR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy patients with AML who were hospitalized in Department of Hematology, Wuwei People's Hospital from April 2017 to August 2019 were selected and enrolled in AML group, 25 healthy volunteers were selected and enrolled in control group; then according to therapeutic regimen, AML patients were divided into 2 groups: combined therapy group (myeloid leukemia NO.1 Chinese herb medicine prescription combined with chemotherapy) and non-combined therapy group (chemotherapy alone). Flow cytometry was used to detect the ratio of CD3(+) CD161(+) IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(+) T cells in bone marrow fluid, and ELISA was used to detect the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) concentrations in bone marrow fluid. Statistical analysis was performed on the data with SPSS 22.0. RESULTS: The ratio of CD3(+) CD161(+) IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(+) T cells, VEGF and IL-17 concentration in newly diagnosed and relapsed AML patients were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (P<0.001); while those in CR and DFS stage patients were significantly lower than those in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients (P<0.001), and the ratio of CD3(+) CD161(+) IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(+) T cells, VEGF and IL-17 concentration in DFS patients with AML were not significantly different from those in the control group (P>0.05). The ratio of CD3(+) CD161(+) IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(+) T cells, VEGF and IL-17 concentration in CR stage of AML patients treated with chemotherapy alone were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05), but there was no difference between combined therapy group and the control group; the ratio of CD3(+) CD161(+) IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(+) T cells, the concentration of VEGF and IL-17 in CR stage of AML patients treated with chemotherapy alone were higher than those of patients treated with combined therapy regimen (P<0.05). AML patients treated with combined therapy regimen had a significantly higher complete remission rate compared with patients received chemotherapy alone (P<0.05), but the recurrence rate was significantly lower (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Th17 cells expression in bone marrow of newly diagnoses and relapsed AML patients significantly increase, and decrease significantly after treatment.

METHODS: A total of 108 children with B-cell ALL (B-ALL) were diagnosed and systematically treated according to Chinese Children's Leukemia Group (CCLG) -ALL 2008 in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2016. The 108 patients were divided into two groups according to the result of mutiplex polymerase chain reaction: group with P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement and group without P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement. The ALL children with P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement were all treated by CCLG-ALL 2008 high-risk group (HR) regimens, and the ALL children in group without P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement received different intensity chemotherapy according to clinical risk classification. RESULTS: Five (4 male and 1 female) out of 108 patients with B-ALL had P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement. In the 5 B-ALL patients with P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement, the median age of the was 4 (2-6) years old and the median WBC count was 26.2 (2.46-525.1)x10(9)/L. These patients presented different immunophenotype, including 3 cases of common B-ALL and 2 cases of pre B-ALL. Four patients carried a normal karyotype and 1 patient carried 46, XY, der (20) [22]/46, XY[2]. For the children with P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement, 1 patient (20%) could not achieve complete remission (CR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) of 2 patients (40%) was higher than 1% on day 33 of induction chemotherapy; while in group without P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement, all the patient achieved CR, and MRD in 6 patients (5.8%) was higher than 1% on day 33 of induction chemotherapy. The 3 year event-free survival (EFS) of ALL children in group with P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement was significantly lower than that in group without P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement (60.0%+/-21.9% vs 85.9%+/-3.9%) (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The early treatment response and prognosis of ALL children with P2RY8-CRLF2 gene rearrangement are worse, and more effective protocol is needed for this subtype patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by clonal expansion and differentiation arrest of the myeloid progenitor cells, which leads to the accumulation of immature cells called blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 occur in 30% of normal karyotype patients with AML and are associated with a higher incidence of relapse and worse survival. Targeted therapies against FLT3 mutations using small-molecule FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have long been investigated, with some showing favorable clinical outcomes. However, major setbacks such as limited clinical efficacy and the high risk of acquired resistance remain unresolved. FLT3 signaling, mutations, and FLT3 inhibitors are topics that have been extensively reviewed in recent years. Strategies to target FLT3 beyond the small molecule kinase inhibitors are expanding, nevertheless they are not receiving enough attention. These modalities include antibody-based FLT3 targeted therapies, immune cells mediated targeting strategies, and approaches targeting downstream signaling pathways and FLT3 translation. Here, we review the most recent advances and the challenges associated with the development of therapeutic modalities targeting FLT3 beyond the kinase inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"Mouse models of various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, often display an immature dentate gyrus, characterized by increased numbers of immature neurons and neuronal progenitors and a dearth of mature neurons. We previously demonstrated that the CRMP5-associated GTPase (CRAG), a short splice variant of Centaurin-gamma3/AGAP3, is highly expressed in the dentate gyrus. CRAG promotes cell survival and antioxidant defense by inducing the activation of serum response factors at promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies, which are nuclear stress-responsive domains, during neuronal development. However, the physiological role of CRAG in neuronal development remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the role of CRAG using dorsal forebrain-specific CRAG/Centaurin-gamma3 knockout mice. The mice revealed maturational abnormality of the hippocampal granule cells, including increased doublecortin-positive immature neurons and decreased calbindin-positive mature neurons, a typical phenotype of immature dentate gyri. Furthermore, the mice displayed hyperactivity in the open-field test, a common measure of exploratory behavior, suggesting that these mice may serve as a novel model for neuropsychiatric disorder associated with hyperactivity. Thus, we conclude that CRAG is required for the maturation of neurons in the dentate gyrus, raising the possibility that its deficiency might promote the development of psychiatric disorders in humans.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

In addition to differences in underlying conditions and comorbidities relative to adults, invasive fungal diseases in infants, children, and adolescents are unique in terms of their epidemiology, the validity of current diagnostic methods, the pharmacology and dosing of antifungal agents, and the absence of phase 3 clinical trials to provide data to guide evidence-based interventions. To re-examine the state of knowledge and to further improve invasive fungal disease diagnosis, prevention, and management, the 8th European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-8) reconvened a Paediatric Group to review the literature and to formulate updated recommendations according to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) grading system, which are summarised in this Review.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolism of gonocytes is not defined. We demonstrate with mitochondrial ultrastructure studies via TEM and IHC and metabolic flux studies with UHPLC-MS that a distinct metabolic transition occurs during the maturation to SSCs. The mitochondrial ultrastructure of prepubertal human spermatogonia is shared with prepubertal pig spermatogonia. The metabolism of early prepubertal porcine spermatogonia (gonocytes) is characterized by the reliance on OXPHOS fuelled by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. Interestingly, at the same time, a high amount of the consumed pyruvate is also reduced and excreted as lactate. With maturation, prepubertal spermatogonia show a metabolic shift with decreased OXHPOS and upregulation of the anaerobic metabolism-associated uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). This shift is accompanied with stem cell specific promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) protein expression and glial cell-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF) pathway activation. Our results demonstrate that gonocytes differently from mature spermatogonia exhibit unique metabolic demands that must be attained to enable their maintenance and growth in vitro.",['(c) 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3970-6011', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8092-0066', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7410-1491', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2839-1870', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5753-499X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7952-8419', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0695-2606']",,PMC8212869,['NOTNLM'],"['*maturation', '*metabolism', '*prepubertal spermatogonia', '*reactive oxygen species']","['R01 HD092084/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 OD016575/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS1709299'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of the genomic studies indicating a distinct gene expression profile, we evaluated the role of immunophenotyping in characterizing a rare subtype of AML-CBFA2T3-GLIS2 rearranged. Immunophenotypic data were obtained by studying a cohort of 20 pediatric CBFA2T3-GLIS2-AML and 77 AML patients not carrying the fusion transcript. Enrolled cases were included in the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) AML trials and immunophenotypes were compared using different statistical approaches. By multiple computational procedures, we identified two main core antigens responsible for the identification of the CBFA2T3-GLIS2-AML. CD56 showed the highest performance in single marker evaluation (AUC = 0.89) and granted the most accurate prediction when used in combination with HLA-DR (AUC = 0.97) displaying a 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity. We also observed a weak-to-negative CD45 expression, being exceptional in AML. We here provide evidence that the combination of HLA-DR negativity and intense bright CD56 expression detects a rare and aggressive pediatric AML genetic lesion improving the diagnosis performance.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Apr 2.,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) consists of two isoforms (alpha and beta) that were originally linked to glucose metabolism regulation. However, GSK-3 is also involved in several signaling pathways controlling many different key functions in healthy cells. GSK-3 is a unique kinase in that its isoforms are constitutively active, while they are inactivated mainly through phosphorylation at Ser residues by a variety of upstream kinases. In the early 1990s, GSK-3 emerged as a key player in cancer cell pathophysiology. Since active GSK-3 promotes destruction of multiple oncogenic proteins (e.g., beta-catenin, c-Myc, Mcl-1) it was considered to be a tumor suppressor. Accordingly, GSK-3 is frequently inactivated in human cancer via aberrant regulation of upstream signaling pathways. More recently, however, it has emerged that GSK-3 isoforms display also oncogenic properties, as they up-regulate pathways critical for neoplastic cell proliferation, survival, and drug-resistance. The regulatory roles of GSK-3 isoforms in cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, tumor metabolism, invasion, and metastasis reflect the therapeutic relevance of these kinases and provide the rationale for combining GSK-3 inhibitors with other targeted drugs. Here, we discuss the multiple and often conflicting roles of GSK-3 isoforms in acute leukemias. We also review the current status of GSK-3 inhibitor development for innovative leukemia therapy.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6027-3156'],20210402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three of five xenograft lines (HCT-116, HL-60, and BL-0382), F-aza-T-dCyd was more efficacious than aza-T-dCyd. Comparable activity was observed for these two agents against the NCI-H23 and OVCAR3 xenografts. In the HCT-116 study, F-aza-T-dCyd [10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.), QDx5 for four cycles], produced complete regression of the tumors in all mice with a response that proved durable beyond postimplant day 150 (129 days after the last dose). Similarly, complete tumor regression was observed in the HL-60 leukemia xenograft when mice were dosed with F-aza-T-dCyd (10 mg/kg i.p., QDx5 for three cycles). In the PDX BL-0382 bladder study, both oral and i.p. dosing of F-aza-T-dCyd (8 mg/kg QDx5 for three cycles) produced regressions that showed tumor regrowth beginning 13 days after dosing. These findings indicate that further development of F-aza-T-dCyd (NSC801845) is warranted.

Epub 2021 Mar 2.,"BACKGROUND: FLAG +/- Ida (fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin), is a salvage chemotherapy regimen for relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with complete remission (CR) rates historically ranging from 52% to 63%. We review the outcomes for patients with R/R AML treated with FLAG +/- Ida at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients (>/= 18 years) with R/R AML who received FLAG or FLAG + Ida from January 1, 2012 to October 31, 2016 were identified via chart review. Outcomes evaluated were CR, CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), overall response rate, overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival, and adverse events. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included. The median age was 52 years (range, 23-73 years), and 57% were male. Sixteen (38.1%) patients had relapsed disease, and 26 (61.9%) had refractory disease. Most (n = 35; 83.3%) patients had European LeukemiaNet intermediate-risk AML. Responses were CR in 20 (47.6%) and CRi in 6 (14.3%). The median OS was 10 months (range, 0.8-51 months), and the median relapse-free survival was 12 months (range, 1-51 months) for responders. The median OS for patients who achieved CR was not reached, and the estimated 48-month survival rate was 56%. The median OS after CRi or no response was 3.47 and 2.17 months, respectively. The median OS was not significantly different when censored for stem cell transplant following chemotherapy, nor with use/deferral of idarubicin. The most common adverse effects were pancytopenia and infection. CONCLUSION: Patient outcomes after treatment with FLAG +/- Ida for R/R AML remain similar to prior reports, confirming its role as a salvage regimen for these patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 3.,"Standard therapy in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is often impossible at the time of deep neutropenia/agranulocytosis with or without infectious complications; it is thus a complex therapeutic problem. Vemurafenib has been used to treat resistant HCL since 2012. Because vemurafenib does not have a myelotoxic effect, we thought that it could be used to treat HCL associated with deep neutropenia/agranulocytosis with or without the development of infectious complications as a preliminary stage before treatment with cladribine. We conducted a retrospective analysis of treatment with vemurafenib followed by a standard course of cladribine provided to 22 patients with deep neutropenia/agranulocytosis with or without infectious complications at diagnosis. Vemurafenib was provided to 22 patients with HCL. The response to therapy was evaluated by complete blood cell count (absolute neutrophil count [ANC], hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, absence of hairy cells), spleen size (assessed by ultrasound), and reduce infectious complications. After that, a standard course of cladribine was provided. Among the 22 patients, the male/female sex ratio was 2:1, and median (range) age was 52 (24-78) years. There were 7 patients with severe infectious manifestations admitted to the intensive care unit, including 1 patient during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) ANC at diagnosis was 0.3 (0.04-0.7) x 10(9)/L. Vemurafenib was provided at a dosage of 240 mg 1 or 2 times a day. In 20 patients, vemurafenib was provided for 3 months or more. In 1 case, the effect was not obtained during 1 month of treatment, and the patient died from severe infectious complications during prolonged agranulocytosis. In 21 patients treated with vemurafenib, an increase of ANC was observed and the infectious complications resolved, thus allowing the application of cladribine therapy. After a standard course (0.1 mg/kg per day for 7 days) of cladribine chemotherapy, 18 patients (90%) experienced complete clinical remission and 2 patients (10%) experienced partial remission with residual splenomegaly. In 1 patient, vemurafenib therapy was still ongoing 2 months after initiating therapy. In cases of proven BRAF(V600E) mutation, vemurafenib can be successfully used as an effective preliminary therapy in patients with deep neutropenia/agranulocytosis with or without infectious complications before standard therapy with purine analogs.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Survival analysis and comparisons of incidence, remission rate, relapse, and survival outcomes between FLT3-mutated and wild-type groups were done and prognostic factors identified. RESULTS: FLT3 mutation was detected in 40% of AML patients. The highest incidence was associated with M2 subtype AML (47%) and CN-AML (50%). There was a significant negative association between FLT3 mutations and overall survival (OS), as well as a trend toward improved relapse-free survival, with 3-year OS being 19.17% vs 34.16% (P < .0001) and 33.6% vs 71.0% (P = .085), respectively. Patients with FLT3 mutation had a significantly better complete remission rate after induction (67.9% vs 63.3%, P = .001). Also, OS improved in patients with complete remission (P = .0015) and who then continued to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation compared to FLT3 wild-type patients (P < .001). CONCLUSION: FLT3 mutation is common in Jordanian AML patients, with the highest incidence occurring in patients with M2 or CN disease. It implies a poor prognosis, with poor OS and relapse-free survival, which may be abrogated by early allogeneic transplantation and/or peritransplantation provision of FLT3 inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Despite all progress in the therapeutic strategies and increased rate of complete remission, many patients will eventually relapse and die from the disease. Cytokines as molecular messengers play a pivotal role in the immune system. The imbalance release of cytokine has been shown to exert a significant influence on the progression of hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia.

Leukemic cells, apart from their oncogene-driven ability to proliferate and avoid differentiation, also change the phenotype and function of innate and adaptive immune cells, leading to escape from the immune surveillance. In this review, we provide an overview of the genetic heterogeneity and treatment of BCP- and T-ALL. We outline the interactions of leukemic cells in the bone marrow microenvironment, mainly with mesenchymal stem cells and immune cells. We describe the mechanisms by which ALL cells escape from immune recognition and elimination by the immune system. We focus on the alterations in ALL cells, such as overexpression of ligands for various inhibitory receptors, including anti-phagocytic receptors on macrophages, NK cell inhibitory receptors, as well as T cell immune checkpoints. In addition, we describe how developing leukemia shapes the bone marrow microenvironment and alters the function of immune cells. Finally, we emphasize that an immunosuppressive microenvironment can reduce the efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy and provide examples of preclinical studies showing strategies for improving ALL treatment by targeting these immunosuppressive interactions.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8703-5614', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1719-5233']",20210326,PMC8037152,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell', 'NK cell', 'T cell', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'immune evasion', 'immune system', 'immunotherapy', 'macrophage', 'microenvironment']",['2019/35/B/NZ5/01428/Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are well known, other rarer AICy (autoimmune neutropenia, aplastic anemia, and pure red cell aplasia) and AID (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, thyroiditis, and others) are poorly recognized. This review analyses the available literature of the last 30 years regarding the occurrence of AICy/AID in different onco-hematologic conditions. The latter include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphomas, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myeloproliferative neoplasms, and acute leukemias. On the whole, AICy are observed in up to 10% of CLL and with higher frequencies in certain subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, whilst they occur in less than 1% of low-risk MDS and CMML. AID are described in up to 30% of myeloid and lymphoid patients, including immune-mediated hemostatic disorders (acquired hemophilia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and anti-phospholipid syndrome) that may be severe and fatal. Additionally, AICy/AID are found in about 10% of patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant or treatment with new checkpoint inhibitors.

In this study, we studied the role of MDV US3 in regulating PML-NBs. Using an immunofluorescence assay, we found that MDV US3 disrupts PML and SP100 in a kinase dependent manner. In addition, treatment with MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor) could partially restore the levels of PML and SP100, suggesting that a cellular proteasome dependent degradation pathway is involved in MDV US3 induced disruption of PML and SP100.

Autophagy, a key player on metabolism, plays an essential role in AML. Here, we examined the association of three potentially functional genetic polymorphisms in the ATG10 gene, central for the autophagosome formation. We screened a multicenter cohort involving 309 AML patients and 356 healthy subjects for three ATG10 SNPs: rs1864182T>G, rs1864183C>T and rs3734114T>C. The functional consequences of the ATG10 SNPs in its canonical function were investigated in vitro using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 46 healthy individuals. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender revealed that patients carrying the ATG10rs1864182G allele showed a significantly decreased risk of developing AML (OR [odds ratio] = 0.58, p = 0.001), whereas patients carrying the homozygous ATG10rs3734114C allele had a significantly increased risk of developing AML (OR = 2.70, p = 0.004). Functional analysis showed that individuals carrying the ATG10rs1864182G allele had decreased autophagy when compared to homozygous major allele carriers.

However, inherent limitations such as drug toxicity, as well as acquisition of de novo or acquired mechanisms of resistance, still cause treatment failure. Here we provide an up-to-date review of the successes and limitations of current targeted therapies for cancer treatment and highlight how recent technological advances have provided a new level of understanding of the molecular complexity underpinning resistance to cancer therapies. We also raise three basic questions concerning cancer drug discovery based on molecular markers and alterations of selected signaling pathways, and further discuss how combination therapies may become the preferable approach over monotherapy for cancer treatments.

It is used in exercise physiology as a food supplement to increase performance; however, in vitro evidence suggests that carnosine may exhibit anti-cancer properties. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effect of carnosine on breast, ovarian, colon, and leukemic cancer cell proliferation. We further examined U937 promonocytic, human myeloid leukemia cell phenotype, gene expression, and cytokine secretion to determine if these are linked to carnosine's anti-proliferative properties. RESULTS: Carnosine (1) inhibits breast, ovarian, colon, and leukemic cancer cell proliferation; (2) upregulates expression of pro-inflammatory molecules; (3) modulates cytokine secretion; and (4) alters U937 differentiation and phenotype.

METHODS: MTT assay, DNA fragmentation, ELISA and cell cycle analysis were carried out. RESULTS: Nordamnacanthal and damnacanthal at IC50 values of 1.7 mug/mL and10 mug/mL, respectively. At the molecular level, these compounds caused internucleosomal DNA cleavage producing multiple 180-200 bp fragments that are visible as a ""ladder"" on the agarose gel. This was due to the activation of the Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-dependent endonuclease. The induction of apoptosis by nordamnacanthal was different from the one induced by damnacanthal, in a way that it occurs independently of ongoing transcription process. Nevertheless, in both cases, the process of dephosphorylation of protein phosphates 1 and 2A, the ongoing protein synthesis and the elevations of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration were not needed for apoptosis to take place. Nordamnacanthal was found to have a cytotoxic effect by inducing apoptosis, while damnacanthal caused arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.

Patients with AL are highly susceptible to infectious diseases due to the disease itself, factors attributed to treatment, and specific individual risk factors. Enterobacteriaceae presence (e.g., Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli) is a frequent cause of bloodstream infections in AL patients. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is an emerging health problem worldwide; however, the incidence of CRE varies greatly between different regions. Carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is caused by different mechanisms, and CRE may display various resistance profiles. Bacterial co-expression of genes conferring resistance to both broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics (including carbapenems) and other classes of antibiotics may give rise to multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). The spread of CRE represents a major treatment challenge for clinicians due to lack of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), a limited number of antibiotics available, and the side-effects associated with them. Most research concerning CRE infections in AL patients are limited to case reports and retrospective reviews. Current research recommends treatment with older antibiotics, such as polymyxins, fosfomycin, older aminoglycosides, and in some cases carbapenems. To prevent the spread of resistant microbes, it is of pivotal interest to implement antibiotic stewardship to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, but without giving too narrow a treatment to neutropenic infected patients.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5958-8951', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3434-6715', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1690-1941', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5439-8411']",20210319,PMC8003383,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'infections']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to develop exosomes expressing CD19 CAR to treat CD19-positive B-cell malignancies, instead of using whole CD19 CAR-T cells, thereby reducing the clinical risk of uncontrolled cytokine storms. Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles (30-150 nm), composed of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, that carry the fingerprint of their parent cells. Exosomes are a preferred delivery system in nano-immunotherapy. Here, HEK293T parent cells were transduced with CD19 CAR plasmids and cellular CD19 CAR expression was confirmed. Exosomes (Exo-CD19 CAR) were isolated from the conditioned medium of non-transduced (WT) and CD19 CAR plasmid transduced HEK293T cells. Consequently, CD19 B-lineage leukemia cell lines were co-cultured with Exo-CD19 CAR and cell death was measured. Our data show that Exo-CD19 CAR treatment induced cytotoxicity and elevated pro-apoptotic genes in CD19-positive leukemia B-cells without inducing cell death in CD19-negative cells.

However, the most difficult challenge in agents targeting metabolism is to determine a window of therapeutic opportunities between normal and neoplastic cells, considering that all or most of the metabolic pathways important for cancer ontogeny may also regulate physiological cell functions. Targeted therapies have used the properties of leukemic cells to produce altered metabolic products when mutated. This is the case of IDH1/2 mutations generating the abnormal conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate (KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite inhibiting KG-dependent enzymes, such as the TET family of genes (pivotal in characterizing leukemia cells either by mutations, e.g., TET2, or by altered expression, e.g., TET1/2/3). Additional observations derive from the high sensitivity of leukemic cells to oxidative phosphorylation and its amelioration using BCL-2 inhibitors (Venetoclax) or by disrupting the mitochondrial respiration. More recently, nicotinamide metabolism has been described to mediate resistance to Venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential bioactivity of several actinobacteria isolates form Al-Jouf Desert, Saudi Arabia. Twenty-one actinobacterial isolates were tested for their antioxidant (flavonoids, phenolics, tocopherols and carotenoids) content, and biological activities, namely FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, SOS and XO inhibition, anti-hemolytic and anti-lipid peroxidation as well as their antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities. Accordingly, five isolates (i.e., Act 2, 12, 15, 19 and 21) were selected and their 90% ethanolic extracts were used. The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences indicated that the most active isolates belong to genus Streptomyces. The genus Streptomyces has been documented as a prolific producer of biologically active secondary metabolites against different cancer types. Thus, the anti-blood cancer activity and the possible molecular mechanisms by which several Streptomyces species extracts inhibited the growth of different leukemia cells, i.e., HL-60, K562 and THP-1, were investigated. In general, the five active isolates showed cytotoxic activity against the tested cell lines in a dose dependent manner. Among the potent isolates, isolate Act 12 significantly decreased the cell viability and showed maximum cytotoxic activities against both HL-60 and K562 cells, while isolate Act 15 exhibited maximum cytotoxic activity against THP-1 cells. Moreover, Act 2 and Act 12 reduced cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, which is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells and may represent a possible molecular mechanism underlying leukemia growth inhibition. The bioactive antioxidant extracts of the selected Streptomyces species inhibited leukemia cell growth by reducing the COX-2 and LOX activity. Overall, our study not only introduced a promising natural alternative source for anticancer agents, but it also sheds light on the mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of isolated actinomycetes.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2218-3947', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4025-8586', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9764-9006']",20210319,PMC8003550,['NOTNLM'],"['actinomycetes', 'anti-inflammatory', 'antioxidant', 'leukemia']",['G: 636- 140-1441/King Saud University'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein (P-gp, or MDR1) is an active pump responsible for the efflux of xenobiotics out of the cell, including anti-cancer drugs. It is a validated target against MDR. No crystal structure of the human P-gp is available to date, and only recently several cryo-EM structures have been solved. In this paper, we present a comprehensive computational approach that includes constructing the full-length three-dimensional structure of the human P-gp and its refinement using molecular dynamics. We assessed its flexibility and conformational diversity, compiling a dynamical ensemble that was used to dock a set of lignan compounds, previously reported as active P-gp inhibitors, and disclose their binding modes. Based on the statistical analysis of the docking results, we selected a system for performing the structure-based virtual screening of new potential P-gp inhibitors. We tested the method on a library of 87 natural flavonoids described in the literature, and 10 of those were experimentally assayed. The results reproduced the theoretical predictions only partially due to various possible factors.

The clinical value of MRD testing depends on the accuracy and reliability of results. Currently, there are no Canadian provincial or national guidelines for MRD testing in adult B-ALL, and consistent with the absence of such guidelines, there is no uniform Ontario MRD testing consensus. Moreover, there is great variability in Ontario in MRD testing with respect to where, when, and by which technique, MRD testing is performed, as well as in how the results are interpreted. To address these deficiencies, an expert multidisciplinary working group was convened to define consensus recommendations for improving the provision of such testing. The expert panel recommends that MRD testing should be implemented in a centralized manner to ensure expertise and accuracy in testing for this low volume indication, thereby to provide accurate, reliable results to clinicians and patients. All adult patients with B-ALL should receive MRD testing after induction chemotherapy. Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive patients should have ongoing monitoring of MRD during treatment and thereafter, while samples from Ph-negative B-ALL patients should be tested at least once later during treatment, ideally at 12 to 16 weeks after treatment initiation. In Ph-negative adult B-ALL patients, standardized, ideally centralized, protocols must be used for MRD testing, including both flow cytometry and immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement analysis. For Ph-positive B-ALL patients, MRD testing using a standardized protocol for reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for the BCR-ABL1 gene fusion transcript is recommended, with Ig/TCR gene rearrangement analysis done in parallel likely providing additional clinical information.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5350-8313', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4476-9722']",20210330,PMC8025812,['NOTNLM'],"['*adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*flow cytometry', '*measurable residual disease', '*minimal residual disease', '*next-generation sequencing', '*polymerase chain reaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Overall, 179 patients aged >/= 65 years were enrolled, 53% between 71 and 79 years old. Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) comorbidity score was >/=6 in 54% patients. Overall survival (OS) at 12 months was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90-97%); after a median follow up of 50 months, median OS was 84 months. The overall response rate was 87%, with 56% complete responses; the median time to progression (TTP) was 61 months. The baseline factors affecting OS by multivariable analysis were sex, histological diagnosis, renal function, and planned bendamustine dose, while only type of lymphoma and bendamustine dose impacted on TTP. Main adverse events were neutropenia (grade >/= 3: 43%) and infections (any grade: 36%), with 17% of patients requiring hospital admission.

Memory-like NK cells able to lyse autologous tumor cells can also be generated from patients with solid malignancies.

Increased expression and activity of CK2 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is associated with a poor outcome. CK2 promotes AML cell survival by impinging on multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. The selective small-molecule CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 has shown in vitro cytotoxicity in AML. Here, we report that CX-4945 has a strong in vivo therapeutic effect in preclinical models of AML. The analysis of genome-wide DNA-binding and gene expression in CX-4945 treated AML cells shows that one mechanism, by which CK2 inhibition exerts a therapeutic effect in AML, involves the revival of IKAROS tumor suppressor function. CK2 phosphorylates IKAROS and disrupts IKAROS' transcriptional activity by impairing DNA-binding and association with chromatin modifiers. Here, we demonstrate that CK2 inhibition decreases IKAROS phosphorylation and restores IKAROS binding to DNA. Further functional experiments show that IKAROS negatively regulates the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes, including BCL-XL (B cell Lymphoma like-2 like 1, BCL2L1). CX-4945 restitutes the IKAROS-mediated repression of BCL-XL in vivo and sensitizes AML cells to apoptosis.

However, CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors has not been successful clinically. Although, some research efforts, such as combining CARs with immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy, have been used to expand the application of CAR T cells for the treatment of solid tumors. Importantly, further understanding of the coordination of nutrient and energy supplies needed for CAR T cell expansion and function, especially in the tumor microenvironment (TME), is greatly needed. In addition to CAR T cells, there is great interest in utilizing other types of CAR immune cells, such as CAR NK and CAR macrophages that can infiltrate solid tumors. However, the metabolic competition in the TME between cancer cells and immune cells remains a challenge. Bioengineering technologies, such as metabolic engineering, can make a substantial contribution when developing CAR cells to have an ability to overcome nutrient-paucity in the solid TME.

Due to the sparse knowledge about their phenotype and its changes during cancer progression and treatment response, CTC isolation remains challenging. Here we focused on the mechanical characterization of circulating non-hematopoietic cells from breast cancer patients to evaluate its utility for CTC detection. For proof of premise, we used healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), human MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells and human HL-60 leukemia cells to create a CTC model system. For translational experiments CD45 negative cells-possible CTCs-were isolated from blood samples of patients with mamma carcinoma. Cells were mechanically characterized in the optical stretcher (OS). Active and passive cell mechanical data were related with physiological descriptors by a random forest (RF) classifier to identify cell type specific properties. Cancer cells were well distinguishable from PBMC in cell line tests. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that in PBMC the elliptic deformation was significantly increased compared to non-hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, non-hematopoietic cells showed significantly higher shape restoration. Based on Kelvin-Voigt modeling, the RF algorithm revealed that elliptic deformation and shape restoration were crucial parameters and that the OS discriminated non-hematopoietic cells from PBMC with an accuracy of 0.69, a sensitivity of 0.74, and specificity of 0.63. The CD45 negative cell population in the blood of breast cancer patients is mechanically distinguishable from healthy PBMC. Together with cell morphology, the mechanical fingerprint might be an appropriate tool for marker-free CTC detection.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4052-2490', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5474-051X']",20210305,PMC7961579,['NOTNLM'],"['CTCs', 'breast cancer', 'cell mechanics', 'circulating tumor cells', 'optical stretcher']",['ERC-741350/ERC_/European Research Council/International'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While classic anti-cancer chemotherapy is effective against the dividing progeny of CSCs, non-dividing or quiescent CSCs are often spared. Improved anti-cancer therapies therefore require approaches that target non-dividing CSCs, which must be underpinned by a better understanding of factors that permit these cells to maintain a stem cell-like state. During hematopoiesis, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) gamma is selectively expressed by stem cells and their immediate progeny. It is overexpressed in, and is an oncogene for, many cancers including colorectal, renal and hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinomas and some cases of acute myeloid leukemia that harbor RARgamma fusion proteins.

ALL and its treatment cause altered bone-mineral homeostasis, which can contribute to musculoskeletal late adverse effects (LAEs). With the increasing number of childhood cancer survivors, LAEs are reported often, and are aggravated by inactive lifestyles. A telerehabilitation program is proposed to strengthen the muscle-bone complex and prevent future impairment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore and better understand patient and parent experience of a telerehabilitation program after completion of ALL treatment. METHODS: ALL survivors (n = 12), 75% girls, 7.9 to 14.7 years old, within six months to five years of treatment, were recruited to participate in the proposed study, along with a parent. The 16-week group program included 40 potential home-based physical activities, with monthly progression, supervised by a kinesiologist, through an online telerehabilitation platform. Patients could be included in the study if they joined during the first month of intervention of their group (minimum 12 weeks of intervention). A semi-structured post-intervention interview was conducted with the patients and their parent during the final assessment, along with a review of the kinesiologist's clinical notes, to obtain a portrait of the participants' experience with the telerehabilitation program. Overarching themes were identified by one author and confirmed by two senior authors before extracting the various aspects of each theme. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients recruited, three were excluded from the analysis because they did not complete the minimum 12 weeks of intervention (one = relapse, one = failure to meet technical requirements, and one = abandoned due to parent's disinterest). The nine patients who completed the program (six girls; 10.93 +/- 2.83 years) had a mean adherence of 89%. The overarching themes identified were the program modalities (group approach with patient-parent paired training, supervised by a kinesiologist), the telerehabilitation system, the participants' perception of the benefits, and recommendations and suggestions from the families. Both patients and parents expressed very high satisfaction with the program and perceived benefits. CONCLUSION: Participants appreciated the program and reported they would all recommend it to other families in similar situations. The telerehabilitation method of service delivery was perceived by some as decisive in choosing to participate, while the supervision and intra- and inter-family interactions were the motivating factors that were key to program adherence.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1096-050X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7672-8477', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6872-6607']",20210331,PMC8037042,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*exercise therapy', '*intervention study', '*patient perspective', '*rehabilitation', '*telehealth']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity of shikonin derivatives was measured by an MTT test. Cell death, proliferation, cell cycle, and expression of molecules that control these processes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of STAT3-regulated genes was analyzed by real-time q-RT-PCR (Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction). The antitumor effects of shikonin derivatives in vivo were analyzed, using flow cytometry, by detection of leukemia cells in the peripheral blood and spleens of mice intravenously injected with BCL1 cells. The two most potent derivatives, isobutyrylshikonin (IBS) and alpha-methylbutyrylshikonin (MBS), induced cell cycle disturbances and apoptosis, inhibited proliferation, and decreased expression of phospho-STAT3 and downstream-regulated molecules in BCL1 and JVM-13 cells. IBS and MBS decreased the percentage of leukemia cells in vivo. The link between the decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 by MBS and IBS and BCL1 cell death was confirmed by detection of enhanced cell death after addition of AG490, an inhibitor of Jak2 kinase.

ROS homeostasis relies on a tightly-regulated balance between the antioxidant and oxidant systems. Among the oxidants, NADPH oxidases (NOX) generate ROS as a physiological function. Although it has been reported in AML initiation and development, the contribution of NOX to the ROS production in AML remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the NOX expression and function in AML, and to examine the role of NOX in blast proliferation and differentiation. First, we interrogated the NOX expression in primary cells from public datasets, and investigated their association with prognostic markers. Next, we explored the NOX expression and activity in AML cell lines, and studied the impact of NOX knockdown on cell proliferation and differentiation. We found that NOX2 is ubiquitously expressed in AML blasts, and particularly in cells from the myelomonocytic (M4) and monocytic (M5) stages; however, it is less expressed in LSCs and in relapsed AML. This is consistent with an increased expression throughout normal hematopoietic differentiation, and is reflected in AML cell lines. Nevertheless, no endogenous NOX activity could be detected in the absence of PMA stimulation. Furthermore, CYBB knockdown, although hampering induced NOX2 activity, did not affect the proliferation and differentiation of THP-1 and HL-60 cells. In summary, our data suggest that NOX2 is a marker of AML blast differentiation, while AML cell lines lack any NOX2 endogenous activity.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0270-8195', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4466-4880', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6047-1718', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9887-072X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7419-1124', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6984-7096']",20210323,PMC8004739,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'NADPH oxidase', 'leukemia', 'transcriptomics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its applications are various, such as for the treatment of chronic lymphoid leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in oncology, and it can also be used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Several studies support the interest in therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize dosing regimens of rituximab. Thus, two different laboratories have developed accurate and reproductive methods to quantify rituximab in human plasma: one using liquid chromatography quadripolar tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) and the other, liquid chromatography orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/HRMS). For both assays, quantification was based on albumin depletion or IgG-immunocapture, surrogate peptide analysis, and full-length stable isotope-labeled rituximab. With LC-MS/MS, the concentration range was from 5 to 500 microg/mL, the within- and between-run precisions were <8.5%, and the limit of quantitation was 5 microg/mL. With LC-MS/HRMS, the concentration range was from 10 to 200 microg/mL, the within- and between-run accuracy were <11.5%, and the limit of quantitation was 2 microg/mL.

Numerous factors such as DNA damage repair, cell death inhibition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and evasion of apoptosis have all been implicated in the promotion of chemoresistance. The receptor tyrosine kinase Axl, a member of the TAM family (which includes TYRO3 and MER), plays an important role in the regulation of cellular processes such as proliferation, motility, survival, and immunologic response. The overexpression of Axl is reported in several solid and hematological malignancies, including non-small cell lung, prostate, breast, liver and gastric cancers, and acute myeloid leukaemia. The overexpression of Axl is associated with poor prognosis and the development of resistance to therapy. Reports show that Axl overexpression confers drug resistance in lung cancer and advances the emergence of tolerant cells. Axl is, therefore, an important candidate as a prognostic biomarker and target for anticancer therapies. In this review, we discuss the consequence of Axl upregulation in cancers, provide evidence for its role in cancer progression and the development of drug resistance.

An HL60 cell is initially encapsulated in a viscoelastic shell fluid. As the cell-laden droplet moves through the sudden contraction, shear stresses are experienced around the cell. These stresses along with the interfacial force and geometrical effects cause mechanical deformation which may result in cell death. A parametric study is done to investigate the effects of shell fluid relaxation time, encapsulating droplet size and contraction geometries on cell mechanical deformation. It is found that a large encapsulating droplet with a high relaxation time will undergo low cell mechanical deformation.

One common group of blood cancers is the B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), which can be categorized according to the proliferation and spread rate of cancer cells into indolent and aggressive ones. The most frequent indolent B-cell NHLs are follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can greatly influence protein expression. Based on the multiple interactions among miRNAs and their targets, complex networks of gene expression regulation emerge, which normally are essential for proper B-cell development. Multiple miRNAs have been associated with B-cell lymphomas, as the deregulation of these complex networks can lead to such pathological states. The aim of the present review is to summarize the existing information regarding the multifaceted role of miRNAs in indolent B-cell NHLs, affecting the main B-cell subpopulations. We attempt to provide insight into their biological function, the complex miRNA-mRNA interactions, and their biomarker utility in these malignancies.

The proteins were derived from various cellular compartments (e.g., cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasms), several organelles (e.g., cytoskeleton, endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria) and had various functions (e.g., extracellular matrix and exosomal proteins, cytokines, soluble adhesion molecules, protein synthesis, post-transcriptional modulation, RNA binding, and ribonuclear proteins). Thus, AML patients were very heterogeneous both regarding the number of proteins and the nature of their extracellularly released proteins. The protein release profiles of MSCs and primary AML cells show a considerable overlap, but a minority of the proteins are released only or mainly by the MSC, including several extracellular matrix molecules. Taken together, our observations suggest that the protein profile of the extracellular bone marrow microenvironment differs between AML patients, these differences are mainly caused by the protein release by the leukemic cells but this leukemia-associated heterogeneity of the overall extracellular protein profile is modulated by the constitutive protein release by normal MSCs.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059'],20210325,PMC8037744,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'conditioned medium', 'extracellular protein release', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'patient heterogeneity', 'protein', 'proteomics']","['100933/Kreftforeningen', '182609/Kreftforeningen']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They may derive from the clonal evolution of the hemopoietic stem cell compartment or from the transformation of progenitors with immune potential. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanovesicles which are released by cells into body fluids with a role in intercellular communication in physiology and pathology, including cancer. EV cargos are enriched in nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, and these molecules can be delivered to target cells to influence their biological properties and modify surrounding or distant targets. In this review, we will describe the ""smart strategy"" on how blood cancer-derived EVs modulate tumor cell development and maintenance. Moreover, we will also depict the function of microenvironment-derived EVs in blood cancers and discuss how the interplay between tumor and microenvironment affects blood cancer cell growth and spreading, immune response, angiogenesis, thrombogenicity, and drug resistance. The potential of EVs as non-invasive biomarkers will be also discussed. Lastly, we discuss the clinical application viewpoint of EVs in blood cancers.

The main complications in MPNs are high risk of thrombosis and progression to myelofibrosis and leukemia. MPN patients with high risk scores are treated by hydroxyurea (HU), interferon-alpha, or ruxolitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Polycythemia vera (PV) is an MPN characterized by overproduction of red blood cells (RBCs). ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily transporters known to play a crucial role in multidrug resistance development. Proteome analysis showed higher ABCG2 levels in PV RBCs compared to RBCs from healthy controls and an additional increase of these levels in PV patients treated with HU, suggesting that ABCG2 might play a role in multidrug resistance in MPNs. In this work, we explored the role of ABCG2 in the transport of ruxolitinib and HU using human cell lines, RBCs, and in vitro differentiated erythroid progenitors. Using stopped-flow analysis, we showed that HU is not a substrate for ABCG2. Using transfected K562 cells expressing three different levels of recombinant ABCG2, MPN RBCs, and cultured erythroblasts, we showed that ABCG2 potentiates ruxolitinib-induced cytotoxicity that was blocked by the ABCG2-specific inhibitor KO143 suggesting ruxolitinib intracellular import by ABCG2. In silico modeling analysis identified possible ruxolitinib-binding site locations within the cavities of ABCG2.

Supported by promising early clinical experiences, CAR modified natural killer (CAR-NK) cell therapies represent a complementary and potentially off-the-shelf, allogeneic solution. While acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents an intuitive disease in which to investigate CAR based immunotherapies, key biological differences to B-cell malignancies have complicated progress to date. As CAR-T cell trials treating AML are growing in number, several CAR-NK cell approaches are also in development. In this review we explore why CAR-NK cell therapies may be particularly suited to the treatment of AML. First, we examine the established role NK cells play in AML biology and the existing anti-leukemic activity of NK cell adoptive transfer. Next, we appraise potential AML target antigens and consider common and unique challenges posed relative to treating B-cell malignancies. We summarize the current landscape of CAR-NK development in AML, and potential targets to augment CAR-NK cell therapies pharmacologically and through genetic engineering. Finally, we consider the broader landscape of competing immunotherapeutic approaches to AML treatment. In doing so we evaluate the innate potential, status and remaining barriers for CAR-NK based AML immunotherapy.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6173-7140'],20210329,PMC8036691,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-NK', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunotherapy']","['203930/B/16/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '203930/B/16/Z/HRBI_/Health Research Board/Ireland', 'Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (Ireland)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the effect of kaempferol and its derivatives on cytotoxicity, DNA damage, apoptosis, cell cycle progression and free radicals induced by etoposide. We demonstrated that kaempferol increases the sensitivity of HL-60 cells to etoposide but does not affect apoptosis induced by this drug. Kaempferol also reduces the level of free radicals generated by etoposide. Unlike kaempferol, some of its derivatives reduce the apoptosis of HL-60 cells (P2 and P7) and increase the level of free radicals (P2 and P5) induced by etoposide. Our results indicate that kaempferol and its glycoside derivatives can modulate the activity of etoposide in HL-60 cells and affect its antitumor efficacy in this way.

The aim of the study was to examine the diagnostic significance of antibodies against promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML NB) components such as Sp100, Sp140, and PML in a cohort of PBC patients and compare the results with biochemical and histological parameters. Serum samples were collected from 93 PBC patients. Anti-Sp100 and anti-PML antibodies were assessed using commercially available kits, anti-Sp140 using developed ""in-house"" ELISA test. Anti-Sp140, anti-Sp100, and anti-PML antibodies were present in 25 (27%), 37 (40%), and 29 (31%) PBC patients, respectively. Anti-PML NB positive patients also showed increased concentration of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05). In the group with the presence of at least two types of these antibodies, more frequent deaths or transplantations were observed. A correlation between the presence of antibodies and histological grade (OR = 2.55 p = 0.039) was established.

In this study, the immunomodulatory, cytotoxic effect and antioxidant activity of the sulfated polysaccharides (PcSPs) were determinate. The PcSPs were precipitated with 2% Cetylpyridinium bromide hydrate and ethanol and purified by dialysis. The extract was lyophilized for its characterization by Fourier transform-Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antioxidant activity of PcSPs were examined with assay 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and compared with that of the biomass, observing significant differences between the results obtained from the PcSPs and biomass. To determine their ability to induce cytokine production Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukina-6 (IL-6), the immunomodulatory activity of the PcSPs has been evaluated. In the mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7), PcSPs are potent inducers of IL-6 cytokines but mainly of TNF-alpha. The cytotoxic capacity of PcSPs was measured by the MTT colorimetric assay in colorectal carcinoma (HTC-116), human leukemia (U-937 and HL-60), breast cancer (MCF-7), lung cancer (NCI-H460) and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) cell lines. The IC50 value of 2311.20 microg mL(-1), 1676.74 microg mL(-1), 1089.63 microg mL(-1), 5498.14 microg mL(-1) and 2861.49 microg mL(-1) respectively in the tumor lines and 5022.55 microg mL(-1) in gingival fibroblasts were obtained. Our study suggested that PcSPs from P. cruentum have a moderate immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effect. The results obtained indicate that the polysaccharides from P. cruentum are potent inducers of IL-6 cytokines and, most importantly, of TNF-alpha. PcSPs showed no evidence of antigenic activity or hypersensitivity when administered intraperitoneally in mice. Furthermore, the in vivo study revealed an improvement of local inflammatory response against stress in the peritoneum. These findings suggest that the PcSPs from P. cruentum might have potential as a valuable ingredient in nutraceutical products.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2170-6323', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9868-015X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9158-1861', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8562-3842']",20210324,PMC8063939,['NOTNLM'],"['*Porphyridium cruentum', '*antioxidant capacity', '*immunomodulation', '*sulfated polysaccharides']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initialization of different tumors and their maintenance are caused by the deregulation of different signaling pathways and cancer stem cell maintenance. Quiescent stem cells are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic treatments and, consequently, are responsible for disease relapse. In this review we focus on the conserved Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway which is involved in regulating the cell cycle of hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells. Thus, we examine the role of the Hh signaling pathway in normal and leukemic stem cells and dissect its role in acute myeloid leukemia. We explain not only the connection between illness and the signaling pathway but also evaluate innovative therapeutic approaches that could affect the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. We found that many aspects of the Hedgehog signaling pathway remain unknown. The role of Hh has only been proven in embryo and hematopoietic stem cell development. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of GLI transcription factors for therapeutic targeting.

In September 2014, based on the KEYNOTE-001 study, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, for advanced or unresectable melanoma. Up until now, seven PD-1/PD-ligand(L)-1 inhibitors are approved in various solid cancers and hundreds of clinical studies are currently ongoing. In hematology, PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) classic Hodgkin lymphoma, and later pembrolizumab was approved for R/R primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the combination of hypomethylating agents and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has shown promising results, worth of further investigation, while other combinations or single agent therapy have disappointing results. On the other hand, rather than in first line, these therapies could be useful in the consolidation or maintenance setting, for achieving minimal residual disease negativity. Furthermore, an interesting application could be the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation relapse. There are several reasons why checkpoint inhibitors are not very effective in treating AML, including the characteristics of the disease (systemic, rapidly progressive, and high tumor burden disease), low mutational burden, and dysregulation of the immune system.

Treatment of relapsed and refractory AML, despite the current overall success rates in management of pediatric AML, remains a challenge with limited options considering the heavy but unsuccessful pretreatments in these patients. For relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following ablative chemotherapy presents the only opportunity to cure AML. Even though in some cases immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect has been proven to efficiently eradicate leukemic blasts, the immune- and chemotherapy-related toxicities and adverse effects considerably restrict the feasibility and therapeutic power. Thus, immunotherapy presents a potent tool against acute leukemia but needs to be engineered to function more specifically and with decreased toxicity. To identify innovative immunotherapeutic approaches, sound knowledge concerning immune-evasive strategies of AML blasts and the clinical impact of an immune-privileged microenvironment is indispensable. Based on our knowledge to date, several promising immunotherapies are under clinical evaluation and further innovative approaches are on their way.

Results: Seventeen of 68 retrieved articles were included in the review reporting data on 96 patients (mean age 51.8 years, 57 males and 38 females). Most cases were disseminated (86) with a 60.2% mortality rate. Ninety-five were hematological patients, with AML being the most common (57 cases). Conclusions:S. clavata infection in immunosuppressed patients has a poor prognosis: middle-age patients, male gender and Acute Myeloid Leukemia should be considered risk factors. In immunosuppressed patients, the clinical presentation can be particularly unusual, imposing difficult differential diagnosis, as in the reported case.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4663-9734', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4773-6694']",20210301,PMC7957747,['NOTNLM'],"['*Geotrichum clavatum', '*Saprochaete clavata', '*rare mycoses']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BLV proviral load (PVL) represents the quantity of BLV genome that has integrated into the host's genome in BLV-infected cells. Bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) class II allelic polymorphisms are associated with PVLs in BLV-infected cattle. We sought to identify relationships between BoLA-DRB3 allelic heterozygosity and BLV PVLs among different cattle breeds. Blood samples from 598 BLV-infected cattle were quantified to determine their PVLs by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results were confirmed by a BLV-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction identified 22 BoLA-DRB3 alleles. Multivariate negative binomial regression modeling was used to test for associations between BLV PVLs and BoLA-DRB3 alleles. BoLA-DRB3.2*3, *7, *8, *11, *22, *24, and *28 alleles were significantly associated with low PVLs. BoLA-DRB3.2*10 was significantly associated with high PVLs. Some heterozygous allele combinations were associated with low PVLs (*3/*28, *7/*8, *8/*11, *10/*11, and *11/*16); others were associated with high PVLs (*1/*41, *10/*16, *10/*41, *16/*27, and *22/*27).

BuV has been associated with diarrhea and CuV with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, but there are hardly any data for TuV or CuV in stool or respiratory samples. Hence, using qPCR and IgG enzyme immunoassays, we analyzed 1072 stool, 316 respiratory and 445 serum or plasma samples from 1098 patients with and without gastroenteritis (GE) or respiratory-tract infections (RTI) from Finland, Latvia and Malawi. The overall CuV-DNA prevalences in stool samples ranged between 0-6.1% among our six patient cohorts. In Finland, CuV DNA was significantly more prevalent in GE patients above rather than below 60 years of age (5.1% vs 0.2%). CuV DNA was more prevalent in stools among Latvian and Malawian children compared with Finnish children. In 10/11 CuV DNA-positive adults and 4/6 CuV DNA-positive children with GE, no known causal pathogens were detected.

It is postulated that this results from a saponin-mediated increase in the endolysosomal escape of the toxin to the cytosol, but this remains to be confirmed. To address this issue, we used a number of pharmacological inhibitors of endocytic processes as probes to investigate the role played by saponin in the endolysosomal escape of fluorescently labeled saporin and a saporin based immunotoxin targeted against CD38 on human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Endolysosomal escape of the toxin was measured by flow cytometric pulse shape analysis. These results were compared to the effects of the various inhibitors on the saponin-mediated augmentation of toxin and immunotoxin cytotoxicity. Inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, micropinocytosis, and endosomal acidification abrogated the saponin-induced increase in the endolysosomal escape of the toxin into the cytosol, suggesting that these processes may be involved in the internalization of saponin to the same endolysosomal vesicle as the toxin. Alternatively, these processes may play a direct role in the mechanism by which saponin promotes toxin escape from the endolysosomal compartment to the cytosol. Correlation with the effects of these inhibitors on the augmentation of cytotoxicity provides additional evidence that endolysosomal escape is involved in driving augmentation.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2413-6717', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7145-4737']",20210315,PMC8000476,['NOTNLM'],"['augmentation', 'endocytosis', 'immunotoxin', 'saponin', 'saporin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of different TKIs revolutionized treatment outcome in CML patients, but CML LSCs seem insensitive to TKIs and are detectable in newly diagnosed and resistant CML patients and in patients who discontinued therapy. It has been reported that CML LSCs aberrantly express some CD markers such as CD26 that can be used for the diagnosis and for targeting. In this study, we confirmed the presence of CD26+ CML LSCs in newly diagnosed and resistant CML patients. To selectively target CML LSCs/progenitor cells that express CD26 and to spare normal HSCs/progenitor cells, we designed a venetoclax-loaded immunoliposome (IL-VX). Our results showed that by using this system we could selectively target CD26+ cells while sparing CD26- cells. The efficiency of venetoclax in targeting CML LSCs has been reported and our system demonstrated a higher potency in cell death induction in comparison to free venetoclax.

However, 6-MP has a narrow therapeutic index, which causes dose-limiting toxicities in hematopoietic tissues. Recent studies reported several candidate pharmacogenetic markers such as TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, and APEX1, which predict the possibility of 6-MP related toxicities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of major variants of these genes on 6-MP intolerances and toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. A total of 83 pediatric ALL patients were included (56 males and 27 females). The NUDT15 c.415C>T (rs116855232), NUDT15 c.55_56insGAGTCG (rs746071566), ITPA c.94C>A (rs1127354), ITPA c.IVS2+21A>C (rs7270101), APEX c.190A>G (rs2307486), and TPMT variants were analyzed by sanger sequencing. Correlations between indexes of 6-MP-related toxicities or 6-MP intolerance (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] at several time point, days of ANC < 1 x 10(3)/mm(3), days of ANC < 0.5 x 10(3)/mm(3), frequency of febrile neutropenia, maximum AST and ALT, 6-MP dose and 6-MP dose intensity during maintenance therapy) and genetic variations were analyzed. The NUDT15 c.415C>T allele carrier showed significantly low 6-MP doses at the final maintenance therapy period than the wild type carrier (p = 0.007). The 6-MP dose intensities at the sixth and final maintenance period were also significantly low in NUDT15 c.415C>T carriers (p = 0.003 and 0.008, respectively). However, indexes for neutropenia, days of febrile neutropenia, maximum AST, and ALT levels were not associated with the presence of c.415C>T as well as other analyzed variants. When analyzing the effect of the coexistence of NUDT15 c.415C>T and ITPA c.94C>A, no significant differences were found between the NUDT15 c.415C>T carrier and carrier with both variations. The NUDT15 c.415C>T was the most useful marker to predict 6-MP intolerance among analyzed variants in our study population. Although we could not find association of those variants with 6-MP induced toxicities and the synergistic effects of those variants, a well-planed larger scale study would be helpful in clarifying new candidates and their clinical effects.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6822-1051'],20210315,PMC7998516,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'APEX', 'ITPA', 'NUDT15', 'TPMT', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A genetic signature has been associated with this outcome but, remarkably, leukemogenesis is commonly triggered by genetic alterations of embryonic origin that involve the deregulation of chromatin remodelers. This review considers in depth how the alteration of epigenetic profiles (at DNA and histone levels) induces an aberrant phenotype in B lymphocyte progenitors by modulating the oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors involved in key cancer hallmarks. DNA methylation patterns have been widely studied in BCP-ALL and their correlation with survival has been established. However, the effect of methylation on histone residues can be very different. For instance, methyltransferase KMT2A gene participates in chromosomal rearrangements with several partners, imposing an altered pattern of methylated H3K4 and H3K79 residues, enhancing oncogene promoter activation, and conferring a worse outcome on affected infants. In parallel, acetylation processes provide an additional layer of epigenetic regulation and can alter the chromatin conformation, enabling the binding of regulatory factors. Therefore, an integrated knowledge of all epigenetic disorders is essential to understand the molecular basis of BCP-ALL and to identify novel entry points that can be exploited to improve therapeutic options and disease prognosis.",,,20210318,PMC8003172,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocytes', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'epigenetics']","['SAF2017-87990-R/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion', 'EUR2019-103835/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion', 'FJCI-2017-32430/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion', 'POSTD20024DEBA/Fundacion Cientifica Asociacion Espanola Contra el Cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: to identify effective PIM1 kinase inhibitors, structure-based virtual screening of natural products of plant origin and de novo design were carried out using the protein-ligand binding free energy function improved by introducing an adequate dehydration energy term. RESULTS: as a consequence of subsequent enzyme inhibition assays, four classes of PIM1 kinase inhibitors were discovered, with the biochemical potency ranging from low-micromolar to sub-micromolar levels. The results of extensive docking simulations showed that the inhibitory activity stemmed from the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds in combination with hydrophobic interactions in the ATP-binding site. Optimization of the biochemical potency by chemical modifications of the 2-benzylidenebenzofuran-3(2H)-one scaffold led to the discovery of several nanomolar inhibitors with antiproliferative activities against human breast cancer cell lines.

While the incidence of PFGs characteristic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was relatively well examined by several research groups and estimated to be 1-5% in umbilical cord blood (UCB) of healthy newborns, PFGs that are relevant to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were poorly investigated. Therefore, this study is focused on the estimation of the incidence of the most frequent AML PFGs in newborns. For the first time, this study considered the inducibility of AML PFGs in different subsets of UCB HSPCs by low-dose gamma-rays and also compared endogenous DNA damage, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level between UCB samples containing or lacking AML PFGs. We found that: (i) the incidence of AML PFGs in UCB was 3.19% for RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 3.19% for PML-RARalpha, and 1.17% for KMT2A-MLLT3, (ii) 50 cGy of gamma-rays did not induce RUNX1-RUNX1T1, PML-RARalpha, or KMT2A-MLLT3 PFGs in different subsets of sorted and expanded HSPCs, and (iii) the AML PFG(+) samples accumulated the same level of endogenous DNA damage, as measured by the gammaH2AX/53BP1 focus formation, and also the same ROS level, and apoptosis as compared to PFG(-) controls.

Apoptosis helps to clean the unnecessary cells and has critical physiological significance. Altered apoptosis results in a disorder of cell death and is associated with many diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. Here, we reported that the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 17 (ASB17) was mainly expressed in the testis and promoted apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Analyzing ASB17-deficient mice generated by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we demonstrated that ASB17 deficiency resulted in the reduction of apoptosis in spermatogenic cells, but it did not affect the development of spermatozoa or normal fertility. Next, in an in vivo model, ASB17 deficiency prevented the apoptosis of spermatogonia induced by etoposide in male mice. We noted that ASB17 promoted apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, ASB17 interacted with the members of the BCL2 family, including BCL2, BCLX, BCLW, and MCL1.

We herein, characterize the effect of MK-2206 on B-ALL cell lines and primary samples and investigate potential synergistic effects with BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax to overcome limitations in apoptosis induction. MK-2206 incubation reduced AKT phosphorylation and influenced downstream signaling activity. Interestingly, after MK-2206 mono application tumor cell proliferation and metabolic activity were diminished significantly independently of basal AKT phosphorylation. Morphological changes but no induction of apoptosis was detected in the observed cell lines. In contrast, primary samples cultivated in a protective microenvironment showed a decrease in vital cells. Combined MK-2206 and venetoclax incubation resulted in partially synergistic anti-proliferative effects independently of application sequence in SEM and RS4;11 cell lines. Venetoclax-mediated apoptosis was not intensified by addition of MK-2206. Functional assessment of BCL-2 inhibition via Bax translocation assay revealed slightly increased pro-apoptotic signaling after combined MK-2206 and venetoclax incubation.

Current treatments for leukaemia are associated with serious side-effects. Plant-derived polyphenols have been identified as potent anti-cancer agents and have been shown to work synergistically with standard chemotherapy agents in leukaemia cell lines. Polyphenols have multiple mechanisms of action and have been reported to decrease cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle and induce apoptosis via the activation of caspase (3, 8 and 9); the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c. Polyphenols have been shown to suppress activation of transcription factors, including NF-kB and STAT3. Furthermore, polyphenols have pro-oxidant properties, with increasing evidence that polyphenols inhibit the antioxidant activity of glutathione, causing oxidative DNA damage. Polyphenols also induce autophagy-driven cancer cell death and regulate multidrug resistance proteins, and thus may be able to reverse resistance to chemotherapy agents. This review examines the molecular mechanism of action of polyphenols and discusses their potential therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss the pharmacological properties of polyphenols, including their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-tumour activities, and suggest that polyphenols are potent natural agents that can be useful therapeutically; and discuss why data on bioavailability, toxicity and metabolism are essential to evaluate their clinical use.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8617-2636'],20210317,PMC8002821,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'cell cycle', 'glutathione', 'leukaemia', 'multi-drug resistance', 'polyphenols', 'reactive oxygen species']","['J567/Libyan Ministry of Higher Education-National Medical Research Centre (NMRC),', 'Libya.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated if a MRD-driven transplant policy improved outcome as compared to a policy solely relying on a familiar donor availability. High-risk patients (adverse karyotype, FLT3-ITD) received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) whereas for intermediate and low risk ones (CBF-AML and NPM1-mutated), alloHCT or autologous SCT was delivered depending on the post-consolidation measurable residual disease (MRD) status, as assessed by flow cytometry. For comparison, we analyzed a matched historical cohort of patients in whom alloHCT was delivered based on the sole availability of a matched sibling donor. Ten-years overall and disease-free survival were longer in the MRD-driven cohort as compared to the historical cohort (47.7% vs. 28.7%, p = 0.012 and 42.0% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.0003). The favorable impact of this MRD-driven strategy was evident for the intermediate-risk category, particularly for MRD positive patients. In the low-risk category, the significantly lower CIR of the MRD-driven cohort did not translate into a survival advantage.

A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify relevant clinical intervention studies conducted through August 2020. Fifty-seven unique cancer trials, assessing EPA and/or DHA supplementation pre- or post-treatment, concomitant with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, or in palliative therapy were included. Breast, head and neck, gastrointestinal, gastric, colorectal/rectal, esophageal, leukemia/lymphoma, lung, multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancers were investigated.

With drug combination screenings, we found that the triple combination of the protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT), and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) is effective in inducing apoptosis in TNBC cells. A set of PKIs were first screened in combination with gefitinib in the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. The AKT inhibitor, AT7867, was identified and further analyzed in two mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtype TNBC cells, MDA-MB-231 and HS578T. A combination of gefitinib and AT7867 reduced the proliferation and long-term survival of MSL TNBC cells. However, gefitinib and AT7867 induced the activation of the rat sarcoma (RAS)/ v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (RAF)/MEK/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. To inhibit this pathway, MEK/ERK inhibitors were further screened in MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of gefitinib and AT7867. As a result, we identified that the MEK inhibitor, PD-0325901, further enhanced the anti-proliferative and anti-clonogenic effects of gefitinib and AT7867 by inducing apoptosis. Our results suggest that the dual inhibition of the AKT and MEK pathways is a novel potential therapeutic strategy for targeting EGFR in TNBC cells.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2117-5219', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6895-0465', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4422-6266']",20210310,PMC8000364,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'EGFR resistance', 'MEK', 'anti-cancer', 'combination', 'protein kinase inhibitor (PKI)', 'synergism', 'triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)']","['NRF-2015R1D1A1A01057893/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'NRF-2019R1A4A1028268/National Research Foundation of Korea']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As myeloid leukemia cells modify their bone marrow microenvironment, they lead to dysfunction of cytotoxic cells, such as CD8+ T cells or NK cells, simultaneously promoting development of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and suppressive myeloid cells. This facilitates disease progression, spreading of leukemic blasts outside the bone marrow niche and therapy resistance. The following review focuses on main immunosuppressive features of myeloid leukemias. Firstly, factors derived directly from leukemic cells - inhibitory receptors, soluble factors and extracellular vesicles, are described.

TAM receptor activation is induced upon binding of the ligands protein S (Pros1) or growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) which act as bridging molecules for binding of phosphatidyl serine (PtdSer) exposed on apoptotic cell membranes. Upon clearance of apoptotic cell material, TAM receptor activation on innate cells suppresses proinflammatory functions, thereby ensuring the immunologically silent removal of apoptotic material in the absence of deleterious immune responses. However, in T cells, MerTK signaling is costimulatory and promotes activation and functional output of the cell. MerTK and Axl are also aberrantly expressed in a range of both hematological and solid tumor malignancies, including breast, lung, melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia, where they have a role in oncogenic signaling. Consequently, TAM receptors are being investigated as therapeutic targets using small molecule inhibitors and have already demonstrated efficacy in mouse tumor models. Thus, inhibition of TAM signaling in cancer cells could have therapeutic value but given the opposing roles of TAM signaling in innate cells and T cells, TAM inhibition could also jeopardize anticancer immune responses. This conflict is discussed in this review, describing the effects of TAM inhibition on cancer cells as well as immune cells, while also examining the intricate interplay of cancer and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2466-9625', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7106-7216', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0590-7560']",20210310,PMC7998716,['NOTNLM'],"['Axl', 'MerTK', 'PD-1', 'TAM receptors', 'cancer', 'small molecule inhibitors']","['DFF-1331-00095B/Danish Council for independent research', 'R72-A4396-13-S2/Danish Cancer Society']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One method used to analyze exposure to multiple chemical exposures is weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression. While WQS regression has been demonstrated to have good sensitivity and specificity when identifying important exposures, it has limitations including a two-step model fitting process that decreases power and model stability and a requirement that all exposures in the weighted index have associations in the same direction with the outcome, which is not realistic when chemicals in different classes have different directions and magnitude of association with a health outcome. Grouped WQS (GWQS) was proposed to allow for multiple groups of chemicals in the model where different magnitude and direction of associations are possible for each group. However, GWQS shares the limitation of WQS of a two-step estimation process and splitting of data into training and validation sets. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian group index model to avoid the estimation limitation of GWQS while having multiple exposure indices in the model. To evaluate the performance of the Bayesian group index model, we conducted a simulation study with several different exposure scenarios. We also applied the Bayesian group index method to analyze childhood leukemia risk in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS). The results showed that the Bayesian group index model had slightly better power for exposure effects and specificity and sensitivity in identifying important chemical exposure components compared with the existing frequentist method, particularly for small sample sizes. In the application to the CCLS, we found a significant negative association for insecticides, with the most important chemical being carbaryl. In addition, for children who were born and raised in the home where dust samples were taken, there was a significant positive association for herbicides with dacthal being the most important exposure. In conclusion, our approach of the Bayesian group index model appears able to make a substantial contribution to the field of environmental epidemiology.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7387-1016', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7584-8856', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3467-4145']",20210327,PMC8037139,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*chemical mixtures', '*environment', '*mixture analysis']","['R21CA238370/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MYC overexpression is a hallmark of malignant growth, inducing self-renewal of stem cells and blocking senescence and cell differentiation. This review summarizes the latest advances in our understanding of MYC-mediated molecular mechanisms responsible for its oncogenic activity. Several recent findings indicate that MYC is a regulator of cancer genome and epigenome: MYC modulates expression of target genes in a site-specific manner, by recruiting chromatin remodeling co-factors at promoter regions, and at genome-wide level, by regulating the expression of several epigenetic modifiers that alter the entire chromatin structure.

However, substantial response rates have only been observed in specific subsets of patients since pre-existing factors determine the susceptibility of a tumor to these therapies. The development of approaches that can actively induce an anti-tumor immune response, such as adoptive cell transfer and oncolytic virotherapy, have shown clinical success in the treatment of leukemia and melanoma, respectively. Based on the immune-stimulatory capacity of oncolytic VSV-NDV virotherapy, we envisioned a combination approach to synergize with adoptive T cell transfer, in order to enhance tumor cell killing. Using the immune-competent B16 melanoma model, we demonstrate that combination treatment has beneficial effects on the suppressive microenvironment through upregulation of MHC-I and maintaining low expression levels of PD-L1 on tumor cells. The approach led to additive cytotoxic effects and improved the recruitment of T cells to virus-infected tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.

Moreover, biologic effects of S100A8/9 via both TLR4 and RAGE on hematopoietic stem cells contribute to the selection and expansion of leukemic clones by excretion of proinflammatory cytokines and/or immune regulation.

Since natural products with apoptosis-inducing ability can be promising anti-cancer agents, in this study, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of HOEA on U937 cells focusing on apoptosis induction. HOEA showed much stronger cytotoxic and cytolytic effects on U937 cells than elaidic acid, which has similar structure but no 12-hydroxy group, suggesting that hydroxy group is important for the cytotoxicity of HOEA. HOEA induced apoptotic nuclear morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, time-dependent increase in annexin V+/PI+ cell population in HOEA-treated U937 cells was detected. Among the apoptosis-related reagents, caspase-family inhibitor almost completely inhibited HOEA-induced DNA fragmentation. In the analyses using specific caspase-substrates, extremely high cleavage activity toward caspase-3/7/8 substrate was observed in HOEA-treated U937 cells, and weak activities of caspase-1 and -3 were detected. Analyses using specific caspase inhibitors suggested that caspase-3 and caspase-8 might be predominantly responsible for the cleavage activity. Activation of these caspases were also confirmed by western blotting in which significant levels of cleaved forms of caspase 3, caspase 8, and PARP were detected in HOEA-treated U937 cells. Our results suggest that HOEA is capable of inducing apoptosis in U937 cells in which caspase-3 and caspase-8 might play important roles. Since the cytotoxic effect of HOEA is not strictly specific to tumor cells, development of appropriate drug delivery system for selective tumor targeting is necessary for the clinical applications to reduce the possible side effects.",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3124-5206'],20210302,PMC8001238,['NOTNLM'],"['C18 hydroxy unsaturated fatty acid', 'Tricleocarpa jejuensis', 'U937 cells', 'apoptosis', 'caspases', 'red alga']","['18K05823/Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education,', 'Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OM is accompanied by complex and diverse interactions among bacteria, viruses, inflammatory cells, immune cells, and epithelial cells. The present study summarizes the antibodies that contribute to immune reactions in all types of otitis media, including acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, as well as the transcription factors that induce the production of these antibodies. The types and distribution of B cells; the functions of B cells, especially in otorhinolaryngology; antibody formation in patients with otitis media; and antibodies and related transcription factors are described. B cells have important functions in host defenses, including antigen recognition, antigen presentation, antibody production, and immunomodulation. The phenotypes of B cells in the ear, nose, and throat, especially in patients with otitis media, were shown to be CD5(low), CD23(high), CD43(low), B220(high), sIgM(low), sIgD(high), Mac-1(low), CD80(B7.1)(low), CD86(B7.2)(low), and Syndecam-1(low). Of the five major classes of immunoglobulins produced by B cells, three (IgG, IgA, and IgM) are mainly involved in otitis media.

Moreover, IgG, IgA, and IgM concentrations in the middle ear cavity are increased during immune responses in patients with otitis media. B cell leukemia/lymphoma-6 (Bcl-6) and paired box gene 5 (Pax-5) suppress antibody production, whereas B lymphocyte inducer of maturation program 1 (Blimp-1) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) promote antibody production during immune responses in patients with otitis media.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6398-1297', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7756-3560', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5928-5272', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8021-1024']",20210321,PMC8004237,['NOTNLM'],"['acute otitis media', 'antibody', 'chronic otitis media', 'immunoglobulin', 'otitis media', 'otitis media with effusion']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two hundred and sixty-six childhood leukemia patients and 266 healthy controls were enrolled in Taiwan, and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2839698 and rs217727, in H19 were genotyped and analyzed. There was a significant difference in the genotypic distribution of rs2839698 between patients and healthy controls (p = 0.0277). Compared to the wild-type CC genotype, the heterozygous variant CT and homozygous variant TT genotypes were associated with significantly increased risks of childhood leukemia with an adjusted odd ratio (OR) of 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.14, p = 0.0429) and 1.94 (95%CI, 1.15-3.31, p = 0.0169), respectively (pfor tread = 0.0277).

Their dysregulation is one of the cancer hallmarks and one of the reasons of drug resistance. Here, we studied the significance of the individual members of PCD signaling pathways in response to treatment with common anti-cancer drugs using the T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells with single or double knockouts of necroptosis and/or apoptosis genes. We identified apoptosis as the primary cell death pathway upon anti-cancer drugs treatment. The cells with knocked out either Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) or all executioner caspases were resistant. This resistance could be partially overcome by induction of RIP1-dependent necroptosis through TNFR1 activation using combined treatment with TNF-alpha and smac mimetic (LCL161). RIP1 was essential for cellular response to TNF-alpha and smac mimetic, but dispensable for the response to anti-cancer drugs. Here, we demonstrated the significance of FADD and executioner caspases in carrying out programmed cell death upon anti-cancer drug treatments and the ability of combined treatment with TNF-alpha and smac mimetic to partially overcome drug resistance of FADD and/or CASP3/7/6-deficient cells via RIP1-dependent necroptosis.

Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a gammaretrovirus that infects domestic and wild cats, causing immunodeficiency, cytopenia and neoplasia in progressively infected cats. The outcome of FeLV infection is influenced by the host immune response; progressively infected cats demonstrate weaker immune responses compared to regressively infected cats. In this study, humoral immune responses were examined in 180 samples collected from 123 domestic cats that had been naturally exposed to FeLV, using a novel ELISA to measure antibodies recognizing the FeLV surface unit (SU) glycoprotein in plasma samples. A correlation was demonstrated between the strength of the humoral immune response to the SU protein and the outcome of exposure. Cats with regressive infection demonstrated higher antibody responses to the SU protein compared to cats belonging to other outcome groups, and samples from cats with regressive infection contained virus neutralising antibodies. These results demonstrate that an ELISA that assesses the humoral response to FeLV SU complements the use of viral diagnostic tests to define the outcome of exposure to FeLV.

Among these subgroups, chromatin-spliceosome (CS)-AML is characterized by mutations in the spliceosome, cohesin complex, transcription factors, and chromatin modifiers. Class-defining mutations of CS-AML are also frequently identified in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and secondary AML, indicating the molecular similarity among these diseases. CS-AML is associated with myelodysplasia-related changes in hematopoietic cells and poor prognosis, and, thus, can be treated using novel therapeutic strategies and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Functional studies of CS-mutations in mice have revealed that CS-mutations typically cause MDS-like phenotypes by altering the epigenetic regulation of target genes. Moreover, multiple CS-mutations often synergistically induce more severe phenotypes, such as the development of lethal MDS/AML, suggesting that the accumulation of many CS-mutations plays a crucial role in the progression of MDS/AML.

Treatment with FLT3 inhibitors frequently produces a clinical response, but the disease nevertheless often recurs. Recent studies have revealed system-wide gene expression changes in FLT3-mutant AML cell lines in response to drug treatment. Here we sought a systems-level understanding of how these cells mediate these drug-induced changes. Using RNAseq data from AML cells with an internal tandem duplication FLT3 mutation (FLT3-ITD) under six drug treatment conditions including quizartinib and dexamethasone, we identified seven distinct gene programs representing diverse biological processes involved in AML drug-induced changes. Based on the literature knowledge about genes from these modules, along with public gene regulatory network databases, we constructed a network of FLT3-ITD AML. Applying the BooleaBayes algorithm to this network and the RNAseq data, we created a probabilistic, data-driven dynamical model of acquired resistance to these drugs. Analysis of this model reveals several interventions that may disrupt targeted parts of the system-wide drug response. We anticipate co-targeting these points may result in synergistic treatments that can overcome resistance and prevent eventual recurrence.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0067-123X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9485-0828']",20210311,PMC7998618,['NOTNLM'],"['Boolean model', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'network']","['PHY 1545832/National Science Foundation', 'MCB-1715826/National Science Foundation', 'IIS-1814405/National Science Foundation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Osteoblast differentiation, also known as osteoblastogenesis, is orchestrated by transcription factors, such as runt-related transcription factor 1/2, osterix, activating transcription factor 4, special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 and activator protein-1. Osteoblastogenesis is regulated by a network of cytokines under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Osteoblastogenic cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-11, IL-18, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), cardiotrophin-1 and oncostatin M, promote osteoblastogenesis, whereas anti-osteoblastogenic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-beta, IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-7, IL-12, IL-13, IL-23, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, leukemia inhibitory factor, cardiotrophin-like cytokine, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, downregulate osteoblastogenesis.

The mainstay of managing severe chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) in cancer is the use of platelet transfusions. While prophylactic platelet transfusions reduce the bleeding rate, multiple unmet needs remain, such as high residual rates of bleeding, and anticancer treatment dose reductions/delays. Accordingly, the following promising results in other settings, antifibrinolytic drugs have been evaluated for prevention and treatment of bleeding in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In addition, Thrombopoeitin receptor agonists have been studied for two major implications in cancer: treatment of severe thrombocytopenia associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia; primary and secondary prevention of CIT in solid tumors in order to maintain dose density and intensity of anti-cancer treatment. Furthermore, thrombocytopenic cancer patients are often prescribed antithrombotic medication for indications arising prior or post cancer diagnosis.

However, studies have highlighted haematologic toxicity as an adverse event of concern. We report our single-centre experience of compassionate access palliative (177)Lu-DOTAGA-(I-y)fk(Sub-KuE) ((177)Lu-PSMA I&T) with respect to efficacy and haematologic safety. METHODS: Patients with mCRPC and adequate bone marrow/liver function were included. All patients included underwent baseline and response assessment by Gallium-68-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT). Prescribed activity of therapy was a median 6.24 GBq per patient per cycle (IQR1.29 GBq), administered in 8-week intervals, up to four cycles. Response was assessed by prostate specific antigen (PSA) and a week-12 PET/CT. Incidence of grade >/= 3 haematologic toxicity, including association with risk factors (age >/= 70 years, prior/concurrent therapy, presence of metastases, and number of cycles completed), was analysed. RESULTS: One hundred patients completed one cycle of (177)Lu PSMA I&T and underwent response assessment by both PSA and PET/CT. Two patients had an uninterpretable week-12 PET/CT. Median age was 70 (50-89), median number of prior therapies was three (1-6), and median follow up was 12-months. Fifty-four percent achieved a PSA response. Disease control rate (DCR) by PET/CT was 64% (29% SD, 34% PR, and 1% CR). Disease control by PET/CT was associated with an improved one-year overall survival (OS) compared to non-responders, median OS not-reached vs 10-months (p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 0.08-0.44). Regarding haematologic toxicity, 11% experienced a grade >/= 3 cytopenia (self-limiting). No cases of myelodysplasia/acute leukaemia (MDS/AL) have been recorded. No association with risk factors was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: (177)Lu-PSMA I&T is a safe and effective palliative outpatient treatment for mCRPC.

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) are dynamic and multiprotein complexes implicated in a variety of important biochemical events. Due to alternative mRNA splicing, PML has at least six nuclear isoforms that share a common N-terminus but differ in their C-terminal regions. However, the unique role of each PML isoform is not clear. Here, we report the characterization of the deubiquitinase ataxin-3 as a specific binding partner of PML isoform II (PML-II). Ataxin-3 was identified as a potential binding protein of PML-II in a yeast-hybrid screen employing the unique C-terminal region of PML-II as bait. Ataxin-3 only binds to the C-terminal region of PML-II and not that of other PML isoforms. The interaction between ataxin-3 and PML-II was confirmed by co-immunoprecipition assays, and immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that PML-II and ataxin-3 were co-localized in PML-NBs. In addition, PML-II not only interacts with ataxin-3 with a normal range of poly-Q repeats (13Q), but also with a pathological form of ataxin-3 with extended poly-Q repeats (79Q). Importantly, the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin-3 was inhibited by PML-II. Our results suggest that PML-II may be a negative regulator of ataxin-3.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Both total body irradiation (TBI)-based and chemotherapy only-based myeloablative transplantation conditioning regimens have been applied, but the optimal regimen remains unclear. We performed a systematic review to assess the efficacy of TBI-based versus chemotherapy only-based myeloablative conditioning regimens. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and meeting abstracts for all studies comparing TBI-based and chemotherapy only-based conditioning regimens in patients who underwent allo-HCT for ALL. Two authors independently reviewed all studies for inclusion and extracted data related to overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Eight studies were included in the final analysis. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was optimal. TBI-based regimens showed evidence of benefit compared with chemotherapy only-based conditioning regimens in terms of relapse (relative risk [RR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.94; 6 studies, 5091 patients), OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89; 7 studies, 4727 patients), and PFS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.85; 7 studies, 4727 patients). The TBI-based regimen did not increase the likelihood of grade II-IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.36; 5 studies, 4996 patients) or chronic GVHD (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.21; 5 studies, 4490 patients), or NRM (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.28; 6 studies, 4522 patients). However, TBI-based regimens were associated with an increased risk of grade III-IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.63; 3 studies, 3675 patients). A subgroup comparison of patients age >/=16 years showed similar results. This systematic review represents evidence supporting the use of TBI-based conditioning regimen in patients undergoing allo-HCT for ALL who are candidates for myeloablative conditioning, as it offers better OS, PFS, and less relapse with acceptable NRM.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"For more than 30 years, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has remained largely unchanged and reliant on chemotherapeutic drug combinations, specifically cytarabine and daunorubicin (the 7 + 3 regimen). One broad spectrum drug, flavopiridol (also known as Alvocidib) has shown significant activity against AML through the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases. Flavopiridol is a semisynthetic flavonoid and our research team recently described methods to formulate another flavonoid, quercetin, through the ability of flavonoids to bind divalent metals. This method relies on use of copper-containing liposomes to enhance the apparent solubility of flavopiridol and to create formulations suitable for intravenous (i.v.) use. Similar to quercetin, flavopiridol is defined as an aqueous-insoluble compound (< 1 mg/mL in water) and this research sought to evaluate whether the copper-binding capabilities of flavopiridol could be used to prepare an injectable formulation that would exhibit enhanced exposure and improved efficacy. Flavopiridol powder was added directly to preformed copper-containing liposomes (DSPC:Chol or DSPC:DSPE-PEG2000) and the resulting formulations were characterized. Pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies were then conducted. The liposomal flavopiridol formulations were well-tolerated in mice following i.v. administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg with no apparent acute or chronic toxicities. In vivo pharmacokinetics of the optimized DSPC/DSPE-PEG2000 liposomal flavopiridol formulation demonstrated a 30-fold increase in AUC (0.804 mug-hr/mL versus 26.92 mug-hr/mL) compared to the free flavopiridol formulation. The resultant liposomal formulation also demonstrated significant therapeutic activity in MV4-11 and MOLM-13 subcutaneous AML models. Additional studies will be required to define whether formulation changes can be made to enhance flavopiridol retention in the selected composition. The results suggest that further increases in flavopiridol retention will result in improved therapeutic activity.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Large HTLV-1 endemic areas exist in Southern Japan, the Caribbean, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia, and equatorial regions of Africa. HTLV-1 TAX viral protein is thought to play a critical role in HTLV-1 associated diseases. We have used numerous bio-informatics and immuno-informatics implements comprising sequence and construction tools for the construction of a 3D model and epitope prediction for HTLV-1 Tax viral protein. The conformational linear B-cell and T-cell epitopes for HTLV-1 TAX viral protein have been predicted for their possible collective use as vaccine candidates. Based on in silico investigation two B cell epitopes, KEADDNDHEPQISPGGLEPPSEKHFR and DGTPMISGPCPKDGQPS spanning from 324-349 and 252-268 respectively; and T cell epitopes, LLFGYPVYV, ITWPLLPHV and GLLPFHSTL ranging from 11-19, 163-171 and 233-241 were found most antigenic and immunogenic epitopes. Among different vaccine constructs generated by different combinations of these epitopes our predicted vaccine construct was found to be most antigenic with a score of 0.57. T cell epitopes interacted strongly with HLA-A*0201 suggesting a significant immune response evoked by these epitopes. Molecular docking study also showed a high binding affinity of the vaccine construct for TLR4. The study was carried out to predict antigenic determinants of the Tax protein along with the 3D protein modeling. The study revealed a potential multi epitope vaccine that can raise the desired immune response against HTLV-1 and be useful in developing effective vaccines against Human T-lymphotropic virus.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4958-2537', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0680-1936', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1433-5085']",20210402,PMC8018625,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stool samples were collected from all participants and subjected to routine microscopic examination, special staining and detection of copro-antigen using rapid diagnostic test (RDT) RIDA(R)QUICK Entamoeba/ Giardia/ Cryptosporidium Combi. Cases were tested post-chemotherapy at the nadir of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ANC<= 0.5x10(9)/L) and 19 cases were also tested initially prior to chemotherapy. Of examined patients, 15/40 (37%) were positive for Blastocystis hominis by wet mount, 10/40 (25%) had microsporidia using modified trichrome stain and only 2 cases (5%) of Cryptosporidium spp. by Ziehl-Neelsen stain. By RDT, 8/40 cases (20%) were positive compared to entirely negative controls. The positive cases included 4 patients with G. intestinalis 2 with Entamoeba and 2 with Cryptosporidium.19/40 cases were tested both pre- and post-chemotherapy. microsporidian spp. was diagnosed in 6/19 cases at the nadir of neutropenia compared to none of the cases pre-chemotherapy and the difference was statistically significant (p= 0.031*). Intestinal protozoa in acute leukemia patients post-chemotherapy are common especially B. hominis. Furthermore, RDT might be helpful for diagnosing intestinal protozoa in acute leukemia.

Until recently, treatment options for PTC patients are limited. Nilotinib is the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and has been widely used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore whether nilotinib is effective in PTC cancer progression and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: In this study, the three human PTC cell lines (KTC-1, BCPAP, and TPC1) were used to verify the effects of nilotinib on cell growth. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated according to the growth curve post nilotinib treatment at different concentrations. Cell counting kit-8 and colony formation analysis were used to monitor cell growth after nilotinib treatment. Cell apoptosis and autophagy related proteins and phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR were detected by Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Nilotinib treatment can effectively inhibit PTC cell growth, which was accompanied by increase of apoptosis and induction of autophagy. Mechanistically, nilotinib treatment repressed the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results demonstrated that nilotinib may display anti-tumor effect against PTC via inhibiting of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inducing apoptosis and autophagy.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,20210401,,['NOTNLM'],"['Nilotinib', 'PI3K/Akt/mTOR', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'phosphorylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the effects of platelet-rich fibrin in a thin endometrium rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. For the thin endometrium group, endometria of left uteri were injected with ethanol. For the experimental group, platelet-rich fibrin was sutured onto the left uteri of endometria injected with ethanol. Right uteri were kept as the normal (control) group. Two weeks after platelet-rich fibrin transplant, uteri were sampled for histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Endometrium thicknesses in normal, thin endometrium, and experimental groups were 632.2 +/- 38.28, 434.80 +/- 41.37, and 603.0 +/- 40.93 mum, respectively. Endometrium thickness in the experi-mental group was significantly increased versus the thin endometrium group (P = .011). Immunohistochemical examination showed that expression levels of cytokeratin 18, vimentin, and leukemia inhibitory factor in the experimental group were significantly higher versus the thin endometrium group (P < .001, P < .006, and P = .001, respectively). In Western blot analysis, cytokeratin 18, integrin beta3, leukemia inhibitory factor, and vimentin protein expressions were slightly higher in the experimental and normal groups versus the thin endometrium group. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed significantly higher octamer-binding transcription factor 4 mRNA levels in the experimental group versus the thin endometrium group (P < .001). Interleukin 6 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in the experimental group versus the thin endometrium group (P= .004 and P < .001, respectively). Interleukin 1beta mRNA expression was significantly lower in the experimental group versus the thin endometrium group (P < .007).

Herein, we discovered a novel FLT3 inhibitor 17, which displayed potent inhibitory activity against the FLT3-ITD mutant (IC50 = 0.8 nM) and achieved good selectivity over c-KIT kinase (over 500-fold). Compound 17 selectively inhibited the proliferation of FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell lines MV4-11 (IC50 = 23.5 nM) and MOLM-13 (IC50 = 35.5 nM) and exhibited potent inhibitory effects against associated acquired resistance mutations. In cellular mechanism studies, compound 17 strongly inhibited FLT3-mediated signaling pathways and induced apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle in the sub-G1 phase.

Epub 2021 Apr 2.,"The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia increases with age, and more than half of AML patients are over 60 years old. Treating elderly AML patients presents several challenges and uncertainties, linked partly to disease characteristics and partly to the difficulty of establishing which patients could benefit from the best treatment. Although some elderly fit patients can receive intensive therapy, many of them are not treated and not enrolled in clinical trials. Yet supportive care is associated with significantly lower survival rates compared to intensive therapy or lower intensive therapy. A poorer prognosis in elderly patients is related to age, functional status, and comorbidities, combined with leukemia characteristics. Chronological age is not the best surrogate factor for selecting patients eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Scoring systems-including patient characteristics (ECOG, comorbidities) and disease characteristics (cytogenetics and molecular parameters)-designed to evaluate probabilities of response to treatment, morbidity, and survival may be used to balance the risk-benefit ratio for intensive therapy. A geriatric assessment (GA) to evaluate physical function, comorbidities, nutritional status, cognitive function, and social support could help identify the most vulnerable patients so that they can receive intensive therapy. A GA would also help take the necessary steps to improve tolerance to treatment. Evaluating markers of fitness and quality of life as part of clinical trials should be favored.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4389-6164'],20210402,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Comorbidities', 'Drug targeting', 'Elderly', 'Fitness', 'Geriatric assessment', 'New agents', 'Quality of life', 'Treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inherent graft-versus-leukemia activity (GvL) may be optimized by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Here we present our single-center experience of DLI use patterns and effectiveness, based on 342 consecutive adult patients receiving a first allo-HSCT for AML between 2009 and 2017. The median age at transplantation was 57 years (range 19-79), and the pre-transplant status was active disease in 58% and complete remission (CR) in 42% of cases. In a combined landmark analysis, patients in CR on day +30 and alive on day +100 were included. In this cohort (n=292), 93 patients received cryopreserved aliquots of peripheral blood-derived grafts for DLI (32%) and median survival was 55.7 months (2-year/5-year probability: 62%/49%). Median survival for patients receiving a first dose of DLI ""preemptively,"" in the absence of relapse and guided by risk marker monitoring (preDLI; n=42), or only after hematological relapse (relDLI; n=51) was 40.9 months (2-year/5-year: 64%/43%) vs 10.4 months (2-year/5-year: 26%/10%), respectively. Survival was inferior when preDLI was initiated at a time of genetic risk marker detection vs mixed chimerism or clinical risk only. Time to first-dose preDLI vs time to first-dose relDLI was similar, suggesting that early warning and intrinsically lower dynamics of AML recurrence may contribute to effectiveness of preDLI-modified GvL activity. Future refinements of the preemptive DLI concept will benefit from collaborative efforts to diagnose measurable residual disease more reliably across the heterogeneous genomic spectrum of AML.",['(c) 2021.

Considering the sustained development of metastasis, tumor recurrence, and drug resistance, there is an urgent need for the novel therapeutic approaches to combat glioblastoma. Trivalent arsenic derivative (arsenite, As(III)) with remarkable clinical efficacy in leukemia has been shown to exert cytocidal effect against glioblastoma cells. Gamabufotalin, an active bufadienolide compound, also shows selective cytocidal effect against glioblastoma cells, and has been suggested to serve as a promising adjuvant therapeutic agent to potentiate therapeutic effect of conventional anticancer drugs. In order to gain novel insight into therapeutic approaches against glioblastoma, the cytotoxicity of As(III) and gamabufotalin was explored in the human glioblastoma cell lines U-87 and U-251. In comparison with U-251 cells, U-87 cells were highly susceptible to the two drugs, alone or in combination. More importantly, clinically achieved concentrations of As(III) combined with gamabufotalin exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity against U-87 cells, whereas showed much less cytotoxicity to human normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. G2/M cell cycle arrest was induced by each single drug, and further augmented by their combination in U-87 cells. Downregulation of the expression levels of cdc25C, Cyclin B1, cdc2, and survivin was observed in U-87 cells treated with the combined regimen and occurred in parallel with G2/M arrest. Concomitantly, lactate dehydrogenase leakage was also observed. Intriguingly, SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, intensified the cytotoxicity of the combined regimen in U-87 cells, whereas wortmannin, a potent autophagy inhibitor, significantly rescued the cells. Collectively, G2/M arrest, necrosis and autophagy appeared to cooperatively contribute to the synergistic cytotoxicity of As(III) and gamabufotalin. Given that p38 MAPK serves an essential role in promoting glioblastoma cell survival, developing a possible strategy composed of As(III), gamabufotalin, and a p38 MAPK inhibitor may provide novel insight into approaches designed to combat glioblastoma.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yuan, Xu, Shimada, Li, Hayashi, Okazaki and Takagi.']",,20210316,PMC8009626,['NOTNLM'],"['arsenite', 'autophagy', 'cell cycle arrest', 'combination therapy', 'gamabufotalin', 'glioblastoma', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'p38 MAPK']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,['Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 08;11:778834.

Although widely used for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, the prognostic value of CD123 has not been fully characterized in pediatric B-ALL. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the association between the CD123 expression of leukemic blasts and the outcomes of the pediatric B-ALL patients. Methods: A total of 976 pediatric B-ALL, including 328 treated with CCLG-ALL-2008 protocol and 648 treated with CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol, were recruited in this retrospective study. CD123 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Patients with >50, 20-50, or <20% of CD123 expressing blasts were grouped into CD123(high), CD123(low), and CD123(neg), respectively. The correlation between CD123 expression and the patients' clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were studied statistically. Results: Of 976 pediatric B-ALL, 53.4% from the CCLG-ALL-2008 cohort and 49.2% from the CCCG-ALL-2015 cohort were CD123(high). In the CCLG-ALL-2008 cohort, CD123(high) was significantly associated with chromosome hyperdiploidy (p < 0.0001), risk stratification (p = 0.004), and high survival rate (p = 0.005). By comparing clinical outcomes, patients with CD123(high) displayed favorable prognosis, with a significantly better OS (p = 0.005), EFS (p = 0.017), and RFS (p = 0.045), as compared to patients with CD123(low) and CD123(neg). The prognostic value of CD123 expression was subsequently confirmed in the CCCG-ALL-2015 cohort. Univariate and multivariate cox regression model analysis showed that high CD123 expression was independently associated with favorable EFS (OR: 0.528; 95% CI: 0.327 to 0.853; p = 0.009) in this cohort. In patients without prognosis-defining genomic abnormalities, high CD123 expression strongly indicated superior survival rates and was identified as an independent prognosis factor for EFS and RFS in both cohorts. Conclusions: A group of B-ALL lacks prognosis-defining genomic aberrations, which proposes a challenge in risk stratification. Our findings revealed that high CD123 expression of leukemic blasts was associated with favorable clinical outcomes in pediatric B-ALL and CD123 could serve as a promising prognosis predictor, especially in patients without prognosis-defining genetic aberrations.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Chu, Gao, Ling, Xiao, Lu, Wang, He, Li, Hu, Li, Pan, Xiao', 'and Hu.']",,20210316,PMC8008053,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CD123', 'favorable', 'pediatric', 'prognosis']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the role of B7-H6 and the mechanisms that control its expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Epigenome modulation, including epigenomic reader dysregulation, is one of the hallmarks of AML. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), the best-known member of the BET family of epigenetic readers, is overexpressed in AML cells and regulates the transcription of genes involved in the pathogenesis of AML, as MYC oncogene. Here, we analyze the role of BRD4 in regulating B7-H6 in AML cells. Results demonstrated that the specific inhibition of BRD4 drastically reduces the expression of B7-H6 in AML cells. Histone acetylation mediated by CBP30/P300 facilitates the binding of BRD4 to the B7-H6 promoter, which recruits the P-TEFb elongation factor that phosphorylates RNA polymerase II, thereby activating B7-H6 transcription. BRD4 also co-bounded with JMJD6 at the distal enhancer of the B7-H6 gene. Metabolic modulation with metformin modifies the acetylation pattern in the B7-H6 promoter, impairing BRD4 binding, thereby inhibiting B7-H6 expression. B7-H6 knockdown induces the apoptosis in HEL-R cell line. Moreover, a high level of B7-H6 expression in AML patients is related to increased BRD4 levels, myelodysplastic-derived AML, and del5q, the two latter being associated with poor prognosis. Our data show that BRD4 is a positive regulator of the pro-tumorigenic molecule B7-H6 and that the blockage of the B7-H6 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AML.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Meanwhile, multiple retrospective analyzes showed the superiority of pediatric regimens among the older adults and young adolescents (AYAs) group over adult regimens. A series of prospective studies have made it apparent that pediatric-inspired ALL regimens are feasible in AYAs, with manageable toxicities and potentially more encouraging results.

There were five remaining factors in the final model: AML, FN at admission, prolong broad spectrum antibiotics, lower respiratory tract infection, and Aspergillosis. Only lower respiratory tract infection was significant with adjusted odds ratio of 7.794 (95% CI of 1.549, 39.212). The Hosmer-Lemeshow Chi square was 2.74 (p value 0.907). The lower respiratory tract infection group had higher proportions of Gram negative and fungus than the non-lower respiratory tract infection group; specifically E. coli (p 0.003), and Aspergillus (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There were two independent predictors of mortality in acute leukemia patients with FN: septic shock and lower respiratory tract infection regardless of leukemia type or pathogen. E. coli and Aspergillus were more common in those with lower respiratory tract infection than those without. No specific pathogens were found in cases of septic shock.",['AJBR Copyright (c) 2021.'],,20210215,PMC8010598,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'aspergillus', 'escherichia']",,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JMML is associated with mutations in the RAS pathway genes resulting in the myeloid progenitors being sensitive to granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Karyotype abnormalities and additional epigenetic alterations can also be found in JMML. Neurofibromatosis and Noonan's syndrome have a predisposition for JMML. In a few patients, the RAS genes (NRAS, KRAS, and PTPN11) are mutated at the germline and this usually results in a transient myeloproliferative disorder with a good prognosis. JMML with somatic RAS mutation behaves aggressively. JMML presents with cytopenias and leukemic infiltration into organs. The laboratory findings include hyperleukocytosis, monocytosis, increased hemoglobin-F levels, and circulating myeloid precursors. The blast cells in the peripheral blood/bone-marrow aspirate are less than 20% and the absence of the BCR-ABL translocation helps to differentiate from chronic myeloid leukemia. JMML should be differentiated from immunodeficiencies, viral infections, intrauterine infections, hemophagolymphohistiocytosis, other myeloproliferative disorders, and leukemias. Chemotherapy is employed as a bridge to HSCT, except in few with less aggressive disease, in which chemotherapy alone can result in long term remission. Azacitidine has shown promise as a single agent to stabilize the disease. The prognosis of JMML is poor with about 50% of patients surviving after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Allogeneic HSCT is the only known cure for JMML to date. Myeloablative conditioning is most commonly used with graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis tailored to the aggressiveness of the disease. Relapses are common even after HSCT and a second HSCT can salvage a third of these patients. Novel options in the treatment of JMML e.g., hypomethylating agents, MEK inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, etc. are being explored.",['AJBR Copyright (c) 2021.'],,20210215,PMC8010610,['NOTNLM'],"['Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'monocytosis', 'mutations', 'myelodysplastic', 'myeloproliferative']",,,"['AKG has been sanctioned a grant for research on the genomic landscape of JMML', 'from the Indian Council of Medical Research.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 13.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate different biological prognostic markers to identify high-risk patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a higher tumor burden, in order to ensure appropriate management. A total of 81 Egyptian patients with CLL were enrolled in the present study, with 75 healthy subjects serving as the control group. The expression of CD49d, CD38 and ZAP-70 in CLL cells was assessed using flow cytometry. The fluorescence in situ hybridization technique was employed to evaluate TP53 (del17p), ataxia-telangiectasia (del11q) and 13q14 (del13q14) genes and the presence of trisomy 12. The serological markers beta2 microglobulin (B2M) and sCD23 were measured by ELISA. The CD49d gene was highly expressed in 25.9% and cytogenetic aberrations were observed in 66.6% of all recruited CLL patients. The patients were categorized according to the Binet staging system and a significant increase in the expression of sCD23, CD49d and ZAP-70 was detected in group C (P=0.008, 0.034 and 0.017, respectively) when compared to groups A and B. CD49d(+) patients exhibited significantly higher expression of CD38 (P=0.002) and trisomy 12 (P=0.015) and lower expression of del13q14 (P=0.001). Patients who were CD49d(+) with B2M>3.5 microg/ml exhibited higher total leukocyte count (P=0.048), higher absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.036), higher expression of CD38 (P=0.002) and trisomy 12 (P=0.034) and lower expression of del13q14 (P=0.002). Therefore, sCD23, CD49d and ZAP-70 may be considered as an optimal prognostic marker combination to be evaluated in the early stages of CLL and throughout disease management. Integrating both serological markers and CD49d expression by flow cytometry may add to the prognostic value of each marker alone and help identify high-risk patients with a higher tumor burden.",['Copyright: (c) Attia et al.'],,20210313,PMC8010509,['NOTNLM'],"['CD49d', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'prognostic variables']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phase III RESONATE and RESONATE-2 trials first demonstrated the superiority of ibrutinib over ofatumumab in the relapsed/refractory setting and over chlorambucil in older patients with de novo disease. The phase III ECOG-ACRIN trial extended these results to young, fit patients, demonstrating a significant survival advantage to ibrutinib plus rituximab over fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Similarly, the Alliance trial demonstrated the superiority of ibrutinib over bendamustine with rituximab as frontline in elderly patients. Challenges with ibrutinib include toxicity, development of resistance, and need for indefinite therapy. The second generation BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib may cause less off-target toxicity. The ELEVATE TN trial demonstrated the superiority of acalabrutinib with or without obinutuzumab over chlorambucil and obinutuzumab as frontline therapy for elderly or comorbid patients. Promising early results from the phase II CAPTIVATE and CLARITY trials, which combined ibrutinib with venetoclax, suggest a future role for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing to determine treatment duration. The ongoing phase III GAIA/CLL13, ECOG EA9161, Alliance A041702, CLL17, and [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03836261] trials will assess various combinations of ibrutinib/acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and anti-CD20 antibodies. These trials will answer key questions in the treatment of CLL: should novel agents in CLL be used in combination or sequentially? What is the best frontline agent? Can treatment be safely stopped with BTK inhibitors? Can undetectable MRD be used to determine treatment duration? In this review, we will discuss these and other aspects of the evolving role of BTK inhibition in CLL.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3940-4451'],20210130,PMC7970705,['NOTNLM'],"['BTK inhibitor', 'acalabrutinib', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'combination therapy', 'ibrutinib', 'targeted therapy']",,,"['Conflict of interest statement: AVD reports consultancy from Abbvie, Beigene,', 'Celgene, Curis, Janssen, Karyopharm, Nurix, Seattle Genetics, Teva Oncology, and', 'TG Therapeutics; research funding from Aptose Biosciences, Bristol-Myers Squibb,', 'Gilead Sciences, and Takeda Oncology; and consultancy and research funding from', 'AstraZeneca, Bayer Oncology, Genentech, and Verastem Oncology.']",,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03836261'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MM with plasma-cell leukemia (PCL) transformation is highly aggressive and is resistant to conventional therapy. Novel therapeutics are needed for PCL, and daratumumab may play role. We report a case of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)-transformed PCL successfully treated with daratumumab. The case was a 42-year-old man who was diagnosed with MM 2 years ago and relapsed after six cycles of bortezomib-based chemotherapy. The patient rapidly developed hyperleukocytosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, and was diagnosed with PCL. Daratumumab-based therapy was tried and the case miraculously obtained complete remission (CR) after four doses of a weekly infusion of daratumumab. Finally the patient received autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) and maintained CR. Moreover, we monitored the immune cell dynamics by flow cytometry (FCM) during daratumumab-based treatment. The immune cell subset analysis revealed significant down-regulation of CD38+ natural killer (NK) cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and regulatory B cells (Bregs). Meanwhile cytotoxic T-lymphocyte expansion was observed. In conclusion, daratumumab could rapidly decrease tumor burden, improve the condition of the PCL patient, and serve as a bridging salvage chemotherapy for further chimeric antigen recptor T cell therapy (Car-T) or HSCT, which could potentially improve patient survival. The immune cell dynamic findings in this case suggest that the immunomodulatory mechanism may contribute to the antimyeloma effect of daratumumab.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8708-9711'],20210128,PMC7970699,['NOTNLM'],"['daratumumab', 'immunomodulatory effect', 'plasma-cell leukemia']",,,"['Conflict of interest: The author(s) declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL-rearranged fusion proteins (MLLr) induce aberrant target gene expression resulting in leukemogenesis. MLL and its fusions are tethered to chromatin by LEDGF/p75, a transcriptional co-activator that specifically recognizes H3K36me2/3. LEDGF/p75 is ubiquitously expressed and associated with regulation of gene expression, autoimmune responses, and HIV replication. LEDGF/p75 was proven to be essential for leukemogenesis in MLL. Apart from MLL, LEDGF/p75 has been linked to lung, breast, and prostate cancer. Intriguingly, LEDGF/p75 interacts with Med-1, which co-localizes with BRD4. Both are known as co-activators of super-enhancers. Here, we describe LEDGF/p75-dependent chemoresistance of MLLr cell lines. Investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed a role of LEDGF/p75 in the cell cycle and in survival pathways and showed that LEDGF/p75 protects against apoptosis during chemotherapy.

METHODS: We conducted a multiphase, descriptive study to translate SSPedi into Argentinian Spanish. Using two translators, forward and backward translations were performed. The translated version was evaluated by Spanish-speaking paediatric patients 8-18 years of age receiving cancer treatments in two centres in Argentina and El Salvador. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was patient self-reported difficulty with understanding of the SSPedi instructions and each symptom using a 5-point Likert scale. Secondary outcomes were incorrect understanding of the SSPedi instructions, symptoms and response scale determined by cognitive interviews with the patients and rated using a 4-point Likert scale. Cultural relevance was assessed qualitatively. RESULTS: There were 30 children enrolled and included in cognitive interviews; 16 lived in Argentina and 14 lived in El Salvador. The most common types of Spanish spoken were Central American (17, 57%) followed by South American (10, 33%) and Castilian (3, 10%). No changes to Argentinian Spanish SSPedi were required based on the outcomes or qualitative comments. No issues with cultural relevance were identified by any of the respondents. CONCLUSIONS: We translated and finalised Argentinian Spanish SSPedi. Future research will focus on its use to describe bothersome symptoms by Argentinian Spanish-speaking children.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

This therapy requires patients to remain hospitalized for at least 7 days to monitor for two black-box warnings: cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Both toxicities require astute monitoring and early treatment to prevent complication. DATA SOURCE: We use a case study to illustrate the assessment and toxicity management of a patient receiving CAR T-cell therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma at an academic medical center. CONCLUSION: Cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity are two common, potentially life-threatening toxicities that can be reversed with early nursing identification and treatment using evidence-based interventions.

We have recently reported that outcomes of adult patients (pts) with ALL in complete remission (CR) receiving HaploSCT are comparable to unrelated donor transplants. We now compared HaploSCT and matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants in pts with ALL. AIM: To assess transplantation outcomes of HaploSCT and MSD transplants in pts with ALL in CR. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed adult patients (>/= 18 years) with ALL who underwent their first allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in first or second CR between 2012 and 2018, either from a T cell replete Haplo or MSD donor, and whose data were reported to the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). Multivariate analysis (MVA) adjusting for differences between the groups was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Propensity score matching was also performed to reduce confounding effects. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 2304 patients: HaploSCT-413; MSD-1891. Median follow-up was 25 months. Median age was 37 (range 18-75) and 38 (18-76) years in HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. HaploSCT patients were transplanted more recently than those transplanted from MSD (2016 vs 2015, p < 0.0001). A higher rate of HaploSCT was in CR2 (33.4% vs 16.7%, p < 0.0001), respectively, and fewer received myeloablative conditioning (68% vs 83.2%, p < 0.0001). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity was lower in HaploSCT patients (22% vs 28%, p = 0.01) and donors (27.1% vs 33%, p < 0.02), and a higher proportion of the HaploSCTs were performed using a bone marrow (BM) graft (46.2% vs 18.6%, p < 0.0001). The 2 groups did not differ with regard to gender, Karnofsky performance status score, ALL phenotype, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positivity and pre-alloSCT measurable residual disease (MRD). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was mainly post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) based (92.7%) in the HaploSCT setting, while it was mostly pharmacologic in the setting of MSD (18.7% received ATG). Cumulative incidence of engraftment at day 60 was higher in MSD transplants compared to HaploSCT (98.7% vs 96.3%, p = 0.001), respectively. Day 180 incidence of acute (a) GVHD II-IV and III-IV was higher in HaploSCT vs. MSD: 36.3% vs 28.9% (p = 0.002 and 15.2% vs 10.5% (p = 0.005), respectively. Conversely, the 2-year chronic (c) GVHD and extensive cGVHD were 32% vs 38.8% (p = 0.009) and 11.9% vs 19.5% (p = 0.001) in HaploSCT vs MSD, respectively. Main causes of death were leukemia (31.8% vs 45%), infection (33.1% vs 19.7%) and GVHD (16.6% vs 19.7%) for HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. Two-year relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 26% vs 31.6%, 22.9% vs 13%, 51% vs 55.4%, 58.8% vs 67.4% and 40.6% vs 39% for HaploSCT and MSD, respectively. In the MVA, RI was significantly lower in HaploSCT in comparison with MSD, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66 (95% CI 0.52-0.83, p = 0.004), while NRM was significantly higher, HR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.43-2.53, p < 0.0001). aGVHD grade II-IV and grade III-IV were higher in HaploSCT than in MSD HR = 1.53 (95% CI 1.23-1.9, p = 0.0002) and HR = 1.54 (95% CI 1.1-2.15, p = 0.011), respectively. Extensive cGVHD was lower in HaploSCT compared with MSD, HR = 0.61 (95% CI 0.43-0.88, p = 0.007), while total cGVHD did not differ significantly, HR = 0.94 (95% CI 0.74-1.18, p = 0.58). LFS, OS and GRFS did not differ significantly between the 2 transplant groups, HR = 0.96 (95% CI 0.81-1.14, p = 0.66); HR = 1.18 (95% CI 0.96-1.43, p = 0.11) and HR = 0.93 (95% CI 0.79-1.09, p = 0.37), respectively. These results were confirmed in a matched-pair analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of adult patients with ALL in CR receiving alloSCT from haploidentical donors are not significantly different from those receiving transplants from MSD in terms of LFS, OS and GRFS.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0763-1265'],20210401,PMC8017786,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Donor', '*Haploidentical', '*Sibling']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

frequent in patients admitted to intensive care units for critical illness and pneumonia. It has been reported also in patients with COVID-19, Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We analyzed the clinical relevance of Low T3 syndrome in COVID-19 patients and, in particular, in those with associated hematological malignancies. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients, hospitalized during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Sant'Andrea University Hospital in Rome, were subdivided in 38 patients (Group A), showing low levels of FT3, and in 24 patients (Group B), with normal FT3 serum values. During the acute phase of the disease, we measured serum, radiologic and clinical disease severity markers and scores, in search of possible correlations with FT3 serum values. In addition, in 6 COVID-19 patients, 4 with Low T3 syndrome, including 2 with a hematological malignancy, and 2 with normal FT3 values, we performed, high-dimensional single-cell analysis by mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay and gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: Low FT3 serum values were correlated with increased Absolute Neutrophil Count, NLR and dNLR ratios and with reduced total count of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Low FT3 values correlated also with increased levels of inflammation, tissue damage and coagulation serum markers as well as with SOFA, LIPI and TSS scores. The CyTOF analysis demonstrated reduction of the effector memory and terminal effector subtypes of the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Multiplex cytokine assay indicates that mainly IL-6, IP-10 and MCAF changes are associated with FT3 serum levels, particularly in patients with coexistent hematological malignancies. Gene expression analysis using Nanostring identified four genes differently expressed involved in host immune response, namely CD38, CD79B, IFIT3 and NLRP3. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that low FT3 serum levels are associated with severe COVID-19. Our multi-omics approach suggests that T3 is involved in the immune response in COVID-19 and coexistent hematological malignancy and new possible T3 target genes in these patients have been identified.",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1492-5365'],20210401,PMC8016508,['NOTNLM'],"['*Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)', '*CyTOF', '*Differentially expressed genes', '*Hematological malignancies', '*Low T3 syndrome', '*NanoString', '*Thyroid function']","['grant 2018 n.85-2017-13750/Lazioinnova', ""PRIN Bando 2017 (Prot. 2017HWTP2K)/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e"", 'della Ricerca', 'IG 24451/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2) is a pseudo serine/threonine kinase that functions as a scaffold or adaptor in various physiological and pathological processes. Trib2 can interact with E3 ubiquitin ligases and control protein stability of downstream effectors. This protein is induced by mitogens and enhances the propagation of several cancer cells, including myeloid leukemia, liver, lung, skin, bone, brain, and pancreatic. Thus, Trib2 can be a predictive and valuable biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent studies have illustrated that Trib2 plays a major role in cell fate determination of stem cells. Stem cells have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into specific cell types. Stem cells are important sources for cell-based regenerative medicine and drug screening. Trib2 has been found to increase the self-renewal ability of embryonic stem cells, the reprogramming efficiency of somatic cells, and chondrogenesis. In this review, we will focus on the recent advances of Trib2 function in tumorigenesis and stem cell fate decisions.

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"Azacitidine and enasidenib are two therapies available for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and the mechanisms of action of these drugs involve alteration of aberrant DNA methylation. We hypothesized that a combination of these agents could have interactive effects on DNA methylation and enhance differentiation in mIDH2 cells. Combination treatment enhanced cellular differentiation in TF-1 cells overexpressing IDJ2R140Q through increased hemoglobinization and increased hemoglobin gamma RNA expression compared with the effects of single agents. Furthermore, in primary AML samples (IDH2R140Q or R172K), combination treatment reduced CD34+ cells and increased CD15+ cells to a greater extent than attained with single agents. To explore the mechanism of enhanced differentiation with combination treatment, the TF-1 epigenome was analyzed by profiling 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) DNA methylation changes. Enasidenib treatment alone increased 5hmC, consistent with reactivation of ten-eleven-translocation (TET) enzyme activity. Compared with treatment with azacitidine alone, combination treatment reduced 5mC levels at greater numbers of sites and these loci were significantly enriched in regions with increased 5hMC (25.8% vs. 7.4%). Results are consistent with a model in which enasidenib-mediated reactivation of ten-eleven-translocation enzymes cooperates with azacitidine-mediated inhibition of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, leading to greater reductions in DNA methylation and enhanced erythroid differentiation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"This paper argues that Edward B. Lewis served as a type of independent academic radiation LNT-cancer risk assessment-stalking horse for the BEAR Genetics Panel, a task for which he had no expertise or experience (e.g. radiation, leukemia, epidemiology and statistical modelling). His efforts produced an insufficiently documented, strongly biased, and high-profile paper in Science (May 17, 1957), whose principal conclusions had not been proven, he asserted privately, in writing. This inconclusive perspective was well camouflaged in the published paper by means of sophisticated wordsmithing. At the time his academic department head George Beadle came to chair the BEAR Genetics Panel in the summer of 1956, the Beadle-inspired-Lewis LNT activity acquired an urgency when a study of 70,000 offspring from survivors of the A-bombs failed to show genetic damage after a decade of careful study, undercutting Panel recommendations. With Beadle's guidance, the Lewis effort redirected the Panel's focus from the atomic bomb genetic damage study, which had acrimoniously disrupted Panel relationships and priorities, to more immediate disciplinary/professional opportunities with concerns about fallout, leukemia risks and a new cancer causation role for mutation. The serious limitations of the Lewis paper affected neither its publication in Science nor its receiving an editorial endorsement, possibly due to influence by powerful Panel members, such as Bentley Glass, one of only six senior editors for Science. The Science publication restored, even though improperly, the scientific and moral initiatives of the Panel and led directly to multiple high level LNT recommendations for cancer risk assessment based on the Precautionary Principle, which Lewis asserted, and which remains in place today in essentially all countries. The present paper explores how such a scientific long-shot and quasi-stalking horse, who was unsupported by BEAR Panel members during the withering criticism prompted by his Science article, nevertheless endured in the pursuit of his LNT goal, becoming strikingly successful in achieving a global cancer risk assessment revolution which remains in place.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"Nucleic acid-ion interactions are fundamentally important to the physical, energetic, and conformational properties of DNA and RNA. These interactions help fold and stabilize highly ordered secondary and tertiary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (GQs), which are functionally relevant in telomeres, replication initiation sites, and promoter sequences. The c-kit proto-oncogene encodes for a receptor tyrosine kinase and is linked to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mast cell disease, and leukemia. This gene contains three unique GQ-forming sequences that have proposed antagonistic effects on gene expression. The dominant GQ, denoted c-kit1, has been shown to decrease expression of c-kit transcripts, making the c-kit1 GQ a promising drug target. Toward disease intervention, more information is needed regarding its conformational dynamics and ion binding properties. Therefore, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the c-kit1 GQ with K(+), Na(+), Li(+), and mixed salt solutions using the Drude-2017 polarizable force field. We evaluated GQ structure, ion sampling, core energetics, ion dehydration and binding, and ion competition and found that each analysis supported the known GQ-ion specificity trend (K(+) > Na(+) > Li(+)). We also found that K(+) ions coordinate in the tetrad core antiprismatically, whereas Na(+) and Li(+) align coplanar to guanine tetrads, partially because of their attraction to surrounding water. Further, we showed that K(+) occupancy is higher around the c-kit1 GQ and its nucleobases than Na(+) and Li(+), which tend to interact with backbone and sugar moieties. Finally, we showed that K(+) binding to the c-kit1 GQ is faster and more frequent than Na(+) and Li(+).

Epub 2021 Apr 1.,"BACKGROUND: Venetoclax (VEN) combined with the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine improves survival in patients aged >/=75 years with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). VEN and HMA treatment can result in prolonged and often profound neutropenia, and this warrants antifungal prophylaxis. Azole antifungals inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4, the primary enzyme responsible for VEN metabolism; this results in VEN dose reductions for each concomitant antifungal. Limited clinical data exist on outcomes for patients treated with VEN, an HMA, and various azoles. METHODS: The time to neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 1000 cells/mm(3) ) and platelet (PLT) recovery (PLT count > 100,000 cells/mm(3) ) in 64 patients with newly diagnosed AML who achieved a response after course 1 of VEN plus an HMA were evaluated. HMA therapy included azacitidine (75 mg/m(2) intravenously/subcutaneously for 7 days) or decitabine (20 mg/m(2) intravenously for 5 or 10 days). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (73%) received an azole: posaconazole (n = 17; 27%), voriconazole (n = 9; 14%), isavuconazole (n = 20; 31%), or fluconazole (n = 1; 2%). The median time to ANC recovery were similar for patients who did receive an azole (37 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 34-38 days) and patients who did not receive an azole (39 days; 95% CI, 30 days to not estimable; P = .8). The median time to PLT recovery was significantly longer for patients receiving azoles (28 vs 22 days; P = .01). The median times to ANC recovery (35 vs 38 days) and PLT recovery (26 vs 32 days) were similar with posaconazole and voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: VEN plus an HMA resulted in neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, with the latter prolonged in patients receiving concomitant azoles. Concomitant posaconazole or voriconazole and VEN (100 mg) resulted in similar ANC and PLT recovery times, suggesting the safety of these dosage combinations during course 1.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4166-5717', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1457-178X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5289-331X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0972-2766', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307']",20210401,PMC8249340,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'azole antifungals', 'invasive fungal infection', 'prophylaxis', 'venetoclax']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA235622/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA255721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA235622/NIH Clinical Center']",['2022/07/15 00:00'],,['NIHMS1678423'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 1.,"BACKGROUND: The achievement of a 3-month complete molecular response (CMR) is a major prognostic factor for survival in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, 25% of patients relapse during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: The authors reviewed 204 patients with Ph-positive ALL who were treated between January 2001 and December 2018 using the combination of hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) plus a TKI (imatinib, 44 patients [22%]; dasatinib, 88 patients [43%]; or ponatinib, 72 patients [35%]). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start date of therapy to the date of relapse, death, or last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start date of therapy to the date of death or last follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, a 3-month CMR was observed in 57% of patients, including 32% of those who received imatinib, 52% of those who received dasatinib, and 74% of those who received ponatinib. The median follow-up was 74 months (imatinib, 180 months; dasatinib, 106 months; ponatinib, 43 months). Among 84 patients in 3-month CMR, 17 (20%) proceeded to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 68% and 72%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, ponatinib therapy was the only significant favorable independent factor predicting for progression (P = .028; hazard ratio, 0.388; 95% CI, 0.166-0.904) and death (P = .042; hazard ratio, 0.379; 95% CI, 0.149-0.966). ASCT was not a prognostic factor for PFS and OS by univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Ph-positive ALL, ponatinib is superior to other types of TKIs in inducing and maintaining a CMR, thus preventing disease progression. ASCT does not improve outcome once a 3-month CMR is achieved.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2473-911X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8532-544X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119']",20210401,,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome-positive', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplant', 'complete molecular response', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']","['CA016672/National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center', 'Support Grant']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, no data have been published from Switzerland to assess effectiveness of recent healthcare advances in CLL/SLL on a population-based level. We aimed to estimate trends in incidence, mortality and survival for patients with CLL/SLL in Switzerland. METHODS: We retrospectively studied registry data from the National Agency for Cancer Registration (NACR) database in Switzerland from 1997 to 2016. We investigated incidence, mortality and survival in consecutive 5-year periods. Age-specific rates were calculated for three age groups (&lt;65 years, 65&ndash;74 years and &ge;75 years). RESULTS: We obtained 6301 cases with CLL/SLL. Median age at diagnosis was 72 years. From 7.0 per 100,000 person-years in 1997&ndash;2002, age-adjusted incidence rates peaked at 7.8 per 100,000 person-years in the second time period, 2002&ndash;2006, and declined afterwards to 6.4 per 100,000 person-years in 2012&ndash;2016. Mortality declined from 2.4 per 100,000 person-years in 1997&ndash;2002 to 2.0 per 100,000 in 2012&ndash;2016. Five- and 10-year age-standardised relative survival increased from 77.9% and 55.6%, respectively, in 1997&ndash;2001 to 83.6% (p = 0.009) and 64.2% (p = 0.005), respectively, in 2012&ndash;2016. Improvement in age-specific relative survival was only significant in the middle age group (65&ndash;74 years). Incidence and mortality were significantly higher in males. Females had better relative survival. CONCLUSION: We found no clear down- or upward trend in age-adjusted incidence rates. Age-standardised survival improved over time, mainly in the two younger age-groups, but this improvement was statistically significant in those aged 65&ndash;74 years only. Males have higher incidence rates, higher mortality and shorter survival than females. Reporting delay and underreporting are major limitations in the interpretation of registry data from patients diagnosed with CLL/SLL.",,,20210315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also an active ingredient in some species of the genus Hypericum. Emerging evidence suggests that hypericin has attracted great attention as a potential anticancer drug and exhibits remarkable antiproliferative effect upon irradiation on various tumour cells. This paper aims to summarise the anticancer effect and molecular mechanisms modulated by hypericin-medicated photodynamic therapy and its potential role in the cancer treatment. KEY FINDINGS: Hypericin-medicated photodynamic therapy could inhibit the proliferation of various tumour cells including bladder, colon, breast, cervical, glioma, leukaemia, hepatic, melanoma, lymphoma and lung cancers. The effect is primarily mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), JNK, PI3K, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)/TRIB3/Akt/mTOR, TRAIL/TRAIL-receptor, c-Met and Ephrin-Eph, the mitochondria and extrinsic signalling pathways. Furthermore, hypericin-medicated photodynamic therapy in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapies is more effective in inhibiting the growth of tumour cells. SUMMARY: During the past few decades, the anticancer properties of photoactivated hypericin have been extensively investigated. Hypericin-medicated photodynamic therapy can modulate a variety of proteins and genes and exhibit a great potential to be used as a therapeutic agent for various types of cancer.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: We performed a novel 11-step desensitization procedure to ibrutinib allowing us to successfully induce tolerance against IgE-mediated symptoms in this patient. DISCUSSION: As indications for ibrutinib use expand and more patients present with IgE-mediated symptoms, we expect that this protocol will provide benefit for many such patients.",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5173-275X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6563-9492']",20210401,,['NOTNLM'],"['Desensitization', 'IgE-mediated reaction', 'drug allergy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 1.,"INTRODUCTION: Drug resistance and relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still an important problem in the treatment of leukemia. Leukemia outbreak causes severe hypoxia in bone marrow (BM), remolding BM microenvironment (niche), and transforming hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche into leukemia stem cell (LSC) niche. AML cells and the microenvironment usually conduct ""cross-talk"" through cytokines to anchor resistant AML cells into LSC niche, thus supporting their survival. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the role of CXCL2 in the hypoxic AML niche. METHODS: AML hypoxic niche was simulated by hypoxic culture of THP-1 and HL-60 cells in vitro, thus to study the effects of CXCL2 on the proliferation and migration of AML cells. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and the activation of survival-related kinases such as PIM2 and mTOR under CoCl2 -simulated hypoxic conditions were detected. The correlation between CXCL2 and the prognosis of AML with big data was verified. RESULTS: (a) CXCL2 promoted the proliferation and migration of AML cells. (b) CXCL2 up-regulated the expression of PIM2 by enhancing the transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha. (c) CXCL2 activated mTOR in AML cells. (d) CXCL2 was associated with poor prognosis in AML. CONCLUSION: CXCL2 promotes survival, migration, and drug resistance pathway of AML cells in hypoxia and is associated with poor prognosis in AML. Therefore, CXCL2 can be considered as an important factor in promoting the development of AML cells in hypoxia.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1656-5546', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4331-2138']",20210401,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCL2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hypoxia', 'niche', 'proviral integration moloney 2']","['ldyyyn2018-56/Foundation of The First Affiliated Hospital of Lanzhou University', '18JR3RA342/the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 8.,"Current management of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) lacks immunosuppressant drugs able to block the host immune response toward the graft antigens. Novel treatments may include epigenetic compounds (epidrugs) some of which have been yet approved by the Food and Drugs Administration for the treatment of specific blood malignancies. The most investigated in clinical trials for allo-HSCT are DNA demethylating agents (DNMTi), such as azacitidine (Vidaza) and decitabine (Dacogen) as well as histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACi), such as vorinostat (Zolinza) and panobinostat (Farydak). Indeed, azacitidine monotherapy before allo-HSCT may reduce the conventional chemotherapy-related complications, whereas it may reduce relapse risk and death after allo-HSCT. Besides, a decitabine-containing conditioning regimen could protect against graft versus host disease (GVHD) and respiratory infections after allo-HSCT. Regarding HDACi, the addition of vorinostat and panobinostat to the conditioning regimen after allo-HSCT seems to reduce the incidence of acute GVHD. Furthermore, panobinostat alone or in combination with low-dose decitabine may reduce the relapse rate in high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia patients after allo-HSCT. We discuss the phase 1 and 2 clinical trials evaluating the possible beneficial effects of repurposing specific epidrugs which may guide personalized therapy in the setting of allo-HSCT.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2021 Apr 1.,"An aberrant activity of growth factor receptors followed by excessive cell proliferation plays a significant role in pathogenesis of cholangitis. Therefore, inhibition of these processes could be a fruitful therapeutic strategy. The effects of multi-kinase inhibitor 1-(4-Cl-benzyl)-3-chloro-4-(CF3-phenylamino)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (MI-1) on the hepatic and systemic manifestations of acute and chronic cholangitis in rats were addressed. MI-1 (2.7 mg/kg per day) was applied to male rats that experienced alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced acute (3 days) or chronic (28 days) cholangitis. Liver autopsy samples, blood serum markers, and leukograms were studied. MI-1 localization in liver cells and its impact on viability of HepG2 (human hepatoma), HL60 (human leukemia), and NIH3T3 (normal murine fibroblasts) cell lines and lymphocytes of human peripheral blood (MTT, DNA fragmentation, DNA comet assays, Propidium Iodide staining) were assessed. Under both acute and chronic cholangitis, MI-1 substantially reduced liver injury, fibrosis, and inflammatory scores (by 46-86%) and normalized blood serum markers and leukograms. Moreover, these effects were preserved after a 28-day recovery period (without any treatment). MI-1 inhibited the HL60, HepG2 cells, and human lymphocytes viability (IC50 0.6, 9.5 and 8.3 microg/ml, respectively), while NIH3T3 cells were resistant to that. Additionally, HepG2 cells and lymphocytes being incubated with MI-1 demonstrated insignificant pro-apoptotic and pro-necrotic changes and DNA single-strand breaks, suggesting that MI-1 effects in liver might be partly caused by its cytotoxic action towards liver cells and lymphocytes. In conclusion, MI-1 attenuated the systemic inflammation and signs of acute and chronic cholangitis partly through cytotoxicity towards cells of hepatic and leukocytic origin.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1296-1007'],20210401,,['NOTNLM'],"['1-(4-Cl-benzyl)-3-chloro-4-(CF3-phenylamino)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione', 'HL60', 'HepG2', 'Lymphocytes', 'NIH3T3 cells', 'Alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced cholangitis']","['0118U000244/Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine', '0119U100331/Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With currently available treatments, they have a very poor prognosis and, as such, are an example of group of cancers in which the development of effective precision therapies is needed. Using both short- and long-term drug sensitivity testing, we explored novel ways to target NK-cell neoplasms by combining the clinically approved JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib with other targeted agents. We profiled 7 malignant NK-cell lines in drug sensitivity screens and identified that these exhibit differential drug sensitivities based on their genetic background. In short-term assays, various classes of drugs combined with ruxolitinib seemed highly potent. Strikingly, resistance to most of these combinations emerged rapidly when explored in long-term assays. However, 4 combinations were identified that selectively eradicated the cancer cells and did not allow for development of resistance: ruxolitinib combined with the mouse double-minute 2 homolog (MDM2) inhibitor idasanutlin in STAT3-mutant, TP53 wild-type cell lines; ruxolitinib combined with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in TP53-mutant cell lines; and ruxolitinib combined with either the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) inhibitor S63845 but both without a clear link to underlying genetic features. In conclusion, using a new drug sensitivity screening approach, we identified drug combinations that selectively target mature NK-cell neoplasms and do not allow for development of resistance, some of which can be applied in a genetically stratified manner.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC8045497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the utility of MRD with venetoclax-based lower intensity regimens is unknown. We analyzed the prognostic value of achieving a negative MRD in older/""unfit"" patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax. MRD was evaluated in bone marrow specimens using multicolor flow cytometry (sensitivity 0.1%). Ninety-seven patients achieving either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or morphologic leukemia-free state were included. Median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 68-78 years), and 64% had adverse-risk AML. Eighty-three patients achieved CR/CRi, and 52 (54%) became MRD negative. Median time to becoming MRD negative was 2.0 months (interquartile range, 0.9-3.1 months). Patients becoming MRD negative by 2 months had longer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with those remaining MRD positive (median RFS, not reached vs 5.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.78; P = .004), longer event-free survival (EFS) (median EFS, not reached vs 5.8 months; HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.55; P < .001), as well as longer overall survival (OS) (median OS, 25.1 vs 7.1 months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51; P < .001). Patients achieving an MRD-negative CR had longer OS compared with those with an inferior response (median OS, 25.1 vs 11.6 months; HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58; P < .0005). Patients becoming MRD negative within 1 month had an improved OS compared with MRD-positive patients (median OS, 25.1 vs 3.4 months; HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.64; P < .0001). Differential impact of MRD status on survival outcomes persisted at a later 4-month time point of evaluation. In conclusion, MRD-negative status at 1, 2, and 4 months after starting therapy confers significantly better survival in older/unfit patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax.

Treatment with the type I inhibitor gilteritinib resulted in complete immunophenotypic and cytogenetic remission. This patient subsequently underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and remains in complete remission 1 year later.

We hypothesized that caloric and nutrient restriction from diet/exercise could lessen gains in fat mass (FM) and reduce postinduction MRD. The Improving Diet and Exercise in ALL (IDEAL) trial enrolled patients 10 to 21 years old, newly diagnosed with B-ALL (n = 40), in comparison with a recent historical control (n = 80). Designed to achieve caloric deficits >/=20% during induction, reduce fat intake/glycemic load, and increase activity, IDEAL's end points were FM gain (primary), MRD >/=0.01%, and adherence/feasibility. Integrated biology explored biomarkers of OW/OB physiology. IDEAL intervention did not significantly reduce median FM change from baseline overall (+5.1% [interquartile range [IQR], 15.8] vs +10.7% [IQR, 16.0]; P = .13), but stratified analysis showed benefit in those OW/OB (+1.5% [IQR, 6.6] vs +9.7% [IQR, 11.1]; P = .02). After accounting for prognostic factors, IDEAL intervention significantly reduced MRD risk (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.92; P = .02). The trial exceeded its adherence (>/=75% of overall diet) and feasibility (>/=80% completed visits) thresholds. Integrated biology found the IDEAL intervention increased circulating adiponectin and reduced insulin resistance. The IDEAL intervention was feasible, decreased fat gain in those OW/OB, and reduced MRD. This is the first study in any hematologic malignancy to demonstrate potential benefit from caloric restriction via diet/exercise to augment chemotherapy efficacy and improve disease response.

However, it has been used very few in hospital settings. So, in this study, the group psychodrama was applied to evaluate its effectiveness for. METHOD: Sixteen children with leukemia aged 6-9 years participated in the present randomized controlled trial. Eight children in the intervention group and eight children in the control group were randomly assigned. The intervention group participated in eight sessions of group psychodrama (during the hospitalization time) and the control group waited for the treatment. The score of the bio-psycho-social expressions of incompatibility in hospital (BPSEIH) checklist was the criterion of evaluation of the group psychodrama effectiveness. RESULTS: The results showed that group psychodrama was significantly effective in modifying the BPSEIH. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate the effectiveness of group psychodrama to moderate the psychological consequences of cancer and showed the feasibility of using this method in the hospital settings.",,,20210401,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'group psychodrama', 'leukemia', 'pediatrics', 'psychodrama']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective chart review of pediatric AML patients treated at our institution from 2010 to 2019 was conducted. Data was collected on length of hospitalization, antibiotics administered, infections, and neutropenia duration. Seventeen patients underwent 60 chemotherapy cycles. All were discharged after completion of chemotherapy if clinically stable. Patients were re-admitted for fever and discharged on empiric antibiotics if afebrile with negative cultures. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered in 55 cycles. There were 12 infections in 11 patients and no deaths due to infection. Patients remained outpatient for a mean of 15.8 neutropenia days per cycle. Outpatient supportive care for children with AML may be feasible and safe.

Epub 2021 Apr 1.,"Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) focusing on analyses of heart rate (HR) responses and chronotropic incompetence (CI) could provide early information about treatment's negative cardiac effects. We examined childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors' HR response during maximal CPET and identified survivors with CI. A total of 250 childhood ALL survivors underwent a CPET on ergocycle to assess their HR response. We used a multiparametric structure of three methods to assess survivors' CI, as follows: 1) age-predicted HRmax (APMHR): failure to achieve 85% of the APMHR at the peak of CPET; 2) HR reserve (HRR): failure to achieve 80% of the HRR at the peak of CPET; and 3) metabolic chronotropic relationship (MCR): failure to reach an MCR slope ratio >0.8 at each stage of the CPET. Among 250 childhood ALL survivors, 216 survivors performed a maximum CPET. We observed that 73 males and 74 females did not achieve their predicted HRmax. We found that 6 survivors did not achieve 85% of their APMHR (80.9 +/- 3.9%) and had an MCR below 80% (53.9 +/- 13.8%). In addition, 16 survivors did not achieve 80% of their HRR (71.0 +/- 7.4%) and among them, 15 survivors had an MCR below 80% (61.0 +/- 12.1%). Survivors with CI had a significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness than those without CI. This study shows that survivors are at risk of developing altered HR responses and CI many years after the end of their cancer treatments.

Based on the social ecology model, the current study is aimed at exploring the association between intrafamilial (family functioning, family support) and contextual (network support) resources, and the individual adjustment of siblings facing cancer in their brother/sister. Methods: Participants were 81 siblings of children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The mean siblings' age was 10.32 years. Siblings completed the Family Environment Scale, the Social Support Questionnaire for Children, the Situation-Specific Emotional Reactions Questionnaire, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Data were analyzed using a multi-level approach. Results: Family functioning, family support, and network support proved to be related to siblings' cancer-related emotional reactions post-diagnosis. In addition, the present study suggests taking into account the gender of the ill child and the age of the siblings.

Epub 2021 Apr 21.,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by absolute monocytosis, one or more lineage dysplasia, and proliferative features including myeloid hyperplasia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Because of vast clinical heterogeneity in presentation and course, risk stratification is used for a risk-adapted treatment strategy. Numerous prognostic scoring systems exist, some of which incorporate mutational information. Treatment ranges from observation to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therapies include hydroxyurea for cytoreduction, hypomethylating agents, and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to address splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Recently, oral decitabine with cedazuridine was approved and represents a convenient treatment option for CMML patients. Although novel therapeutics are in development for CMML, further work is needed to elucidate possible targets unique to the CMML clone. In this review, we will detail the pathophysiology, risk stratification, available treatment modalities, and novel therapies for CMML, and propose a modern treatment algorithm. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clinically heterogenous disease, which poses significant management challenges. The diagnosis of CMML requires bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with thorough evaluation. Risk stratification and symptom assessment are essential to designing an effective treatment plan, which may include hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in intermediate or high-risk patients. The recently approved oral decitabine/cedazuridine provides a convenient alternative to parenteral HMAs. Ruxolitinib may be effective in ameliorating proliferative symptoms and splenomegaly. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only treatment with curative potential; however, novel therapies are in clinical development which may significantly alter the therapeutic landscape of CMML.",['(c) 2021 AlphaMed Press.'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-4719-7192'],20210421,PMC8100553,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*MDS/MPN', '*Monocytosis', '*Overlap']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BTK inhibition was shown to protect against lethal influenza-induced acute lung injury in mice. Inhibiting BTK has been hypothesized to ameliorate lung injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). ObjectiveTo evaluate the use of BTK inhibitors (BTKinibs) during COVID-19 and assess how they may affect patient outcomes.Evidence ReviewWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science: Core on December 30, 2020. Clinical studies with at least 5 COVID-19 patients treated with BTKinibs were included. Case reports and reviews were excluded.FindingsOne hundred twenty-five articles were identified, 6 of which met inclusion criteria. Sample size ranged from 6 to 126 patients. Patient populations included subjects hospitalized with COVID-19 (6/6) and admitted to the intensive care unit (5/6). Patient age ranged between 35 and 98 years. Four studies included patients already receiving BTKinibs for their lymphoproliferative disease, 1 for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and 3 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The most common clinical outcomes measured were oxygen requirements (4/6) and hospitalization rate or duration (3/6). Differences in standard-of-care reflected the date of study and pre-existing conditions in the various patient cohorts. Full-dose acalabrutinib was evaluated in 2 studies, one study evaluated full-dose ibrutinib, and another study evaluated both ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. The remainder 2 studies described outcomes in CLL patients on multiple BTKinibs and other CLL-targeted treatments. Three studies showed decreased oxygen requirements in patients who started or continued BTKinibs. All three studies that evaluated hospitalization rate or duration found favorable outcomes in those on BTKinibs. Conclusions and RelevanceBTKinib use was associated with decreased oxygen requirements and decreased hospitalization rates and duration. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the beneficial effects of BTKinibs for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8189-7769'],20210322,PMC8010740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Immunol. 2021 Aug 2;230:108816.

Alterations in tumour cell metabolism were first described nearly a century ago and have been acknowledged as one of the key characteristics of cancers including cALL. Two of the backbone chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of this disease, Glucocorticoids and L-asparaginase, are exerting their anti-leukaemic effects through targeting cell metabolism. Even though risk stratification and treatment regimens have improved cure rates to nearly 90%, prognosis for relapsed children remains poor. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently required. Atovaquone is a well-tolerated drug used in the clinic mainly against malaria. Being a ubiquinone analogue, this drug inhibits co-enzyme Q10 of the electron transport chain (ETC) affecting oxidative phosphorylation and cell metabolism. In this study we tested the effect of Atovaquone on cALL cells in vitro. Pharmacologically relevant concentrations of the inhibitor could effectively target mitochondrial respiration in both cALL cell lines (REH and Sup-B15) and primary patient samples. We found that Atovaquone leads to a marked decrease in basal respiration and ATP levels, as well as reduced proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis. Importantly, we observed an enhanced anti-leukaemic effect when Atovaquone was combined with the standard chemotherapeutic Idarubicin, or with Prednisolone in an in vitro model of Glucocorticoid resistance. Repurposing of this clinically approved inhibitor renders further investigations, but also presents opportunities for fast-track trials as a single agent or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sbirkov, Ivanova, Burnusuzov, Gercheva, Petrie, Schenk and', 'Sarafian.']",,20210315,PMC8005808,['NOTNLM'],"['acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'atovaquone', 'glucocorticoid resistance', 'metabolism', 'mitochondria']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this registry study, we aimed to identify the efficacy of HID G-PB HSCT (HID-PBSCT) for acute leukemia (AL) patients in first complete remission (CR1). Also, we reported the outcomes for the use of G-PB grafts in comparison with the combination of G-BM and G-PB grafts in HID HSCT recipients. Sixty-seven AL patients in CR1 who received HID-PBSCT were recruited at Institute of Hematology, Peking University. Patients who received haploidentical HSCT using the combination of G-BM and G-PB harvests in the same period were enrolled as controls (n=392). The median time from HSCT to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 12 days (range, 9-19 days) and 12 days (range, 8-171 days), respectively. The 28-day cumulative incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment after HSCT was 98.5% and 95.5%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 29.9% (95%CI 18.8-40.9%) and 7.5% (95%CI 1.1-13.8%), respectively. The cumulative incidences of total and moderate-severe chronic GVHD were 54.9% (95%CI 40.9-68.8%) and 17.4% (95%CI 6.7-28.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality were 13.9% (95%CI 5.4-22.5%) and 3.4% (95%CI 0-8.1%), respectively. The probabilities of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 84.7% (95%CI 74.7-94.7%) and 82.7% (95%CI 73.3-92.1%) respectively. Compared with the HID HSCT recipients using the combination of G-BM and G-PB grafts, the engraftments of neutrophil and platelet were both significantly faster for the G-PB group, and the other clinical outcomes were all comparable between the groups.

Children with malignancy are particularly at risk of developing conditions that may require CRRT. We reported three children with malignancy who received CRRT for non-AKI indications. Patient 1 was a 17-year-old teenage girl who developed refractory type B lactic acidosis due to relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Her peak lactate level was 18 mmol/L, and the lowest pH and bicarbonate level was 7.13 and 6.0 mmol/L, respectively. She received three sessions of high-volume hemodiafiltration to bring down the lactate level. Patient 2 was a 15-year-old male with T-cell ALL who developed cytokine storm requiring mechanical ventilatory and high-dose inotropic support due to necrotizing enterocolitis complicated by pneumoperitoneum and Klebsiella pneumoniae septicemia. He received two sessions of hemoperfusion using a specific filter capable of endotoxin absorption and cytokine removal and was successfully weaned off all inotropes after the treatment. Patient 3 was an 8-year-old boy who received bone marrow transplantation and developed worsening hyperbilirubinemia and deteriorating liver function. He received a session of single-pass albumin dialysis for bilirubin removal prior to liver biopsy. Except for mild electrolyte disturbances, no major CRRT complication was encountered. Our report demonstrated that CRRT is an effective and safe procedure for a wide spectrum of nonrenal conditions among children with oncological diagnoses in the pediatric intensive care unit.

Three regions can be involved in PCNSL: the brain, the spine, or the vitreus and retina. Spinal PCNSL is rare. It can mimic neoplasm, infection, and inflammation. Diagnostic confirmation is by tissue biopsy, and even then, tissue corroboration may be altered by an inflammatory overlay. We report a 59-year-old woman who we saw after she had 4 weeks of ascending tetraparesis plus bowel and bladder incontinence. Upon presentation, the patient was ventilator-dependent and locked-in. She reported normal sensation through eye-blinking. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed signal intensity in the bilateral corona radiata and restricted diffusion in the right thalamus, whereas, MRI cervical, and thoracic spine showed T2 prolongation in the anterior medulla and upper cervical cord, with enhancement to C2-C3, and long segment hyperintensity from T1-T9 levels, respectively, suggestive of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Cerebrospinal fluid cytomorphology and flow cytometry were inconclusive for lymphoma/leukemia, but oligoclonal bands were present. Serum aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) antibodies were negative. MR spectroscopy demonstrated NAA reduction, mild lipid lactate peak, and relative reduction of choline on the side of the lesion, favoring demyelination. She received 5-days of intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by 7 sessions of plasma exchange without clinical improvement. Stereotactic biopsy of the right thalamic lesion revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Epub 2021 Mar 17.,"Treatment for higher-risk patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) should aim to modify the disease course by avoiding progression to acute myeloid leukemia and improving survival. When a patient is not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and lacks a donor hematopoietic cell source, or for a patient in a poor economic situation, consideration can be given to the use of Chinese herbal medicine. Numerous plant extracts, such as camptothecin, vinblastine and paclitaxel, have been reported to display antitumor effects, serving as potential therapeutic strategies for cancer. In the present study, the ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (Waters Corporation) was used to detect the main chemical components of HDE, CCK-8 assay to detect the effects of HDE and BIIB021 on the proliferation of SKM-1 cells; and designed hTERT-small interfering (si)RNAs to detect the effects of HDE and BIIB021 on SKM-1 cell apoptosis after HTERT gene knockdown. The present study investigated a newly extracted coumarin HDE, the active component in Oldenlandia diffusa Willd, which efficiently inhibited SKM-1 (MDS cell line) proliferation and induced apoptosis, as determined by performing Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The effect of HDE was associated with decreased telomerase activity. Moreover, heat shock protein 90 inhibitor BIIB021 significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of HDE on SKM-1 cells. In addition, SKM-1 cell apoptosis was increased in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-knockdown cells compared with the negative control group. Cell apoptosis in hTERT-knockdown SKM-1 cells was further enhanced following HDE, BIIB021 or combination treatment, as evidenced by increased levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8 and cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase. Collectively, the results indicated synergistic antitumor effects of HDE and BIIB021, providing a novel therapeutic combination for higher-risk MDS.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Spandidos Publications.']",,20210317,PMC8005740,['NOTNLM'],"['antitumor effects', 'drug combination', 'human telomerase reverse transcriptase', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idelalisib is a highly selective inhibitor of the PI3K p110 partial differential isoform and is approved for the treatment of CLL in patients with relapsed/refractory disease or in those harboring 17p deletions or tp53 mutations. Despite the initial excitement centered around high response rates in clinical trials of idelalisib, its therapeutic success has been hindered by the incidence of severe opportunistic infections. To examine the potential contribution of idelalisib to the increased risk of infection, we investigated the effects of idelalisib on the immune cell compartments of healthy donors (HDs) and CLL patients. PI3K partial differential blockade by idelalisib reduced the expression levels of inhibitory checkpoint molecules in T cells isolated from both HDs and CLL patients. In addition, the presence of idelalisib in cultures significantly decreased T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and granzyme B secretion, as well as cytokine secretion levels in both cohorts. Furthermore, idelalisib reduced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of HD NK cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that both human T and NK cells are highly sensitive to PI3K partial differential inhibition. Idelalisib interfered with the functions of T and NK cell cells from both HDs and CLL patients. Therefore, idelalisib might contribute to an increased risk of infections regardless of the underlying B-cell malignancy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Rohrbacher, Brauchle, Ogrinc Wagner, von Bergwelt-Baildon,', 'Bucklein and Subklewe.']",,20210315,PMC8005712,['NOTNLM'],"['*PI3K inhibition', '*cancer immunotherapy', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*idelalisib', '*immune effector cells']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two ready-to-dilute (RTD) formulations of BND HCl on the US market: a large-volume, long-duration infusion (BND-L) and a small-volume, short-duration infusion (BND-S). It is estimated that the shorter duration infusion could result in cost savings to infusion facilities. Objective: Estimate the one-year budget impact between BND-S and BND-L for use in the treatment of CLL and iNHL when all current BND-L utilization is replaced with BND-S, from the US infusion facility perspective. Methods: An illustrative budget impact model estimated the change in costs associated with a projected increase from 50% to 100% market share for BND-S. The model included CLL and iNHL patient populations. Budgetary costs reflected facility expenditures on drug acquisition and administration based on recommended dosing for BND-S and BND-L. The base-case model assumptions and inputs were derived from scientific literature and publicly available resources. The total budget impact was calculated annually, along with the differences in per patient cost; one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Per-patient savings with BND-S use after the utilization shift were estimated at $2812.24 for CLL and $4769.01 for iNHL. Across both indications, the total annual incremental savings after the utilization shift were estimated at $452,209 for 250 CLL and iNHL patients in a 10,000-patient infusion facility, resulting in cost savings of $150.74 per BND HCI patient per month and $1808.84 per BND HCI patient per year. The model was sensitive to changes in proportion of patients receiving BND HCI infusions for CLL and iNHL, patient body surface area, and BND-S wholesale acquisition cost. Conclusion: This analysis estimated over $450,000 in annual savings for a 10,000-patient chemotherapy infusion facility following a utilization shift from 50% use of each RTD product to 100% use of BND-S in CLL and iNHL patients, driven by lower acquisition costs for BND-S and lower administration labor costs associated with rapid infusion.",['(c) 2021 James et al.'],,20210322,PMC7997603,['NOTNLM'],"['bendamustine', 'budget impact', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'infusion']",,,"['Dr Elizabeth James, Dr Holly Trautman received consulting fees from Teva', 'Pharmaceuticals.

Despite these advances, many patients will eventually require alternative treatment strategies due to the emergence of tolerability issues or resistance to these novel agents. Duvelisib is a first-in-class, potent oral agent with dual inhibitor activity against the delta and gamma isoforms of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kdelta and PI3Kgamma), which are specific to the hematopoietic system. Dysregulation of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway has been implicated in cancer cell growth, survival and metabolism and has been the subject of cancer drug development in recent years. Duvelisib demonstrated activity in CLL/SLL in early trials, leading to further evaluation in the Phase 3 DUO trial that compared duvelisib against ofatumumab in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL. This trial led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of adult patients with CLL/SLL after at least two prior lines of therapy. The major reason for therapy discontinuation is the development of serious adverse events, which include severe infections and diarrhea/colitis, precluding its widespread use. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating duvelisib in combination strategies and with alternate dosing schedules in patients with CLL/SLL. With close monitoring, duvelisib can be a promising drug for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. This review summarizes the relevant clinical data from recent clinical advances in CLL and aims to interpret the duvelisib trials while exploring strategies to improve its use and adverse event management in the era of novel targeted agents.",['(c) 2021 Shah and Barrientos.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8159-4212', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6018-5535']",20210325,PMC8006759,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL/SLL', 'PI3K', 'duvelisib', 'relapsed/refractory']",,,"['JCB has received honoraria for consulting for Gilead, AstraZeneca, Janssen,', 'Genentech, Abbvie and research support from Pharmacyclics/Abbvie, AstraZeneca,', 'and Gilead.

In this study, we developed and applied a hypergravity exposure system as a novel strategy to improve the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to natural killer (NK) cells for efficient immunotherapy. Following exposure to hypergravity, either in the presence or absence of NK cells, we investigated for changes in the cell cytoskeletal structure, which is related to the F-actin mediated immune evasion mechanism (referred to as ""actin response"") of cancer cells. Breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed thrice to a 20 min hypergravitational condition (10 x g), with a 20 min rest period between each exposure. The applied hypergravity induces changes in the intracellular cytoskeleton structure without decreasing the cell viability but increasing the cytotoxicity of MDA-MB-231 from 4 to 18% (4.5-fold) at a 3:1 ratio (NK-to-target). Analyses related to F-actin further demonstrate that the applied hypergravity results in rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, leading to inhibition of the actin response of MDA-MB-231. Taken together, our results suggest that the mechanical load increases through application of hypergravity, which potentially improves efficiency of cell-based immunotherapies by sensitizing tumors to immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",,,20210331,PMC8012622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to leukemia development and how this informs the use of targeted therapies is critical to improving outcomes for patients. Importantly, how to target loss-of-function mutations has been a critical challenge in precision medicine. Heterozygous inactivating mutations in cohesin complex genes contribute to AML in adults by increasing the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by altering PRC2 targeting to induce HOXA9 expression, a key self-renewal transcription factor. Here we sought to delineate the epigenetic mechanism underpinning the enhanced self-renewal conferred by cohesin-haploinsufficiency. First, given the substantial difference in the mutational spectrum between pediatric and adult AML patients, we first sought to identify if HOXA9 was also elevated in children. Next, using primary HSPCs as a model we demonstrate that abnormal self-renewal due to cohesin loss is blocked by DOT1L inhibition. In cohesin-depleted cells, DOT1L inhibition is associated with H3K79me2 depletion and a concomitant increase in H3K27me3. Importantly, we find that there are cohesin-dependent gene expression changes that promote a leukemic profile, including HoxA overexpression, that are preferentially reversed by DOT1L inhibition. Our data further characterize how cohesin mutations contribute to AML development, identifying DOT1L as a potential therapeutic target for adult and pediatric AML patients harboring cohesin mutations.",,,20210331,PMC8012605,,,"['F30 CA236322/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA215317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM080202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such adaptations can confer intrinsic vulnerabilities, enabling the selective targeting of cancer cells. Through a pooled in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we identified the adenosine triphosphatase associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA-ATPase) valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a top stress-related vulnerability in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We established that AML was the most responsive disease to chemical inhibition of VCP across a panel of 16 cancer types. The sensitivity to VCP inhibition of human AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and syngeneic and xenograft mouse models of AML was validated using VCP-directed shRNAs, overexpression of a dominant-negative VCP mutant, and chemical inhibition. By combining mass spectrometry-based analysis of the VCP interactome and phospho-signaling studies, we determined that VCP is important for ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activation and subsequent DNA repair through homologous recombination in AML. A second-generation VCP inhibitor, CB-5339, was then developed and characterized. Efficacy and safety of CB-5339 were validated in multiple AML models, including syngeneic and patient-derived xenograft murine models. We further demonstrated that combining DNA-damaging agents, such as anthracyclines, with CB-5339 treatment synergizes to impair leukemic growth in an MLL-AF9-driven AML murine model. These studies support the clinical testing of CB-5339 as a single agent or in combination with standard-of-care DNA-damaging chemotherapy for the treatment of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Often, donated blood is also screened for human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus, Chagas, dengue, Babesia, cytomegalovirus, malaria, and other infections. Several billion diagnostic tests are performed annually around the world to measure more than 400 biomarkers for cardiac, cancer, infectious, and other diseases. Considering such volumes, every improvement in assay performance and/or throughput has a major impact. Here, we show that medically relevant assay sensitivities and specificities can be fundamentally improved by direct single-molecule imaging using regular epifluorescence microscopes. In current microparticle-based assays, an ensemble of bound signal-generating molecules is measured as a whole. By contrast, we acquire intensity profiles to identify and then count individual fluorescent complexes bound to targets on antibody-coated microparticles. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio and provides better discrimination over nonspecific effects. It brings the detection sensitivity down to the attomolar (10(-18) M) for model assay systems and to the low femtomolar (10(-16) M) for measuring analyte in human plasma. Transitioning from counting single-molecule peaks to averaging pixel intensities at higher analyte concentrations enables a continuous linear response from 10(-18) to 10(-5) M. Additionally, our assays are insensitive to microparticle number and volume variations during the binding reaction, eliminating the main source of uncertainties in standard assays. Altogether, these features allow for increased assay sensitivity, wide linear detection ranges, shorter incubation times, simpler assay protocols, and minimal reagent consumption.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0481-3856', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4641-954X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5906-8710', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1272-2660']",,PMC8040638,['NOTNLM'],"['*diagnostics', '*fluorescence', '*immunoassays', '*microparticles', '*single-molecule imaging']",,,"['Competing interest statement: All authors are employed by Abbott Laboratories,', 'which funded the research.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Feb 6.,"Sexual dysfunction and fertility related issues appear as major post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) late effects in young women, with a heavy impact on quality of life. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of disease and treatments on sexual quality of life, ovarian function, and family planning initiatives in the context of allogeneic HSCT. Between January 2014 and January 2016, adult female patients who underwent HSCT before age 35 and had been followed for more than 2 years in our center were offered participation in the study through a self-reported survey and/or ovarian function assessment if age <40 at inclusion. A total of 63 patients were included, with a median age of 23.4 years at transplantation and 30.9 years at inclusion. Twenty-nine patients (46%) underwent HSCT for acute leukemia and 16 (25%) underwent HSCT for aplastic anemia (AA). The conditioning regimen was myeloablative conditioning (MAC) in 37 patients (59%) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in 26 (41%). Fifty-eight patients completed the survey, and 34 were evaluated for ovarian function. Symptoms of hypoestrogenism were reported by 86% of the patients and changes in sexual life were reported by 76%, due mainly to low sex drive, negative impact of infertility problems, physical sequelae, and loss of self-confidence. Premature ovarian failure (POF) occurred in 74% of patients and was significantly associated with conditioning regimen (MAC versus RIC; P = .001) and baseline disease (bone marrow failure versus acute leukemia versus others; P < .001). However, one-half of the patients developed a POF despite the use of a RIC regimen. For 27 patients (47%), disease and treatments modified their desire for pregnancy, due mainly to fear of relapse and of disease transmission to offspring. Thirteen pregnancies were reported (21%), of which 8 were spontaneous and 5 were obtained through assisted reproductive technologies, mainly oocyte donation. With a median post-transplantation follow-up of 12.2 years, the 10-year cumulative incidence of first pregnancy was 16.6% (95% CI, 8.8-30.0). Among 20 patients (32%) who engaged in a family planning initiative, 13 (65%) succeeded in having children: 11 got pregnant and 2 adopted. Sixteen patients benefited from fertility preservation techniques consisting of ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and a single autologous ovarian tissue transplantation had been performed at the time of this report. This study shows a strong impact of disease and treatments on sexual quality of life, ovarian function, and family planning initiatives in the context of HSCT. It demonstrates the need to improve clinicians' awareness of sexual health- and fertility-related issues after HSCT. The difficulty of predicting ovarian function and fertility issues after RIC supports wide indications of pretransplantation fertility preservation. Evaluation of the use of cryopreserved ovarian tissues is warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Studies have shown that extracellular exosomes derived from BM-MSCs are a key pro-invasive factor. However, how BM-MSC-exos influence AML cell proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance remains poorly understood. METHODS: We isolated exosomes from BM-MSCs and used electron microscopy, particle size separation and western blots to identify the exosomes. The invasion of leukemia cells was observed with a transwell assay. The stemness traits and chemoresistance of the leukemia cells were detected by FCM, colony formation and CCK-8 assays. TCGA database was used to investigate the prognostic relevance of S100A4 and its potential role in AML. RESULTS: In this study, we found that BM-MSC-exos increased the metastatic potential, maintained the stemness and contributed to the chemoresistance of leukemia cells. Mechanistically, BM-MSC-exos promoted the proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance of leukemia cells via upregulation of S100A4. Downregulating S100A4 clearly suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance of leukemia cells after treatment with BM-MSC-exos. Bioinformatic analysis with data in TCGA database showed that S100A4 was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, and functional enrichment revealed its involvement in the processes of cell-cell adhesion and cytokine regulation. CONCLUSIONS: S100A4 is vital in the BM-MSC-exo-driven proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance of leukemia cells and may serve as a potential target for leukemia therapy.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1659-7441'],20210331,PMC8011411,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemoresistance', 'Exosome', 'Invasion', 'Mesenchymal stem cells']","['SBGJ2018085/Medical Science and Technology Research Plan (Joint Construction)', 'Project of Henan Province', 'LHGJ20190676/Medical Science and Technology Research Plan (Joint Construction)', 'Project of Henan Province', '202102310157/Henan Provincial Science and Technology Research Project']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It decreases T cell count leading to significant immunosuppression, with increased risk of systemic and ocular infections. Herein, we report a unique case of bilateral acute retinal necrosis (ARN) caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in a patient affected by MS under treatment with alemtuzumab. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old man with a relapsing-remitting MS under treatment with alemtuzumab developed bilateral visual loss. Anterior segment examination displayed granulomatous keratic precipitates and 3+ cells in the anterior chamber, while fundoscopy showed bilateral 1+ vitritis and peripheral retinal necrosis, complicated by retinal detachment in the left eye. The high viral load for VZV in aqueous humor samples had a univocal interpretation for viral reactivation. In addition to systemic therapy with acyclovir, the patient was treated with bilateral intravitreal injections of foscarnet and underwent pars-plana vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade for retinal detachment in the left eye. CONCLUSION: This report shows a unique case of bilateral ARN caused by VZV associated with alemtuzumab. Any visual loss in MS patients under biologic therapy should not be underestimated, performing an accurate differential diagnosis with optic neuritis.",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7716-7261', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5940-6177', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3238-9682', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2989-6712']",20210331,,['NOTNLM'],"['Panuveitis', 'infections/inflammations', 'neuro ophthalmology', 'optic neuritis', 'orbital disease', 'pars plana vitrectomy', 'retina', 'retinal herpetic infections', 'uveitis', 'vitreous/endophthalmitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: From May 2017 to January 2019, three cases of myeloid leukemia patients with normal karyotype and negative for common fusion genes from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were selected as the research objects. The transcriptome sequencing of bone marrow mononuclear cells was performed by high-throughput gene sequencing technology. Defuse software was used to analyze the gene fusion sequence in the transcriptome data, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing were used to verify the fusion gene with clear pathological significance. Results: All three patients were diagnosed with myeloid leukemia by clinical manifestations, bone marrow cell morphology, immunology, and histochemical staining. Cytogenetic tests showed normal chromosome karyotypes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and RT-PCR were used to detect BCR-ABL1, PML-RARA, and other common fusion genes. The results were all negative. Transcriptome sequencing and fusion transcripts analysis revealed that these three patients carried rare fusion genes with clear pathological significance, which included BCR-FGFR1, CPSF6-RARG, and NUP98-RARG, respectively.

Methods: One hundred and twenty-five AML patients of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) from November 2001 to March 2010 were involved, including 70 patients who received chemotherapy only and other 55 patients treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in addition to chemotherapy. According to the median expression of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1, patients of chemotherapy group were divided into high expression sub-group(n=35) and low expression sub-group (n=35), and patients of allo-HSCT group were also divided into high expression sub-group (n=28) and low expression sub-group (n=27) for prognosis analysis. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis, including peripheral white blood cell counts (WBC), blast percentages in peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM), French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and the frequencies of common genetic mutations in AML were described. The event-free survival (EFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate of patients in different groups were analyzed, and the influence of the clinical characteristics of patients on the prognosis of AML was analyzed by COX multivariate analysis. Results: In the chemotherapy group, patients with low lncRNA-MBNL1-AS1 expression had significantly lower EFS and OS (60.0%, 8.6%) than patients with high lncRNA-MBNL1-AS1 expression (68.6%, 34.3%) (chi(2)=7.817, 10.880, all P<0.01). However, in the alloHSCT group, no significant differences were observed in EFS and OS of patients between high and low expression groups of lncRNA-MBNL1-AS1 (all P>0.05). COX multivariate analysis confirmed that age>/=60 years old (EFS: HR (95%CI): 6.934 (1.918-25.075),P=0.003;OS: HR (95%CI): 4.119 (1.812-9.364), P=0.001), and low expression of lncRNA MBNL1-AS1 (EFS: HR (95%CI): 0.354 (0.126-0.941), P=0.038; OS: HR (95%CI): 0.424 (0.231-0.778), P=0.006)were independent risk factors for EFS and OS in the chemotherapy group.

Methods: A cohort of 263 B-ALL cases was enrolled at Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital from September 2018 to September 2020. An integrated bioinformatics pipeline was developed to adapt the classification and quantification of IKZF1 transcripts from RNA-seq and was applied to sequencing data of these cases. The IKZF1 mutant transcripts classified by RNA-seq analysis were compared with the qualitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Results: IKZF1 mutant transcripts were identified in 53 B-ALL patients by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, among which IK6 and IK10 transcripts accounted for 67.9% (36/53) and 28.3% (15/53) respectively. Additionally, 2 patients were double positive for IK6 and IK10. RNA-seq analysis identified 51 patients with IKZF1 mutant transcripts. Compared with the RT-PCR result, the detection sensitivity and specificity of RNA-seq analysis reached 94.3% (50/53) and 99.5% (209/210), respectively. Among the 50 patients with IKZF1 mutant transcripts both in RNA-seq and RT-PCR analysis, the ratio of mutant transcripts to total IKZF1 transcripts in 6 patients was 0.14 (0.11, 0.35), which was significantly lower than that of the other 44 patients [0.88 (0.35, 0.97), Z=-3.945,P<0.001]. IKZF1 mutations mostly occurred in Ph(+)and Ph-like B-ALL, characterized by abnormal JAK-STAT pathway, and B-ALL with PAX5 translocation. Conclusions: Through the optimized bioinformatics analysis process, RNA-seq data can be used to classify and quantitatively analyze IKZF1 transcripts in B-ALL. Furthermore, the relative expression of mutant IKZF1 transcripts was found to cluster into two groups, and IKZF1 mutation was found often accompanied with PAX5 translocations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, CAR-T cells have shown extraordinary effects in hematologic diseases including chemotherapy-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In this approach, autologous T cells isolated from the patient's body genetically engineered to express a tumor specific synthetic receptor against a tumor antigen, then these cells expanded ex vivo and re-infusion back to the patient body. Recently, significant clinical response and high rates of complete remission of CAR T cell therapy in B-cell malignancies led to the approval of Kymriah and Yescarta (CD19-directed CAR-T cells) were by FDA for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Despite promising therapeutic outcomes, CAR T cells also can elicit the immune-pathologic effects, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), and on-target off-tumor toxicity, that hampered its application. Ineffective control of these highly potent synthetic cells causes discussed potentially life-threatening toxicities, so researchers have developed several mechanisms to remote control CAR T cells.

In the pre-TKI era, front-line allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) represented the standard approach for patients with chronic phase-CML (CP-CML) who were deemed fit to tolerate the procedure and had a human leukocyte antigen compatible donor available. Currently, CP-CML patients are eligible for allo-HCT only if they fail more than one TKI and/or are intolerant to the drug. We performed a systematic review/meta-analysis of the available literature to assess the evidence regarding allo-HCT efficacy in CP-CML patients. Data from eligible studies were extracted in relation to benefits (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival, disease-free survival [DFS], complete remission [CR], and molecular response [MR]) and harms (nonrelapse mortality [NRM], relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease), and stratified by age into adult and pediatric groups. For adult allo-HCT recipients, the pooled OS, DFS, CR and, MR were 84% [95% confidence interval (CI) 59-99%], 66% (95% CI 59-73%), 56% (95% CI 30-80%), and 88% (95% CI 62-98%), respectively. Pooled NRM and relapse were 20% (95% CI 15-26%) and 19% (95% CI 10-28%), respectively. For the pediatric group, the OS rate was reported in one study and was 91% (95% CI 72-99%). Our results suggest that allo-HCT is an effective treatment for TKI-resistant or TKI-intolerant CP-CML. Post-transplant strategies are still needed to further mitigate the risk of relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2021 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre. Published', 'by Elsevier Ltd.

Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target Plk1 and some of them have reached clinical trials in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Pediatric AML patients have a poor prognosis and survivors suffer from long-term side effects. As adult AML cells have an elevated expression of Plk1, AML is a disease candidate for Plk1 inhibition. However, the relative success of clinical trials have been hampered by adverse reactions. Herein, PLK1-targeting RNA interference (RNAi) prodrugs that enter cells without a transfection reagent are used to target PLK1 selectively in primary cells from pediatric AML patients. We show that PLK1 and PLK4 mRNA expression are significantly higher in pediatric AML patients when compared to healthy donors and that PLK1 is downregulated by on average 50% using RNAi prodrugs without a significant effect on other PLK family members. In addition, the RNAi prodrug-induced decrease in PLK1 can be used to potentiate the effect of cytarabine. In summary, PLK1-targeting RNAi prodrugs can decrease the elevated levels of PLK1 in primary cells from pediatric AML patients and sensitize pediatric AML cells to chemotherapeutics.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We examined the effect of bioreductive activation of the anthracyclines, doxorubicin (DOX) and pirarubicin (PIRA), by cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) on triggering apoptosis of leukaemia HL60 cells and their MDR counterparts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell cycle and FAS expression were investigated by flow cytometry. DNA fragmentation was examined by electrophoretic analysis and caspase-3/8 activities were determined colorimetrically. RESULTS: Non-activated and CPR-activated forms of DOX and PIRA (IC90) had similar efficacy in provoking G2/M arrest of sensitive HL60 as well as resistant HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX cells and in causing DNA degradation. Interestingly, HL60/VINC cells were more prone to apoptosis induced by all studied forms of these drugs. However, no change in Fas expression was observed. CONCLUSION: Bioreductive activation of DOX and PIRA does not affect their ability to induce apoptosis of sensitive and resistant HL60 leukaemia cells.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Doxorubicin', 'HL60 human promyelocytic leukaemia cells', 'NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase', 'apoptosis', 'multidrug resistance', 'pirarubicin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"BACKGROUND: Carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2 ; glucarpidase) is a rescue drug for patients at risk for kidney injury from high-dose methotrexate (MTX). As there are no strategies for predicting patients who will require CDPG2 , we evaluated the role of demographic, clinical, and genetic factors for CPDG2 use. PROCEDURE: Cases who received CPDG2 and controls who did not were identified by chart review of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received MTX doses between 1000 and 5000 mg/m(2) between 2010 and 2017. We used multivariable Bayesian logistic regression to evaluate the association of CPDG2 use with demographic and clinical variables and, on a subset of patients, with genetic ancestry and 49 single nucleotide variants previously associated with MTX toxicity. RESULTS: We identified 423 patients who received 1592 doses of MTX. Of the 18 patients who received CPDG2 , 17 (94%) were Hispanic. No patients who received 1000 or 2000 mg/m(2) of MTX received CPDG2 . Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio: 4.68; 95% compatibility interval: 1.63-15.06) and older age (1.87 [1.17-3.17]) were associated with receiving CPDG2 . Of the 177 patients in the genomic cohort, 11 received CPDG2 . Each additional G allele of rs7317112 in ABCC4 increased the odds of requiring CPDG2 (3.10 [1.12-6.75]). Six other loci (NTRK1/rs10908521, TSG1/rs9345389, STT3B/rs1353327, SCLO1B1/rs4149056, GATA3/rs3824662, ARID5B/rs10821936) demonstrated probabilities of association between 88% and 97%. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that demographic characteristics, including Hispanic ethnicity and age, are associated with CPDG2 use. Additionally, we provide evidence that inherited genetic variation is associated with risk of requiring CPDG2 . If validated in independent populations, this information could be leveraged to develop targeted toxicity prevention strategies for children with ALL.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0997-906X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9612-3624', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0892-7727', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4081-8195', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0978-5863', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8379-6088']",20210331,PMC8238882,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hispanic ethnicity', '*ancestry', '*genetics', '*glucarpidase', '*methotrexate', '*pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",['T32 GM007526/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['2022/02/01 00:00'],,['NIHMS1700830'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of osteonecrosis in children with ALL. PROCEDURE: The cohort included 559 children aged 1-20 years diagnosed with ALL between 2003 and 2018 at two tertiary medical centers in Israel and enrolled in two consecutive protocols: ALL-IC BFM 2002 and AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009. Symptomatic osteonecrosis was prospectively captured as an adverse event. RESULTS: Osteonecrosis occurred in 51 patients (9.1%). Ninety-four percent of the events were graded as moderate or severe (grades 3-4, Ponte di Legno Toxicity Working Group classification) and multiple bone involvement was common. Full resolution of osteonecrosis was documented in only 16% of the children (median follow-up 4.2 years). Stepwise logistic regression identified five risk factors for osteonecrosis, with a high predictive value (AUC = 0.88): older ageat ALL diagnosis, high-risk ALL group, T-cell immunophenotype, female gender, and a novel risk factor: bone pain at the time of leukemia diagnosis. In addition, osteonecrosis was less common among children of Arab ethnicity. Thrombophilia and an elevated age-adjusted body mass index were not confirmed as risk factors for osteonecrosis. CONCLUSION: Due to the low rates of osteonecrosis resolution and its debilitating long-term impact, the identification of patients at high risk for osteonecrosis is important for their inclusion in further studies evaluating potential therapeutic adjustments.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3994-0556', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3763-5694', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6938-2540', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3495-7578']",20210331,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*bone pain', '*osteonecrosis', '*risk factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These virtual components will likely be incorporated into future iterations of these conferences even as in-person attendance is reincorporated. In this review, we discuss ways in which usage of the social networking platform Twitter has expanded in the past year during virtual conferences as a method to facilitate-and, in some ways, democratize-information flow and professional networking. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging Twitter-based tools in malignant hematology include presenter-developed #tweetorials, conference-specific ""poster walks,"" and disease-specific online journal clubs. Twitter is also increasingly being used for networking across institutional and international lines, allowing for conversations to continue year-round as a first step toward multicenter collaborations as well as in-person #tweetups at subsequent meetings. The ability of Twitter to enable uninterrupted information exchange has reinforced its central role in medical and scientific communication in a way that will certainly outlive the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,20210331,PMC8011363,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*Conferences', '*Disease-specific hashtags', '*Social media', '*Twitter']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"FLT3 mutations, which are found in a third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), are associated with poor prognosis. Responses to currently available FLT3 inhibitors in AML patients are typically transient and followed by disease recurrence. Thus, FLT3 inhibitors with new inhibitory mechanisms are needed to improve therapeutic outcomes. AMG925 is a novel, potent, small-molecule dual inhibitor of FLT3 and CDK4/6. In this study. we determined the antileukemic effects and mechanisms of action of AMG925 in AML cell lines and primary samples, in particular AML stem/progenitor cells. AMG925 inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in AML cells with or without FLT3 mutations. Reverse-phase protein array profiling confirmed its on-target effects on FLT3-CDK4/6-regulated pathways and identified unrevealed signaling network alterations in AML blasts and stem/progenitor cells in response to AMG925. Mass cytometry identified pathways that may confer resistance to AMG925 in phenotypically defined AML stem/progenitor cells and demonstrated that combined blockade of FLT3-CDK4/6 and AKT/mTOR signaling facilitated stem cell death. Our findings provide a rationale for the mechanism-based inhibition of FLT3-CDK4/6 and for combinatorial approaches to improve the efficacy of FLT3 inhibition in both FLT3 wild-type and FLT3-mutated AML.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9347-2212'],20210331,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3-CDK4/6 kinase', 'Proteomic profiling']","['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA155056-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '6427-13/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA155056-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now expanded the initial cohort and have provided long-term follow-up. Eighty-three patients with AML were treated with the LDC regimen. During the study period, another 100 children with AML received a standard-dose chemotherapy (SDC) regimen. Complete remission was attained in 88.8% and 86.4% of patients after induction in the LDC and SDC groups, respectively (P = .436). Twenty-two patients in the LDC group received SDC for the second induction course. Significantly more high-risk AML patients were treated with the SDC regimen (P = .035). There were no significant differences between the LDC and SDC groups in 5-year event-free survival (61.4% +/- 8.7% vs 65.2% +/- 7.4%, respectively; P = .462), overall survival (72.7% +/- 6.9% vs 72.5% +/- 6.2%, respectively; P = .933), and incidence of relapse (20.5% +/- 4.5% vs 17.6% +/- 3.9%, respectively; P = .484).

It occurs mainly in lymph nodes, skin and soft tissue, testis, bone, peritoneum, and gastrointestinal tract, but rarely in the pancreas. Because their clinical courses, treatments, and prognoses are quite different, it is crucially important to distinguish between MS and pancreatic cancer. PATIENT CONCERNS: We herein report a rare case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which presented with a pancreatic mass that mimicked pancreatic cancer.Diagnosis: The diagnosis of MS was established based on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and bone marrow examination which revealed neoplastic cells with CD34+/CD117+. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was actively treated with chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the lesion in pancreas was significantly reduced, and the patient is still receiving further chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: When we encounter a patient suspected of pancreatic cancer with blood cell abnormalities and no significant increase in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), we need to be aware of the possibility of pancreatic MS. Preoperative pathological biopsy and IHC are indispensable. Misdiagnosis is common if we rely solely on imaging.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with easy bruising and excessive bleeding. With the remission of the primary disease during treatment, the degree of fibrosis did not decrease, but worsened progressively. DIAGNOSIS: The woman was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia with secondary myelofibrosis. INTERVENTIONS: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was discontinued after 6 months of complete remission of APL. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) was discontinued because of supraventricular tachycardia 9 months after complete remission of APL. OUTCOMES: After withdrawal of ATRA for 2 months, the degree of fibrosis was significantly alleviated, and after withdrawal of ATRA for 8 months and ATO for 5 months, bone marrow biopsy showed no reticular fiber deposition. LESSONS: In this case report and review of an additional 14 cases of APL with MF, we highlighted the importance of the degree of MF to be evaluated by bone marrow biopsy at the time of bone marrow aspiration when APL is suspected. If MF is present, the type of MF should be determined in a timely manner, and appropriate intervention measures should be taken accordingly.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Epub 2021 Apr 12.,"PURPOSE: For 65 years the interpretation of the statistical association between the risk of cancer in a child and a prior diagnostic X-ray examination of the abdomen of the pregnant mother has been debated. The objections to a direct cause-and-effect explanation of the association vary in their strength, but one of the most notable grounds for controversy is the finding from the first and largest case-control study reporting the association, the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers (OSCC), of an almost uniformly raised relative risk (RR) for nearly all of the types of cancer that are most frequent in children. Here we compare the antenatal X-ray associations found in the OSCC for different types of childhood cancer with the results of all other case-control and case-cohort studies appropriately combined in meta-analyses, and we also review the findings of the few cohort studies that have been conducted. CONCLUSIONS: From the case-control/case-cohort studies other than the OSCC there are consistent and clear elevations of risk for all types of childhood cancer combined, all leukemia, and all cancers except leukemia combined. This compatibility of the findings of the OSCC with those of the combined other studies is less clear, or effectively absent, when some categories containing smaller numbers of incident cases/deaths are considered, but lack of precision of risk estimates due to sparse data presents inferential challenges, although there is a consistent absence of an association for bone tumors. Further, more recent studies almost certainly address lower intrauterine doses, with an anticipated decrease in estimated risks, which could be misleading when comparisons involve a limited number of studies that are mainly from later years, and a similar problem arises when having to employ all types of antenatal X-ray exposures for a study because data for abdominal exposures are absent. The problem of low statistical power is greater for cohort studies, and this, together with other shortcomings identified in the studies, limits the interpretational value of results. The findings of non-medical intrauterine exposure studies are constrained by sparse data and make a limited contribution to an understanding of the association. Certain aspects of the various studies require a need for caution in interpretation, but overall, the appropriate combination of all case-control/case-cohort studies other than the OSCC lends support to the inference that low-level exposure to radiation in utero proportionally increases the risk of the typical cancers of childhood to around the same level.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2934-0987'],20210412,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood cancer', '*antenatal X-ray', '*epidemiology', '*intrauterine irradiation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) is an adaptor protein that is important for intracellular signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases that are receptors for various growth factors and plays an important role in rapid liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and during acute hepatitis. On the other hand, mild liver regeneration is induced in livers of individuals with chronic hepatitis, where hepatocyte apoptosis is persistent; however, the impact of Gab1 on such livers remains unclear. We examined the role of Gab1 in chronic hepatitis. Gab1 knockdown enhanced the decrease in cell viability and apoptosis induced by ABT-737, a Bcl-2/-xL/-w inhibitor, in BNL.CL2 cells, while cell viability and caspase activity were unchanged in the absence of ABT-737. ABT-737 treatment induced Gab1 cleavage to form p35-Gab1. p35-Gab1 was also detected in the livers of mice with hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1 knockout (KO), which causes persistent hepatocyte apoptosis. Gab1 deficiency exacerbated hepatocyte apoptosis in Mcl-1 KO mice with posttranscriptional downregulation of Bcl-XL. In BNL.CL2 cells treated with ABT-737, Gab1 knockdown posttranscriptionally suppressed Bcl-xL expression, and p35-Gab1 overexpression enhanced Bcl-xL expression. Gab1 deficiency in Mcl-1 KO mice activated STAT3 signaling in hepatocytes, increased hepatocyte proliferation, and increased the incidence of liver cancer with the exacerbation of liver fibrosis. In conclusion, Gab1 is cleaved in the presence of apoptotic stimuli and forms p35-Gab1 in hepatocytes. In chronic liver injury, the role of Gab1 in suppressing apoptosis and reducing liver damage, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis is more important than its role in liver regeneration.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) is known to contribute to liver regeneration after acute liver injury. However, in chronic liver diseases, Gab1 plays a greater role in suppressing hepatocyte apoptosis than in liver regeneration, resulting in suppression of hepatocyte proliferation, liver fibrosis, and liver carcinogenesis.",,,20210331,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-xL', '*Mcl-1 knockout mice', '*liver injury', '*p35-Gab1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are argininosuccinate synthetase-deficient. Pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) monotherapy depletes circulating arginine, thereby selectively inducing tumor cell death. ADI-PEG20 was shown to induce complete responses in ~10% of relapsed/refractory or poor-risk AML patients. We conducted a phase I, dose-escalation study combining ADI-PEG20 and low-dose cytarabine (LDC) in AML patients. Patients received 20 mg LDC subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days every 28 days and ADI-PEG20 at 18 or 36 mg/m(2) (dose levels 1 and 2) intramuscularly weekly. An expansion cohort for the maximal tolerated dose of ADI-PEG20 was planned to further estimate the toxicity and preliminary response of this regimen. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The secondary endpoints were time on treatment, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and biomarkers (pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity detection). Twenty-three patients were included in the study, and seventeen patients were in the expansion cohort (dose level 2). No patients developed dose-limiting toxicities. The most common grade III/IV toxicities were thrombocytopenia (61%), anemia (52%), and neutropenia (30%). One had an allergic reaction to ADI-PEG20. The ORR in 18 evaluable patients was 44.4%, with a median OS of 8.0 (4.5-not reached) months. In seven treatment-naive patients, the ORR was 71.4% and the complete remission rate was 57.1%. The ADI-PEG20 and LDC combination was well-tolerated and resulted in an encouraging ORR. Further combination studies are warranted.

MSCs can affect acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells under hypoxic conditions. With this aim, we used MOLT-4 cells as simulators of ALL cells cocultured with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Then, mRNA and protein expression of the MAT2A, PDK1, and HK2 genes were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot which was also followed by apoptosis measurement by a flow-cytometric method. Next, the methylation status of the target genes was investigated by MS-qPCR. Additionally, candidate gene expressions were examined after treatment with rapamycin using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. We found that the mRNA expression of the candidate genes was augmented under the hypoxic condition in which MAT2A was upregulated in cocultured cells compared to MOLT-4, while HK2 and PDK1 were downregulated. Moreover, we found an association between gene expression and promoter methylation levels of target genes. Besides, expressions of the candidate genes were decreased, while their methylation levels were promoted following treatment with rapamycin. Our results suggest an important role for the BMMSC in regulating the methylation of genes involved in cell survival in hypoxia conditions; however, we found no evidence to prove the MSCs' effect on directing malignant lymphoblastic cells to apoptosis.","['(c) 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4679-9658', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-6211']",20210331,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells', 'hypoxia', 'mesenchymal stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, leukemia is associated with increased risk of malignant cell transmission. We aimed to assess the tumor-inducing potential of two different leukemic cell lines when xenografted to immunodeficient mice. METHODS: Fifty-four female immunodeficient mice were grafted with either 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 10,000 chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (BV-173) cells or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RCH-ACV) cells, embedded inside a fibrin scaffold along with 50,000 human ovarian stromal cells. Two mice per cell line received the fibrin matrix without leukemic cells as negative controls. Clinical signs of disease were monitored for 20 weeks. Grafts, liver tissue, and masses were collected for macroscopic analysis and gene expression of BCR-ABL1 and E2A-PBX fusion transcripts present in BV-173 and RCH-ACV respectively. RESULTS: BV-173 cells: Mice grafted with 100, 200, or 500 cells showed no sign of disease after and were negative for BCR-ABL1 expression. Three of the 5 animals grafted with 1000 cells and all mice with 10,000 cells developed disease and showed BCR-ABL1-positive expression. RCH-ACV cells: Two out of 4 mice grafted with 100 cells developed disease and were E2A-PBX1-positive. All the animals grafted with higher cell doses showed signs of disease and all but one were E2A-PBX1-positive. CONCLUSION: The present work proves that the disease-inducing potential of BV-173 and RCH-ACV leukemic cells xenografted to SCID mouse peritoneum differs between cell lines, depending on cell number, type, status, and cytogenetic disease profile when ovarian tissue is harvested.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0703-6922'],20210331,PMC8266930,['NOTNLM'],"['Fertility preservation', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemic cell engraftment', 'Ovarian tissue cryopreservation', 'Ovarian tissue transplantation']","['5/4/150/5/Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS', 'FNRS-PDR Convention T.0077.14, Televie grant No. 7.6515.16F/Fonds De La Recherche', 'Scientifique - FNRS', 'CP19-00141/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades', ""PROMETEO/2018/137/Conselleria d'Educacio, Investigacio, Cultura i Esport""]",['2022/06/01 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematological disorder characterized by blockage of differentiation and high proliferation rates of myeloid progenitors. Anthracycline and cytarabinebased therapy has remained the standard treatment for AML over the last four decades. Although this treatment strategy has increased survival rates, patients often develop resistance to these drugs. Despite efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying cytarabine resistance, there have been few advances in the field. The present study developed an in vitro AML cell line model resistant to cytarabine (HL60R), and identified chromosomal aberrations by karyotype evaluation and potential molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance. Cytarabine decreased cell viability, as determined by MTT assay, and induced cell death and cell cycle arrest in the parental HL60 cell line, as revealed by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and PI DNA incorporation, respectively, whereas no change was observed in the HL60R cell line. In addition, the HL60R cell line exhibited a higher tumorigenic capacity in vivo compared with the parental cell line. Notably, no reduction in tumor volume was detected in mice treated with cytarabine and inoculated with HL60R cells. In addition, western blotting revealed that the protein expression levels of Bcl2, Xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and cMyc were upregulated in HL60R cells compared with those in HL60 cells, along with predominant nuclear localization of the p50 and p65 subunits of NFkappaB in HL60R cells. Furthermore, the antitumor effect of LQB118 pterocarpanquinone was investigated; this compound induced apoptosis, a reduction in cell viability and a decrease in XIAP expression in cytarabineresistant cells. Taken together, these data indicated that acquired cytarabine resistance in AML was a multifactorial process, involving chromosomal aberrations, and differential expression of apoptosis and cell proliferation signaling pathways. Furthermore, LQB118 could be a potential alternative therapeutic approach to treat cytarabineresistant leukemia cells.",,,20210331,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cytarabine, LQB118, drug resistance, acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib monotherapy were evaluated in a treatment-naive CLL cohort of a single-arm phase 1/2 trial (ACE-CL-001). Adults were eligible for enrollment if chemotherapy was declined or deemed inappropriate due to comorbidities (N = 99). Patients had a median age of 64 years and 47% had Rai stage III/IV disease. Acalabrutinib was administered orally 200 mg once daily, or 100 mg twice daily until progression or intolerance. A total of 99 patients were treated; 57 (62%) had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene, and 12 (18%) had TP53 aberrations. After median follow-up of 53 months, 85 patients remain on treatment; 14 discontinued treatment, mostly because of adverse events (AEs) (n = 6) or disease progression (n = 3). Overall response rate was 97% (90% partial response; 7% complete response), with similar outcomes among all prognostic subgroups. Because of improved trough BTK occupancy with twice-daily dosing, all patients were transitioned to 100 mg twice daily. Median duration of response (DOR) was not reached; 48-month DOR rate was 97% (95% confidence interval, 90-99). Serious AEs were reported in 38 patients (38%). AEs required discontinuation in 6 patients (6%) because of second primary cancers (n = 4) and infection (n = 2).

Here, we demonstrated that a key growth arrest-specific gene 6/AXL axis is highly activated in cells from patients with AML, particularly in stem/progenitor cells. We developed a potent selective AXL inhibitor that has favorable pharmaceutical properties and efficacy against preclinical patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) models of AML. Importantly, inhibition of AXL sensitized AML stem/progenitor cells to venetoclax treatment, with strong synergistic effects in vitro and in PDX models. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA-sequencing and functional validation studies uncovered that AXL inhibition, alone or in combination with venetoclax, potentially targets intrinsic metabolic vulnerabilities of AML stem/progenitor cells and shows a distinct transcriptomic profile and inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

Similar prevalence of STAT3 mutations in chronic T-LGL and NK-LGL leukemia is suggestive of common pathogenesis. We undertook whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations unique to NK-LGL leukemia. The results were analyzed to develop a resequencing panel that was applied to 58 patients. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway gene mutations (PIK3CD/PIK3AP1) and TNFAIP3 mutations were seen in 5% and 10% of patients, respectively. TET2 was exceptional in that mutations were present in 16 (28%) of 58 patient samples, with evidence that TET2 mutations can be dominant and exclusive to the NK compartment. Reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing revealed that methylation patterns were significantly altered in TET2 mutant samples. The promoter of TET2 and that of PTPRD, a negative regulator of STAT3, were found to be methylated in additional cohort samples, largely confined to the TET2 mutant group. Mutations in STAT3 were observed in 19 (33%) of 58 patient samples, 7 of which had concurrent TET2 mutations. Thrombocytopenia and resistance to immunosuppressive agents were uniquely observed in those patients with only TET2 mutation (Games-Howell post hoc test, P = .0074; Fisher's exact test, P = .00466). Patients with STAT3 mutation, inclusive of those with TET2 comutation, had lower hematocrit, hemoglobin, and absolute neutrophil count compared with STAT3 wild-type patients (Welch's t test, P </= .015).

Conventional chemotherapy results in limited responses, underlining the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we investigate the ex vivo and in vivo efficacy of the dual phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-delta/gamma (PI3K-delta/gamma) inhibitor duvelisib (Duv) and the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (Ven) using 4 different RS patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Ex vivo exposure of RS cells to Duv, Ven, or their combination results in variable apoptotic responses, in line with the expression levels of target proteins. Although RS1316, IP867/17, and RS9737 cells express PI3K-delta, PI3K-gamma, and Bcl-2 and respond to the drugs, RS1050 cells, expressing very low levels of PI3K-gamma and lacking Bcl-2, are fully resistant. Moreover, the combination of these drugs is more effective than each agent alone. When tested in vivo, RS1316 and IP867/17 show the best tumor growth inhibition responses, with the Duv/Ven combination leading to complete remission at the end of treatment. The synergistic effect of Duv and Ven relies on the crosstalk between PI3K and apoptotic pathways occurring at the GSK3beta level. Indeed, inhibition of PI3K signaling by Duv results in GSK3beta activation, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of both c-Myc and Mcl-1, making RS cells more sensitive to Bcl-2 inhibition by Ven. This work provides, for the first time, a proof of concept of the efficacy of dual targeting of PI3K-delta/gamma and Bcl-2 in RS and providing an opening for a Duv/Ven combination for these patients.

Migration is a complex process guided by chemokine receptors and integrins. However, it remains largely unknown how CLL cells integrate multiple migratory signals while balancing survival in the peripheral blood and the decision to return to immune niches. Our study provided evidence that CXCR4/CD5 intraclonal subpopulations can be used to study the regulation of migration of CLL cells. We performed RNA profiling of CXCR4dimCD5bright vs CXCR4brightCD5dim CLL cells and identified differential expression of dozens of molecules with a putative function in cell migration. GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) positively regulated CLL cell homing capacity of CXCR4brightCD5dim cells. Gradual GAB1 accumulation in CLL cells outside immune niches was mediated by FoxO1-induced transcriptional GAB1 activation. Upregulation of GAB1 also played an important role in maintaining basal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and the ""tonic"" AKT phosphorylation required to sustain the survival of resting CLL B cells. This finding is important during ibrutinib therapy, because CLL cells induce the FoxO1-GAB1-pAKT axis, which represents an adaptation mechanism to the inability to home to immune niches. We have demonstrated that GAB1 can be targeted therapeutically by novel GAB1 inhibitors, alone or in combination with BTK inhibition. GAB1 inhibitors induce CLL cell apoptosis, impair cell migration, inhibit tonic or BCR-induced AKT phosphorylation, and block compensatory AKT activity during ibrutinib therapy.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0234-6470', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7185-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6237-7178', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9007-266X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8808-8064', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1148-8131', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7590-187X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0352-2547', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5803-5941', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3076-4840', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7136-2680', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8994-649X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6975-8838']",,PMC8513669,,,['802644/ERC_/European Research Council/International'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the most common problem usually faced in the course of treatment is multidrug resistance (MDR). Nowadays, combination therapy involving natural products as adjuvant therapy to chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been used for many of health problems. Coumarin is a natural compound with known chemotherapeutic activity, as well as other pharmacological properties. We focused on the combination of coumarin and doxorubicin in overcoming of drug-resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. Methods: Cell viability, Apoptotic and necrotic cell death with FACS, oxidative stress detection, and protein expression analysis were used in this study. Results: Coumarin as a single drug exerts a significant cell death on Human acute myeloid leukemia (HL60); however, it does not show the same effect on drug-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (HL60/ADR). Comparing the effects of doxorubicin and coumarin as single drugs versus a combination of coumarin and doxorubicin showed a significant apoptotic cell death. Conclusion: In AML patients, the development of multiple drug resistance (MDR) is the biggest challenge in treating AML patients. Combination therapy with coumarin may be a good choice to overcome the drug resistance in AML patients.",['(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],,20210316,PMC7988287,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer drugs', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell viability', 'FACS assay', 'Natural medicine']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed findings suggestive for primary lung malignancy associated with liver metastasis. Liver biopsy showed budding yeast. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid grew fungal organisms. Urine and serology were positive for histoplasmosis. Patient was pancytopenic, hence, we decided to evaluate further with a bone marrow biopsy which revealed underlying hairy cell leukemia. In the case of disseminated histoplasmosis, a high degree of suspicion towards any immunosuppressive condition should be entertained and any signs should be promptly investigated.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Fohle et al.']",,20210223,PMC7992917,['NOTNLM'],"['hairy cell leukemia', 'histoplasmosis', 'lung cancer']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"BACKGROUND: Secondary plasma cell leukaemia (sPCL) is an aggressive form of multiple myeloma (MM), but the mechanism underlying MM progresses into PCL remains unknown. METHODS: Gene expression profiling of MM patients and PCL patients was analysed to identify the molecular differences between the two diseases. Cox survival regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed to illustrate the impact of integrin subunit alpha 6 (ITGA6) on prognosis of MM. Invasion assays were performed to assess whether ITGA6 regulated the progression of MM to PCL. RESULTS: Gene expression profiling analyses showed that cell metastasis pathways were enriched in PCL and ITGA6 was differentially expressed between PCL and MM. ITGA6 expression was an independent prognostic factor for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of MM patients. Moreover, the stratification ability of the International Staging System (ISS) of MM was improved when including ITGA6 expression. Functional studies uncovered that increased ITGA6 reduced the myeloma cell invasion. Additionally, low expression of ITGA6 resulted from epigenetic downregulating of its anti-sense non-coding RNA, ITGA6-AS1. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that ITGA6 gradually decreases during plasma cell dyscrasias progression and low expression of ITGA6 contributes to myeloma metastasis. Moreover, ITGA6 abundance might help develop MM prognostic stratification.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8552-991X'],20210330,PMC8144434,,,,['2022/03/30 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a stem cell-derived neoplasm characterized by dysplasia, uncontrolled expansion of monocytes, and substantial risk to transform to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). So far, little is known about CMML-initiating cells. We found that leukemic stem cells (LSC) in CMML reside in a CD34(+)/CD38(-) fraction of the malignant clone. Whereas CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells engrafted NSGS mice with overt CMML, no CMML was produced by CD34(+)/CD38(+) progenitors or the bulk of CD34(-) monocytes. CMML LSC invariably expressed CD33, CD117, CD123 and CD133. In a subset of patients, CMML LSC also displayed CD52, IL-1RAP and/or CLL-1. CMML LSC did not express CD25 or CD26. However, in sAML following CMML, the LSC also expressed CD25 and high levels of CD114, CD123 and IL-1RAP. No correlations between LSC phenotypes, CMML-variant, mutation-profiles, or clinical course were identified. Pre-incubation of CMML LSC with gemtuzumab-ozogamicin or venetoclax resulted in decreased growth and impaired engraftment in NSGS mice. Together, CMML LSC are CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells that express a distinct profile of surface markers and target-antigens. During progression to sAML, LSC acquire or upregulate certain cytokine receptors, including CD25, CD114 and CD123. Characterization of CMML LSC should facilitate their enrichment and the development of LSC-eradicating therapies.","['(c) 2021.

In immune-mediated aplastic anemia (AA), cytotoxic T-cell expansions are shown to participate in disease pathogenesis. We investigated the mutation profiles of T cells in AA by a custom panel of 2533 genes. We sequenced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of 24 AA patients and compared the results to 20 healthy controls and whole-exome sequencing of 37 patients with AA. Somatic variants were common both in patients and healthy controls but enriched to AA patients' CD8+ T cells, which accumulated most mutations on JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways. Mutation burden was associated with CD8+ T-cell clonality, assessed by T-cell receptor beta sequencing. To understand the effect of mutations, we performed single-cell sequencing of AA patients carrying STAT3 or other mutations in CD8+ T cells. STAT3 mutated clone was cytotoxic, clearly distinguishable from other CD8+ T cells, and attenuated by successful immunosuppressive treatment. Our results suggest that somatic mutations in T cells are common, associate with clonality, and can alter T-cell phenotype, warranting further investigation of their role in the pathogenesis of AA.",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3146-9816', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4714-9481', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2750-4033', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7842-9419', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6837-4346', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0816-8241']",20210330,PMC8102188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EPO was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peripheral blood of 54 patients with different MDS subtypes according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification. The comparison group consisted of 15 healthy individuals. Complete blood count (hemoglobin, leukocyte and platelet levels) was determined and bone marrow cells were characterized morphologically. The overall and leukemia-free survivals were estimated by Kaplan - Meier method. RESULTS: The level of capital IE, Cyrilliccapital ER, Cyrilliccapital O, Cyrillic in MDS was reliably higher in comparison with healthy persons (p < 0.01, Mann - Whitney test). No statistically significant difference was found in serum EPO concentration between the groups of patients with low- and high-risk MDS (603.5 pg/ml vs 721.0 pg/ml; p > 0.05). In transfusion-dependent patients, the level of EPO was significantly higher than in other patients, which may be due to increased endogenous EPO secretion resulting from chronic hypoxia. A negative correlation was revealed between EPO level and Hb level as well as between EPO level and percentage of blast cells in bone marrow in high-risk MDS patients but not in patients with less aggressive variants of MDS. Instead, patients with low-risk MDS had a negative relationship between concentrations of EPO and tumor necrosis factor alpha (p = 0.06, Kendall's tau test). No significant difference was found between EPO concentration in cases differing by bone marrow cellularity or the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities. An EPO concentration below 200 pg/ml was a predictor of shorter overall survival in patients with all MDS subtypes (p < 0.05, Mann - Whitney test). In patients with all FAB disease subtypes, there was no relationship between the leukemia-free survival and serum EPO concentration. CONCLUSION: This study shows that lower serum EPO level may be considered as one of the additional adverse prognostic factors in MDS patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Since gaining approval for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has transformed the treatment of this and other blood-related cancers. Reflecting the large and hydrophobic BH3-binding groove within BCL-2, venetoclax has significantly higher molecular weight and lipophilicity than most orally administered drugs, along with negligible water solubility. Although a technology-enabled formulation successfully achieves oral absorption in humans, venetoclax tablets have limited drug loading and therefore can present a substantial pill burden for patients in high-dose indications. We therefore generated a phosphate prodrug (3, ABBV-167) that confers significantly increased water solubility to venetoclax and, upon oral administration to healthy volunteers either as a solution or high drug-load immediate release tablet, extensively converts to the parent drug. Additionally, ABBV-167 demonstrated a lower food effect with respect to venetoclax tablets. These data indicate that beyond-rule-of-5 molecules can be successfully delivered to humans via a solubility-enhancing prodrug moiety to afford robust exposures of the parent drug following oral dosing.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9261-1583', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0035-9649', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5917-9269', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9833-2614', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5972-3938']",20210330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Feb 28.,"Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) and T-lymphoid/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia (T/M-MPAL) are closely related entities and remain a therapeutic challenge. In this study, we characterized the clinical features of 43 ETP-ALL and 41 T/M-MPAL patients and compared clinical outcomes and safety between cytarabine, aclarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CAG)-like regimens in 34 patients and conventional ALL regimens in 50 patients. In our series, ETP-ALL and T/M-MPAL showed similar biological characteristics, immunophenotypes, genomic alterations, and outcomes. The complete remission (CR) rate and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR rate of CAG-like regimens were significantly higher compared with conventional ALL regimens (CAG-like: 80.0% and 59.7%, respectively; P = .039; ALL: 51.4% and 31.3%, respectively; P = .048). Overall, 90.0% of cases (18/20) achieved CR using combined decitabine and CAG-like regimens. Additionally, CAG-like regimens had lower rates of grade 3 or 4 infection (18.8% vs. 38.2%; P = .059) and grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity (37.5% vs. 60.0%; P = .043) than conventional ALL regimens. The 38 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in the first CR (CR1) had better overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) than the 11 patients who underwent allo-HSCT in the second CR (CR2) or in no remission (median OS not reached vs. 7.6 months, P = .0004; median LFS not reached vs. 11.6 months, P = .0008). There was a significant difference in 3-year OS (95.7% vs. 52.5%; P = .0039) and LFS (95.8% vs. 43.5%; P = .0003) after allo-HSCT between pre-transplant MRD-negative and MRD-positive patients. The median OS for patients without allo-HSCT was 32.1 months in the CAG-like group compared with 12.1 months in the non-CAG-like group (P = .019). These findings suggest that ETP-ALL and T/M-MPAL possess overlapping characteristics and CAG-like regimens improve their clinical outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 27.,"INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer (GC) has severely affected the health of patients and caused high mortality around the world. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been validated to play significant roles in biological process of multiple cancers. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were conducted to evaluate the expression levels and protein levels of related genes in GC cells. Functional assays were implemented to explore the effect of deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2 (DLEU2). The upstream and downstream mechanisms of DLEU2 were verified by mechanism investigations. RESULTS: The expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DLEU2 was observably high in GC cells and tissues. DLEU2 silence depressed the capacities of proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis in GC cells. Moreover, DLEU2 was activated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and sequestered microRNA-23b-3p (miR-23b-3p) to modulate the expression of notch receptor 2 (NOTCH2), thereby stimulating Notch signaling pathway. More importantly, DLEU2 contributed to GC progression via targeting miR-23b-3p/NOTCH2 axis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our research identified the STAT1/DLEU2/miR-23b-3p/NOTCH2/Notch axis in GC development, indicating that DLEU2 might function as a novel biomarker in GC.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Cytogenetics risk, somatic mutations and gene expression profiles are important prognostic factors for AML patients. However, accurate stratification of patient prognosis remains an unsolved problem in AML. This study was to to develop a novel gene profile to accurately classify AML patients into subgroups with different survival probabilities. METHODS: Survival-related genes were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate analysis using the expression and clinical data of 405 AML patients from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) dataset and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Feature selection was performed by using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method. With the LASSO model, a prognostic 85-gene score was established and compared with 2 known gene-expression risk scores. The stratification of AML patients was performed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 85 gene expression levels to identify clusters of AML patients with different survival probabilities. RESULTS: The LASSO model comprising 85 genes was considered as the optimal model based on relatively high area under curve value (0.83) and the minimum mean squared error. The 85-gene score was associated with increased mortality in AML patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 85 genes revealed 3 subgroups of AML patients in the OHSU dataset. The cluster1 AML patients were associated with more female cases, higher percent of bone marrow blast cells, 85-gene score, cytogenetics risk, more frequent FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, NP1 mutations, less frequent TP53, RUNX1 mutations, poorer overall survival than cluster2 tumors. The 85-gene score had higher AUC (0.75) than the 5-gene risk score and LSC17 score (0.74 and 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: The 85-gene score is superior to the 2 established prognostic gene signatures in the prediction of prognosis of AML patients.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5463-4784'],,PMC8020099,['NOTNLM'],"['*85-gene signature', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*overall survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 May 3.,"The importance of viral infections as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality is well documented in severely immunosuppressed patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. By contrast, viral infections generally receive less attention in patients with malignant disorders undergoing chemotherapy, where the onset of neutropenic fever is mostly associated with bacterial or fungal infections, and screening for viral infections is not routinely performed. To address the occurrence of invasive viral infections in a clinical setting commonly associated with less pronounced immunosuppression, we have prospectively screened 237 febrile neutropenic episodes in pediatric (n = 77) and adult (n = 69) patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, primarily for treatment of acute leukemia. Serial peripheral blood specimens were tested by RQ-PCR assays for the presence and quantity of the clinically relevant viruses CMV, EBV, HHV6 and HAdV, commonly reactivated in highly immunocompromised patients. Viremia was documented in 36 (15%) episodes investigated, including the detection of HHV6 (n = 14), EBV (n = 15), CMV (n = 6), or HAdV (n = 1). While low or intermediate levels of viremia (<10(4) virus copies/mL) were commonly associated with bacterial or fungal co-infection, viremia at higher levels (>10(4) copies/mL) was documented in patients without evidence for other infections, raising the possibility that at least in some instances the onset of fever may have been attributable to the virus detected. The observations suggest that viral infections, potentially resulting from reactivation, might also play a clinically relevant role in patients receiving chemotherapy for treatment of malignant neoplasms, and routine screening for viremia in this clinical setting might be warranted.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Apr 20.,"Vertebral fractures are clinically important sequelae of a wide array of pediatric diseases. In this study, we examined the accuracy of case-finding strategies for detecting incident vertebral fractures (IVF) over 2 years in glucocorticoid-treated children (n = 343) with leukemia, rheumatic disorders, or nephrotic syndrome. Two clinical situations were addressed: the prevalent vertebral fracture (PVF) scenario (when baseline PVF status was known), which assessed the utility of PVF and low lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD; Z-score <-1.4), and the non-PVF scenario (when PVF status was unknown), which evaluated low LS BMD and back pain. LS BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, vertebral fractures were quantified on spine radiographs using the modified Genant semiquantitative method, and back pain was assessed by patient report. Forty-four patients (12.8%) had IVF. In the PVF scenario, both low LS BMD and PVF were significant predictors of IVF. Using PVF to determine which patients should have radiographs, 11% would undergo radiography (95% confidence interval [CI] 8-15) with 46% of IVF (95% CI 30-61) detected. Sensitivity would be higher with a strategy of PVF or low LS BMD at baseline (73%; 95% CI 57-85) but would require radiographs in 37% of children (95% CI 32-42). In the non-PVF scenario, the strategy of low LS BMD and back pain produced the highest specificity of any non-PVF model at 87% (95% CI 83-91), the greatest overall accuracy at 82% (95% CI 78-86), and the lowest radiography rate at 17% (95% CI 14-22). Low LS BMD or back pain in the non-PVF scenario produced the highest sensitivity at 82% (95% CI 67-92), but required radiographs in 65% (95% CI 60-70). These results provide guidance for targeting spine radiography in children at risk for IVF.

We reported the pooled hazard ratios (HRs), risk ratios (RRs), mean difference (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects meta-analyses and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Two randomized trials enrolling 529 patients and 23 observational studies enrolling 7296 patients proved eligible. The most common intensive interventions included cytarabine-based intensive chemotherapy, combination of cytarabine and anthracycline, or daunorubicin/idarubicin, and cytarabine plus idarubicin. The most common less-intensive therapies included low-dose cytarabine alone, or combined with clofarabine, azacitidine, and hypomethylating agent-based chemotherapy. Low certainty evidence suggests that patients who receive intensive versus less-intensive therapy may experience longer survival (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99), a higher probability of receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RR 6.14; 95% CI, 4.03-9.35), fewer episodes of pneumonia (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06-0.98), but a greater number of severe, treatment-emergent adverse events (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.75), and a longer duration of intensive care unit hospitalization (MD, 6.84 days longer; 95% CI, 3.44 days longer to 10.24 days longer, very low certainty evidence). Low certainty evidence due to confounding in observational studies suggest superior overall survival without substantial treatment-emergent adverse effect of intensive antileukemic therapy over less-intensive therapy in older adults with AML who are candidates for intensive antileukemic therapy.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0549-5087'],20210330,PMC8009379,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cell leukemia (PCL) have an unfavorable prognosis and no effective treatment. This study was designed to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of a novel anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell in R/R MM and PCL. METHODS: Between February 22, 2017, and June 25, 2018, 28 R/R and two R/R primary PCL patients received a median dose of 11.2 x 10(6) CAR+ cells/kg. The subjects were refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and/or an immunomodulatory agent. Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide were given as lymphodepletion chemotherapy. RESULTS: Results for these 30 consecutive patients who received an anti-BCMA CAR T cell infusion are reported. The patients had received a median of four prior lines of therapy. A total of 44 different types of adverse events were recorded, and hematologic toxic effects were the most common events of any grade during treatment. Hematologic toxic effects were also the most common events of grade 3 or higher. A total of 29 patients (96.7%) had cytokine release syndrome, which was of grade 1 or 2 in 24 patients (80%) and grade 3 in five patients (16.7%). Neurologic toxic effects only occurred in one patient (3.3%) and were of grade 1. The objective response rate was 90%, and the complete response rate was 43.3%. With a median follow-up of 12.6 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 5.2 months and 14.0 months. One of the two primary PCL achieved a complete response with a PFS of 307 days. The other patients achieved a very good partial response with a PFS of 117 days. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-BCMA CAR T cell treatment is safe and highly active in R/R multiple myeloma.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by monoallelic variants in KMT2A and characterized by intellectual disability and hypertrichosis. We performed a retrospective, multicenter, observational study of 104 individuals with WSS from five continents to characterize the clinical and molecular spectrum of WSS in diverse populations, to identify physical features that may be more prevalent in White versus Black Indigenous People of Color individuals, to delineate genotype-phenotype correlations, to define developmental milestones, to describe the syndrome through adulthood, and to examine clinicians' differential diagnoses. Sixty-nine of the 82 variants (84%) observed in the study were not previously reported in the literature. Common clinical features identified in the cohort included: developmental delay or intellectual disability (97%), constipation (63.8%), failure to thrive (67.7%), feeding difficulties (66.3%), hypertrichosis cubiti (57%), short stature (57.8%), and vertebral anomalies (46.9%). The median ages at walking and first words were 20 months and 18 months, respectively. Hypotonia was associated with loss of function (LoF) variants, and seizures were associated with non-LoF variants. This study identifies genotype-phenotype correlations as well as race-facial feature associations in an ethnically diverse cohort, and accurately defines developmental trajectories, medical comorbidities, and long-term outcomes in individuals with WSS.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3480-8123', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3749-2884', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0867-722X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8528-0387', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1020-9989', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4158-341X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4482-6504', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5748-3507', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7663-1851', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9251-2614', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3234-3596', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3064-2488', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5369-346X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9004-2284', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0512-0429', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9548-4188', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7922-7480', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9646-4018', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4735-5223', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9212-2499', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6501-4150', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2814-7461', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6709-6209']",20210330,PMC8631250,['NOTNLM'],"['*KMT2A', '*MLL1', '*Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome', '*hypertrichosis', '*syndromic intellectual disability', '*syndromic short stature']","['K08 HD086250/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001880/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08HD086250/GF/NIH HHS/United States']",['2022/06/01 00:00'],,['NIHMS1753305'],,,,,,,,['Am J Med Genet A. 2021 Nov 11;:.

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that retains a sobering prognosis despite an extensive research effort. Mantle cell lymphoma remains incurable even with aggressive, and at times toxic, chemoimmunotherapy with early incorporation of autologous stem cell transplantation. Given this, attention has turned to the use of targeted therapies addressing dysregulation of B-cell signaling pathways. Drugs such as immunomodulatory agents, proteasome inhibitors, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown success in the relapsed/refractory population, and there is ongoing investigation into the utilization of novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2, and spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors alone or in combination in both the front-line and relapsed settings. Other areas of research in novel immunotherapies include investigations of bispecific T-cell engagers and antibody-drug conjugates. Most recently, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has been granted US Food and Drug Administration approval as a result of durable remissions even in high-risk patients who have classically done poorly with traditional chemoimmunotherapy. The intent of this article is to review the literature describing these selective therapies and discuss their current and future roles in the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma.",,,20210330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple analyses, including rotational thromboelastometry and flow cytometry on blood and bronchoalveolar lavage, are reported to characterize coagulation and immune profiles.

Epub 2021 Mar 30.,"Clinical trials show that tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment can be discontinued in selected patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Although updated CML guidelines support such procedure in clinical routine, data on TKI stopping outside clinical trials are limited. In this retrospective study utilising the Swedish CML registry, we examined TKI discontinuation in a population-based setting. Out of 584 patients diagnosed with chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) in 2007-2012, 548 had evaluable information on TKI discontinuation. With a median follow-up of nine years from diagnosis, 128 (23%) discontinued TKI therapy (>/=1 month) due to achieving a DMR (deep molecular response) and 107 (20%) due to other causes (adverse events, allogeneic stem cell transplant, pregnancy, etc). Among those stopping in DMR, 49% re-initiated TKI treatment (median time to restart 4.8 months). In all, 38 patients stopped TKI within a clinical study and 90 outside a study. After 24 months 41.1% of patients discontinuing outside a study had re-initiated TKI treatment. TKI treatment duration pre-stop was longer and proportion treated with second-generation TKI slightly higher outside studies, conceivably affecting the clinical outcome. In summary we show that TKI discontinuation in CML in clinical practice is common and feasible and may be just as successful as when performed within a clinical trial.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically improved the outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Currently, four TKIs are available for the frontline treatment, including the first-generation TKI (imatinib) and the second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib). The second-generation TKIs lead to a faster and deeper molecular response without a survival benefit compared with imatinib. However, the opportunity for the treatment discontinuation and functional cure requires the achievement of durable deep molecular remission. Therefore, the second-generation TKIs should be considered as initial therapy for chronic-phase CML. Switch of therapy is warranted in case of treatment failure, including resistance and/or intolerance. The life expectancy of patients with CML is approaching that of the general population. Given an expected lifespan, future perspectives should consider the strategy for the optimal choice of TKIs, allowing for long-duration of effective TKI therapy with less toxicity to aim for a functional cure. A novel prediction approach such as artificial intelligence-driven analysis on the accumulated data from clinical trials paves a promising path for the personalized recommendation on frontline TKIs and precise survival prediction.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610'],20210329,,['NOTNLM'],"['Artificial intelligence', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective, observational study included all patients diagnosed with CLL at our hospital who had at least one leukocyte count >/= 50.0 x 10(9)/L during the years 2008-2018. All hyperkalemic episodes (including when leukocyte count was below 50.0 x 10(9)/L) during this period were assessed. Pseudohyperkalemia was defined as when a normal potassium level was measured in a repeated blood test or when known risk factors and ECG changes typical of hyperkalemia were absent. Of the 119 episodes of hyperkalemia observed, 41.2% were considered as pseudohyperkalemia. Pseudohyperkalemia episodes were characterized by significantly higher leukocyte counts as well as higher potassium and LDH levels compared to true hyperkalemia. Pseudohyperkalemia was documented in medical charts only in a minority of cases (n = 4, 8.1%). Treatment was administered in 17 of 49 (34.7%) cases and caused significant hypokalemia in 6 of those cases. The incidence of pseudohyperkalemia in this study was rather high, suggesting that physicians should be more aware of this phenomenon in patients with CLL.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8834-7970'],20210329,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Hyperkalemia', 'Leukocytosis', 'Pseudohyperkalemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"PI3Kdelta is expressed predominately in leukocytes and overexpressed in B-cell-related malignances. PI3Kdelta has been validated as a promising target for cancer therapy, and specific PI3Kdelta inhibitors were approved for clinical practice. However, the substantial toxicity and relatively low efficacy as a monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) limit their clinical use. In this study, we described a novel PI3Kdelta inhibitor SAF-248, which exhibited high selectivity for PI3Kdelta (IC50 = 30.6 nM) over other PI3K isoforms at both molecular and cellular levels, while sparing most of the other human protein kinases in the kinome profiling. SAF-248 exhibited superior antiproliferative activity against 27 human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines compared with the approved PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib. In particular, SAF-248 potently inhibited the proliferation of a panel of seven DLBCL cell lines (with GI50 values < 1 muM in 5 DLBCL cell lines). We demonstrated that SAF-248 concentration-dependently blocked PI3K signaling followed by inducing G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in DLBCL KARPAS-422, Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Its activity against the DLBCL cells was negatively correlated to the protein level of PI3Kalpha. Oral administration of SAF-248 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Activation of mTORC1, MYC and JAK/STAT signaling was observed upon prolonged treatment and co-targeting these pathways would potentiate the activity of SAF-248.

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"Despite recent approval of targeted drugs for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside and anthracyclines remains an important pillar of treatment. Both primary and secondary resistance are frequent and associated with poor survival, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. In previous work, we identified genes deregulated between diagnosis and relapse of AML, corresponding to therapy naive and resistant states, respectively. Among them was MTSS1, whose downregulation is known to enhance aggressiveness of solid tumors. Here we show that low MTSS1 expression at diagnosis was associated with a poor prognosis in AML. MTSS1 expression was regulated by promoter methylation, and reduced by cytosine arabinoside and the anthracycline daunorubicin. Experimental downregulation of MTSS1 affected the expression of numerous genes. It induced the DNA damage response kinase WEE1, and rendered human AML cell lines more resistant to cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, and other anti-cancer drugs. Mtss1 knockdown in murine MLL-AF9-driven AML substantially decreased disease latency, and increased leukemic burden and ex vivo chemotherapy resistance. In summary, low MTSS1 expression represents a novel factor contributing to disease aggressiveness, therapy resistance, and poor outcome in AML.",['(c) 2021.

cytoplasmic translocation of the encoded nucleolar protein (NPM1c(+)). NPM1c(+) maintains a unique leukemic gene expression program, characterized by activation of HOXA/B clusters and MEIS1 oncogene to facilitate leukemogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which NPM1c(+) controls such gene expression patterns to promote leukemogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the activation of HOXBLINC, a HOXB locus-associated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is a critical downstream mediator of NPM1c(+)-associated leukemic transcription program and leukemogenesis. HOXBLINC loss attenuates NPM1c(+)-driven leukemogenesis by rectifying the signature of NPM1c(+) leukemic transcription programs. Furthermore, overexpression of HoxBlinc (HoxBlincTg) in mice enhances HSC self-renewal and expands myelopoiesis, leading to the development of AML-like disease, reminiscent of the phenotypes seen in the Npm1 mutant knock-in (Npm1(c/+)) mice. HoxBlincTg and Npm1(c/+) HSPCs share significantly overlapped transcriptome and chromatin structure. Mechanistically, HoxBlinc binds to the promoter regions of NPM1c(+) signature genes to control their activation in HoxBlincTg HSPCs, via MLL1 recruitment and promoter H3K4me3 modification. Our study reveals that HOXBLINC lncRNA activation plays an essential oncogenic role in NPM1c(+) leukemia. HOXBLINC and its partner MLL1 are potential therapeutic targets for NPM1c(+) AML.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6514-8466', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4282-7757', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3282-6072', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9931-5990', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4788-2085', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7063-6253']",20210329,PMC8007823,,,"['R01 HL141950/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK110108/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL144712/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA178191/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK121831/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL145883/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"PURPOSE: The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has demonstrated significant benefits for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, patients often lose response to ruxolitinib or suffer disease progression despite therapy with ruxolitinib. These observations have prompted efforts to devise treatment strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy in combination with ruxolitinib therapy. Activation of JAK-STAT signaling results in dysregulation of key downstream pathways, notably increased expression of cell-cycle mediators including CDC25A and the PIM kinases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Given the involvement of cell-cycle mediators in MPNs, we sought to examine the efficacy of therapy combining ruxolitinib with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (LEE011) and a PIM kinase inhibitor (PIM447). We utilized JAK2-mutant cell lines, murine models, and primary MPN patient samples for these studies. RESULTS: Exposure of JAK2-mutant cell lines to the triple combination of ruxolitinib, LEE011, and PIM447 resulted in expected on-target pharmacodynamic effects, as well as increased apoptosis and a decrease in the proportion of cells in S-phase, compared with ruxolitinib. As compared with ruxolitinib monotherapy, combination therapy led to reductions in spleen and liver size, reduction of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, improved overall survival, and elimination of disease-initiating capacity of treated bone marrow, in murine models of MPN. Finally, the triple combination reduced colony formation capacity of primary MPN patient samples to a greater extent than ruxolitinib. CONCLUSIONS: The triple combination of ruxolitinib, LEE011, and PIM447 represents a promising therapeutic strategy with the potential to increase therapeutic responses in patients with MPN.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0355-6368', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7019-1453', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5204-8661', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5911-6655']",20210329,PMC8197756,,,"['K08 CA188529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS1690802'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemoresistance is an obstacle to effective chemotherapy and the precise mechanisms involved remain to be determined. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as relevant factors in the development of drug resistance in patients with AML. Furthermore, accumulating data support the importance of lncRNAs as potentially useful novel therapeutic targets in many cancers. Here, we review the role of lncRNAs in the development and induction of the chemoresistance in AML, and suggest lncRNAs as novel molecular markers for diagnosis, prediction of patient response to chemotherapy, and novel therapeutic targets for AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2021 Mar 26.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adult cancer patients stratified by type of underlying malignancy, age, and capsular serotype and to assess herd effects of childhood pneumococcal vaccination. METHODS: All adult IPD cases reported to the Dutch pneumococcal surveillance system between 2004 and 2016 were included in this study. IPD incidence rates (IR) stratified by subtype of malignancy were calculated per 100 000 patient-years of follow-up. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated to compare IRs between groups. RESULTS: A total of 7167 IPD cases were included, of which 1453 were in patients with malignancies. For patients with hematological malignancies (HM) and solid organ malignancies (SOM), IRs were 482/100 000 and 79/100 000, respectively, compared with 15/100 000 in controls. The highest incidence was observed among patients with multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer (3299/100 000, 2717/100 000, 538/100 000, 559/100 000, and 393/100 000, respectively), and in patients >/=50 years old. Among HM patients, the incidence of IPD declined significantly after the implementation of infant pneumococcal vaccination (IRR 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.84); among SOM patients, the decline was not statistically significant (IRR 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.72-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: The IPD disease burden in cancer patients remains high. Large differences in IPD incidence between the different types of cancer demand tailored guidance regarding pneumococcal vaccination.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The role of allogeneic HSCT in Ph-ALL patients has been analysed through a multicentric study where data belonging to 70 patients diagnosed of this entity in different center that received HSCT between years 1998 and 2014, were reported by the Grupo Espanol de Trasplante Hematopoyetico (GETH). RESULTS: The performance of HSCT from year 2004, in first complete remission (CR) status with thymoglobulin (ATG) based conditioning had a favorable impact on overall survival (OS). HSTC performance from year 2004, in first CR with ATG-based conditioning in addition to acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) development, increased event free survival (EFS). Treatment with imatinib as well as undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) prior to HSCT, combined with aGvHD, reduced risk of relapse (RR). Patient age less than 10 years when HSCT, first CR and ATG-based conditioning were associated to a lower transplant related mortality (TRM). CONCLUSIONS: Patients that could achieve first CR that also received ATG-based conditioning had a better OS and EFS, so HSCT should be considered for this group of patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021.

We describe outcomes of patients with SR-LGI aGVHD treated with vedolizumab. The primary objective was to determine overall response rate (ORR) at days 14, 28, and 56. Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), non-relapse mortality and toxicities. Twenty patients, median age 46 years (range, 23-71), were included. All but 2 patients (90%) had grade 3 to 4 aGVHD (45% stage 4, 40% stage 3 LGI). Median time to vedolizumab was 21 days (range, 5-1031) and 13 days (range, 0-533) after diagnosis of LGI aGVHD and SR-LGI aGVHD, respectively. It was given as >/=3rd line (median 3; range 2-6) in 75% after failure of steroids, and additional treatments including ruxolitinib (n = 12) and others. Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 10-34). The days 14, 28 and 56 ORRs were 45% (9/20; complete response [CR] 25%), 35% (7/20; CR 20%), and 25% (5/20; CR 20%), respectively. Among ruxolitinib failures, it was 50% (6/12; CR 25%), 50% (6/12; CR 25%) and 25% (3/12; CR 16.7%), respectively. Fifteen patients died (14 GVHD, 1 leukemia relapse). The actuarial 6-month OS was 35% (95% confidence interval 16-55). No progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or infusion reaction occurred. Forty-four infection events (22 viral, 18 bacterial, and 4 fungal) were noted in 16 patients. Vedolizumab was well tolerated and demonstrated potential efficacy even after ruxolitinib failure for SR-LGI aGVHD. Yet the responses were suboptimal, and its use requires further investigation.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Dec 16.,"Large granular lymphocytosis (LGL)-or LGL leukemia-is a T- or NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that often results in cytopenias and autoimmune phenomena. Several studies have described LGL in a subset of patients after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT), almost exclusively in the setting of asymptomatic lymphocytosis. Some have suggested an association with improved transplant-related outcomes. In contrast, clinically significant LGL after alloBMT is only described in small case reports. This study sought to assess the characteristics, significance, and response to treatment of LGL associated with unexplained anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia after alloBMT. We performed a retrospective analysis of 150 patients who were evaluated for LGL by peripheral blood flow cytometry (LGL flow) for unexplained cytopenias following initial engraftment after alloBMT from January 1 2012 to July 1, 2019. We identified patients with abnormally increased populations of LGL cells (LGL+) as assessed by Johns Hopkins Hematopathology. We collected demographic, transplantation, and LGL treatment information from electronic medical records. We compared LGL+ patients to patients with unexplained cytopenias with negative flow cytometry for LGL (LGL-) in this cohort. We also assessed change in blood counts after 4 weeks of immunosuppressive therapy in LGL+ patients. Cytopenias occurred at a median of 5.7 months (range 1-81) after alloBMT. The majority of the transplants were nonmyeloablative from haploidentical donors, and all patients received post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, consistent with the overall alloBMT characteristics at our center. We identified 70 patients with LGL and cytopenias, representing 47% of those evaluated by flow cytometry. There were no significant demographic or transplant-related differences between LGL+ patients and LGL- patients. The median age was 59, and 63% were male. LGL+ patients were more likely to have had cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (73% versus 28%, P < .0001), but not acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. LGL+ patients had higher absolute lymphocyte counts (1500 versus 485/ mm(3), P < .0001), a trend toward lower absolute neutrophil count (660 versus 965/mm(3), P = .17), and lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (0.39 versus 1.71, P < .001). There were no differences in overall survival or relapse-free survival. Of those with T-cell LGL, 45 were assessed for T-cell receptor clonality. In all, 22% were clonal, 53% oligoclonal, 4% polyclonal, and 20% indeterminate. Thirty (43%) LGL+ patients received immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for cytopenias. First-line treatment was corticosteroids for 25 (83%). Among those treated, there was an increase in median absolute neutrophil count from 720 before treatment to 1990/mm(3) after 4 weeks (P = .0017). Thrombocytopenia and anemia showed at most a mild improvement with IST. LGL was a common association with otherwise unexplained cytopenias after alloBMT, almost always after prior CMV infection. LGL in the setting of cytopenias did not predict improved transplantation outcomes compared to those with cytopenias without presence of LGL. IST was effective at improving neutropenia associated with LGL after alloBMT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Dec 16.,"Fanconi anemia (FA) cells are characterized by genomic instability, which places FA patients at risk for malignancies such as leukemia and oropharyngeal/urogenital cancers. The risk of development of leukemia is theoretically eliminated after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Mixed chimerism (MC) in FA patients might have a unique implication because the persistent existence of FA cells might give rise to a malignant clone. We have studied a large population of FA patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution and report here the outcome according to chimerism status. Patients with FA who had evidence of progressive bone marrow failure and were blood products-transfusion dependent (packed red blood cells, platelets, or both) were included in the study. Those who had myelodysplasia (MDS) or an abnormal clone or evidence of leukemia were excluded. All but 3 patients had normal renal and cardiac function at the time of transplantation. In total, 160 patients with FA underwent allogeneic HCT at our center from January 1995 to December 2017; mean age at HCT was 8.4. Chimerism data at last follow-up visit were available on 97 patients who are the subjects of this analysis (no day +100 chimerism data on one of them). On day +100, 46 patients (47.9%) had full chimerism (FC) and 50 (52.1%) had MC, whereas at last follow-up 50 (51.5%) exhibited FC and the remaining 47 (48.5%) had MC. Cumulative incidence of all grades acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 13.4% and that of grade III to IV GVHD was 4.1%. Chronic GVHD was seen in eight (8.0%) patients. Incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade >/= III) and that of chronic GVHD were not significantly associated with FC or MC measured at day +100 (P values = .347 and .254, respectively), nor at the last follow-up. Graft failure occurred in 2 patients; both from the MC at day +100 group. No graft failures occurred in the FC at day +100 group (P value = 1.00). At a median follow-up of 83.8 months (95% confidence interval, 51.0-116.6; range, 19.3-181.1 months) the cumulative probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 95.7% +/- 2.1%. Mean follow-up time in our cohort was 90.7 months. Five-year overall survival was not significantly associated with FC or MC evaluated at day +100 (95.7% +/- 3.0% versus 95.6% +/- 3.1%, P value = .908) nor at the last follow-up (96.0% +/- 2.8% versus 95.4% +/- 3.2%, P value = .925). No patient in either group developed MDS/leukemia during the follow-up period. We conclude that mixed chimerism in patients with FA appears to have no adverse effect on outcome in our follow-up period. A longer follow-up period is needed, however, to confirm the validity of this statement.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Feb 2.,"European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 risk stratification by genetics is prognostic of outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is not well established. We examined the effect of 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification on alloHCT outcomes of AML. We included 500 adult (>/=18 years) AML patients in first (n = 370) or second (n = 130) complete remission receiving alloHCT from 2005 to 2016. Patients were classified into favorable (12%), intermediate (57%), and adverse (32%) 2017 ELN risk groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to conduct the multivariable analyses of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). Relapse and nonrelapse mortality were analyzed by the Fine-Gray regression model. OS at 2 years was 72% in the favorable versus 60% in the intermediate versus 45% in the adverse risk groups (P < .001). In multivariable analyses, the 2017 ELN classifier was an independent predictor of OS after alloHCT with significantly higher overall mortality in the intermediate (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.68; P = .03) and adverse (HR = 2.50, 95% CI, 1.54-4.06; P < .001) risk groups compared to the favorable risk group. Similarly, LFS was worse in the intermediate (HR = 1.63, 95%, CI 1.06-2.53; P = .03) and adverse (HR 2.23, 95% CI, 1.41-3.54; P < .001) risk groups while relapse was higher in the adverse risk group (HR = 2.36, 95% CI, 1.28-4.35; P = .006) as compared to the favorable risk group. These data highlight the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN genetic risk stratification on the survival of AML patients after alloHCT. Patients in the adverse risk group had the highest risk of relapse and worst survival. Thus the 2017 ELN prognostic system can help identify AML patients who may benefit from clinical trials offering relapse mitigation strategies to improve transplant outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Dec 22.,"Introduction of novel salvage therapies and expansion of the donor pool within the past decade have allowed more patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) to receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). The impact of each salvage therapy on transplant outcomes have not been compared. Our primary objective was to determine post-HCT relapse-free survival (RFS) in adult patients with r/r Philadelphia-chromosome negative (Ph(neg)) B-ALL. We retrospectively studied alloHCT outcomes in 108 adult patients with r/r Ph(neg) B-ALL transplanted in morphological remission achieved by salvage therapy. Salvage therapies were chemotherapy-based combination (n = 45, 42%), blinatumomab (n=43, 40%), inotuzumab (n = 14, 13%), or CAR T cells (n = 6, 6%). The 2-year RFS and overall survival (OS) were 44% and 50%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, conditioning with reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative regimens (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-3.80; P = .003), having received >/=3 lines of therapies prior to transplant (HR = 2.66, 95% CI, 1.56-4.54; P < .001), and inotuzumab (HR = 2.42, 95% CI, 1.14-5.12; Wald P value = .021) were independently associated with lower RFS. Blinatumomab (HR = 1.10, 95% CI, 0.62-1.96) had comparable RFS to chemotherapy. Incidence of hepatic sinusoidal syndrome was highest with inotuzumab (P < .001); however, 30-day mortality and intensive care unit admissions were not different per salvage therapy. The alloHCT in r/r Ph(neg) B-ALL after remission induction with blinatumomab or chemotherapy led to encouraging outcomes if morphologic CR was achieved. In contrast, pretransplantation inotuzumab therapy was associated with inferior RFS. Larger studies are warranted to confirm our observations. Early transplantation after relapse and the utilization of myeloablative conditioning, when feasible, were key factors associated with improved outcomes after alloHCT in these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The value of MRD after treatment with decitabine in older patients is unknown. This retrospective analysis included patients >/=60 years of age with AML who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) after treatment with decitabine or intensive chemotherapy. Of the 133 consecutively transplanted patients, 109 had available pretransplantation MRD analyses (by flowcytometry [threshold 0.1%]). Forty patients received decitabine treatment (10-day schedule), and 69 patients received intensive chemotherapy (7 + 3 regimen). Patients who received decitabine were older (median 67 versus 64 years) and more often had MRD (70% versus 38%). OS after alloHCT was comparable in both groups. In the chemotherapy group, MRD-positive patients had a significantly higher relapse probability (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 4.81; P= .0031) and risk of death (HR 2.8; P= .02) compared to MRD-negative patients. In the decitabine group there was no significant association between the presence of MRD and relapse (sHR 0.85; P= .83) or death (HR 0.72; P= .60). Pretransplantation MRD in patients receiving decitabine treatment does not have similar predictive value for relapse or survival in older AML patients receiving an alloHCT, compared to patients receiving intensive chemotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Dec 26.,"Until recently, treatment options were relatively limited for children and young adults with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy with promising efficacy and manageable safety that was approved in Japan in 2019 for the treatment of CD19-positive r/r B cell ALL (B-ALL). However, there is no publication assessing the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T in Japan. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy compared to a blinatumomab treatment strategy and a clofarabine combination treatment strategy (i.e., clofarabine + cyclophosphamide + etoposide) in Japan for pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with r/r B-ALL. A partitioned survival model with a lifetime horizon and monthly cycle was constructed from a Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective. Patients were distributed across the following partitioned health states: event-free survival (EFS), progressive disease, and death, which were informed by the EFS and overall survival (OS) data of respective clinical trials before year 5. For the tisagenlecleucel arm, a decision-tree structure was used to partition patients based on the infusion status; those who discontinued prior to receiving infusion were assigned efficacy and cost inputs of blinatumomab and those who received infusion were assigned efficacy and costs inputs based on tisagenlecleucel-infused patients. As trial data for blinatumomab and clofarabine ended before year 5, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were used to extrapolate OS between the end of trial observation and up to year 5. All surviving patients followed the mortality risk of long-term ALL survivors without additional risk of disease relapse after year 5, regardless of initial treatment strategies. The model accounted for pretreatment costs, treatment costs, adverse event costs, follow-up costs, subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation costs, and terminal care costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per life-years (LYs) gained and ICERs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were evaluated using a 2% discount rate, and a threshold of yen7.5 million was used to assess cost-effectiveness. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The total LYs (discounted) for tisagenlecleucel, blinatumomab, and clofarabine combination treatment strategies were 13.3, 4.0, and 2.7 years, respectively; the corresponding QALYs were 11.6, 3.1, and 2.1 years, respectively. The ICERs per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel were yen2,035,071 versus blinatumomab and yen2,644,702 versus clofarabine combination therapy. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the findings.

They have to deal with tough challenges before they can reach success. Nonetheless, it seems that recently developed immunotherapy-based therapy approaches such as adoptive cell transfer (ACT) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy against various kinds of tumors even the cancers in the blood (liquid cancers). The hematological (liquid) cancers are hard to be targeted by usual cancer therapies, for they do not form localized solid tumors. Until recently, two types of ACTs have been developed and introduced; tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells which the latter is the subject of our discussion. It is interesting about engineered CAR-T cells that they are genetically endowed with unique cancer-specific characteristics, so they can use the potency of the host immune system to fight against either solid or liquid cancers. Multiple myeloma (MM) or simply referred to as myeloma is a type of hematological malignancy that affects the plasma cells. The cancerous plasma cells produce immunoglobulins (antibodies) uncontrollably which consequently damage the tissues and organs and break the immune system function. Although the last few years have seen significant progressions in the treatment of MM, still a complete remission remains unconvincing. MM is a medically challenging and stubborn disease with a disappointingly low rate of survival rate. When comparing the three most occurring blood cancers (i.e., lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma), myeloma has the lowest 5-year survival rate (around 40%). A low survival rate indicates a high mortality rate with difficulty in treatment. Therefore, novel CAR-T cell-based therapies or combination therapies along with CAT-T cells may bring new hope for multiple myeloma patients. CAR-T cell therapy has a high potential to improve the remission success rate in patients with MM. To date, many preclinical and clinical trial studies have been conducted to investigate the ability and capacity of CAR T cells in targeting the antigens on myeloma cells. Despite the problems and obstacles, CAR-T cell experiments in MM patients revealed a robust therapeutic potential. However, several factors might be considered during CAR-T cell therapy for better response and reduced side effects. Also, incorporating the CAT-T cell method into a combinational treatment schedule may be a promising approach. In this paper, with a greater emphasis on CAR-T cell application in the treatment of MM, we will discuss and introduce CAR-T cell's history and functions, their limitations, and the solutions to defeat the limitations and different types of modifications on CAR-T cells.",,,20210329,PMC8008571,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adoptive cell therapy', '*CAR-T cells', '*Hematological malignancy', '*Multiple myeloma']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Stem Cell Res Ther. 2021 Aug 6;12(1):443.

However, in most of the studies patients received non-uniform treatment. METHODS: We performed a population-based analysis of 160 (122 pediatric and 38 adult) Lithuanian BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL patients who had been uniformly treated according to MRD-directed NOPHO ALL-2008 protocol. Targeted RNA sequencing and FISH analysis were performed in cases without canonical B-ALL genomic alterations (high hyperdiploids and low hypodiploids included). RESULTS: We identified ABL-class fusions in 3/160 (1.9%) B-ALL patients, and exclusively in adults (p = 0.003). JAK-STAT pathway fusions were present in 4/160 (2.5%) cases. Of note, P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion was absent in both pediatric and adult B-ALL cases. Patients with ABL-class or JAK-STAT pathway fusions had a poor MRD response and were assigned to the higher risk groups, and had an inferior event-free survival (EFS) / overall survival (OS) compared to patients without these fusions. In a multivariate analysis, positivity for ABL-class and JAK-STAT fusions was a risk factor for worse EFS (p = 0.046) but not for OS (p = 0.278) in adults. CONCLUSIONS: We report a low overall frequency of ABL-class and JAK-STAT fusions and the absence of P2RY8-CRLF2 gene fusion in the Lithuanian BCR-ABL1 negative B-ALL cohort. Future (larger) studies are warranted to confirm an inferior event-free survival of ABL-class/JAK-STAT fusion-positive adult patients in MRD-directed protocols.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8502-0750'],20210329,PMC8006339,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL-class', 'B-ALL', 'JAK-STAT', 'RNA-Seq']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 May 5.,"The definition of older age in AML is arbitrary. In the context of the clinical studies, it starts with age >/=60 or >/=65 years and in recent years >/=70 or 75, depending on the selection of the studied population. In clinical practice, with older age, we often mean that the patient is unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Higher age overlaps with categories such as worse performance status, unfitness, comorbidities, poor-risk cytogenetics, adverse mutation patterns, age-related clonal haematopoiesis and specific disease ontogeny. Intensive induction therapy can result in prolonged overall survival, at least in a subset of elderly patients aged up to 75 years despite the reluctance of some physicians and patients to use treatment regimens perceived as toxic. Venetoclax and azacitidine combination is the new standard of comparison for persons unfit for intensive therapy. New oral hypomethylating agent CC-486 as maintenance therapy led to a prolonged overall survival in a randomized trial of patients >/=55 years of age who were in first complete remission, but not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Any therapy is better than no therapy, but a substantial proportion of older patients still receive only palliative care. Making a decision for AML diagnosed in older age should be individualized and shared through the dialog with the patient and relatives or cohabitants, considering medical issues and social factors including personal goals. Although we are witnesses of the advances in basic research and therapy, we are still a very long way from curing older patients with AML.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Mutations in GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1) have been identified as the cause of these diseases, and the expression levels of the resulting protein, short-form GATA1 (GATA1s), are known to correlate with the severity of TAM. On the other hand, despite the presence of GATA1 mutations in almost all cases of DS-AMKL, the incidence of DS-AMKL in TAM patients is inversely correlated with the expression of GATA1s. This discovery has required the need to clarify the role of GATA1s in generating the cells of origin linked to the risk of both diseases. Focusing on this point, we examined the characteristics of GATA1 mutant trisomy-21 pluripotent stem cells transfected with a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible GATA1s expression cassette in a stepwise hematopoietic differentiation protocol. We found that higher GATA1s expression significantly reduced commitment into the megakaryocytic lineage at the early hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) stage, but once committed, the effect was reversed in progenitor cells and acted to maintain the progenitors. These differentiation stage-dependent reversal effects were in contrast to the results of myeloid lineage, where GATA1s simply sustained and increased the number of immature myeloid cells.

Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) may be involved in regulating BAMBI and SMAD7 expressions; a role beyond telomeres that is not clinically validated yet. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the expression levels and prognostic values of BAMBI, SMAD7 and TERT and their association with AML patients' outcomes. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 74 de-novo AML patients and 16 controls. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to analyze BAMBI, SMAD7 and TERT expressions. RESULTS: BAMBI and SMAD7 expression in AML were significantly upregulated versus controls (p< 0.05). BAMBI, SMAD7 and TERT levels were significantly correlated together (p< 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high BAMBI, SMAD7 and TERT expression levels had markedly shorter event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) time (p< 0.01). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that only high BAMBI expression was an independent risk factor for OS (p= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: BAMBI is a novel biomarker in predicting prognosis in AML patients. Moreover, a potential interplay is found between BAMBI, SMAD7 and TERT in AML pathogenies.",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BAMBI', 'SMAD7', 'TERT', 'transforming growth factor-beta']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"Counting numbers of blood neutrophils is one of the most common laboratory tests in modern clinical medicine. In this report, we have tested the idea that immunoassay of major constituents of mature neutrophils might serve as proxy of cell counting and allow the development of rapid and simple point-of-care tests. The procedure may also allow for the estimate of the state of maturity of the circulating blood cells. Immunoassays for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF) were used to measure the respective protein in whole blood extracts of 275 unselected hospitalized patient and in 51 healthy controls and leukemia patients of which eight were followed before, during and after remission treatment. MPO was correlated to neutrophil counts in the unselected hospitalized population (r = 0.95, p <.0001). Huge variations were seen in whole blood extracts of patients with AML with very high MPO/LF ratios in half of the AML patients and in all three patients with APL. In extracts from patients with ALL no difference was found in the ratio as compared to healthy persons. The monitoring of AML patients during remission treatment showed intriguing patterns one of which suggested the possibility to monitor the myelopoietic activity in the bone marrow during the recovery phase. We show a novel and easy technology to count mature neutrophils in blood and also to monitor myeloid cell maturity in the blood as well as myelopoietic activity in the bone marrow. The technology lends itself to the development of a rapid and simple point-of-care test.",,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2468-0226'],20210329,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'immunoassay', 'point-of-care', 'white blood cell differential count']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degradation of these polymers is accelerated in an acidic medium and does not result in acidic byproducts. Their biocompatibility depends on the diol used for the synthesis. The present work aims to synthesize, characterize, and fabricate nanospheres of an aliphatic polyketal for delivery of the nucleotide analogue cytarabine toward the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The internalization mechanism of the nanospheres was probed, and its implication on the nuclear localization and escape from the endo-lysosomal compartments were studied. The drug-loaded polyketal nanoparticles reduced the cell viability to a greater extent compared with the free drug. The effect of the drug-loaded polyketal nanoparticles on the differential gene expression of leukemic cells was investigated for the first time to understand their therapeutic implications. It was found that treatment with drug-loaded polyketal nanoparticles downregulated AML-specific genes involved in cell proliferation and recurrence compared to the free drug. The protein expression studies were performed for selected genes obtained from gene expression analysis. Biodistribution studies showed that the poly(cyclohexane-1,4-diyl acetone dimethylene ketal) (PCADK) nanoparticles exhibit prolonged circulation time. Overall, our results suggest that polyketal-based delivery of cytarabine represents a more effective alternative strategy for AML therapy.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9353-9053', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6508-4485']",20210329,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*cytarabine', '*microarray analysis', '*nanoparticles', '*polyketal']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, there is a limited understanding of poor treatment outcomes seen in this population.Areas covered: We provide an overview of the available literature with respect to treatment outcomes of pediatric AML in LMICs yielding poor outcomes compared to high-income countries. Moreover, treatment outcomes vary markedly between LMICs. In addition, there is a wide variation among studies in how treatment outcomes are reported and analyzed.Expert opinion: The substantially inferior treatment outcomes of pediatric AML in LMICs emphasize the unprecedented importance of global initiatives and international collaborations to improve the survival of these patients. A coordinated approach is necessary to carry out country-specific situational analyses. These analyses will result in operational plans on how to structurally implement childhood cancer registries, align healthcare infrastructure, build on capacities, and provide universal health coverage in LMICs. In addition, we strongly recommend that, in the future, LMICs document, analyze, and publish pediatric AML treatment outcomes in a more structured and uniform manner.",,,20210329,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer', 'developing countries', 'low- and middle-income countries', 'pediatric acute myeloid leukemia', 'survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Aug 24.,"OBJECTIVE: As well as being an established oncoprotein and therapeutic target in cancer, proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (Pim-1) is implicated in human autoimmunity. This study was undertaken to investigate Pim-1 and its family members as potential therapeutic targets in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A flow cytometry assay for PIM1 transcript measurement in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with early arthritis was validated and applied as a biomarker of Pim-1 activity at the cellular level. Synovial protein expression was similarly determined by multiplex immunofluorescence in tissue samples from untreated RA patients and non-RA disease controls. Functional consequences of Pim kinase family manipulation in freshly isolated CD4+ T cells from these individuals were ascertained, along with the impact of Pim inhibition on mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). RESULTS: The percentage of circulating CD4+ T cells positive for PIM1 transcript by flow cytometry proved a faithful surrogate for gene expression and was significantly higher in patients with early RA than in those with other diseases. Pim-1 protein levels were similarly up-regulated in synovial CD4+ T cells from patients with early RA. Ex vivo, exposure of T cell receptor-stimulated early RA CD4+ T cells to Pim kinase inhibitors restrained their activation and proliferative capacity. Diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma and interleukin-17) and an expanded CD25(high) FoxP3+ Treg cell fraction were also observed in exposed versus unexposed cells. Finally, administration of Pim inhibitors robustly limited arthritis progression and cartilage destruction in CIA. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that Pim kinases are plausible therapeutic targets in a readily identifiable subgroup of patients with early RA. Repurposing of Pim inhibitors for this disease should be considered.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: With institutional review board approval, 166 patients were retrospectively reviewed between 2007 and 2017 who were diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, or myelodysplastic syndromes (with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplant) and who underwent CT-guided FNAB and/or CNB of the lung. Patient medical records, pathologic reports, and interventional biopsy reports were reviewed. Results: In the study period, 166 patients underwent percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy; 36% (60 of 166) of the procedures included CNB (CNB + FNAB and CNB only), whereas 64% (106 of 166) were FNAB only. In the CNB group, FNAB was also performed for 92% (55 of 60) of the patients before CNB; 13% (eight of 60) of patients in the CNB group were nondiagnostic versus 45% (48 of 106) of FNAB only (P < .0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the pulmonary complication rates, with 1.7% of CNB and 1.9% of FNAB only requiring chest tube placement (P = .7), 5% of CNB and 2.8% of FNAB only developing hemoptysis (P = .4), and 5% of CNB and 2% of FNAB only developing hemothorax (P = .3). A change in clinical management was observed in 51% of patients with diagnostic biopsies compared with 21% of patients with nondiagnostic biopsies (P = .0002). Conclusion: CT-guided CNB is an effective technique for performing lung biopsy in patients with HMs with higher diagnostic yield compared with FNAB, and a higher, although not a statistically significant, increased risk of bleeding complications and pneumothorax.(c) RSNA, 2019See also the commentary by Elicker in this issue.","['2019 by the Radiological Society of North America, Inc.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1786-0897', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1700-7984']",20191219,PMC7977995,,,,,"['Disclosures of Conflicts of Interest: G.V.W. disclosed no relevant relationships.', 'M.M.H. disclosed no relevant relationships.

In this study, we analyzed alterations in the expression of miR-486-5p in chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients. Initially, the expression of miR-486-5p was studied in the BCR-ABL1+ve CML K562 cell line by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results indicated that the miR-486-5p expression was significantly upregulated in K562 cells after imatinib exposure, as compared to untreated K562 cells (p-value = 0.047). These observations were corroborated by a hospital-based study of the miR-486-5p expression in peripheral blood leucocytes of 36 CML patients in the chronic phase (CP) and compared with age and sex-matched healthy volunteers as control subjects. qRT-PCR-based quantification revealed significant downregulation of the miR-486-5p expression in newly diagnosed untreated CP-CML patients' samples (2(-DeltaCt) = 13.19 +/- 14.41) as compared to control samples (2(-DeltaCt) = 254.5 +/- 274.8) (p-value < 0.0001). Levels of miR-486-5p were found to be distinctly elevated in the post-imatinib treatment samples of CML patients (2(-DeltaCt) = 469.7 +/- 312.9) as compared to pre-treatment samples (p-value < 0.0001). CML patients' clinical and hematological responses to imatinib therapy (oral dose of 400 mg OD) were monitored for 12 months. The correlation of pre-treatment miR-486-5p levels with Sokal score indicated that patients with a higher expression of miR-486-5p had better prognoses. Patients with higher pre-imatinib miR-486-5p levels also showed a major hematologic response to imatinib in a shorter time and vice versa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of alterations in the miR-486-5p expression in peripheral blood leucocytes of CML patients. Our observations support a tumor suppressor role of miR-486-5p in CML. The downregulation of the miR-486-5p expression may be critically important in the disease progression of CML patients.

Notwithstanding the facts that one-step qRT-PCR is well suited for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and that there are many commercially available one-step qRT-PCR kits in the market, their high cost and unavailability due to airport closures and shipment restriction became a major bottleneck that had driven the desire to produce the key components of such kits locally. Here, we provide a simple, economical, and powerful one-step qRT-PCR kit based on patent-free, specifically tailored versions of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase and termed R3T (Rapid Research Response Team) one-step qRT-PCR. We also demonstrate the robustness of our enzyme production strategies and provide the optimal reaction conditions for their efficient augmentation in a one-step approach. Our kit was routinely able to reliably detect as low as 10 copies of the synthetic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, our kit successfully detected COVID-19 in clinical samples of broad viral titers with similar reliability and selectivity to that of the Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-step qRT-PCR and TaqPath one-step RT-qPCR kits. Overall, our kit has shown robust performance in both laboratory settings and the Saudi Ministry of Health-approved testing facility.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have successfully improved outcomes in several tumor types. In addition, currently, immune cell-based therapy is also attracting significant attention. However, the clinical efficacy of these treatments requires further improvement. The mechanisms through which cancer cells escape the immune response must be identified and clarified. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a central role in multiple aspects of malignant tumors. CSCs can initiate tumors in partially immunocompromised mice, whereas non-CSCs fail to form tumors, suggesting that tumor initiation is a definitive function of CSCs. However, the fact that non-CSCs also initiate tumors in more highly immunocompromised mice suggests that the immune evasion property may be a more fundamental feature of CSCs rather than a tumor-initiating property. In this review, we summarize studies that have elucidated how CSCs evade tumor immunity and create an immunosuppressive milieu with a focus on CSC-specific characteristics and functions. These profound mechanisms provide important clues for the development of novel tumor immunotherapies.","['(c) 2021 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

Methods: Between 1999 to 2015, we used the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database to evaluate and randomly divide 440 children diagnosed with AML into the population of training (n = 309) and validation (n = 131). The analysis of Lasso Cox was used to identify separate predictive variables. We have used essential forecasting considerations to construct a nomogram and a web-based calculator focused on Cox regression analysis. Nomogram validation was tested through discrimination and calibration. Results: Compared to the multivariate training cohort models, a nomogram integrating gender, age of diagnose, WBC at diagnosis, bone marrow leukemic blast percentage, and chromosomal abnormalities [t(8; 21), inv(16)] were designed for the prediction of OS. We also developed a predictive survival nomogram and a web-based calculator. C-indexes validated internally and checked externally were 0.747 and 0.716. The calibration curves have shown that the nomogram might accurately forecast 3-year and 5-year OS. Conclusions: A nomogram effectively predicts survival in children with AML.

Therefore, it is still necessary to identify new antigens that contribute to diagnostic information and to refine the current risk stratification. Methods: The expression of C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) in AML blasts was examined in 52 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML and was compared with two other classic markers CD33 and CD34 in AML, in order to assess the value of CLL-1 as an independent biomarker or in combination with other markers for diagnosis in AML. Subsequently, the value of CLL-1 as a biomarker for prognosis was assessed in this malignant tumor. Results: The results showed that CLL-1 was expressed on the cell surface of the majority of AML blasts (78.8%) and also expressed on leukemic stem cells in varying degree but absent on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Notably, CLL-1 was able to complement the classic markers CD33 or CD34. After dividing the cases into CLL-1(high) and CLL-1(low) groups according to cutoff 59.0%, we discovered that event-free survival and overall survival (OS) of the CLL-1(low) group were significantly lower than that of the CLL-1(high) group, and low CLL-1 expression seems to be independently associated with shorter OS.

However, available therapeutic options are still unsatisfactory in many types of cancer, and often fail due to the occurrence of resistance mechanisms. With regard to small-molecule compounds targeting the components of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2, these drugs may result ineffective as a consequence of the activation of compensatory pro-survival/proliferative signals, including receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K, as well as other components of the MAPK family such as TPL2/COT. The MAPK ERK5 has been identified as a key signaling molecule in the biology of several types of cancer. In this review, we report pieces of evidence regarding the activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway as a resistance mechanism to RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 inhibitors. We also highlight the known and possible mechanisms underlying the cross-talks between the ERK1/2 and the ERK5 pathways, the characterization of which is of great importance to maximize, in the future, the impact of RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 targeting. Finally, we emphasize the need of developing additional therapeutically relevant MEK5-ERK5 inhibitors to be used for combined treatments, thus preventing the onset of resistance to cancer therapies relying on RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Tubita, Tusa and Rovida.']",,20210311,PMC7991100,['NOTNLM'],"['ERK1/2/5', 'MAPK', 'cancer', 'combined therapy', 'resistance mechanisms', 'targeted therapy']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances being made by comparisons from epidemiological studies, common pathways and molecular mechanisms, little is known about the identities of the circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in the development and progression of these two pathologies and their possible correlations. The aim of this study was to explore the circRNA relationship between AD and cancer. Materials and Methods: In this investigation, circRNAs that were significantly dysregulated in AD or associated with AD diagnosis, clinical dementia severity, and neuropathological severity, were examined in a large panel of 28 cancer types. On the basis of shared abnormal circRNAs in AD and cancers, we constructed a circRNA-micro RNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) network by leveraging experimentally identified miRNA-circRNA and miRNA-mRNA interactions from crosslinking-immunoprecipitation sequencing data. Results: An inverse correlation of expression pattern was found in acute myeloid leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, and myelofibrosis. CircRNAs associated with AD diagnosis and clinical severity demonstrated negative correlation in more cancer types. Notably, differentially expressed candidate circRNAs in temporal lobe epilepsy were not associated with any cancers. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis suggested the circRNA-regulated genes are significantly associated with interleukin-12-mediated signaling and viral response. CircPICALM, circRTN4 and circMAN2A1 are the hub nodes in the circRNA-miRNA-target network. Conclusion: Our results indicated the relevance of inflammation signaling as a common pathogenesis shared by cancer and AD and provided novel insight for therapeutics targeting circRNAs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chen, Hao and Xu.']",,20210311,PMC7991802,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cancer', 'circRNA', 'inflammation', 'systems biology']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report summarizes the main findings from a group of expert hematologists in Italy who met to discuss treatment and management of patients with CML with focus on broad-ranging aspects of TFR. A survey was used to obtain information about the clinicians' experience with TFR and to better understand the clinical and psychological issues that patients and physicians face when considering TFR. The overall goal was to explore the possibility of discontinuing treatment from multiple points of view, considering both clinical aspects of TFR as well as psychological management of patients. Practical information is provided on aspects associated with initiating TFR, clinical data supporting it, the role of monitoring, and management of discontinuation-related adverse events.

The primary response to GCs predicts the overall response to treatment and clinical outcome. In this review, we have critically analyzed the available data on the effects of GCs on sensitive and resistant leukemic cells, in order to reveal the mechanisms of GC resistance and how these mechanisms may determine a poor outcome in ALL. Apart of the GC resistance, associated with a decreased expression of receptors to GCs, there are several additional mechanisms, triggered by alterations of different signaling pathways, which cause the metabolic reprogramming, with an enhanced level of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis resistance, and multidrug resistance. Due to all this, the GC-resistant ALL show a poor sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic protocols. We propose pharmacological strategies that can trigger alternative intracellular pathways to revert or overcome GC resistance. Specifically, we focused our search on drugs, which are already approved for treatment of other diseases and demonstrated anti-ALL effects in experimental pre-clinical models. Among them are some ""truly"" re-purposed drugs, which have different targets in ALL as compared to other diseases: cannabidiol, which targets mitochondria and causes the mitochondrial permeability transition-driven necrosis, tamoxifen, which induces autophagy and cell death, and reverts GC resistance through the mechanisms independent of nuclear estrogen receptors (""off-target effects""), antibiotic tigecycline, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration, causing energy crisis and cell death, and some anthelmintic drugs. Additionally, we have listed compounds that show a classical mechanism of action in ALL but are not used still in treatment protocols: the BH3 mimetic venetoclax, which inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine, which restores the expression of the pro-apoptotic BIM, and compounds targeting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis. Accordingly, these drugs may be considered for the inclusion into chemotherapeutic protocols for GC-resistant ALL treatments.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Olivas-Aguirre, Torres-Lopez, Pottosin and Dobrovinskaya.']",,20210311,PMC7991804,['NOTNLM'],"['BH3 mimetics', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cannabidiol', 'drug repositioning', 'glucocorticoid-resistance', 'signaling pathways', 'tamoxifen', 'tigecycline']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Oct 31.,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is implicated in various cancers, and targeting SHP2 has become a promising therapeutic approach. We herein described a robust cross-validation high-throughput screening protocol that combined the fluorescence-based enzyme assay and the conformation-dependent thermal shift assay for the discovery of SHP2 inhibitors. The established method can effectively exclude the false positive SHP2 inhibitors with fluorescence interference and was also successfully employed to identify new protein tyrosine phosphatase domain of SHP2 (SHP2-PTP) and allosteric inhibitors. Of note, this protocol showed potential for identifying SHP2 inhibitors against cancer-associated SHP2 mutation SHP2-E76A. After initial screening of our in-house compound library ( approximately 2300 compounds), we identified 4 new SHP2-PTP inhibitors (0.17% hit rate) and 28 novel allosteric SHP2 inhibitors (1.22% hit rate), of which SYK-85 and WS-635 effectively inhibited SHP2-PTP (SYK-85: IC50 = 0.32 mumol/L; WS-635: IC50 = 4.13 mumol/L) and thus represent novel scaffolds for designing new SHP2-PTP inhibitors. TK-147, an allosteric inhibitor, inhibited SHP2 potently (IC50 = 0.25 mumol/L). In structure, TK-147 could be regarded as a bioisostere of the well characterized SHP2 inhibitor SHP-099, highlighting the essential structural elements for allosteric inhibition of SHP2. The principle underlying the cross-validation protocol is potentially feasible to identify allosteric inhibitors or those inactivating mutants of other proteins.","['(c) 2021 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica,', 'Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Epub 2020 Oct 29.,"The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway plays important roles in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis and the gastrointestinal tumor microenvironment (TME). Aberrant HH signaling activation may accelerate the growth of gastrointestinal tumors and lead to tumor immune tolerance and drug resistance. The interaction between HH signaling and the TME is intimately involved in these processes, for example, tumor growth, tumor immune tolerance, inflammation, and drug resistance. Evidence indicates that inflammatory factors in the TME, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), macrophages, and T cell-dependent immune responses, play a vital role in tumor growth by affecting the HH signaling pathway. Moreover, inhibition of proliferating cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and inflammatory factors can normalize the TME by suppressing HH signaling. Furthermore, aberrant HH signaling activation is favorable to both the proliferation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the drug resistance of gastrointestinal tumors. This review discusses the current understanding of the role and mechanism of aberrant HH signaling activation in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, the gastrointestinal TME, tumor immune tolerance and drug resistance and highlights the underlying therapeutic opportunities.","['(c) 2021 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica,', 'Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Here we examine the functions of RNA modifications, with a focus on N (6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), in hematopoietic stem cells under normal conditions and in malignancy. Recent Findings: The m(6)A RNA modification is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis. Disruption of different elements of the m(6)A machinery can skew the balance of self-renewal and differentiation in normal hematopoietic stem cells. The m(6)A reader, writer, and eraser proteins are also overexpressed in myeloid leukemia, and disruption of their function impairs leukemogenesis. RNA m(6)A modification governs important aspects of immune system function, including immune cell development, immune signaling, and recognition of RNA as foreign or self. In hematopoietic stem cells, endogenously-derived double stranded RNA can form in the absence of m(6)A, inducing deleterious inflammatory pathways which compromise stem cell function. Summary: The RNA modification m(6)A exerts a variety of functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells as well as leukemic cells. Pharmacologic modulation of different elements of the m(6)A machinery provides a promising avenue for ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in the transplant setting, as well as for leukemia therapy.",,,20200812,PMC7992056,['NOTNLM'],"['N6-methyladenosine', 'RNA modification', 'dsRNA', 'hematopoiesis', 'm6A']","['R01 CA222518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK102792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DK106857/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Compliance with Ethical Standards Radovan Vasic, Yimeng Gao, Chengyang Liu, and', 'Stephanie Halene declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"Radiotherapy is widely used in the management of lung cancer, and physicians are aware that the effect of radiotherapy is dependent on radiosensitivity. Although a series of blockers and activators targeting molecules related to radioresistance have been developed as radiation sensitizers, compensatory mechanisms or drug resistance limits their clinical efficacy. The identification of a key molecule related to lung cancer cell radioresistance or an effective molecular target is a challenging but important problem in radiation oncology. A previous study found that neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is related to radioresistance in A549 cells and is associated with VEGF, PI3K-Akt, MAPK-ERK, P38, NF-kappabeta and TGF-beta. Inhibition of NRP1 can increase the radiosensitivity of A549 cells. Therefore, NRP1 may be a molecular target for radiotherapy-sensitizing drugs in lung cancer. The present study investigated the key downstream genes of NRP1, verified their regulation and clarified their roles in regulating lung cancer radioresistance. NRP1 positively regulated the downstream homeobox genes (HOXs) HOXA6, HOXA9 and mixed lineage leukaemia 5 (MLL5) in addition to MLL5-regulated HOXA6 and HOXA9, but these genes did not regulate NRP1. MLL5, HOXA6 and HOXA9 levels were decreased in tumour tissues and positively correlated with NRP1. All of these genes were induced by ionizing radiation in vivo and in vitro.

Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) upregulation mediates drug resistance in several types of human cancer and has become a therapeutic target worthy of exploration. The present study investigated AXL antigen expression and the effects of novel AXL-targeted agents in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. AXL antigen expression in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant human AML cell lines, and AML blast cells from 57 patients with different clinical characteristics, was analyzed by flow cytometry and compared. Furthermore, the effects of the novel AXL antibody DAXL-88, antibody-drug conjugate DAXL-88-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), AXL small molecule inhibitor R428 and their combination with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor quizartinib (AC220) in AML cells were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry and western blotting. The present study revealed that AXL antigen expression was upregulated in FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)/tyrosine kinase domain mutation-positive (TKD)(+) AML blast cells compared with FLT3-ITD/TKD(-) AML cells. Additionally, AXL antigen expression was markedly upregulated in the AC220-resistant FLT3-ITD(+) MV4-11 cell line (MV4-11/AC220) and in FLT3 inhibitor-resistant blast cells from a patient with FLT3-ITD(+) AML compared with parental sensitive cells. The AXL-targeted agents DAXL-88, DAXL-88-MMAE and R428 exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on FLT3-mutant AML cell lines (THP-1, MV4-11 and MV4-11/AC220) and blast cells from patients with FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Combinations of AXL-targeted agents with AC220 exerted synergistic cytotoxic effects and induced apoptosis in MV4-11/AC220 cells and FLT3 inhibitor-resistant blast cells. The antileukemic effect of DAXL-88 and DAXL-88-MMAE may rely on their ability to block AXL, FLT3 and their downstream signaling pathways. The present study demonstrated the association between AXL antigen expression upregulation and drug resistance in FLT3-ITD(+) AML, and proposed a method for overcoming FLT3 inhibitor resistance of FLT3-ITD(+) AML using novel AXL-targeted agents.",['Copyright: (c) Liu et al.'],,20210318,PMC7988696,['NOTNLM'],"['AXL receptor tyrosine kinase small-molecule inhibitor', 'FLT3 mutations', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'anti-AXL receptor tyrosine kinase antibody', 'drug resistance', 'synergistic cytotoxic effect']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal DHX32 expression contributes to cancer initiation and development, due to dysregulated cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and other processes. In the current review, the discovery, structure and function of DHX32, as well as the association between abnormal DHX32 expression and tumors are discussed. DHX32 expression is downregulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but upregulated in solid tumors, including colorectal and breast cancer. Furthermore, DHX32 expression levels are associated with the pathological and clinical features of the cancer. Therefore, DHX32 may serve as a novel liquid biopsy marker for auxiliary diagnosis and prognosis screening, as well as a possible target for cancer therapy. The molecular mechanism underlying the contribution of DHX32 towards the initiation and development of cancer requires further investigation for the development of anticancer treatments based on manipulating DHX32 expression and function.",['Copyright: (c) Wei et al.'],,20210316,PMC7988694,['NOTNLM'],"['DHX32', 'RNA helicases', 'biomarkers', 'tumor diagnosis and prognosis', 'tumor treatment']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IDO expression and elevations in Kyn metabolites are associated with immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment including T cell proliferative arrest and generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) which can favor tumor progression. However, the extent of the role of IDO in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is currently ill-defined. This study reviews the role of IDO-driven Treg function in AML and evaluates the current body of evidence implicating IDO in AML pathogenesis. Method: Studies related to IDO in AML were identified through a systematic review of PubMed and Scopus. Data extracted described sample analysis, IDO expression, IDO in prognosis, techniques used in Treg phenotypic studies, and the effect of IDO inhibitors. Results: Twenty studies were included in the systematic review. Expression of IDO was identified in a range of cells in AML, both inducible and constitutive. Seven studies indicated an association between elevated expression and poor clinical prognosis. Six studies suggested a positive correlation between IDO expression and Treg induction, with FoxP3 being the prominent Treg phenotypic marker. Of eight studies investigating IDO inhibition, some reported reductions in Treg frequency and enhanced effector T cell proliferation. Conclusion: This review highlights that IDO expression in AML is associated with poor prognosis and measurement of IDO and its Kyn metabolites may offer utility as prospective prognostic markers. Pharmacological inhibition of IDO using novel drugs may hold promise for the treatment of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wells, Kennedy and Dahal.']",,20210310,PMC7988196,['NOTNLM'],"['*1-Methyltryptophan', '*acute myeliod leukemia', '*indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase', '*prognosis', '*regulatory T cells']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased coagulability of platelets facilitates the vascular evasion and establishment of solid tumor metastasis. Furthermore, platelets can support an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment or shield tumor cells directly from engagement of cytotoxic lymphocytes as e.g., natural killer (NK) cells. Platelets are both in the tumor microenvironment and systemically the quantitatively most important source of TGF-beta, which is a key cytokine for immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. If similar platelet-tumor interactions are of physiological relevance in hematological malignancies remains less well-studied. This might be important, as T- and NK cell mediated graft vs. leukemia effects (GvL) are well-documented and malignant hematological cells have a high exposure to platelets compared to solid tumors. As NK cell-based immunotherapies gain increasing attention as a therapeutic option for patients suffering from hematological and other malignancies, we review the known interactions between platelets and NK cells in the solid tumor setting and discuss how these could also apply to hematological cancers. We furthermore explore the possible implications for NK cell therapy in patients with solid tumors and patients who depend on frequent platelet transfusions. As platelets have a protective and supportive effect on cancer cells, the impact of platelet transfusion on immunotherapy and the combination of immunotherapy with platelet inhibitors needs to be evaluated.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Schmied, Hoglund and Meinke.']",,20210310,PMC7988080,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cells', '*antitumor immunity', '*cytotoxicity', '*immunosuppressive', '*immunotherapy', '*metastasis', '*platelets', '*tumor microenvironment']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TCR gammadelta and NK cells are perceived as potent innate effector cells in HSCT and have been associated with post-transplant protection from relapse in clinical studies. Immunocompetent cells from the donor are crucial for patient outcomes and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are being increasingly applied as graft source. G-CSF is the preferential mobilizing agent in healthy donors for PBSC grafts, yet effects of G-CSF on TCR gammadelta and NK cells are scarcely uncovered and could influence the graft composition and potency of these cells. Therefore, we analyzed T and NK cell subsets and activation markers in peripheral blood samples of 49 donors before and after G-CSF mobilization and-for a subset of donors-also in the corresponding graft samples using multicolor flowcytometry with staining for CD3, CD4, CD8, TCRalphabeta, TCRgammadelta, Vdelta1, Vdelta2, HLA-DR, CD45RA, CD197, CD45RO, HLA-DR, CD16, CD56, and CD314. We found that TCR gammadelta cells were mobilized and harvested with an efficiency corresponding that of TCR alphabeta cells. For TCR gammadelta as well as for TCR alphabeta cells, G-CSF preferentially mobilized naive and terminally differentiated effector (TEMRA) cells over memory cells. In the TCR gammadelta cell compartment, G-CSF preferentially mobilized cells of the nonVdelta2 types and increased the fraction of HLA-DR positive TCR gammadelta cells. For NK cells, mobilization by G-CSF was increased compared to that of T cells, yet NK cells appeared to be less efficiently harvested than T cells. In the NK cell compartment, G-CSF-stimulation preserved the proportion of CD56dim NK effector cells which have been associated with relapse protection. The expression of the activating receptor NKG2D implied in anti-leukemic responses, was significantly increased in both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells after G-CSF stimulation. These results indicate differentiated mobilization and altering properties of G-CSF which could improve the effects of donor TCR gammadelta and NK cells in the processes of graft-versus-leukemia for relapse prevention after HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Minculescu, Sengelov, Marquart, Ryder, Fischer-Nielsen and', 'Haastrup.']",,20210310,PMC7988077,['NOTNLM'],"['*G-CSF', '*NK cells', '*TCRgammadelta cells', '*allogeneic transplantation', '*stem cell grafts']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes associated with antineoplastics' pharmacokinetics or with the immune/inflammatory response could explain variability in infection occurrence. Objective: To build a pharmacogenetic-based algorithm to predict the incidence of infections in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy. Methods: Prospective cohort study in adult patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy to treat leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma in two hospitals in Santiago, Chile. We constructed the predictive model using logistic regression. We assessed thirteen genetic polymorphisms (including nine pharmacokinetic-related genes and four inflammatory response-related genes) and sociodemographic/clinical variables to be incorporated into the model. The model's calibration and discrimination were used to compare models; they were assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and area under the ROC curve, respectively, in association with Pseudo-R(2). Results: We analyzed 203 chemotherapy cycles in 50 patients (47.8 +/- 16.1 years; 56% women), including 13 (26%) with acute lymphoblastic and 12 (24%) with myeloblastic leukemia. Pharmacokinetics-related polymorphisms incorporated into the model were CYP3A4 rs2242480C>T and OAT4 rs11231809T>A. Immune/inflammatory response-related polymorphisms were TLR2 rs4696480T>A and IL-6 rs1800796C>G. Clinical/demographic variables incorporated into the model were chemotherapy type and cycle, diagnosis, days in neutropenia, age, and sex. The Pseudo-R(2) was 0.56, the p-value of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was 0.98, showing good goodness-of-fit, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.93, showing good diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions: Genetics can help to predict infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

His platelet count decreased approximately 8 years after ET treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) and aspirin. The dose of HU was reduced because of suspected myelosuppression due to HU; however, myelosuppression did not improve. Bone marrow examination revealed myelofibrosis; therefore, ruxolitinib was administered. Approximately 1 year later, his leukocyte and blast counts in the peripheral blood increased; thus, ET was judged to have progressed to AML-myelodysplasia-related change. Induction chemotherapy and consolidation therapy were initiated; however, the patient unfortunately failed to achieve complete remission. We then continued to administer salvage chemotherapy; however, his general condition worsened, and he died from cerebral hemorrhage. The karyotype at the onset of ET was 46,XY, which changed to 47,XY,del(7q),+8 at the time of AML diagnosis. In addition, genetic testing revealed FLT-3 ITD mutation. His histopathological analysis showed subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages and tumor cell infiltration into the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum. In this case, deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7, additional abnormalities in chromosome 8, and FLT3-ITD mutation were confirmed as risk factors for having developed secondary AML for approximately 9 years and death from cerebral hemorrhage 1 year later.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by S.

However, few studies describe ponatinib for pediatric Ph+ALL; therefore, the efficacy, safety, and optimal dosage have not been determined. Here, we report a 3-year-old girl with Ph+ALL treated by a ponatinib-containing regimen with therapeutic drug monitoring in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In our case, a ponatinib-containing regimen was able to keep minimal residual disease negative, and the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of plasma ponatinib resembled that previously reported in adults. Penetration to the CSF was extremely limited. Thus, ponatinib was feasible and effective for a child with Ph+ALL, although the plasma concentration of ponatinib varied significantly throughout the treatment. The appropriate dosage should be confirmed in a prospective trial, including a detailed PK study.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by S.

Thus far, only one decade-old study on molecular characterization of Malaysian FeLV isolates exists, which resulted in a scarcity of updated information of current FeLV isolates circulating in Malaysia. This study was conducted to determine the status of FeLV in clinically ill cats and to study the molecular characterization and phylogenetic relatedness of the current isolates. Materials and Methods: Convenience sampling was performed in 20 cats from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital in Selangor. Plasma and saliva samples were collected from 15 clinically ill cats and 5 healthy cats subjected to one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers targeting a highly conserved gene of U3-LTR-gag. Results: Two clinically ill cats' plasma and saliva samples tested positive for FeLV RNA. Partial nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the current isolates were 94-99% homologous to the previous Malaysian and Japanese FeLV isolates. Conclusion: Current FeLV isolates from this study displayed higher similarity with the previous Malaysian isolates, signifying that a similar FeLV strain circulated among the cat population in Selangor.","['Copyright: (c) Mummoorthy, et al.']",,20210213,PMC7994122,['NOTNLM'],"['Malaysia', 'feline leukemia virus', 'one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction', 'phylogenetic analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to analyze the cytomorphological criteria and its pitfalls in differentiating metastatic lesion of the breast from primary malignancy. Methodology: Retrospective analysis of 891 FNACs of the breast was performed for a time span of 3 years. A total of 12 cases were diagnosed on FNAC as secondary neoplasms to the breast. Clinical and radiological data, along with Pap and MGG stained smears of each case were examined and correlated with the histopathology of the primary tumor. Statistical analysis was carried out. All cases of primary breast malignancies were excluded from our study. Results: In 10 out of 12 cases, primary malignancies were identified as Plasma cell myeloma (one case), B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (two cases), acute myeloid leukemia (one case); chronic myeloid leukemia (one case), Burkitt's lymphoma of the ovary (one case), Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (one case), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (one case), spindle cell sarcoma (one case) and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (one case). The remaining two cases in our study were misdiagnosed on cytology as metastasis and turned out to be breast primaries on histopathology.

Forty-two percent of patients had a high or very high revised Disease Risk Index (rDRI), 55% had an European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score (EBMT-RS) >/=4, and 36% had an age-adjusted Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI-age) score >/=3. Each of these was considered an unfavorable score. Using the pretransplantation unfavorable scores that had an independent impact on each transplantation outcome studied in multivariate analysis allowed for better stratification of patient outcomes. Thus, the 3-year overall survival (OS) in patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 unfavorable scores was 86%, 56%, 36%, and 24%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was negatively impacted by the EBMT-RS and the HCT-CI-age score (3-year NRM in patients with 0, 1, and 2 unfavorable scores was 12%, 33%, and 43%, respectively), whereas the EBMT-RS and the rDRI had an impact on the 3-year relapse incidence (8%, 18%, and 41% in patients with 0, 1, and 2 unfavorable scores, respectively).

Early-phase studies showed azacitidine is safe for post-transplant maintenance therapy in AML. METHODS: We performed a single institutional prospective cohort study to evaluate the benefit of azacitidine maintenance therapy following allogeneic HSCT in poor-risk AML. The main objective of this study is to generate a hypothesis aiming to optimize post-transplantation outcomes in poor-risk AML. Forty-nine adults with poor-risk AML who underwent allogeneic HSCT were evaluated in a nonrandomized prospective cohort fashion. Thirty-one participants received post-transplant azacitidine (32 mg/m(2)) on Days 1-5 for a 28-day treatment cycle beginning approximately 40 days after transplantation. The study was controlled using 18 matched individuals who were on a noninterventional surveillance protocol. RESULTS: The relapse rate was significantly higher in the control cohort (66.67%) versus (25.81%) in the azacitidine maintenance cohort (p < .005). Time to relapse was significantly prolonged by azacitidine maintenance, not reached versus 4.1 months in the control arm (p < .0001). In addition, median overall survival was lower in the control cohort at 7.6 versus 27.4 months in the interventional cohort (p < .0001). At a median follow-up of 24 months, incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not differ between study groups (p = .325). In both cohorts, minimal residual disease was correlated with higher hazard of relapse (95% confidence interval, 2.31-13.74; p < .001). CONCLUSION: We conclude that low dose azacitidine maintenance following allogeneic HSCT in poor-risk AML, decreased relapse rate, and increased both the time to relapse and overall survival without increased risk of GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2021 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

We aim to report our 20-year experience of HSCT in t-AML. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with t-AML who underwent HSCT. Patients were analyzed for prior malignancy, therapy, time to diagnosis of t-AML, transplant details, relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and predictors of outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 68 patients (59.9% female; median age, 56.5 years) underwent HSCT. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 39 (57.4%) and 23 (33.8%) patients, respectively. Cumulative incidence of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, RFS, and OS at 2 years were 17.9%, 34.5%, 47.6%, and 49.3%, respectively. Significant predictors of reduced OS were presence of 11q23 rearrangement (hazard ratio [HR], 3.24), using induction regimens other than FLAG-Ida or 7 + 3 (HR, 3.65), haploidentical donors (HR, 3.48), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 or higher (HR, 5.83), and using cyclosporine A-methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis (HR, 2.41). A significant decrement in survival was seen with an increasing number of any of these prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of t-AML are satisfactory after allo-HSCT. Patients with t-AML with good-risk karyotypes, good performance status, having HLA-matched donors, and receiving intensive induction regimens have better outcomes after HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Epub 2021 Feb 26.,"Several prospective randomized trials comparing conditioning intensity before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have been performed, with conflicting results. Although reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) leads to lower treatment-related mortality (TRM), this is offset by higher rates of relapse. Long-term follow-up of randomized comparative trials are limited. Here we present long-term follow-up of a randomized comparison of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) compared with RIC before HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS). Long-term comparative analyses of overall survival, relapse, and relapse-free survival were performed. Patients age 18 to 65 years with <5% marrow myeloblasts were randomized to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137), followed by HCT from an HLA-matched donor. The primary endpoint of the trial was an 18-month pointwise comparison of overall survival. The analyses were performed using a proportional hazards model. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 51 months. At 4 years, the transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 25.1% for MAC, compared with 9.9% for RIC (P < .001). Patients who received RIC had a significantly higher risk of relapse compared to those who received MAC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.06; 95% CI, 2.59 to 6.35; P < 0.001). Among the patients who relapsed after HCT, postrelapse survival was similar at 3 years (24% for MAC and 26% for RIC). Overall survival was superior for patients who received MAC compared to those who received RIC (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.2; P = .03). Our data show that patients who received MAC were at higher risk of late TRM compared with those who received RIC; however, because of the exceedingly high rates of relapse in the RIC arm, overall survival remained significantly better for patients who received MAC. Among patients with MDS or AML eligible for either MAC or RIC regimens, long-term follow up demonstrates a survival advantage for patients who received MAC.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Despite recent advances in CLL treatment, RT also develops in patients on novel agents, usually occurring as an early event. RT incidence is lower in CLL patients treated with novel agents in the front line compared to relapsed/refractory cases, with a higher incidence in patients with TP53 disruption. The genetic heterogeneity and complexity are higher in RT-DLBCL than CLL; the genetics of RT-HL are largely unknown. In addition to TP53, aberrations in CDKN2A, MYC, and NOTCH1 are common in RT-DLBCL; however, no distinct RT-specific genetic aberration is recognised yet. RT-DLBCL on ibrutinib is frequently associated with BTK and PLCG2 mutations.

However, learning self-management can be quite challenging for young adults. This paper aims to describe the symptoms self-management learning experiences of young adults following an allogeneic stem cell transplant. METHOD: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted to describe self-management learning experiences of young adults (18-39 years old) following an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Semi-structured interviews were conducted (n = 7, mean age 26 years old, mean time since allogeneic stem cell transplant was 14,71 months). Iterative qualitative content analysis was performed. RESULTS: Participants who had undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant described learning self-management as a progressive process, with expertise having to be developed through experience. Certain factors could positively or negatively affect the learning process and hence the development of this self-management expertise. With time, these young adults developed interoceptive ability and body awareness related to their symptoms, which influenced their self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Following an allogeneic stem cell transplant, young adults need to be supported during their survivorship to develop self-management expertise. Nurses must adapt care according to patients' level of expertise to promote autonomy, development of interoceptive ability, and acquisition of self-management skills.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2021 Mar 26.,"The discovery of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway was a major advance in understanding eukaryotic signal transduction. The high frequency of PI 3-kinase pathway mutations in many cancers stimulated the development of drugs targeting these oncogenic mutants. The PI 3-kinases are divided into three classes and Class I PI 3-kinases, which catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), are the main subject of this review. The class I PI 3-kinases are made up of p110alpha, p110beta, p110delta, and p110gamma catalytic subunits. These catalytic subunits are constitutively bound to regulatory subunits (p85alpha, p85beta, p55gamma, p101, and p87 proteins). The p85/p55 regulatory subunits heterodimerize with p110alpha or p110delta thereby forming complexes that are regulated chiefly by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The p101 and p87 subunits heterodimerize with p110gamma to form complexes that are regulated mainly by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Complexes containing the p110beta subunit are activated by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases as well as GPCRs. Following the generation of PIP3, the AKT and mTOR protein-serine/threonine kinases are activated leading to cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Like protein kinases, the PI 3-kinase domains consist of a bilobed structure connected by a hinge-linker segment. ATP and most PI 3-kinase and protein kinase inhibitors form hydrogen bonds with hinge residues. The small and large lobes of PI 3-kinases and protein kinases have a very similar three-dimensional structure called the protein kinase fold. Both PI 3-kinases and eukaryotic protein kinases possess an activation segment that begins with a DFG triad (Asp-Phe-Gly); the activation segment of protein kinases usually ends with an APE (Ala-Pro-Glu) signature while that of PI 3-kinases ends with a PFxLT (Pro-Phe-Xxx-Leu-Thr) signature. Dormant PI 3-kinases have a collapsed activation loop and active PI 3-kinases have an extended activation loop. The distance between the alpha-carbon atom of the DFG-D residue at the beginning of the activation loop and that of the PFxLT-F residue at the end of the activation loop in dormant PI 3-kinases is about 13 A; this distance in active PI 3-kinases is about 18 A. The protein kinase catalytic loop has an HRD (His-Arg-Asp) signature while that of the PI 3-kinases reverses the order with a DRH triad. Alpelisib is an orally effective FDA-approved PI 3-kinase-alpha inhibitor used for the treatment of breast cancer. Copanlisib, duvelisib, idelalisib, and umbralisib are PI 3-kinase-delta inhibitors that are approved for the third-line treatment of follicular lymphomas and other hematological disorders. Copanlisib is also a potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinase-alpha. Of the five approved drugs, all are orally bioavailable except copanlisib. Idelalisib interacts with the active conformation of PI 3-kinase-delta and is classified as a type I inhibitor. Alpelisib and copanlisib interact with inactive PI 3-kinase-alpha and PI 3-kinase-gamma, respectively, and are classified as a type I(1/2) antagonists. Except for umbralisib with a molecular weight of 571.5, all five drugs conform to the Lipinski rule of five for oral effectiveness. Copanlisib, however, must be given intravenously. Alpelisib and copanlisib inhibit PI 3-kinase-alpha, which is involved in insulin signaling, and both drugs promote insulin-resistance and produce hyperglycemia. The five FDA-approved PI 3-kinase inhibitors produce significant on-target toxicities, more so than many approved protein kinase antagonists. The development of PI 3-kinase inhibitors with fewer toxicities is an important long-term therapeutic goal.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effect of PC interventions on patient- and caregiver- reported outcomes and healthcare utilization among adults with HMs (leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma). METHODS: From database inception through September 10, 2020, we systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Reviews using terms representing HMs and PC. Eligible studies investigated adults aged 18 years and older, were published in the English language, and contained original, quantitative, or qualitative data related to patient- and/or caregiver-centered outcomes and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: We screened 5345 studies;16 met inclusion criteria and found that specialty PC led to improved symptom management, decreased likelihood of inpatient death, decreased healthcare utilization, decreased cost of healthcare, and improved caregiver-reported outcomes. Patients with HM have a high need for PC which, though increasing over time, is often provided late in the clinical disease course. CONCLUSIONS: Specialty PC interventions improve healthcare outcomes for patients with HMs and should be implemented early and often. There remains a need for additional studies investigating PC use exclusively in patients with HMs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Epub 2021 Mar 16.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm caused by a reciprocal translocation [t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)] that leads to the fusion of ABL1 gene sequences (9q34) downstream of BCR gene sequences (22q11) and is cytogenetically visible as Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). The resulting BCR/ABL1 chimeric protein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signaling pathways, which collectively lead to malignant transformation. During the early (chronic) phase of CML (CP-CML), the myeloid cell compartment is expanded, but differentiation is maintained. Without effective therapy, CP-CML invariably progresses to blast phase (BP-CML), an acute leukemia of myeloid or lymphoid phenotype. The development of BCR-AB1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the treatment of CML and ignited the start of a new era in oncology. With three generations of BCR/ABL1 TKIs approved today, the majority of CML patients enjoy long term remissions and near normal life expectancy. However, only a minority of patients maintain remission after TKI discontinuation, a status termed treatment free remission (TFR). Unfortunately, 5-10% of patients fail TKIs due to resistance and are at risk of progression to BP-CML, which is curable only with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Overcoming TKI resistance, improving the prognosis of BP-CML and improving the rates of TFR are areas of active research in CML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor, as an attractive analytical tool, has shown a great potential in sensitive cell counting. Its detection efficiency is strongly dependent on the electrochemiluminescent materials, whose property is related to its morphology and surface vacancies. Herein, the ultrathin Lu2O3-S nanosheets contain abundant oxygen vacancies were newly synthesized. Its special two-dimensional (2D) structure morphology and surface vacancy endowed it intensified and stable ECL emission. The possible mechanism was deduced from experiments and discussed. Then, through integrating with a DNA device cycle-amplification system plus signal conversion pretreatment, we constructed a crossed enhanced ECL cytosensing platform. In this system, the target cells were transformed into programmable sequences, which could be next coupled with DNA device cycle-amplification on the modified electrode surface. Using Ag2S quantum dots as the energy acceptor toward Lu2O3-S donor, and CCRF-CEM cells (CEM) as the model CTCs, an enhanced ECL cytosensing platform was proposed, displaying good analytical performance for acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer cell detection. The ECL signal responded proportionately on the CEM cells concentration in a wide range of 5 x 10 to 1 x 10(6) cells/mL, and a low detection limit of 10 cells/mL was obtained.

Pulmonary post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a particularly aggressive and rapidly progressive disease, with high morbidity and mortality. There are a very limited number of reported pulmonary PTLD cases following HSCT in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early diagnosis and detection of pulmonary PTLD is critical given its high lethality. However, variable clinical presentations and nonspecific radiographic findings make pulmonary PTLD difficult to distinguish from other more common causes of pulmonary disease in AML patients. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a 68-year-old Caucasian man who presented for salvage induction therapy following relapse of his AML after a haploidentical allogeneic HSCT 10 months earlier. He developed recurrent fevers, dry cough, and hypoxemia, with chest computed tomography (CT) showing bibasilar consolidations and increased nodularity without increased lymphadenopathy. His symptoms initially improved with antibiotic and antifungal therapy, but his follow-up chest CT showed progression of disease despite symptomatic improvement. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in his blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and a lung biopsy revealed monomorphic PTLD with B cells positive for EBV. Unfortunately, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, and he passed away prior to treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an AML patient developing pulmonary PTLD relatively late in his post-transplant course in the setting of relapsed disease and salvage therapy. Pulmonary PTLD, a rare but highly lethal disorder, can imitate the symptoms and radiographic findings of pneumonia, a common diagnosis in immunocompromised AML patients. This case illustrates the importance of considering pulmonary PTLD in the differential diagnosis for pulmonary disease in AML patients with a history of HSCT, especially in the setting of progressive radiographic findings despite broad antibacterial and antifungal therapy. Further, our case demonstrates the importance of biopsy and uninterrupted EBV DNA monitoring in the definitive diagnosis of PTLD, given nonspecific symptomatology and radiographic findings.",,,20210328,PMC8005240,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Case report', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect mechanism of TQ on AML cells still not fully understood. In this study, the authors examined the effects of TQ on the expression of JAK/STAT-negative regulator genes SOCS-1, SOCS-3, and SHP-1, and their consequences on cell proliferation and apoptosis in HL60 leukemia cells. METHODS: MTT and trypan blue exclusion tests were conducted to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and cell proliferation. FITC Annexin and Guava(R) reagent were used to study the cell apoptosis and examine the cell cycle phases, respectively. The expression of JAK/STAT-negative regulator genes, SOCS-1, SOCS-3, and SHP-1, was investigated using reverse transcriptase- quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: TQ demonstrated a potential inhibition of HL60 cell proliferation and a significant increase in apoptotic cells in dose and time-dependent manner. TQ significantly induced cycle arrest at G0-G1 phase (P < 0.001) and enhanced the re-expression of JAK/STAT-negative regulator genes. CONCLUSION: TQ potentially inhibited HL60 cell proliferation and significantly increased apoptosis with re-expression of JAK/STAT-negative regulator genes suggesting that TQ could be a new therapeutic candidate for leukemia therapy.<br />.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6194-2729', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3701-4006', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6344-0220']",20210301,PMC8286695,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK/STAT signaling', 'Leukemia', 'negative regulators', 'thymoquinone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A complete remission could not achieved after first chemotherapy treatment. Due to primary resistance and variant of t(8;21), stem cell transplantation was performed. The variant translocation we have reported is unique and also the case is the second case that was reported in the literature in terms of the relocation of the AML1/ETO fusion gene.

However, acute medical issues or disease treatment plans may prevent a safe transfer to the inpatient rehabilitation unit. Accordingly, Short-term Pediatric Rehabilitation Intensive Therapy (SPRINT), a 2-week inpatient intensive therapy program, was developed for pediatric patients on an acute care service. OBJECTIVE: To assess functional outcomes of SPRINT participants, adverse events associated with the program, and measures of patients' fatigue, sadness, nervousness, and pain by parents and patients at the start and end of SPRINT. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant units at regional pediatric tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen pediatric patients (50% female, age 1.9-17.8 years) participated in SPRINT, and 11 parents and 4 children completed questionnaires. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional outcomes of SPRINT participants measured by Caregiver Assistance section of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), adverse events identified on chart review, and inquiry of participants' symptoms before and after SPRINT with a questionnaire. RESULTS: Common diagnoses included leukemia and lymphoma (N = 9, 50%) and central nervous system tumor (N = 6, 33%). Deconditioning (N = 18, 100%) and peripheral neuropathy (N = 8, 44.4%) were common rehabilitation diagnoses. Significant gains were found in tasks in self-care and mobility domains of PEDI (all P < .05), as well as functional expression in social function domain (P = .03). No adverse events related to SPRINT participation were identified. There was no significant difference between pre- and post-SPRINT questionnaire responses. CONCLUSIONS: SPRINT is an alternative model for intensive rehabilitation care delivery. Data suggested that SPRINT participation was safe and resulted in significant gains in mobility, self-care, and functional expression for pediatric patients with hematologic and oncologic diagnoses while receiving acute care. No difference was found in questionnaire responses after SPRINT participation.",['(c) 2021 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9729-2833'],20210327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 27.,"BACKGROUND: Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We assessed immunity to S. pneumoniae among children after ALL treatment, and the impact of pneumococcal immunization during and after chemotherapy. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study of children treated for ALL at a single center. All children were fully immunized with three routine doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) prior to ALL diagnosis. Children from Group 1 received a 13-valent PCV (PCV13) dose during the maintenance phase as well as a PCV13 booster after completing chemotherapy, while Group 2 only received the postchemotherapy dose. Serologic testing was performed after chemotherapy and again after the postchemotherapy dose. A serotype-specific antibody level >/=0.35 mug/ml was considered protective, and patients with protective levels for >/=70% of serotypes in the PCV7 vaccine were defined as seroprotected. RESULTS: A total of 71 children (median age 46 months, range 12-160) were included. At the end of chemotherapy, 53.1% of children in Group 1 (17/32) and 25.6% in Group 2 (10/39) were seroprotected (p = .018). After the postchemotherapy booster, seroprotection rates increased to 96.9% in Group 1 (31/32) and 100% in Group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of pneumococcal seroprotection among children with ALL are low following chemotherapy, despite prior routine immunization. A PCV booster during chemotherapy may shorten the period of susceptibility to IPD in some children. However, irrespective of a booster during chemotherapy, a PCV dose postchemotherapy appears sufficient to confer high rates of seroprotection against IPD.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-0746-2737'],20210327,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy', '*children', '*leukemia', '*pneumococcal conjugate vaccine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to prove the safety and tolerability of intravenous allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in PD patients. METHODS: This was a 12-month single-center open-label dose-escalation phase 1 study of 20 subjects with mild/moderate PD assigned to a single intravenous infusion of 1 of 4 doses: 1, 3, 6, or 10 x 10(6) allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells/kg, evaluated 3, 12, 24, and 52 weeks postinfusion. Primary outcome safety measures included transfusion reaction, study-related adverse events, and immunogenic responses. Secondary outcomes included impact on peripheral markers, PD progression, and changes in brain perfusion. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse reactions related to the infusion and no responses to donor-specific human leukocyte antigens. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events were dyskinesias (20%, n = 4) with 1 emergent and 3 exacerbations; and hypertension (20%, n = 4) with 3 transient episodes and 1 requiring medical intervention. One possibly related serious adverse event occurred in a patient with a 4-year history of lymphocytosis who developed asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Peripheral inflammation markers appear to be reduced at 52 weeks in the highest dose including, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P < 0.05), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 22 (P < 0.05), whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (P < 0.05) increased. The highest dose seems to have demonstrated the most significant effect at 52 weeks, reducing the OFF state UPDRS motor, -14.4 (P < 0.01), and total, -20.8 (P < 0.05), scores. CONCLUSION: A single intravenous infusion of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells at doses of 1, 3, 6, or 10 x 10(6) allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells/kg is safe, well tolerated, and not immunogenic in mild/moderate PD patients.

Epub 2021 Apr 18.,"Recent studies have shown that therapeutic drug monitoring of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) could improve treatment efficacy and safety. A simple analytical method using high-performance LC/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of BCR-ABL and Bruton's TKIs used for chronic leukemia (imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and ibrutinib) in human plasma. Although these structures and physical properties are similar, owing to their different linear ranges, simultaneously determining the plasma levels of these five TKIs by applying optimal MS parameters remains difficult. A quantitative range exceeding 60,000-fold was required, and the linear dynamic ranges of imatinib, bosutinib, and nilotinib were limited because of the presence of a saturated detection signal. In this study, we applied the in-source collision-induced dissociation technique to control the ion amounts in mass spectrometry. This new method allowed rapid determination within 5 min with simple pretreatment. The method was validated according to the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Moreover, all samples of patients with chronic leukemia were successfully measured and their values were within the linear range of measurement. Therefore, our high-throughput analytical system is useful to measure the plasma concentrations of imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and ibrutinib in clinical practice.","['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2148-6129', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1438-7800', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8979-2408', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8807-2417', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1679-9024']",20210418,,['NOTNLM'],"['LC/ESI-MS/MS', 'chronic leukemia', 'in-source CID', 'therapeutic drug monitoring', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",['Shimadzu Corporation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory proliferation effect of hupehenenine and its three related alkaloid derivatives, including o-caproyl-hupehenenine, o-(2-furanoyl)-hupehenenine, and Delta(5(6)) -isopeimine on human lung cancer cell line, human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line, and human thyroid duct cancer cell line in vitro, has been identified. This study first developed a sensitive HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of hupehenenine and three alkaloid derivatives in rat plasma and tissues. The developed method was validated, and it was linear over the concentration range of 1-800 ng/mL for all analytes with R(2) >/= 0.9939 and 0.9972, respectively, in rat plasma and rat liver homogenate. The lower limit of quantitation was 1 ng/mL for all analytes. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were satisfactory. This validated method was successfully applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of hupehenenine in rats. In pharmacokinetic study, the maximum plasma concentration of rats exists gender difference. Tissue distribution study showed that hupehenenine has good affinity for multiple tissues but is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results may provide a useful reference for further research of hupehenenine and its three related alkaloid derivatives.","['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5620-9928'],20210503,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bulbus Hupehensis Fritillariae', 'HPLC-MS/MS', 'hupehenenine', 'pharmacokinetics', 'tissue distribution']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 27.,"BCR-ABL1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and it has been investigated as a druggable target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over two decades. Since imatinib, the first TKI for anti-cancer therapy, was successfully applied in CML therapy, further generation TKIs and a novel allosteric inhibitor targeting the myristate binding site have been developed as alternative options for CML management. However, significant concerns regarding toxicity profiles, especially in long-term treatment, have emerged from TKI clinical data. Efforts to reduce adverse events and serious complications are warranted not only for survival, but also quality of life in CML patients. A better understanding of the mechanism of action will help to identify on- and off-target effects of TKIs, and guide personalized TKI drug selection in each individual CML patient. Herein, this review summarizes the biologic mechanism of BCR-ABL1 inhibition and differential target spectra, and related off-target effects of each TKI.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2640-4911'],20210327,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Drug targets', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was a 39-year-old Japanese man with aggressive NK cell leukemia. He had no previous history of allergies. After receiving CBT, the patient had an unbalanced diet with high preference for bread, bananas, miso-soup, cow's milk, cheese, egg, sesame and buckwheat soba noodles, and experienced repeated diarrhea. Six months later, he developed symptoms such as vomiting, epigastric pain, diarrhea, high fever and hypotension. The condition was initially diagnosed as enterocolitis, but symptoms recurred after consumption of buckwheat. Anaphylaxis induced by buckwheat was confirmed with serum radioallergosorbent tests (RAST), showing allergen-specific IgE for buckwheat (greater than 100 U/mL, Class 6) and egg ovomucoid (Class 4). Nineteen months after a buckwheat and egg-free diet, serum RAST for buckwheat and egg significantly improved. As a result, the patient acquired a tolerance and was able to consume buckwheat and egg without allergic symptoms.",['(c) 2021.

However, the pathophysiological roles of cytoplasmic DNAs in leukemias remain largely unknown. We observed that during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in mouse myeloid leukemia models, double-stranded (ds)DNAs were constitutively secreted in the form of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from myeloid leukemia cells and were transferred to the donor cells to dampen their hematopoietic capabilities. Subsequent analysis of cytoplasmic DNA dynamics in leukemia cells revealed that autophagy regulated cytoplasmic dsDNA accumulation and subsequent redistribution into EVs. Moreover, accumulated cytoplasmic dsDNAs activated STING pathway, thereby reducing leukemia cell viability through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Pharmaceutical inhibition of autophagosome formation induced cytoplasmic DNA accumulation, eventually triggering cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathways to exert cytotoxicity, preferentially in leukemia cells. Thus, manipulation of cytoplasmic dsDNA dynamics can be a novel and potent therapeutic strategy for myeloid leukemias.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2161-2087', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3733-260X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4193-1851']",20210326,PMC7997981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that ATL can be detected early in HTLV-1-carriers through quantification of T-cell receptor (TCR)Vbeta subunit diversity on T-cells infected with HTLV-1 (CD3+ CCR4+ CD26- T-cells) using an 'oligoclonality index' (OCI-flow). We established a reference range for OCI-flow by analysing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HTLV-1-carriers who had not developed ATL in a median of 10.5 years follow up (n = 38) and patients with ATL (n = 30). In the third cohort of HTLV-1-carriers with no history or clinical evidence of ATL (n = 106), 19% of high proviral load (PVL, >/=4 copies of HTLV-1/100 PBMCs) carriers had an OCI-flow in the ATL range, >0.770. Carriers with an OCI-flow >0.770 (n = 14) had higher lymphocyte counts and PVLs and were more likely to have a family history of ATL than carriers with OCI-flow </=0.770. ATL subsequently developed in two of these 14 carriers but no carriers with OCI-flow </=0.770 (p = 0.03, cumulative follow-up 129 person-years). This method can be used to identify a subset of high-PVL HTLV-1-carriers at increased risk of developing ATL who may benefit from intervention therapy, prior to the detection of disease.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7897-1814'],20210326,PMC7997885,,,['MR/R017271/1/RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that the Alphabody scaffold can be engineered into a cell-penetrating protein antagonist against induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein MCL-1, an intracellular target in cancer, by grafting the critical B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3 helix of MCL-1 onto the Alphabody and tagging the scaffold's termini with designed cell-penetration polypeptides. Introduction of an albumin-binding moiety extended the serum half-life of the engineered Alphabody to therapeutically relevant levels, and administration thereof in mouse tumor xenografts based on myeloma cell lines reduced tumor burden. Crystal structures of such a designed Alphabody in complex with MCL-1 and serum albumin provided the structural blueprint of the applied design principles. Collectively, we provide proof of concept for the use of Alphabodies against intracellular disease mediators, which, to date, have remained in the realm of small-molecule therapeutics.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"BACKGROUND: Biallelic variants in IL6ST, encoding GP130, cause a recessive form of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) characterized by high IgE level, eosinophilia, defective acute phase response, susceptibility to bacterial infections, and skeletal abnormalities due to cytokine-selective loss of function in GP130, with defective IL-6 and IL-11 and variable oncostatin M (OSM) and IL-27 levels but sparing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to understand the functional and structural impact of recessive HIES-associated IL6ST variants. METHODS: We investigated a patient with HIES by using exome, genome, and RNA sequencing. Functional assays assessed IL-6, IL-11, IL-27, OSM, LIF, CT-1, CLC, and CNTF signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations and structural modeling of GP130 cytokine receptor complexes were performed. RESULTS: We identified a patient with compound heterozygous novel missense variants in IL6ST (p.Ala517Pro and the exon-skipping null variant p.Gly484_Pro518delinsArg). The p.Ala517Pro variant resulted in a more profound IL-6- and IL-11-dominated signaling defect than did the previously identified recessive HIES IL6ST variants p.Asn404Tyr and p.Pro498Leu. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the p.Ala517Pro and p.Asn404Tyr variants result in increased flexibility of the extracellular membrane-proximal domains of GP130. We propose a structural model that explains the cytokine selectivity of pathogenic IL6ST variants that result in recessive HIES. The variants destabilized the conformation of the hexameric cytokine receptor complexes, whereas the trimeric LIF-GP130-LIFR complex remained stable through an additional membrane-proximal interaction. Deletion of this membrane-proximal interaction site in GP130 consequently caused additional defective LIF signaling and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a structural basis to understand clinical phenotypes in patients with IL6ST variants.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The aim of this review was to evaluate the role of comorbidities and frailty as prognostic factors as well as predictive factors of response and tolerability to hypomethylating agents. Both comorbidities and frailty were shown to be predictive of overall survival; however, they mostly correlate with risk for non-leukemic death rather than leukemia-free survival. In patients with higher-risk MDS, comorbidities burden and frailty might be predictive of poor treatment response as well as increased toxicity. In this context, all patients with MDS should be evaluated for comorbidities and frailty at baseline, preferentially using indices validated for MDS. This assessment should guide the selection of treatment.

It has been shown to exert cytolysis on microbes and tumors. We showed previously that 9-kDa granulysin exerted cell death by apoptosis in vitro on hematological tumor cell lines and also on cells from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. In addition, we have shown the anti-tumor efficiency of granulysin as a single agent in two in vivo models of human tumor development in athymic mice, the MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma and the NCI-H929 multiple myeloma, without signs of overt secondary effects by itself. In this work, we have tested recombinant 9-kDa granulysin in an in vivo and especially aggressive model of melanoma development, xenografted UACC62 cells in athymic mice. Recombinant granulysin was administered once UACC62-derived tumors were detectable and it substantially retarded the in vivo development of this aggressive tumor. We could also detect apoptosis induction and increased NK cell infiltration inside granulysin-treated tumor tissues. These observations are especially interesting given the possibility of treating melanoma by intra-tumor injection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Here, we report that the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate links metabolism to mitobiogenesis through binding to malic enzyme 2 (ME2). Mechanistically, fumarate binds ME2 with two complementary consequences. First, promoting the formation of ME2 dimers, which activate deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (DUT). DUT fosters thymidine generation and an increase of mtDNA. Second, fumarate-induced ME2 dimers abrogate ME2 monomer binding to mitochondrial ribosome protein L45, freeing it for mitoribosome assembly and mtDNA-encoded protein production. Methylation of the ME2-fumarate binding site by protein arginine methyltransferase-1 inhibits fumarate signaling to constrain mitobiogenesis. Notably, acute myeloid leukemia is highly dependent on mitochondrial function and is sensitive to targeting of the fumarate-ME2 axis. Therefore, mitobiogenesis can be manipulated in normal and malignant cells through ME2, an unanticipated governor of mitochondrial biomass production that senses nutrient availability through fumarate.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Putative enhancers are established by binding of the pioneer factor C/EBPalpha followed by chromatin opening and enhancer RNA (eRNA) synthesis from H3K4-monomethylated regions. Using eRNA synthesis as a proxy for enhancer activity, we find that most putative enhancers cooperate in an additive way to regulate transcription of assigned target genes. However, transcription from 136 target genes depends exponentially on the summed activity of its putative paired enhancers, indicating that these enhancers cooperate synergistically. The target genes are cell type-specific, suggesting that enhancer synergy can contribute to cell fate determination. Enhancer synergy appears to depend on cell type-specific transcription factors, and such interacting enhancers are not predicted from occupancy or accessibility data that are used to detect superenhancers.","['(c) 2021, Choi et al.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4909-9473', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7829-4243', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1404-1992', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9642-8244', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9906-0980', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2774-4117', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5454-7755']",20210326,PMC8004103,['NOTNLM'],"['*c/ebpa', '*computational biology', '*enhancer cooperation', '*genetics', '*genomics', '*human', '*systems biology', '*transcriptional regulation', '*transdifferentiation']","['SPP1935/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'SFB860/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '693023/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'SPP2191/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'Open-access funding/Max-Planck-Gesellschaft']",,"['JC, KL, GS, CD, JS, TT, TG, PC No competing interests declared']",,"['GEO/GSE131620', 'GEO/GSE141226']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, recent approvals of CAR T-cell therapy, the antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab, and the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody tafasitamab have provided efficacious options for patients with relapsed and refractory disease. These immunotherapies attempt to harness power from the patient's own immune system to eradicate lymphoma. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, oral targeted kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib (Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) are now favored over chemoimmunotherapy for upfront treatment because of improved progression-free survival across all subgroups (including high-risk subgroups such as unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain and chromosome 17p deletion). In indolent lymphomas, several PI3K inhibitors are approved for treatment of relapsed disease. However, uptake of these agents has been limited because of toxicity concerns. Combination of lenalidomide and rituximab has been a safe and effective immune modality for patients with refractory indolent lymphomas; it is currently being used as a backbone to bring other targeted agents such as tazemetostat (EZH2 inhibitor) into earlier lines of treatment. In this article, we will review novel commercially available agents in the treatment of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and relapsed/refractory indolent lymphomas. We will evaluate clinical trials that led to their approval and will provide an outlook into the future novel agents currently under investigation in B-cell malignancies.",,,,,,,['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) that mediate activation of Nrf2, in the cytosol and its release from Keap1, have been extensively studied but PTMs that impact its biology after activation are beginning to emerge. In this regard, PTMs like acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation contribute towards the Nrf2 subcellular localization, and its transactivation function. We previously demonstrated that Nrf2 traffics to the promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies (PML-NB), where it is a target for modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins (sumoylation), but the site(s) for SUMO conjugation have not been determined. In this study, we aim to identify SUMO-2 conjugation site(s) and explore the impact, sumoylation of the site(s) have on Nrf2 stability, nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of its target gene expression upon oxidative stress. METHODS: The putative SUMO-binding sites in Nrf2 for human isoform1 (NP_006155.2) and mouse homolog (NP_035032.1) were identified using a computer-based SUMO-predictive software (SUMOplot). Site-directed mutagenesis, immunoblot analysis, and ARE-mediated reporter gene assays were used to assess the impact of sumoylation on these site(s) in vitro. Effect of mutation of these sumoylation sites of Nrf2 on expression of Heme Oxygenase1 (HO-1) was determined in HEK293T cell. RESULTS: Eight putative sumoylation sites were identified by SUMOplot analysis. Out of the eight predicted sites only one (532)LKDE(535) of human (h) and its homologous (524)LKDE(527) of mouse (m) Nrf2, exactly matches the SUMO-binding consensus motif. The other high probability SUMO-acceptor site identified was residue K(110), in the motifs (109)PKSD(112) and (109)PKQD(112) of human and mouse Nrf2, respectively. Mutational analysis of putative sumoylation sites (human (h)/mouse (m)K(110), hK(533) and mK(525)) showed that these residues are needed for SUMO-2 conjugation, nuclear localization and ARE driven transcription of reporter genes and the endogenous HO-1 expression by Nrf2. These residues also stabilized Nrf2, as evident from shorter half-lives of the mutant protein compared to wild-type Nrf2. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that SUMO-2mediated sumoylation of K(110) and K(533) in human Nrf2 regulates in part its transcriptional activity by enhancing its stabilization and nuclear localization.",['(c) Copyright by the Author(s).

However, quantification using traditional reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is dependent on a calibration curve and is prone to laboratory-to-laboratory variation. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a novel method that allows for highly sensitive absolute quantification of transcript copy number. As such, ddPCR is a good candidate for disease monitoring, an assay requiring reproducible measurements with high specificity and sensitivity. OBJECTIVE.-: To compare results of ddPCR and RT-qPCR BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript measurements of patient samples and determine if either method is superior. DESIGN.-: We optimized and standardized a 1-step multiplexed ddPCR assay to detect BCR-ABL1 p190 and ABL1 e10 transcripts. The ddPCR optimization included varying cycle number and primer concentration with standardization of droplet generation and droplet number and analyses to improve data sensitivity. Following optimization, ddPCR measurements were performed on clinical samples and compared with traditional RT-qPCR results. RESULTS.-: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction was able to detect the BCR-ABL1 p190 transcript to 0.001% (1:10-5) with a calculated limit of detection and limit of quantitation of 4.1 and 5.3 transcripts, respectively. When tested on patient samples, ddPCR was able to identify 20% more positives than a laboratory-developed 2-step RT-qPCR assay. CONCLUSIONS.-: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction demonstrated increased detection of BCR-ABL1 compared with RT-qPCR. Improved detection of BCR-ABL1 p190 and the potential for improved standardization across multiple laboratories makes ddPCR a suitable method for disease monitoring in patients with acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differing clinical behaviors have been observed in cases with CBL versus other RAS-pathway gene (RAS-p) mutations, notably the patients with CBL mutations can be self-limiting with spontaneous resolution. Additional clinical characteristics and histopathologic findings between these subsets are less well-described. We performed a retrospective search and identified cases with either CBL or RAS-p mutations, as per targeted and/or massively parallel sequencing. Eight patients had sufficient material for review, including cytogenetic studies and peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, and/or biopsy with flow cytometry analyses. Three patients showed CBL mutations and lower percentages of hemoglobin F and peripheral blood absolute monocyte counts, lesser degrees of leukocytosis compared with the RAS-p cohort, and normal megakaryocyte morphology and myeloblast immunophenotypes. Two of these patients were managed with observation only and experienced resolution of their disease. The patients with RAS-p mutations had severe thrombocytopenia, moderate to severe anemia, and experienced variable clinical outcomes. Abnormal megakaryocyte morphology and decreased numbers of megakaryocytes were seen in cases with RAS-p mutations. In addition, 3 of 4 cases with flow cytometry data demonstrated aberrant CD7 expression in myeloblasts. Our study is the first to identify morphologic and immunophenotypic differences between juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia cases with CBL or RAS-p mutations, and further supports previous reports of significantly different clinical behaviors between these subsets of patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: Between December 2011 and March 2019, a total of 550 patients (248 males, 302 females; mean age: 77.6+/-7.9 years; range, 46 to 103 years) who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in our center were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline demographic characteristics, cancer type, laboratory data, procedural data, and outcome data of the patients were collected. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 30 days and every six months up to maximally available follow-up. Follow-up was performed at 30 days, six months, and 12 months after the procedure and annually thereafter. Results: Of the patients, 36 had a cancer diagnosis-active (n=10) or cured (n=26). The most common types of cancer were colorectal (16.6%), prostate (13.8%), leukemia (11.1%), and bladder (11.1%) cancers. Post-procedural complication rates were similar between the two groups. No mortality was observed in the cancer group at one month of follow-up. During follow-up, seven patients died within one year due to non-cardiac reasons. Although mortality at one year was higher in cancer patients, it did not reach statistical significance (23.3% vs. 11.6%, respectively; p=0.061). The estimated cumulative survival rate was 71.0% in the non-cancer group and 58.3% in the cancer group. The multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that cancer was independently associated with cumulative mortality after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and atrial fibrillation (p=0.008). Conclusion: Our study results show that transcatheter aortic valve implantation is safe and feasible in active cancer patients and cancer survivors with similar short-term and mid-term mortality and procedure-related complication rates, compared to non-cancer patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Turkish Society of Cardiovascular Surgery.']",,20210113,PMC7970091,['NOTNLM'],"['Aortic stenosis', 'cancer', 'cancer survivors', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation']",,,"['Conflict of Interest: The authors declared no conflicts of interest with respect', 'to the authorship and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only few reports showed clinical course of patients who developed lymphoma during TKI therapies. Herein, we report a case of high-grade B-cell lymphoma diagnosed in the course of CML treatment with bosutinib. The 75-year-old male patient had been diagnosed with CML 25 years ago. After receiving TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib), he achieved a major molecular response. Over 3 years after starting bosutinib, he was diagnosed with a high-grade B-cell lymphoma. A total of six courses of DA-EPOCH-R therapy brought complete remission of the lymphoma. Moreover, BCR-ABL1 transcript copies remained undetectable by RT-PCR, 8 months after stopping bosutinib. The risk of secondary malignancy due to TKI has been controversial. It is reported that TKI induces irreversible chromosomal abnormalities or chromosome aberrations and inhibits the proliferation or function of T cells, B cells, and NK cells. These mechanisms of TKI may contribute to the development of secondary malignancy. There remains no consensus on the management of secondary lymphoma during TKI therapies. At present, the only alternative is to observe patients receiving TKI treatment cautiously and to treat secondary lymphoma in the same manner as de novo lymphoma.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Apr 21.,"We conducted the first human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele and genome-wide association study to identify loci associated with hypersensitivity reactions exclusively to the PEGylated preparation of asparaginase (pegaspargase) in racially diverse cohorts of pediatric leukemia patients: St Jude Children's Research Hospital's Total XVI (TXVI, n = 598) and Children's Oncology Group AALL0232 (n = 2,472) and AALL0434 (n = 1,189). Germline DNA was genotyped using arrays. Genetic variants not genotyped directly were imputed. HLA alleles were imputed using SNP2HLA or inferred using BWAkit. Analyses between genetic variants and hypersensitivity were performed in each cohort first using cohort-specific covariates and then combined using meta-analyses. Nongenetic risk factors included fewer intrathecal injections (P = 2.7 x 10(-5) in TXVI) and male sex (P = 0.025 in AALL0232). HLA alleles DQB1*02:02, DRB1*07:01, and DQA1*02:01 had the strongest associations with pegaspargase hypersensitivity (P < 5.0 x 10(-5) ) in patients with primarily European ancestry (EA), with the three alleles associating in a single haplotype. The top allele HLA-DQB1*02:02 was tagged by HLA-DQB1 rs1694129 in EAs (r(2) = 0.96) and less so in non-EAs. All single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with pegaspargase hypersensitivity reaching genome-wide significance in EAs were in class II HLA loci, and were partially replicated in non-EAs, as is true for other HLA associations. The rs9958628 variant, in ARHGAP28 (previously linked to immune response in children) had the strongest genetic association (P = 8.9 x 10(-9) ) in non-EAs. The HLA-DQB1*02:02-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01 associated with hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase is the same haplotype associated with reactions to non-PEGylated asparaginase, even though the antigens differ between the two preparations.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Emerging data describe a milder or asymptomatic course in children compared with adults in this scenario. We present the seroprevalence and clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 in a prospective cohort of 114 immunosuppressed children and adolescents from three groups: kidney transplantation, liver transplantation, and cancer patients. Among the thirty-five (30.7%) patients who had a positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2, 77% did not report previous symptoms and none of them developed any complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after 30 or more days of follow-up. Among those who were symptomatic, diarrhea, fever, and cough were the most common findings.Conclusion: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is high among immunosuppressed children and adolescents. COVID-19 has a mild or asymptomatic course in most of these patients. What is Known: * The number of immunosuppressed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing. * Viral infections have the potential for greater severity in immunocompromised children. What is New: * Seroprevalence for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in immunocompromised pediatric patients was 31%. * A quarter of the serology-positive patients reported mild symptoms and none of them developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with coronavirus disease 2019.","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and distribution of specific marrow patterns on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in children with leukaemia and lymphoma and with respect to the anatomic location. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant study included children with leukaemia or lymphoma who underwent pre-treatment MRI examinations over 18 years (between 1 January 1995 and 31 August 2013). Two radiologists blinded to the clinical diagnosis reviewed each study to determine the presence or absence of abnormal marrow signal and, when present, sub-categorised the pattern into diffuse, patchy, or focal abnormal marrow. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare marrow patterns between leukaemia and lymphoma. RESULTS: The study included 50 children (32 males and 18 females; mean age 9.5 +/- 5.3 years) with 54 MRI examinations (27 leukaemia and 27 lymphoma) that included 26 spine and 28 non-spine studies. Marrow replacement was present on 43 (80%) studies, significantly more common with leukaemia than with lymphoma (p = 0.039). The diffuse replacement pattern was significantly more common with leukaemia when compared to lymphoma (p < 0.001) and the focal pattern was only observed with lymphoma. In the spine, the diffuse pattern was observed with lymphoma (3/14, 21%). All patients with leukaemia and MRI outside of the spine showed marrow involvement. CONCLUSION: Marrow replacement is common on MRI from children with leukaemia and lymphoma. A diffuse pattern was significantly associated with leukaemia on studies outside of the spine and a focal pattern was only observed with lymphoma, independently of the anatomic location. KEY POINTS: * Bone marrow replacement on pre-treatment MRI examinations in children with leukaemia and lymphoma was observed in 93% (25/27) and 67% (18/27), respectively. * Diffuse pattern of marrow replacement was significantly more common in leukaemia even though this pattern was also observed with lymphoma on the spine MRI studies. * Focal pattern of marrow replacement was present only with lymphoma and not with leukaemia regardless of the anatomic location.",['(c) 2021.

We show that anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 CARs are presented on the surface of lentiviral vectors (LVs), inducing specific binding to the respective antigen. Binding of anti-CD19 CAR-encoding LVs containing supernatant was reduced by CD19-specific blocking antibodies in a dose-dependent manner, and binding was absent for unspecific LV containing supernatant. This suggests that LVs bind via displayed CAR molecules to CAR antigen-expressing cells. The relevance for CAR-T cell manufacturing was evaluated when PBMCs and B-ALL malignant B cells were mixed and transduced with anti-CD19 or anti-CD20 CAR-displaying LVs in clinically relevant doses to mimic transduction conditions of unpurified patient leukapheresis samples. Malignant B cells were transduced at higher levels with LVs displaying anti-CD19 CARs compared to LVs displaying non-binding control constructs. Stability of gene transfer was confirmed by applying a potent LV inhibitor and long-term cultures for 10 days.

Hypertriglyceridaemia is a side effect and associated with potentially fatal complications, including acute pancreatitis. Plasmapheresis may have a role in treatment when triglycerides are >2000 mg/dl. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman treated with L-asparaginase for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who developed severe hypertriglyceridaemia (6560 mg/dl) and acute pancreatitis. Intravenous insulin infusion was started, along with fenofibrate and atorvastatin administration, and platelet transfusion. Plasmapheresis was carried out leading to a frank decline in serum triglyceride levels (366 mg/dl), a decrease in pancreatic enzymes and clinical improvement. The diagnosis of pancreatitis secondary to L-asparaginase should lead to immediate drug withdrawal, and plasmapheresis should be considered when serum triglyceride values exceed 2000 mg/dl. In our case, there was a 95% triglyceride removal rate. This response illustrates the strong effectiveness of early treatment with plasmapheresis in severe and symptomatic hypertriglyceridaemia associated with L-asparaginase.

Sixteen years after their initial approval, the hypomethylating agents (HMAs), 5-azacytidine (AZA) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, remain the mainstay of treatment for HR-MDS and AML. However, a connection of the hypomethylating or additional effects of HMAs with clinical responses remains yet to be shown, and the mode of action of HMAs remains obscure. Given the relatively short-lived responses and the inevitable development of resistance in HMAs, a thorough understanding of the antineoplastic mechanisms employed by HMAs holds critical importance. Recent data in cancer cell lines demonstrate that reactivation of endogenous retroelements (EREs) and induction of a cell-intrinsic antiviral response triggered by RNA neotranscripts may underlie the antitumor activity of HMAs. However, data on primary CD34(+) cells derived from patients with HR-MDS failed to confirm a link between HMA-mediated ERE modulation and clinical response. Though difficult to reconcile the apparent discrepancy, it is possible that HMAs mediate their effects in more advanced levels of differentiation where cells become responsive to interferon, whereas, inter-individual variations in the process of RNA editing and, in particular, in the ADAR1/OAS/RNase L pathway may also confound the associations of clinical response with the induction of viral mimicry. Further ex vivo studies along with clinical correlations in well-annotated patient cohorts are warranted to decipher the role of ERE derepression in the antineoplastic mechanisms of HMAs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kordella, Lamprianidou and Kotsianidis.']",,20210309,PMC7985079,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'decitabine', 'endogenous retroelements', 'hypomethylating agents', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,"['IK have received research funding from Celgene Corporation and received honoraria', 'from Genesis Pharma Hellas.

However, unlike many other tumors, CLL B lymphocytes do not reproducibly grow in xenografts without manipulation, proliferating only when there is concomitant expansion of T cells. Here we show that in vitro pre-activation of CLL-derived T lymphocytes allows for a reliable and robust system for primary CLL cell growth within a fully autologous system that uses small numbers of cells and does not require pre-conditioning. In this system, growth of normal T and leukemic B cells follows four distinct temporal phases, each with characteristic blood and tissue findings. Phase 1 constitutes a period during which resting CLL B cells predominate, with cells aggregating at perivascular areas most often in the spleen. In Phase 2, T cells expand and provide T-cell help to promote B-cell division and expansion. Growth of CLL B and T cells persists in Phase 3, although some leukemic B cells undergo differentiation to more mature B-lineage cells (plasmablasts and plasma cells). By Phase 4, CLL B cells are for the most part lost with only T cells remaining. The required B-T cell interactions are not dependent on other human hematopoietic cells nor on murine macrophages or follicular dendritic cells, which appear to be relatively excluded from the perivascular lymphoid aggregates. Notably, the growth kinetics and degree of anatomic localization of CLL B and T cells is significantly influenced by intravenous versus intraperitoneal administration. Importantly, B cells delivered intraperitoneally either remain within the peritoneal cavity in a quiescent state, despite the presence of dividing T cells, or migrate to lymphoid tissues where they actively divide; this dichotomy mimics the human condition in that cells in primary lymphoid tissues and the blood are predominately resting, whereas those in secondary lymphoid tissues proliferate. Finally, the utility of this approach is illustrated by documenting the effects of a bispecific antibody reactive with B and T cells. Collectively, this model represents a powerful tool to evaluate CLL biology and novel therapeutics in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Patten, Ferrer, Chen, Kolitz, Rai, Allen, Barrientos, Ioannou,', 'Ramsay and Chiorazzi.']",,20210309,PMC7985329,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*T cells', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*engraftment', '*growth', '*patient-derived xenograft']",,,"['NC received the DART molecule, the DART control molecule, and financial support', 'to carry out the studies in Figure 8 from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Epub 2020 Dec 19.,"BACKGROUND: Platelet transfusion is among the most useful therapeutic tools in modern clinical settings which mean that ensuring an adequate supply is of paramount importance. AIM: The aim of our study was to record the use and wastage of platelet concentrates (PCs) in Greece, so as to come up with evidence-based interventions. METHODS: The study was conducted during May and June 2015. We evaluated the use of random-donor platelets (RDPs) and single-donor apheresis platelets (SDPs). We analyzed such parameters as hospital department and diagnosis, indication for transfusion, PCs' age at the time of transfusion, and wastage rate. RESULTS: We used data from 21 hospitals across the country. A total of 12,061 RDPs and 1189 SDPs were transfused, with an average of 4.84 (+/-2.72) and 1.12 (+/-2.73) units per episode, respectively. Most patients had been admitted to the internal medicine and hematology departments. The transfusions were mostly given prophylactically, usually in cases of acute leukemia, and mostly on the day before expiration. Wastage rate was 16.75% for RPDs and 2.70% for SDPs, primarily because of the expiration of the use-by date. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first national survey regarding platelet transfusion in Greece. Since most patients were admitted in internal medicine and hematology departments, we recommend that the staff of the abovementioned departments should undergo training on contemporary transfusion guidelines. Platelet discard rate could further be lowered through the centralization of inventory management along with the extension of the lifetime of PCs by means of emerging technologies.",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Asian Journal of Transfusion Science.'],,20201219,PMC7983137,['NOTNLM'],"['National', 'platelet', 'platelet products', 'platelets transfusion', 'survey']",,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In murine graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) models, alloreactive NK-cells also prevent GvHD. Here we report the results of a non-interventional, prospective study performed on behalf of the Cellular Therapy and Immunobiology Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The study was aimed at re-assessing the role of NK-cell alloreactivity in a cohort of haploidentical transplants performed in Europe between 2012 and 2015 and composed of unmanipulated, as well as T-cell-depleted transplants. One hundred thirty-eight patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemias were analyzed. Eighty-six patients received ex-vivo T-cell-depleted transplants, 52 patients received unmanipulated transplants. Fifty patients were transplanted from NK alloreactive donors, 88 from non-NK alloreactive donors. NK cell alloreactivity did not impact on GvHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS) in unmanipulated transplants (HR: 1.66 (0.9-3.1), p = 0.1). In contrast, it did impact beneficially on GRFS in T-cell-depleted transplants (HR: 0.6, (0.3-1.2), p = 0.14, interaction p < 0.001).

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"The impact of adverse risk genetic profiles on outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) has not been fully elucidated. Accordingly, we have profiled somatic mutations at diagnosis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 178 AML patients who received allogeneic HCT. NGS revealed 598 somatic mutations in 165/178 patients (92.7%). Frequently mutated genes include DNMT3A, TET2, NPM1, RUNX1, IDH2, and FLT3. Commonly detected cytogenetic profiles include normal karyotype, trisomy 8, monosomal karyotype (MK), deletion 5, complex karyotype (CK), and monosomy 7. In univariate analyses, TP53 mutation, MK, CK, and monosomy 7 were associated with decreased overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and a higher relapse incidence (RI). We defined adverse molecular-genetic profile as harboring at least one of the molecular/genetic abnormalities of TP53 mutation, MK, CK, monosomy 7, and deletion 5. The patients harboring adverse molecular-genetic profile (n = 30) showed a lower 2-year OS (24.9% vs. 57.9%; p = 0.003), RFS (23.7% vs. 57.9%; p = 0.002), and higher RI (47.2% and 17.2%; p = 0.001) after HCT when compared to patients without those lesions. Multivariate analysis confirmed adverse molecular-genetic profile as an independent prognostic factor, associated with decreased OS (HR 2.19), RFS (HR 2.23), and higher RI (HR 2.94).","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"Hematological malignancies are a class of malignant neoplasms attributed to abnormal differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The systemic involvement, poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance, and recurrence common in hematological malignancies urge researchers to look for novel treatment targets and mechanisms. In recent years, epigenetic abnormalities have been shown to play a vital role in tumorigenesis and progression in hematological malignancies. In addition to DNA methylation and histone modifications, which are most studied, RNA methylation has become increasingly significant. In this review, we elaborate recent advances in the understanding of RNA modification in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and molecular targeted therapies of hematological malignancies and discuss its intricate interactions with other epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and noncoding RNAs.",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0028-3736', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6488-5731']",20210325,PMC8102199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present an approach, named Drug Ranking Using ML (DRUML), which uses omics data to produce ordered lists of >400 drugs based on their anti-proliferative efficacy in cancer cells. To reduce noise and increase predictive robustness, instead of individual features, DRUML uses internally normalized distance metrics of drug response as features for ML model generation. DRUML is trained using in-house proteomics and phosphoproteomics data derived from 48 cell lines, and it is verified with data comprised of 53 cellular models from 12 independent laboratories. We show that DRUML predicts drug responses in independent verification datasets with low error (mean squared error < 0.1 and mean Spearman's rank 0.7).

Epub 2021 Apr 26.,"During spermatogenesis, intricate gene expression is coordinately regulated by epigenetic modifiers, which are required for differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) contained among undifferentiated spermatogonia. We have previously found that KMT2B conveys H3K4me3 at bivalent and monovalent promoters in undifferentiated spermatogonia. Because these genes are expressed late in spermatogenesis or during embryogenesis, we expect that many of them are potentially programmed by KMT2B for future expression. Here, we show that one of the genes targeted by KMT2B, Tsga8, plays an essential role in spermatid morphogenesis. Loss of Tsga8 in mice leads to male infertility associated with abnormal chromosomal distribution in round spermatids, malformation of elongating spermatid heads and spermiation failure. Tsga8 depletion leads to dysregulation of thousands of genes, including the X-chromosome genes that are reactivated in spermatids, and insufficient nuclear condensation accompanied by reductions of TNP1 and PRM1, key factors for histone-to-protamine transition. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of spermatids rescued the infertility phenotype, suggesting competency of the spermatid genome for fertilization. Thus, Tsga8 is a KMT2B target that is vitally necessary for spermiogenesis and fertility.",['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liu Shen Wan (LSW) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with detoxification and antiphlogistic activity; it is composed of bezoar, toad venom, musk, pearl powder, borneol and realgar. In recent years, LSW has been widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of influenza, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, mumps, cancer and leukaemia. AIM OF STUDY: The anti-influenza virus properties of LSW and its inhibition of the inflammatory response was demonstrated in our previous research; however, the effect and potential mechanism of LSW against influenza induced secondary bacteria have remained obscure. Therefore, in the present study, a model of influenza virus PR8 with secondary infection by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in vitro and in mice was established to examine the effect and potential mechanism by which LSW inhibits bacterial adhesion and subsequent severe pneumonia after viral infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of LSW on the PR8-induced adhesion of live S. aureus in A549 cells. RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of adhesion molecules. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of CEACAM1, RIG-1, MDA5, p-NF-kappaB, and NF-kappaB in A549 cells. Inflammatory cytokines were detected using a Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Screening Panel (R&D) in A549 cells and Mouse Magnetic Luminex Assays (R&D) in mice infected with PR8 virus and secondarily with S. aureus, respectively. Moreover, the survival rate, lung index, viral titre, bacterial loads and pathological changes in the lung tissue of mice infected with PR8 and S. aureus were investigated to estimate the effect of LSW in inhibiting severe pneumonia. RESULTS: LSW significantly decreased S. aureus adhesion following influenza virus infection in A549 cells, which may have occurred by suppressing expression of the adhesion molecule CEACAM1. In addition, treatment with LSW dramatically suppressed the induction of proinflammatory cytokines (CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL-9/MIG) and chemokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) by PR8 infection following secondary LPS stimulation in A549 cells. Upregulation of related signalling proteins (RIG-I, MDA5 and NF-kappaB) induced by viruses and bacteria was suppressed by LSW in A549 cells. LSW significantly decreased the viral titres and bacterial load, prolonged survival time, and ameliorated lung inflammation and injury in mice with S. aureus infection secondary to PR8 infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that LSW prevents S. aureus adherence to influenza virus-infected A549 cells, perhaps by inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule CEACAM1. The upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and related signalling proteins induced by viruses and bacteria was suppressed by LSW in A549 cells. LSW significantly ameliorated lung injury caused by viral and secondary bacterial infection. These findings provide a further evaluation of LSW and suggest a beneficial effect of LSW for the prevention of secondary bacterial infection and related complications.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Neoplastic lymphocytes are seen to invade nerves (cranial or peripheral), nerve roots or other related structures in patients with hematological malignancy. It is a separate entity from central nervous system lymphoma. Neurolymphomatosis has most commonly been described in association with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Neurolymphomatosis in the context of Burkitt lymphoma and the post-renal transplant setting has not been described before. CASE REPORTS: We report for the first time in the Arabian Gulf countries and nearby Arab states four cases of neurolymphomatosis (one Asian, and the other 3 are from Arabic nationals) occurring between 2012 and 2017 involving the median nerve, optic nerve, nerve root and cauda equina in patients with Burkitt lymphoma, Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Neurolymphomatosis is rare and can be difficult to diagnose by biopsy but reliably confirmed by a combined imaging approach. Prior treatment with high-dose dexamethasone might suppress 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity and decrease the sensitivity of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

Information on the geographical distribution and epidemiological features of L. infantum infection in cats is scarce, particularly in urban stray cats living in regions where canine leishmaniosis is endemic. As diagnosis can be challenging, combining different serological and molecular methods is a useful approach. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of infection of L. infantum in apparently healthy stray cats in an endemic region of Spain (Zaragoza city) using serological and molecular methods, and to compare the results of the different techniques. METHODS: The prevalence of Leishmania infection was studied in stray cats captured in urban and peri-urban areas of Zaragoza. Blood was collected from each animal for serology and molecular analysis. Three serological methods, namely the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB), were used to detect L. infantum antibodies and a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was used to detect L. infantum DNA. The results were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and Cohen's kappa statistic (kappa) to assess the level of agreement between the diagnostic techniques. RESULTS: Serological analysis of blood samples from 180 stray cats revealed 2.2% (4/179) Leishmania infection positivity by IFAT, 2.8% (5/179) by ELISA and 14.5% (26/179) by WB. Leishmania DNA was detected by qPCR in 5.6% (10/179) of the cats. Sixteen cats (8.9%) tested positive by only one serological technique and four tested positive by all three serological methods used. The overall rate of infected cats (calculated as the number of cats seropositive and/or qPCR positive) was 15.6%, and only two cats tested positive by all the diagnostic methods. A significant association was found between male cats and a positive qPCR result. Comparison of the techniques revealed a fair agreement in seropositivity between blood qPCR and IFAT (kappa = 0.26), blood qPCR and ELISA (kappa = 0.24), WB and ELISA (kappa = 0.37) and WB and IFAT (kappa = 0.40). The highest agreement between seropositive results was between IFAT and ELISA (kappa = 0.89), and the lowest was between blood qPCR and WB (kappa = 0.19). The prevalence of the feline leukemia virus antigen was 4.49% (8/178 cats) and that of the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibody was 6.74% (12/178), while co-infection with both retroviruses was observed in one female cat (1/178).

Prior to conducting one of the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy trials in Canada, we used the Theoretical Domains Framework, a novel tool for identifying barriers and enablers to behavior change, to identify physician-related barriers and enablers to screening and recruiting patients for an early phase immunotherapy trial. METHODS: We conducted interviews with hematologists across Canada and used a directed content analysis to identify relevant domains reflecting the key factors that may affect screening and recruitment. RESULTS: In total, we interviewed 15 hematologists. Physicians expressed ""cautious hope""; while expressing safety, feasibility, and screening criteria concerns, 14 out of 15 hematologists intended to screen for the trial (domains: knowledge, goals, beliefs about consequences, intentions). Physicians underscored the ""challenging contexts,"" identifying resources, workload, forgetting, and patient wait times to receive CAR T cells as key practical barriers to screening (domains: environmental context and resources, memory, attention and decision-making, behavioral regulation). They also highlighted ""variability in roles and procedures"" that may lead to missed trial candidates (domain: social and professional role). Left unaddressed, these barriers may undermine trial recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to use the Theoretical Domains Framework from the physician perspective to identify recruitment challenges to early phase trials and demonstrates the value of this approach for identifying barriers to screening and recruitment that may not otherwise have been elicited. This approach can optimize trial procedures and may serve to inform future promising early phase cancer therapy trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03765177 .

Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed stippled pinpoint hyperfluorescence in the upper macula. One week later, reduced visual acuity was noted in the right eye. B-scan ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography revealed serous RD in both eyes. A provisional diagnosis of VKH was made. However, subsequent hematologic analysis detected an extremely high leukocyte count. Elevated numbers of leukocytes and tumor cells were found in cerebrospinal fluid. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 77% primary atypical blood cells, 89% of which were immature lymphocytes. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia and transferred to the Department of Hematology. However, the patient and her family refused chemotherapy; she eventually died.

Epub 2021 Apr 18.,"In this randomized phase 3 study, the FILO group tested whether the addition of 6 mg/m(2) of gemtuzumab ozogamycin (GO) to standard chemotherapy could improve outcome of younger patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and intermediate-risk cytogenetics. GO arm was prematurely closed after 254 inclusions because of toxicity. A similar complete remission rate was observed in both arms. Neither event-free survival nor overall survival were improved by GO in younger AML patients (<60 years) ineligible for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. (P = .086; P = .149, respectively). Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on mutational analysis of seven genes (NPM1, FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and ASXL1), six clusters of patients with significant different outcome were identified. Five clusters were based on FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations as well as epigenetic modifiers (DNMT3A, IDH1/2, ASXL1), whereas the last cluster, representing 25% of patients, had no mutation and intermediate risk. One cluster isolated FLT3-ITD mutations with higher allelic ratio and a very poor outcome. The addition of GO had no impact in these molecular clusters. Although not conclusive for GO impact in AML patients <60 years, this study provides a molecular classification that distinguishes six AML clusters influencing prognosis in younger AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetic.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assay were carried out to determine RNA and protein expression. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, flow cytometry, transwell migration assay and aerobic glycolysis analysis were performed to analyze cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and aerobic glycolysis of thyroid cancer cells. MiRcode and Starbase software were used to search the downstream genes of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2 (DLEU2) and microRNA-205-5p (miR-205-5p), and the intermolecular combination was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The in vivo role of DLEU2 in tumor growth was verified using the murine xenograft model. Results: DLEU2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) were highly expressed in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines. DLEU2 and TNRAIP8 promoted the proliferation, migration and aerobic glycolysis and restrained the apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells. DLEU2/miR-205-5p/TNFAIP8 signaling axis was identified in thyroid cancer cells. TNFAIP8 overexpression largely rescued the malignant phenotypes in DLEU2-silenced thyroid cancer cells.

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"PURPOSE: CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CD19-CAR) T cells induce high response rates in children and young adults (CAYAs) with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), but relapse rates are high. The role for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (alloHSCT) following CD19-CAR T-cell therapy to improve long-term outcomes in CAYAs has not been examined. METHODS: We conducted a phase I trial of autologous CD19.28zeta-CAR T cells in CAYAs with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. Response and long-term clinical outcomes were assessed in relation to disease and treatment variables. RESULTS: Fifty CAYAs with B-ALL were treated (median age, 13.5 years; range, 4.3-30.4). Thirty-one (62.0%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR), 28 (90.3%) of whom were minimal residual disease-negative by flow cytometry. Utilization of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion was associated with improved CR rates (29/42, 69%) compared with non-fludarabine/cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion (2/8, 25%; P = .041). With median follow-up of 4.8 years, median overall survival was 10.5 months (95% CI, 6.3 to 29.2 months). Twenty-one of 28 (75.0%) patients achieving a minimal residual disease-negative CR proceeded to alloHSCT. For those proceeding to alloHSCT, median overall survival was 70.2 months (95% CI, 10.4 months to not estimable). The cumulative incidence of relapse after alloHSCT was 9.5% (95% CI, 1.5 to 26.8) at 24 months; 5-year EFS following alloHSCT was 61.9% (95% CI, 38.1 to 78.8). CONCLUSION: We provide the longest follow-up in CAYAs with B-ALL after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy reported to date and demonstrate that sequential therapy with CD19.28zeta-CAR T cells followed by alloHSCT can mediate durable disease control in a sizable fraction of CAYAs with relapsed or refractory B-ALL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01593696).",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8474-9080', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3249-9796', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2601-3665', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9319-6281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8280-551X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6916-4925', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8044-5226', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5867-3265', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0359-9023']",20210325,PMC8274806,,,"['P30 CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011498/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011823/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['2022/05/20 00:00'],"['Nirali N.

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"PURPOSE: Treatment options are limited for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS). This phase III, placebo-controlled trial evaluated CC-486 (oral azacitidine), a hypomethylating agent, in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System LR-MDS and RBC transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to CC-486 300-mg or placebo for 21 days/28-day cycle. The primary end point was RBC transfusion independence (TI). RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients received CC-486 (n = 107) or placebo (n = 109). The median age was 74 years, median platelet count was 25 x 10(9)/L, and absolute neutrophil count was 1.3 x 10(9)/L. In the CC-486 and placebo arms, 31% and 11% of patients, respectively, achieved RBC-TI (P = .0002), with median durations of 11.1 and 5.0 months. Reductions of >/= 4 RBC units were attained by 42.1% and 30.6% of patients, respectively, with median durations of 10.0 and 2.3 months, and more CC-486 patients had >/= 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increases from baseline (23.4% v 4.6%). Platelet hematologic improvement rate was higher with CC-486 (24.3% v 6.5%). Underpowered interim overall survival analysis showed no difference between CC-486 and placebo (median, 17.3 v 16.2 months; P = .96). Low-grade GI events were the most common adverse events in both arms. In the CC-486 and placebo arms, 90% and 73% of patients experienced a grade 3-4 adverse event. Overall death rate was similar between arms, but there was an imbalance in deaths during the first 56 days (CC-486, n = 16; placebo, n = 6), most related to infections; the median pretreatment absolute neutrophil count for the 16 CC-486 patients was 0.57 x 10(9)/L. CONCLUSION: CC-486 significantly improved RBC-TI rate and induced durable bilineage improvements in patients with LR-MDS and high-risk disease features. More early deaths occurred in the CC-486 arm, most related to infections in patients with significant pretreatment neutropenia. Further evaluation of CC-486 in MDS is needed.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5439-2172', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4687-7089', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4320-9253', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4867-291X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8747-078X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3931-0914', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9238-5734', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3185-6488', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4737-1103', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7823-0004']",20210325,PMC8099416,,,,['2022/05/01 00:00'],"['Guillermo Garcia-ManeroHonoraria: Celgene, Astex Pharmaceuticals, Acceleron', 'Pharma, Helssin, AbbvieConsulting or Advisory Role: Celgene, Astex', 'Pharmaceuticals, Acceleron Pharma, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb,', 'Helsinn TherapeuticsResearch Funding: Celgene, Astex Pharmaceuticals, Amphivena,', 'Helsinn Therapeutics, Novartis, Abbvie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Onconova', 'Therapeutics, H3 Biomedicine, Merck Valeria SantiniHonoraria:', 'Celgene/Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novartis, Janssen-CilagConsulting or Advisory Role:', 'Celgene/Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novartis, Menarini, Takeda, Pfizer, Geron, Gilead', 'SciencesResearch Funding: CelgeneTravel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag,', 'Celgene Antonio AlmeidaHonoraria: Novartis, CelgeneConsulting or Advisory Role:', ""Novartis, CelgeneSpeakers' Bureau: Novartis, CelgeneTravel, Accommodations,"", 'Expenses: Bristol-Myers Squibb Uwe PlatzbeckerHonoraria: Celgene/JazzConsulting', 'or Advisory Role: Celgene/JazzResearch Funding: Amgen, Janssen, Novartis,', 'BerGenBio, CelgenePatents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: part of a', 'patent for a TFR-2 antibody (Rauner et al.

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound assistance improves success rates and reduces adverse outcomes of lumbar punctures (LPs) among adult patients in the emergency room and the operating room, but has not been evaluated in pediatric patients with cancer. Our objectives were (1) to determine whether pediatric oncologists could perform ultrasound-assisted LPs following a structured teaching curriculum, and (2) to determine the feasibility of recruiting pediatric cancer patients to a clinical trial of this procedure. METHODS: Three pediatric oncologists completed a curriculum composed of didactic teaching followed by hands-on workshops. Each learner was evaluated during 20 attempts at three ultrasound tasks using the cumulative sum method. The three pediatric oncologists then performed ultrasound assessments prior to routinely scheduled LPs. Feasibility was defined as ability to perform at least 30 ultrasound-assisted LPs within 6 months. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of successful, bloody, or traumatic LPs, time required, and perceived helpfulness of ultrasound. RESULTS: All three pediatric oncologists achieved competence in the three tasks of ultrasound scanning within 20 evaluated attempts. We recruited 62 patients within 1 month, and 58 underwent an ultrasound-assisted LP. All LPs were successful. Two LPs (4%) had >/=500 red blood cells (RBCs)/mul, and nine (16%) had >/=10 RBCs/mul. Median time to conduct the scan was 1.9 minutes (range 0.8-4.0 minutes). In 37 (64%) of the LPs, ultrasound assistance was considered helpful or very helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric oncologists readily achieved competence in ultrasound-assisted LPs, and ultrasound was commonly perceived as helpful. It is feasible to proceed to a randomized trial of this procedure in pediatric cancer.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7069-0359', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9695-1702']",20210325,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*lumbar puncture', '*radiology', '*supportive care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"A 7-year-old castrated male domestic shorthair cat was presented for evaluation of decreased appetite and respiratory signs. A CBC run on presentation revealed severe nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis characterized by a prominent population of blasts, having morphologic features suggestive of a monocytic lineage. The cat tested positive for FIV, FeLV, Mycoplasma haemominutum, and only mild abnormalities were identified on the chemistry panel. Bone marrow biopsies were obtained to investigate the bicytopenia and the possibility of a hematopoietic neoplasm. Although the bone marrow aspirate was nondiagnostic, the core biopsy was markedly hypercellular with a population of blasts, largely replacing the normal hematopoietic tissue. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the blasts were CD3-negative, Pax5-negative, dimly CD18-positive, and moderately positive for Iba1. These findings, in addition to the prominent monocytic differentiation seen in peripheral blood, supported a diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia.

Epub 2021 Apr 4.,"OBJECTIVES: Relapse of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) belongs to the major causes of treatment failure. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter analysis of patients diagnosed with AML or MDS who had hematological relapse after allo-HSCT and were treated with azacitidine for this indication. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients receiving azacitidine as the first treatment of relapse (Group_1) and 8 patients receiving azacitidine after other treatment of relapse (Group_2) were included. There were 68% males, median age at initiation of azacitidine was 53 years (15-66). Median time to relapse was 3.5 months and 6.3 months in Group_1 and Group_2, respectively; median time from relapse to azacitidine 0.2 and 2.3 months. Azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) , days 1-7, was administered in 78% and 75% of patients in Group_1 and Group_2, concomitant DLI in 48% and 50%. With median follow-up of 4.7 and 13.6 months, the median overall survival was 5.9 and 9.5 months. 17% and 37.5% patients proceeded to salvage allo-HSCT, with median OS of 11.6 months and not reached respectively.

Epub 2019 Apr 9.,"BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine are routinely administered to prevent febrile non-hemolytic and allergic blood transfusion reactions despite multiple randomized controlled trials demonstrating that this practice lacks efficacy. As a result, patients are exposed to the adverse effects of these medications and their financial burdens with no expected benefit. The aim of this study was to quantify the frequency and cost of transfusion premedications in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with AML admitted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) for induction chemotherapy between January 2008 and December 2016. Data were collected on the number of platelet and packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions each patient received during the initial inpatient encounter for AML, as well as on the administration of premedications prior to each transfusion. RESULTS: During the 9-year study period, 948 AML patients received a total of 19,820 transfusions. Of these, 30% were preceded by oral diphenhydramine, 8% by intravenous diphenhydramine, and 39% by oral acetaminophen. The percentage of patients that received a transfusion preceded by a premedication increased over the study period (p = 0.03), as did the percentage of transfusions preceded by a premedication (p = 0.02). The total unadjusted cost of pre-transfusion medications to the institution during the study period was $50,309.77, or $52.67 per patient with AML. The cost of premedications per patient did not increase over the study period (p = .45).

However, data are limited regarding risk factors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in this population. METHODS: The authors conducted a secondary analysis of data from 160 patients with high-risk AML who were enrolled in a supportive care trial. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version was used to assess PTSD symptoms at 1 month after AML diagnosis. The Brief COPE and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia were to assess coping and quality of life (QOL), respectively. In addition, multivariate regression models were constructed to assess the relation between PTSD symptoms and baseline sociodemographic factors, coping, and QOL. RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of patients reported PTSD symptoms, describing high rates of intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigiliance. Baseline sociodemographic factors significantly associated with PTSD symptoms were age (B = -0.26; P = .002), race (B = -8.78; P = .004), and postgraduate education (B = -6.30; P = .029). Higher baseline QOL (B = -0.37; P </= .001) and less decline in QOL during hospitalization (B = -0.05; P = .224) were associated with fewer PTSD symptoms. Approach-oriented coping (B = -0.92; P = .001) was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms, whereas avoidant coping (B = 2.42; P </= .001) was associated with higher PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients with AML report clinically significant PTSD symptoms 1 month after initiating intensive chemotherapy. Patients' baseline QOL, coping strategies, and extent of QOL decline during hospitalization emerge as important risk factors for PTSD, underscoring the need for supportive oncology interventions to reduce the risk of PTSD in this population.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9136-9644', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0546-7895', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6086-5626', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4907-6447', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3556-1495']",20210325,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'coping', 'distress', 'hematologic malignancy', 'hypervigilance', 'posttraumatic stress', 'posttraumatic stress disorder', 'psychological well-being', 'traumatic stress']","['K08CA251654/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA251654/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with adult B-cell ALL, reports of adult T-cell ALL (T-ALL) MRD have been scarce and mostly based on molecular methods. We evaluated the prognostic value of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM)-based MRD at the end of induction (EOI-MRD). The present retrospective study included 94 adult patients with T-ALL. MRD was detected by six- to eight-colour FCM. Patients who were EOI-MRD positive had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (87.6% vs. 38.8%, P = 0.0020), and a lower relapse-free survival (RFS) (5.4% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.0005) and overall survival (OS) (32.7% vs. 69.7%, P < 0.0001) than those who were EOI-MRD negative. Moreover, for patients who received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at their first remission, EOI-MRD positivity was predictive of post-transplant relapse (2-year CIR: 68.2% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.0003). Multivariate analysis showed that EOI-MRD was an independent prognostic factor for CIR [hazard ratio (HR) 2.139, P = 0.046], RFS (HR 2.125, P = 0.048) and OS (HR 2.987, P = 0.017). In conclusion, EOI-MRD based on FCM was an independent prognostic factor for relapse and survival in adult T-ALL.

Since PML can also act as a regulator of the inflammatory and fibroproliferative responses characteristic of atherosclerosis, we investigated whether PML is implicated in this disease. Immunoblotting, ELISA and immunohistochemistry showed a stronger expression of PML in segments of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries and sections compared with non-atherosclerotic ones. In particular, PML was concentrated in PML-NBs from alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)-immunoreactive cells in plaque areas. To identify possible functional consequences of PML-accumulation in this cell type, differentiated human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (dHCASMCs) were transfected with a vector containing the intact PML-gene. These PML-transfected dHCASMCs showed higher levels of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1-dependent SUMOylated proteins, but lower levels of markers for smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation and revealed more proliferation and migration activities than dHCASMCs transfected with the vector lacking a specific gene insert or with the vector containing a mutated PML-gene coding for a PML-form without SUMOylation activity. When dHCASMCs were incubated with different cytokines, higher PML-levels were observed only after interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulation, while the expression of differentiation markers was lower. However, these phenotypic changes were not observed in dHCASMCs treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressing PML-expression prior to IFN-gamma stimulation. Taken together, our results imply that PML is a previously unknown functional factor in the molecular cascades associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is positioned in vascular SMCs (VSMCs) between upstream IFN-gamma activation and downstream SUMOylation.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"Genetic aberrations in the epigenome are rare in pediatric AML, hence expression data in epigenetic regulation and its downstream effect is lacking in childhood AML. Our pilot study screened epigenetic modifiers and its related oncogenic signal transduction pathways concerning clinical outcomes in a small cohort of pediatric AML in KSA. RNA from diagnostic BM biopsies (n = 35) was subjected to expression analysis employing the nCounter Pan-Cancer pathway panel. The patients were dichotomized into low ASXL1 (17/35; 49%) and high ASXL1 (18/35; 51%) groups based on ROC curve analysis. Age, gender, hematological data or molecular risk factors (FLT3 mutation/molecular fusion) exposed no significant differences across these two distinct ASXL1 expression groups (P > 0.05). High ASXL1 expression showed linkage with high expression of other epigenetic modifiers (TET2/EZH2/IDH1&2). Our data showed that high ASXL1 mRNA is interrelated with increased BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) and its target gene E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F1) expression. High ASXL1 expression was associated with high mortality {10/18 (56%) vs. 1/17; (6%) P < 0 .002}. Low ASXL1 expressers showed better OS {740 days vs. 579 days; log-rank P= < 0.023; HR 7.54 (0.98-54.1)}. The association between high ASXL1 expression and epigenetic modifiers is interesting but unexplained and require further investigation. High ASXL1 expression is associated with BAP1 and its target genes. Patients with high ASXL1 expression showed poor OS without any association with a conventional molecular prognostic marker.",,,20210325,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1 expression', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetic modifiers', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 25.,"High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is an important component of treatment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL). Optimal rescue therapy is essential for the safe administration of HDMTX. A cost-effective strategy that does not compromise safety is necessary for low- and middle-income countries. Consecutive admissions for HDMTX in children with ALL and LL over 12 months were analyzed. The dose of HDMTX was 3 g/m(2) in B-ALL and B-LL and 5 g/m(2) in T-ALL and T-LL. A methotrexate level was measured at 42 hours of starting HDMTX infusion (T42-MTX). Three doses of folinic acid at T42, T48, and T54 and alkalinized hydration till T54 were administered if T42-MTX <1 microM. A total of 282 cycles of HDMTX that were administered in 71 patients were analyzed. T42-MTX was <1 microM in 266 (94.3%) cycles. T42-MTX was >/=1 microM in 12% and 3% of cycles of HDMTX administered at a dose of 5 g/m2 and 3 g/m2, respectively (p = .074). The median duration of hospitalization for HDM was three days and did not differ with the dose of HDMTX administered (p = .427). Mucositis, delayed recovery of blood counts, and hospitalization for reversible toxicity occurred after 21 (7.4%), 28 (9.9%), and 19 (6.7%) cycles of HDMTX, respectively. Mucositis was greater following the administration of 5 g/m(2) of HDMTX. A single T42-MTX measurement permits the safe administration of HDMTX and an expedited discharge from the hospital within three days in more than 90% of children with ALL/LL.",,,20210325,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'LMIC', 'intravenous methotrexate', 'nephrotoxicity', 'resource limited']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

regulators of transcription and translation that are often dysregulated in cancer. Although RBPs are increasingly recognized as being important for normal hematopoiesis and for hematologic malignancies as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, RBPs that are essential for the maintenance and survival of leukemia remain elusive. Here we show that YBX1 is specifically required for maintaining myeloid leukemia cell survival in an N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-dependent manner. We found that expression of YBX1 is significantly upregulated in myeloid leukemia cells, and deletion of YBX1 dramatically induces apoptosis and promotes differentiation coupled with reduced proliferation and impaired leukemic capacity of primary human and mouse acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Loss of YBX1 has no obvious effect on normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, YBX1 interacts with insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins (IGF2BPs) and stabilizes m6A-tagged RNA. Moreover, YBX1 deficiency dysregulates the expression of apoptosis-related genes and promotes mRNA decay of MYC and BCL2 in an m6A-dependent manner, which contributes to the defective survival that results from deletion of YBX1. Thus, our findings have uncovered a selective and critical role of YBX1 in maintaining myeloid leukemia survival, which might provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of YBX1 in myeloid leukemia.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-0982-0382'],,PMC8667054,,,"['R01 CA245147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA214965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK120282/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA243386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Blood. 2021 Jul 8;138(1):6-7.

Lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and their precursors were among the first cells proved to express a functional P2X7 receptor; therefore, it is not surprising that lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases, also known as hematological malignancies, were shown to be related in their insurgence and progression to P2X7 alterations. Here, we overview established and recent literature relating P2X7 with the biological mechanisms underlying leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma development. Particular attention is paid to studies published in the very recent past correlating P2X7 with ATP concentration in the leukemic microenvironment and P2X7 overexpression to acute myeloid leukemia aggressiveness and response to chemotherapy. The described literature strongly suggests that P2X7 and its genetic variants could be regarded as potential new biomarkers in hematological malignancies and that both P2X7 antagonists and agonists could emerge as new therapeutic tools alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 De Marchi, Pegoraro and Adinolfi.']",,20210305,PMC7982859,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP', 'P2X7 receptor', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'multiple myeloma']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wide range of therapeutic approaches involving T lymphocytes, such as programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PDL-1) inhibitors, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) blockers, and CD19-targeted T-cell therapy through chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells or CD19/CD3 bi-specific T-cell engagers, have been introduced to the field of oncology, leading to significant improvements in overall survival of adult cancer patients. During the past few years, the availability and approval of T-cell based immunotherapies have become a reality also for the treatment of childhood cancers. However, the distribution, ratio of regulatory to effector cells and the quality of T-cell responses early in life are distinct from those during adolescence and adulthood, raising the possibility that these differences impact the efficacy of immunotherapy. Herein we provide a brief overview of the properties of conventional T cell subsets during early life. Focusing on the most common cancer type during childhood, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we describe how current conventional therapies used against ALL influence the T-cell compartment of small children. We describe early life T-cell responses in relation to immunotherapies engaging T-cell anticancer reactivity and present our opinion that it is not only immaturity of the adaptive immune system, but also the impact of an immunosuppressive environment that may prove disadvantageous in the setting of immunotherapies targeting pediatric cancer cells.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Saghafian-Hedengren, Sverremark-Ekstrom and Nilsson.']",,20210304,PMC7982872,['NOTNLM'],"['*T cells', '*chemotherapy', '*childhood', '*immunotherapy', '*leukemia']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA from post-mortem fibroblastic tissue samples of 16 fetuses after unexplained IUFD was retrieved at two tertiary university hospitals for clinical exome sequencing with subsequent filtering of 122 cardio-specific genes to elucidate underlying cardio-pathogenic variants. In total, we included 12 (75%) male and four (25%) female fetuses who were stillborn at a median gestational age of 34(+6) (23(+2)-40(+5)) weeks. In two (12.5%) fetuses no cardio-pathogenic variants were found.

Among the 33 variants, five (15.2%) were classified as likely benign according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; 28 (84.8%) variants were considered as variants of uncertain significance. Compared to a cohort of explained IUFDs, the cases with and without fetal variants in cardiac genes differed not significantly regarding maternal age, previous history of stillbirth, time of stillbirth or fetal sex. Unexplained stillbirth may be caused by cardio-genetic pathologies, yet a high number of variants of uncertain significance merit a more detailed post-mortem examination including family segregation analysis.",,,20210324,PMC7991630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that B cell tumor antigen escape may be overcome by a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) design that simultaneously targets three B cell leukemia antigens. We engineered trispecific duoCAR-T cells with lentiviral vectors encoding two CAR open reading frames that target CD19, CD20, and CD22. The duoCARs were composed of a CAR with a tandem CD19- and CD20-targeting binder, linked by the P2A self-cleaving peptide to a second CAR targeting CD22. Multiple combinations of intracellular T cell signaling motifs were evaluated. The most potent duoCAR architectures included those with ICOS, OX40, or CD27 signaling domains rather than those from CD28 or 4-1BB. We identified four optimal binder and signaling combinations that potently rejected xenografted leukemia and lymphoma tumors in vivo. Moreover, in mice bearing a mixture of B cell lymphoma lines composed of parental triple-positive cells, CD19-negative, CD20-negative, and CD22-negative variants, only the trispecific duoCAR-T cells rapidly and efficiently rejected the tumors. Each of the monoCAR-T cells failed to prevent tumor progression.

Decitabine activates the transcription of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which can induce immune response by acting as cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Yet, the posttranscriptional regulation of ERV dsRNAs remains uninvestigated. Here, we find that the viral mimicry and subsequent cell death in response to decitabine require the dsRNA-binding protein Staufen1 (Stau1). We show that Stau1 directly binds to ERV RNAs and stabilizes them in a genome-wide manner. Furthermore, Stau1-mediated stabilization requires a long noncoding RNA TINCR, which enhances the interaction between Stau1 and ERV RNAs. Analysis of a clinical patient cohort reveals that MDS and AML patients with lower Stau1 and TINCR expressions exhibit inferior treatment outcomes to DNMTi therapy. Overall, our study reveals the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of ERVs and identifies the Stau1-TINCR complex as a potential target for predicting the efficacy of DNMTis and other drugs that rely on dsRNAs.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9798-475X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-6029', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4889-2269', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7829-397X']",,PMC8020767,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA demethylation', '*RNA-binding protein', '*double-stranded RNAs', '*noncoding RNA', '*posttranscriptional regulation']",,,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of biological therapies has improved outcomes for the majority of patients with MM, but in approximately 20% of patients the tumour is characterised by genetic changes which confer a significantly poorer prognosis, generally termed high-risk (HR) MM. It is important to diagnose these genetic changes early and identify more effective first-line treatment options for these patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Myeloma UK nine OPTIMUM trial (MUKnine) evaluates novel treatment strategies for patients with HRMM. Patients with suspected or newly diagnosed MM, fit for intensive therapy, are offered participation in a tumour genetic screening protocol (MUKnine a), with primary endpoint proportion of patients with molecular screening performed within 8 weeks. Patients identified as molecularly HR are invited into the phase II, single-arm, multicentre trial (MUKnine b) investigating an intensive treatment schedule comprising bortezomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab, low-dose cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, with single high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) followed by combination consolidation and maintenance therapy. MUKnine b primary endpoints are minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 100 post-ASCT and progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints include response, safety and quality of life. The trial uses a Bayesian decision rule to determine if this treatment strategy is sufficiently active for further study. Patients identified as not having HR disease receive standard treatment and are followed up in a cohort study. Exploratory studies include longitudinal whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI for imaging MRD testing.

Epub 2021 Jan 11.,"With improved safety of the procedure, disease recurrence is now the leading cause of treatment failure when allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recent studies suggest that maintenance therapy with hypomethylating agents after standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy prolongs disease-free and possibly overall survival in older patients with AML. While these results argue that hypomethylating agents should likewise prolong remission duration if used as maintenance after allogeneic transplantation for AML, trials to date have failed to show a benefit. This failure may be due, in part, to difficulties in administering the drugs in this setting, and in part, because of an inability to identify those patients most likely to benefit. Realizing the full potential of hypomethylating agents in the management of patients with AML will likely require both improved drug formulations as well as an increased understanding of their mechanism of action in the complex post-allogeneic transplant environment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2021 Feb 13.,"New drug approvals now afford AML physicians a wider choice of initial treatment options than ever before. Although chemotherapy for AML is by no means ready to be replaced entirely by novel agents, the role of traditional cytotoxics in AML therapy is rapidly changing. In particular, biologically targeted agents such as the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax and inhibitors of FLT3 and IDH mutations stand out as drugs likely to take AML therapy in important new directions. Maximum response and survival benefits likely require combinations of novel agents and chemotherapy or multiple novel agents together. The recently-published phase 3 VIALE-A study demonstrates a very successful example of a new combination approach, which led to venetoclax plus azacitidine establishing itself as the new standard of care for patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. One could reasonably expect other subsets of AML to benefit from this regimen or other applications of venetoclax combinations. Building on this experience, venetoclax-based regimens also have the potential to replace standard intensive cytarabine/anthracycline ""7&3"" induction approach for some if not many patients who are fit for induction.

Epub 2021 Feb 8.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasm-blast phase (MPN-BP) is a form of acute leukemia which is distinct from de novo acute myeloid leukemia with each entity being characterized by specific complex cytogenetic abnormalities and myeloid gene mutational patterns. MPN-BP patients have a particularly dismal prognosis with a medium overall survival of 5.8 months with currently available therapies. Large-scale sequencing studies have unraveled the mutational landscape of the chronic MPNs and MPN-BP, demonstrating importance of clonal heterogeneity and the role of somatic mutations in disease progression and their use to determine patient outcomes. JAK inhibitors represent the standard of care for intermediate/high-risk MF patients and have been shown to improve clinical symptoms. However, this therapeutic approach leads to a modest reduction in the variant allele frequency of the known MPN driver mutations in most patients and does not substantially delay or prevent the evolution to MPN-BP. In this article, we will review molecular mechanisms driving the progression from chronic MPNs to a BP, the impact of genetic changes on MPN-BP evolution, and the role of clonal evolution in response to JAK inhibitor therapy and disease progression. We will also discuss our ongoing functional studies of cells responsible for the development of MPN-BP.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Nevertheless, the recent accumulation of genetic data on the molecular underpinnings of myeloid neoplasms as well as numerous recently approved novel therapies have highlighted areas of controversy in how we currently define and classify AML; the 2016 WHO Classification will continually be revised and updated in future versions based on these advances.

Patients should ideally be prospectively selected for CPI based therapies based on pre-treatment biomarkers, as there are definite populations that are more likely to respond.

Furthermore, the encouraging activity of novel therapies such as inotuzumab and blinatumomab in chemo-refractory B-cell ALL has promoted an interest in introducing these agents early in Ph-like ALL management, which may lead to improved cure rates with frontline therapies, sparing more adults from undergoing early allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Finally, the high relapse rate in patients with Ph-like ALL, does not necessary correlate with early minimal residual disease (MRD) response, raising the question of consolidation with allogenic HCT in all adults with Ph-like ALL in first complete remission irrespective of MRD response.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, frail patients who are not eligible for allogeneic HSCT or those with TKI-resistant mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain have a poor clinical course. Blinatumomab (BLIN) is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct that directs cytotoxic T cells to CD19-expressing B-ALL cells. To date, only a few studies have shown the safety and efficacy of Blinatumomab (BLIN) + TKI combination therapy for relapsed/refractory (R/R) Ph+ ALL. Here we report the case of two patients with R/R Ph+ ALL who were treated with BLIN + TKI with durable molecular response. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient 1: A 69-year-old Japanese male with R/R Ph+ ALL was treated with conventional chemotherapy and dasatinib in April 2016. In May 2018, he developed molecular relapse due to the acquisition of T315I during dasatinib maintenance therapy. Thereafter, he achieved molecular complete remission (mCR) after switching from dasatinib to ponatinib. However, he developed a second relapse after the emergence of triple compound mutations (G250E/D276G/T315I) in November 2018. He subsequently received a total of nine cycles of BLIN and ponatinib combination therapy, which resulted in sustained mCR without any adverse events. Patient 2: A 69-year-old Japanese female with R/R Ph+ ALL was treated with chemotherapy and imatinib in April 2008. She developed molecular relapse due to the emergence of the T315I mutation in October 2017. She achieved mCR after switching from imatinib to ponatinib. However, she developed a second relapse after acquiring ABL exon4 skipping in addition to T315I. She subsequently received a total of seven cycles of BLIN and ponatinib combination therapy, which resulted in sustained mCR. CONCLUSION: In our two cases, BLIN + ponatinib combination therapy was highly effective for R/R Ph+ ALL without any incidence of severe adverse events. Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate the safety and efficacy of this potent combination therapy.",,,20210325,PMC7992866,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL compound mutations', 'Blinatumomab', 'Ponatinib', 'Relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 24.,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer patients are prone to infections, but the mortality of fatal infections remains unclear. Understanding the patterns of fatal infections in patients with cancer is imperative. In this study, we report the characteristics, incidence, and predictive risk factors of fatal infections among a population-based cancer cohort. METHODS: A total of 8,471,051 patients diagnosed with cancer between 1975 and 2016 were retrospectively identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The primary outcome was dying from fatal infections. Mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) adjusted for age, sex, race, and calendar year were calculated to characterize the relative risks of dying from fatal infections and to compare with the general population. Furthermore, cumulative mortality rates and the Cox regression models were applied to identify predictive risk factors of fatal infections. RESULTS: In cancer patients, the mortality rate of fatal infections was 260.1/100,000 person-years, nearly three times that of the general population [SMR, 2.92; 95% (confidence interval) CI 2.91-2.94]. Notably, a decreasing trend in mortality rate of fatal infections was observed in recent decades. SMRs of fatal infections were highest in Kaposi sarcoma (SMR, 162.2; 95% CI 159.4-165.1), liver cancer (SMR, 30.9; 95% CI 30.0-31.8), acute lymphocytic leukemia (SMR, 19.1; 95% CI 17.0-21.4), and acute myeloid leukemia (SMR, 13.3; 95% CI 12.4-14.3). Patients aged between 20 and 39 years old exhibited a higher cumulative mortality rate in the first few years after cancer diagnosis, whereas the cumulative mortality rate of those > 80 years old was rapidly increasing and became the highest approximately 3 years post-cancer diagnosis. Predictive risk factors of dying from fatal infections in cancer patients were the age of 20-39 or > 80 years, male sex, black race, diagnosed with cancer before 2000, unmarried status, advanced cancer stage, and not receiving surgery and radiotherapy, but receiving chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients were at high risks of dying from infectious diseases. Certain groups of cancer patients, including those aged between 20 and 39 or > 80 years, as well as those receiving chemotherapy, should be sensitized to the risk of fatal infections.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4024-4291'],20210324,PMC8116465,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer patients', 'Cohort studies', 'Fatal infections', 'SEER', 'Survivorship']","['2017ZT07S096/Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial', 'Teams', '2019TQ05Y351/Tip-top Scientific and Technical Innovative Youth Talents of', 'Guangdong Special Support Program', '2019CFB156/Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, harmful adverse events (AEs) and significant differences in drug response among individuals remain a significant problem in clinical application. Current evidence suggests that the observed individual variation in the treatment outcomes of AI is conferred by genetic variants. Hence, in this study, we examined the association of TCL1A gene polymorphisms with letrozole-induced AEs. The study subjects were postmenopausal HR+ breast cancer patients who were receiving adjuvant letrozole. Genomic DNA was isolated by a routine standard phenol-chloroform method. In total, 198 South Indian patients were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCL1A gene loci by the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay using the RT-PCR system. We used the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval to assess the genetic association. Musculoskeletal (MS) AEs and vasomotor symptoms (VMSs) are the most common side effects observed in the study cohort. Among 198 patients, 81 experienced musculoskeletal toxicity, reporting MS-AEs, 57 had VMSs, and 33 of them had both. The most frequently identified polymorphic variants in the patient series were rs11849538 (G), with an allele frequency of about 27.3%, followed by rs7158782-G (27.3%), rs7159713-G (25.8%), and rs2369049-G (22.5%). The genetic association analysis indicated no significant difference in the proportion of TCL1A gene variants between patients with and without AEs on either MS-AEs or VMSs. Though we observed high LD in all patient groups, the inferred haplotypes displayed a non-significant association with letrozole-induced specific AEs. However, the SNP functionality analysis by RegulomeDB provided a 2b rank score for rs7158782, suggesting a potential biological function. Our findings suggest that TCL1A gene polymorphisms may not play any role in the prediction of letrozole-induced AEs in South Indian HR+ breast cancer patients.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8709-9159'],20210324,PMC7990231,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation of cohesin complex subunits is observed in cancer and developmental disorders, but the mechanisms through which these mutations may contribute to disease remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate a recurrent missense mutation to the hinge domain of the cohesin subunit SMC1A, observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Engineering this mutation into murine embryonic stem cells caused widespread changes in gene expression, including dysregulation of the pluripotency gene expression program. This mutation reduced cohesin levels at promoters and enhancers, decreased DNA loops and interactions across short genomic distances, and weakened insulation at CTCF-mediated DNA loops. These findings provide insight into how altered cohesin function contributes to disease and identify a requirement for the cohesin hinge domain in three-dimensional chromatin structure.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9776-1989'],20210324,PMC7990204,,,"['R35 GM124764/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA217824/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007092/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper demonstrates the functionality of Perl alternation and grouping expressions to classify electronic pathology reports generated from military treatment facilities. Eight Perl-based algorithms are validated to classify malignant melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and malignant neoplasms of the breast, ovary, testis, and thyroid. METHODS: Case finding cohorts were developed using diagnostic codes for neoplasm groups and matched by unique identifiers to obtain pathology records. Preprocessing techniques and Perl-based algorithms were applied to classify records as malignant, in situ, suspect, or nonapplicable, followed by a hand-review process to determine the accuracy of the algorithm classifications. Interrater reliability, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were computed following abstractor adjudication. RESULTS: The specificity of the Perl-based algorithms was consistently high, over 98%. Very few benign results were classified as malignant or in situ by the Perl-based algorithms; the leukemia algorithm classification was the only group to demonstrate a positive predictive value below 95%, at 91.9%. Three algorithm classification groups demonstrated a sensitivity of < 80%, including malignant neoplasm of the ovary (33.3%), leukemia (52.8%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (62.9%). The pathology records for these results included substantial linguistic variation. CONCLUSION: This paper contextualizes the utility and value of an algorithm logic built around synoptic reporting to identify neoplasms from electronic pathology results. The major strength includes the application of Perl-based coding in SAS, an accessible software application, to develop highly specific algorithms across institutional variation in diagnostic documentation.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5271-8434'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 24.,"Highrisk human papillomavirus (HPV)16 and 18 are the primary cause of cervical cancer (CC) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs/lncs) are often abnormally expressed in patients with CC. The authors' previous study indicated that oncogenic enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)binding lncRNA in cervical cancer (lncEBIC) serves a role in the tumorigenic activity of the HPV E6 protein in patients with CC. However, whether HPV E7 affects the development of CC through lncEBIC, and the potential mechanisms underlying this remains unclear. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of lncEBIC and HPV E7 in cervical cancer cell lines HeLa, CaSki and C33A in vitro. CCK8, EdU and DAPI staining assays, flow cytometry, RTqPCR, western blotting and Transwell assay were performed on these cell lines. The results revealed that exogenous expression of HPV16/18 E7 significantly promoted lncEBIC expression, and conversely, lncEBIC was downregulated by silencing endogenous HPV16/18 E7 expression in corresponding CaSki and HeLa cells. Overexpression of lncEBIC significantly increased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibited apoptosis in HPV C33A cells. The tumorigenic effects of HPV16/18 E7 in corresponding CaSki and HeLa cells were significantly blocked by the silencing of lncEBIC expression. Molecular analysis revealed that HPV16/18 E7 depended on TAL BHLH transcription factor 1, erythroid differentiation factor inhibition to promote lncEBIC expression, which also resulted in the upregulation of oncogenic Kelch domaincontaining 7B (KLHDC7B) in corresponding CaSki and HeLa cells. Additionally, KLHDC7B knockdown blocked the tumorpromotive effects of lncEBIC in HPV() C33A cells. Collectively, the results of the present study indicated that lncEBIC acts as an oncogenic lncRNA by enhancing KLHDC7B expression in HPV(+) and HPV() CC cells, and can be exploited by HPV16/18 E7 to accelerate tumorigenic activity in CC. These results further revealed that the lncEBIC/KLHDC7B axis represents a novel molecular mechanism and potential therapeutic target for CC.",,,20210324,,['NOTNLM'],"['*human papillomavirus E7', '*enhancer of zeste homolog 2binding long noncoding RNA in cervical cancer', '*TAL BHLH transcription factor 1', '*erythroid differentiation factor', '*Kelch domaincontaining 7B', '*cervical cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

inhibitors in cancer cells. Here, we first show that cell lines, PDXs, and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring an IDH mutation displayed an enhanced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Along with an increase in TCA cycle intermediates, this AML-specific metabolic behavior mechanistically occurred through the increase in electron transport chain complex I activity, mitochondrial respiration, and methylation-driven CEBPalpha-induced fatty acid beta-oxidation of IDH1 mutant cells. While IDH1 mutant inhibitor reduced 2-HG oncometabolite and CEBPalpha methylation, it failed to reverse FAO and OxPHOS. These mitochondrial activities were maintained through the inhibition of Akt and enhanced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 PGC1alpha upon IDH1 mutant inhibitor. Accordingly, OxPHOS inhibitors improved anti-AML efficacy of IDH mutant inhibitors in vivo. This work provides a scientific rationale for combinatory mitochondrial-targeted therapies to treat IDH mutant AML patients, especially those unresponsive to or relapsing from IDH mutant inhibitors.",['(c) 2021 Stuani et al.'],,,PMC7995203,,,['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Disclosures: B.

We aimed to compare the functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients infected with HTLV-1, HIV, and HIV-HTLV-1. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients older than 18 years who had an HTLV-1 infection (Group A), HIV infection (Group B), or HIV-HTLV-1 coinfection (Group C). The functioning profiles were evaluated using handgrip strength, Berg balance scale (BBS), timed ""up and go"" (TUG) test, and 5-m walk test (m/s). We used the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) questionnaire to measure disability. The HRQoL was evaluated using a 36-item short-form health survey. For data with parametric and non-parametric distribution, we used analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction and the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn's pairwise tests with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: We enrolled 68 patients in Group A, 39 in Group B, and 29 in Group C. The scores for handgrip strength, BBS, TUG test, all the WHODAS domains, and HRQoL were poorer for Groups A and C than for Group B. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients with HIV infection, those with HIV-HTLV-1 coinfection and HTLV-1 infection had poor functioning and HRQoL scores. HTLV-1 infection was associated with reduced functioning and HRQoL in patients with a single HTLV-1 infection and HIV-HTLV-1 coinfection.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0435-7288', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3736-0002', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4673-6991', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0717-9694']",20210322,PMC8008869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 5.,"INTRODUCTION: Hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-V) is a rare B-cell neoplasm arising or homing primarily in the spleen. It has been considered in the WHO classification of Hemopoietic and Lymphoid Tumors as a provisional entity since 2008 and included under the umbrella of unclassifiable splenomegalic B-cell leukemia/lymphomas. The diagnosis is a challenge to hematopathologists and management of these patients by the clinicians is difficult due to the lack of diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines and prospective studies. AREAS COVERED: This manuscript is a comprehensive review of the clinical features, pathology, immunophenotypic profile, genomic alterations and therapeutic options of HCL-V. Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas are extensively outlined considering the information derived from a literature search covering from 1980 to 2019. Integration of all the data is needed and recommended for establishing the diagnosis of this leukemia. EXPERT OPINION: More extensive information of genomic aberrations underlying the pathogenesis of the disease would be a solid stone for the diagnosis. To this end, a collaborative work among scientists and pathologists from different centers is required and expected. In turn, this might have a relevant clinical translation by allowing to identify putative targets for therapy and to improve the outlook of these patients.",,,20210405,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hairy cell leukemia variant', 'MAP2K1', 'TP53', 'diagnosis', 'gene mutations', 'immunophenotype', 'treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: The study aimed to record dental late effects of antineoplastic treatment and associate them with disease and treatment characteristics in order to identify possible risk factors. DESIGN: Orthopantomograms of 70 survivors aged 4-21 years, who were treated at ages 0-10 years for any type of malignancy and completed antineoplastic treatment at least one year before, were examined. Incidence of developmental disturbances was recorded. Their severity was calculated, and odds ratios for the development of severe defects were estimated. RESULTS: Root defects presented in 62% of the participants, with impaired root growth being the most common (58%). Increased incidence was associated with combination treatment protocols, irradiation to the head and neck region, and administration of antimetabolites, steroids, and vincristine. Mean DeI value was 17.46 with risk factors for the development of severe root defects being diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, combination treatment protocols, administration of cyclophosphamide and steroids, and hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Root defects are common among childhood cancer survivors, with their incidence and severity being affected by multiple disease and treatment characteristics.","['(c) 2021 BSPD, IAPD and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4197-5827'],20210416,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer survivorss', 'dental late effects', 'radiographic findings', 'root defects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"A 6.2-year-old 28-kg (61.7 lb) intact female Golden Retriever was referred due to persistent and multiple cytopenias noted on a routine CBC prior to a mature ovariohysterectomy procedure. The patient's physical examination was unremarkable, and staging of the thorax and abdomen identified no abnormalities. At the referral hospital, moderate hypercalcemia, borderline anemia, and neutropenia were noted. Assessment of bone marrow samples by cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry indicated a T-cell neoplasm. The patient was treated with a multi-agent chemotherapy protocol for 6 months, which induced remission. Nine months after diagnosis, she relapsed with recurrence of hypercalcemia, cytopenias, and clinical illness. Single-agent anthracycline (mitoxantrone) in combination with prednisone therapy was initiated for 3 months. Two months after completion, the patient relapsed again, and palliative therapy with prednisone was elected. The patient was euthanized 16 months after diagnosis due to progressive disease. Post-mortem histopathologic evaluation showed extensive replacement of bone marrow by neoplastic cells, and infiltrates in multiple organs. The neoplasm was diagnosed as lymphoma rather than leukemia due to the lack of abnormal circulating cells throughout the course of disease. The neoplasm was detected only in marrow at the time of initial diagnosis, and the marrow was the most extensively effaced organ at the time of death. Therefore, leukemia or stage V lymphoma was considered unlikely. In patients with a cytopenia and lack of neoplastic leukocytosis or solid tissue masses, primary bone marrow lymphoma should be considered among the differential diagnoses.",['(c) 2021 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2301-2931'],20210323,,['NOTNLM'],"['canine', 'clonality', 'dog', 'flow cytometry', 'immunohistochemistry', 'lymphosarcoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Vet Clin Pathol. 2021 Jun;50(2):310.

Heterozygous germline mutations in GATA2 underlie a pleiotropic autosomal dominant disorder, GATA2 deficiency syndrome. The wide spectrum of its clinical features involves familial predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiorgan dysfunction, including congenital sensorineural hearing loss (CSHL). We herein report a pedigree with a novel germline frameshift mutation presenting as CSHL and familial MDS. The proband was a 46-year-old man, and his daughter also presented with an identical set of clinical syndromes. Target DNA sequencing identified a novel eight-nucleotide duplicative insertion at exon 5 (NM_032638.4:c.1126_1133dup:p.Lys378Asnfs*12)of the GATA2 gene. RT-PCR and subcloning analysis showed that the frameshift might result in a truncated mutation with an early stop codon without interfering with the predicted splice site. The predicted mutant protein had 388 amino acids and in silico analysis showed the variant was considered deleterious. This mutation was not detected in unaffected family members. Its deleterious effect is highly likely to have portended the familial MDS and CSHL in this pedigree.

However, ICIs targeting programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, best known as PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) have limited clinical efficacy in patients with AML. Natural killer (NK) cells are central players in AML-targeting immune responses. However, little is known on the relationship between co-inhibitory receptors expressed by NK cells and the ability of the latter to control AML. Here, we show that hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVCR2, best known as TIM-3) is highly expressed by NK cells from AML patients, correlating with improved functional licensing and superior effector functions. Altogether, our data indicate that NK cell frequency as well as TIM-3 expression levels constitute prognostically relevant biomarkers of active immunity against AML.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

We previously reported that leukemia patients were more susceptible to COVID-19 than the overall population. However, for COVID-19 recovered patients with leukemia, the impacts of intensive chemotherapy on the immune memory of COVID-19 are unknown. This study characterized the changes in immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in acute leukemia patients, who underwent chemotherapy after recovering from COVID-19. The study enrolled three groups of individuals. One group was a total of three acute leukemia patients, who recovered well from COVID-19 before the last cycle of chemotherapy. The other two groups were six COVID-19 recovered healthy people, and six normal uninfected healthy people, respectively. Levels of B cells, T cells, and NK cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were monitored. The results showed that B cells were severely decreased after chemotherapy, especially memory B cells. Most of the T cells and NK cells showed only minor changes after chemotherapy, except for gammadelta T cells. The serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not significantly affected after chemotherapy in two leukemia patients. However, interestingly, one leukemia patient's SARS-CoV-2 IgM showed dramatically increase, suggesting possible loss of serological memory after chemotherapy. These findings raised the concern for the stability of immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 during chemotherapy and the choice of anti-leukemia treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic.",['(c) The author(s).'],,20210301,PMC7974873,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'antibody', 'chemotherapy', 'immune memory', 'leukemia', 'lymphocytes']",,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We estimated the leukemia incidence and 5-year survival rate along with the temporal trends by sex, race, age, and subtype in the United States over the past four decades using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Results: The overall incidence of leukemia steadily increased from 12.39/100 000 in 1975 to 14.65/100 000 in 2011, and then began to decline in recent years (13.73/100 000 in 2017), with average annual percent changes (APC) of 0.350 (P<0.001). The 5-year relative survival rate of leukemia patients significantly improved from 33.2% in 1975 to 66.1% in 2012 (APC=1.980, P<0.001). The main subtypes of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia, increased in most age groups; conversely, the incidences of all other subtypes were gradually declined during the monitoring period. The incremental advancement in leukemia prognosis had been achieved in almost all histological subtypes, especially among young patients. Conclusions: Based on SEER data, the leukemia incidence increased gradually over the past decades, and then began to decline in recent years in the United States. The 5-year relative survival rate increased incrementally over time, especially among young patients. However, the huge disparities among different sexes, races, histological subtypes, and age groups, emphasize that precise causes control and innovative treatments need to be developed to reduce the incidence and improve the prognosis, especially among specific populations.",['(c) The author(s).'],,20210222,PMC7974881,['NOTNLM'],"['SEER', 'incidence', 'leukemia', 'secular trend', 'survival']",,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells and is considered a powerful marker of angiogenesis and a potential main player in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases as well as tumor progression. CD105 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in many types of solid malignancies, however, its influence on hematological neoplasms is still an area of interest. Purpose: To assess the flow-cytometric expression of CD105 in childhood B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and its relation to disease response after the induction chemotherapy. Subjects and Methods: Eighty children newly diagnosed with B-ALL were screened for flow-cytometric expression of CD105 at time of diagnosis, then they were followed up to detect their response to induction therapy. Results: CD105 was expressed in 41.2% of B-ALL patients. Higher expression of CD105 was observed in high and very high-risk groups. The multivariate analysis considered CD105 positivity as an independent prognostic marker for response to induction therapy. Values higher than 2.5 Specific fluorescence indices (SFIs) and 35% expression were sensitive predictors to induction failure. Conclusion: CD105 can be considered as a potential prognostic marker for the detection of response to induction therapy in childhood B-ALL, and it can serve to optimize treatment decisions.",['(c) 2021 Elkholy et al.'],['ORCID: 0000-0001-6538-6598'],20210316,PMC7981143,['NOTNLM'],"['B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CD105', 'endoglin']",,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"Advances in our understanding of cancer biology have enabled drug development to progress towards better targeted therapies that are both more effective and safer owing to their lack of off-target toxicities. In this regard, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which have the potential to combine the selectivity of therapeutic antibodies with the cytotoxicity of highly toxic small molecules, are a rapidly developing drug class. The complex and unique structure of an ADC, composed of a monoclonal antibody conjugated to a potent cytotoxic payload via a chemical linker, is designed to selectively target a specific tumour antigen. The success of an ADC is highly dependent on the specific properties of its components, all of which have implications for the stability, cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity of the ADC. The development of therapeutic ADCs, including gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin, provided great knowledge of the refinements needed for the optimization of such agents. In this Review, we describe the key components of ADC structure and function and focus on the clinical development and subsequent utilization of two leukaemia-directed ADCs - gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin - as well as on the mechanisms of resistance and predictors of response to these two agents.",,,20210323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"Several methodologies that rely on the detection of immunophenotypic or molecular abnormalities of the neoplastic cells are now available to quantify measurable (""minimal"") residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although the perfect MRD test does not (yet) exist, the strong association between MRD and adverse patient outcomes has provided the impetus to use measures of MRD as biomarker in the routine care of AML patients and during clinical trials. MRD test results may inform the selection of postremission therapy in some patients but evidence supporting the use of MRD as predictive biomarker is still limited. Several retrospective studies have shown that conversion from undetectable to detectable MRD or increasing MRD over time is associated with overt disease recurrence, and MRD testing may therefore be valuable as a monitoring biomarker for early detection of relapse. Interpreting serial MRD data is complex, with open questions regarding the optimal timing and frequency of testing, as well as the identification of test-specific thresholds to define relapse. Importantly, it is unknown whether intervening at the time of MRD detection, rather than at overt disease recurrence, improves outcomes. Finally, using MRD as a surrogate efficacy-response biomarker to accelerate drug development/approval has already been accepted by regulatory authorities in other diseases and is of great interest as a potential strategy in AML. While the prognostic value of MRD in AML is well established, data from prospective clinical trials confirming that treatment effects on MRD directly relate to clinical outcomes are needed to further establish the role of MRD as a surrogate endpoint in AML.",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9268-3341', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0969-3766', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0245-0553']",20210323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that even without the mediation of any N-terminal signal peptides, BlAase can efficiently secrete into the medium. Further investigation indicated that the secretion of the BlAase was via neither Sec- nor Tat-dependent secretion pathway, and both the N- and C-terminal regions of the BlAase were essential for its expression and secretion, implying that BlAase might be secreted via a non-classical secretion pathway. To explore its secretion ability, BlAase was used as a signal peptide to direct the secretion of various heterologous proteins, where two of five proteins were successfully secreted with the mediation of BlAase.

Epub 2021 Feb 23.,"INTRODUCTION: Classic BCR/ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity and include 4 distinct constituents. Very little data on clinical presentation and epidemiology of the same is available from the Indian setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred to Hematology-Oncology from January 2018 to August 2020 with suspected MPNs were included in the analysis and prospectively followed-up. All patients were initially screened, and only those meeting the updated World Health Organization 2016 criteria were included in the analysis. Epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular characteristics were documented, and patients were followed-up prospectively. RESULTS: A total of 233 patients were referred for evaluation of MPN, of which 63 were included in the analysis, including 39 males and 24 females. The median age at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 28-82 years), and 38% patients were younger than 50 years of age. The most common presentations were incidental detection in 35 (55.5%), abdominal symptoms in 13 (20%), fatiguability in 7 (11%), and recent vascular events in 6 (9.5%) patients. Final diagnosis was polycythemia vera in 27, essential thrombocytosis (ET) in 21, prefibrotic myelofibrosis in 9, and myelofibrosis in 6 patients. The frequency of driver mutations in polycythemia vera included JAK2 in 75%; in ET, JAK2 in 33%, CALR in 33%, and MPL in 4%; and in prefibrotic myelofibrosis, JAK2 in 66% and CALR in 33%. Aspirin was used for all patients along with risk-adapted cytoreduction with hydroxyurea. Ruxolitinib was reserved for symptoms refractory to hydroxyurea. After a median follow-up of 15 months (interquartile range, 10-28 months) from diagnosis, disease progression was noted in 4 patients. Two patients died at the end of the follow-up period, including 1 with secondary acute myeloid leukemia post myelofibrosis and one with ET and coexistent oral malignancy. The remaining 61 patients are alive and on regular treatment. RESULTS: This is one of the first systematic descriptions and prospective follow-up of patients with BCR/ABL-negative MPNs from India. Our study indicates a younger median age of presentation and higher proportion of JAK2-unmutated disease across all subtypes. The primary role of bone marrow morphology and supportive role of somatic mutations in differentiating MPN subtypes is indicated. CONCLUSIONS: This study sets the stage for a collaborative registry for defining epidemiologic data and long-term outcomes with MPN in India.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The exploration of the genomic and molecular landscape of AML, identification of mutations associated with the pathogenesis of AML, and the understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to treatment from excellent translational research helped to expand the treatment options of AML quickly in the past few years, resulting in noteworthy breakthroughs and FDA approvals of new therapeutic treatments in AML patients. Targeted therapies and combinations of different classes of therapeutic agents to overcome treatment resistance further expanded the treatment options and improved survival.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) regulate biological and pathogenic processes, suggesting a potential role in AML. We have previously described the overall alterations in circRNAs and their regulatory networks between patients with AML presenting with and without EMI. This study aims to find new prognostic and therapeutic targets potentially associated with AML. METHODS: qRT-PCR was performed on samples from 40 patients with AML and 15 healthy controls. The possibility of using circPLXNB2 (circRNA derived from PLXNB2) as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for AML was analysed with multiple statistical methods. In vitro, the function of circPLXNB2 was studied by lentivirus transfection, CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, and Transwell experiments. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to detect the expression of related proteins and genes. The distribution of circPLXNB2 in cells was observed using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH). We also investigated the role of circPLXNB2 by establishing AML xenograft models in NOD/SCID mice. RESULTS: By analysing the results of qRT-PCR detection of clinical samples, the expression of the circPLXNB2 and PLXNB2 mRNAs were significantly increased in patients with AML, more specifically in patients with AML presenting with EMI. High circPLXNB2 expression was associated with an obviously shorter overall survival and leukaemia-free survival of patients with AML. The circPLXNB2 expression was positively correlated with PLXNB2 mRNA expression, as evidenced by Pearson's correlation analysis. RNA-FISH revealed that circPLXNB2 is mainly located in the nucleus. In vitro and in vivo, circPLXNB2 promoted cell proliferation and migration and inhibited apoptosis. Notably, circPLXNB2 also increased the expression of PLXNB2, BCL2 and cyclin D1, and reduced the expression of BAX. CONCLUSION: In summary, we validated the high expression of circPLXNB2 and PLXNB2 in patients with AML. Elevated circPLXNB2 levels were associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with AML. Importantly, circPLXNB2 accelerated tumour growth and progression, possibly by regulating PLXNB2 expression. Our study highlights the potential of circPLXNB2 as a new prognostic predictor and therapeutic target for AML in the future.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8060-8221'],20210323,PMC7988933,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukaemia', '*CircPLXNB2', '*Extramedullary infiltration', '*PLXNB2', '*Tumour biomarker']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is one of the members of Morbilliviruses that has been speculated to cause chronic kidney disease in cats even though a definite relationship is still unclear. To date, FeMV has been detected in several continents, such as Asia (Japan, China, Thailand, Malaysia), Europe (Italy, German, Turkey), Africa (South Africa), and South and North America (Brazil, Unites States). This study aims to develop a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay targeting the N gene of FeMV in clinical samples to detect early phase of FeMV infection. RESULTS: A specific assay was developed, since no amplification was observed in viral strains from the same family of Paramyxoviridae, such as canine distemper virus (CDV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and measles virus (MeV), and other feline viruses, such as feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). The lower detection limit of the assay was 1.74 x 10(4) copies/muL with Cq value of 34.32 +/- 0.5 based on the cRNA copy number. The coefficient of variations (CV) values calculated for both intra- and inter-assay were low, ranging from 0.34-0.53% and 1.38-2.03%, respectively. In addition, the clinical sample evaluation using this assay showed a higher detection rate, with 25 (35.2%) clinical samples being FeMV-positive compared to 11 (15.5%) using conventional RT-PCR, proving a more sensitive assay compared to the conventional RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the N gene described in this study is more sensitive, specific, rapid, and reproducible compared to the conventional RT-PCR assay targeting the N gene, which could be used to detect early infection in cats.",,,20210323,PMC7987112,['NOTNLM'],"['Feline morbillivirus', 'N gene', 'TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to evaluate the reproductive health in long-term pediatric cancer survivors by conducting a crosscut survey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors over 18 years of age, who were in remission for more than 5 years, were invited to complete a gender-specific questionnaire surveying on their reproductive health. Demographic and treatment data were retrieved from their medical records. Treatment modalities were reviewed for its potential gonadotoxicity. RESULTS: 34 (17 males and 17 females, respectively) from 346 addressed survivors (9.8%) completed the questionnaire. Median age and follow-up after diagnosis was 27 (18-35) and 14 (3-25) years, respectively. Some respondents reported sexual concerns: 11.8% males experienced problems with penetration, two males (11.8%) who underwent semen analysis were found to be azoospermic. Similarly, 11.8% females reported delayed puberty, the average age of menarche was 14 (12-17) years, 29.4% females reported irregular menstrual cycles. Cyclophosphamide equivalent dose (CED) differed significantly between the patients treated for leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors (3000 vs 4352 vs 6660 mg/m2, respectively, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalence of sexual dysfunction, fertility related disorders or delayed puberty in childhood cancer survivors was found.

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"Despite the efficacy of chemotherapy, the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic drugs are considered a limitation of leukemia treatment. Therefore, a chemotherapy drug with minimal side effects is currently needed. One interesting molecule for this purpose is a bioactive peptide isolated from plants since it has less toxicity to normal cells. In this study, we extracted protein from the Zingiber officinale rhizome and performed purification to acquire the peptide fraction with the highest cytotoxicity using ultrafiltration, reverse-phase chromatography, and off-gel fractionation to get the peptide fraction that contained the highest cytotoxicity. Finally, a novel antileukemic peptide, P2 (sequence: RALGWSCL), was identified from the highest cytotoxicity fraction. The P2 peptide reduced the cell viability of NB4, MOLT4, and Raji cell lines without an effect on the normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The combination of P2 and daunorubicin significantly decreased leukemic cell viability when compared to treatment with either P2 or daunorubicin alone. In addition, leukemic cells treated with P2 demonstrated increased apoptosis and upregulation of caspase 3, 8, and 9 gene expression. Moreover, we also examined the effects of P2 on p53, which is the key regulator of apoptosis. Our results showed that treatment of leukemic cells with P2 led to the upregulation of p53 and Bcl-2-associated X protein, and the downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2, indicating that p53 is involved in apoptosis induction by P2. The results of this study are anticipated to be useful for the development of P2 as an alternative drug for the treatment of leukemia.",['Thieme.

However, relapse occurs in approximately 20% of cases which necessitates identifying additional high risk parameters for treatment intensification. The aim of this study is to assess the prognostic significance of CD45 antigen expression in pediatric ALL. METHODS: We studied 363 pediatric patients with B cell precursor-ALL (BCP-ALL) (n = 313) and T-ALL (n = 50). The ratio of median fluorescence intensity of CD45 expressed in leukemic blasts and normal lymphocytes was calculated. The 75th percentile was taken as cut-off to categorise patients into CD45 high and CD45 low groups. RESULTS: The 75th percentile was 0.141 in BCP-ALL and 0.548 in T-ALL. In BCP-ALL, there was a statistically significant association of age (>/=10 years) (p = 0.027) and National Cancer Institute high risk group (p = 0.001) with high CD45 expression but not in T-ALL. Worse event-free survival (EFS) was seen with high CD45 expression in BCP-ALL (42.17% versus 60.83%, p = 0.0053). In T-ALL, there was no association between CD45 expression and EFS (CD45 high 40.40% versus low 67.35%, p = 0.414). The overall survival (OS) was 70% versus 60% (p = 0.38) in BCP-ALL and the OS was 82% versus 68% (p = 0.16) in T-ALL for CD45 low versus CD45 high groups, respectively.

Deliberative dialogues and exhaustive programs have emerged as promising means of advancing evidence-informed policy, by providing a structured forum for key stakeholders to integrate scientific and pragmatic knowledge about complex health concerns. A system-wide strategy based on the comprehensive leukemia identity is essential for a meaningful decline in early childhood mortality.",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3401-9757'],20210323,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Bone marrow', '*Childhood cancer', '*Leukemia burden', '*Leukemia stratification', '*Leukemia-initiating cells', '*Low-to-middle-income countries', '*Systemic diseases', '*Tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

creating oncoprotein DEK-NUP214 that induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients, and secreted DEK protein functions as a hematopoietic cytokine to regulate hematopoiesis; however, the intrinsic role of nuclear DEK in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains largely unknown. Here, we show that HSCs lacking DEK display defects in long-term self-renew capacity, eventually resulting in impaired hematopoiesis. DEK deficiency reduces quiescence and accelerates mitochondrial metabolism in HSCs, in part, dependent upon activating mTOR signaling. At the molecular level, DEK recruits the corepressor NCoR1 to repress acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and restricts the chromatin accessibility of HSCs, governing the expression of quiescence-associated genes (e.g., Akt1/2, Ccnb2, and p21). Inhibition of mTOR activity largely restores the maintenance and potential of Dek-cKO HSCs. These findings highlight the crucial role of nuclear DEK in preserving HSC potential, uncovering a new link between chromatin remodelers and HSC homeostasis, and have clinical implications.",['(c) 2021 Chen et al.'],,,PMC7992411,,,,,['Disclosures: The authors declare no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment option, and patient selection is critical because of relevant transplant-related morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the impact of mutation status together with clinical presentations on posttransplant outcome. Our study included 240 patients with a median follow-up of 5.5 years. A significant association with worse survival was identified for the presence of mutations in ASXL1 and/or NRAS. In multivariable analysis, ASXL1- and/or NRAS-mutated genotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63), marrow blasts >2% (HR, 1.70), and increasing comorbidity index (continuous HR, 1.16) were independently associated with worse survival. A prognostic score (CMML transplant score) was developed, and the following points were assigned: 4 points for an ASXL1- and/or NRAS-mutated genotype or blasts >2% and 1 point each for an increase of 1 in the comorbidity index. The CMML transplant score (range, 0-20) was predictive of survival and nonrelapse mortality (P < .001 for both). Up to 5 risk groups were identified, showing 5-year survival of 81% for a score of 0 to 1, 49% for a score of 2 to 4, 43% for a score of 5 to 7, 31% for a score of 8 to 10, and 19% for a score >10. The score retained performance after validation (concordance index, 0.68) and good accuracy after calibration. Predictions were superior compared with existing scores designed for the nontransplant setting, which resulted in significant risk reclassification. This CMML transplant score, which incorporated mutation and clinical information, was prognostic in patients specifically undergoing transplantation and may facilitate personalized counseling.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC7993107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) were evaluated monthly. Median survival was increased as compared to the control cohort, though not statistically different. Interestingly, improvements in the immunological profile of patients were found. After 30 days, an activated and cytotoxic phenotype was detected: GT increased total and naive/effector CD8(+) T cells, perforin(+)/granzyme B(+) natural killer cells, monocytes, and classical monocytes with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. A reduction in the immunosuppressive profile was also observed: GT reduced TGF-beta and IL-4 expression, and decreased regulatory T cell and CXCR4(+) regulatory T cell frequencies. ROS levels and CXCR4 expression were reduced in bone marrow CD34(+) cells, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression in biopsies. Immune modulation induced by GT appears to occur, regardless of tumor burden, as soon as 30 days after intake and is maintained for up to 180 days, even in the presence of low-dose chemotherapy.

CLINICAL FINDINGS: All 5 bearded dragons had nonspecific clinical signs, including lethargy, poor appetite, ocular discharge, and weight loss. Clinicopathologic testing revealed extremely high lymphocyte counts with morphological findings consistent with lymphocytic leukemia. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: All 5 patients were treated with lomustine, prednisolone, and antimicrobials. In addition, 1 or 2 doses of L-asparaginase were administered when the drug was available. Partial remission was achieved in all 5 patients. One patient, after disease progression was documented, was treated with cyclophosphamide and achieved a second partial remission. One of the 5 patients was still alive and continuing to receive chemotherapy at the time of final follow-up 244 days after the initial diagnosis.

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"Peptides are attractive drug candidates, but their utility is greatly limited by their inherent susceptibility to proteolytic degradation and their inability to pass through the cell membrane. Here, we employ a strategy of temporary cyclization to develop a cell-active lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) inhibitor peptide. We first identified a highly potent LSD1-inhibitory linear peptide, with the assistance of X-ray crystal structure data of inhibitor peptide-bound LSD1.CoREST. The peptide was converted to a redox-activatable cyclic peptide incorporating cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), expecting selective activation under intracellular reducing conditions. The cyclic peptide moiety exhibited enhanced stability to protease and was converted to the linear, unmodified LSD1 inhibitor peptide under reducing conditions. The cyclic peptide with CPP inhibited the proliferation of human acute myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60) in the low micromolar concentration range.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3966-2303', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3464-2960', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3586-4680']",20210323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib, an oral agent targeting Bruton tyrosine kinase in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, is highly effective in several malignancies. Its activity in HCL was unknown, so we conducted a multisite phase 2 study of oral ibrutinib in patients with either relapsed classic or variant hairy cell leukemia. The primary outcome measure was the overall response rate (ORR) at 32 weeks, and we also assessed response at 48 weeks and best response during treatment. Key secondary objectives were characterization of toxicity and determination of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Thirty-seven patients were enrolled at 2 different doses (24 at 420 mg, 13 at 840 mg). The median duration of follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 0-5.9 years). The ORR at 32 weeks was 24%, which increased to 36% at 48 weeks. The best ORR was 54%. The estimated 36-month PFS was 73% and OS was 85%. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea (59%), fatigue (54%), myalgia (54%), and nausea (51%). Hematologic adverse events were common: anemia (43%), thrombocytopenia (41%), and neutropenia (35%). Ibrutinib can be safely administered to patients with HCL with objective responses and results in prolonged disease control. Although the initial primary outcome objective of the study was not met, the observation of objective responses in heavily pretreated patients coupled with a favorable PFS suggests that ibrutinib may be beneficial in these patients.

Case 2: A case of burned-out testicular cancer with atypical lymphatic spread (stage II A) was presented. After right orchiectomy and complete remission of tumor markers, due to atypical metastases location and uncertain histology, the patient was treated with systemic therapy based on bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (PEB). At re-staging after chemotherapy computed tomography showed reduction of all node metastases and an observation protocol was proposed. Case 3: A patient was readmitted to hospital after 12 days from an uneventful Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer due to lower abdominal pain plus abdominal distension, nausea and constipation not responsive to medical therapy. Computed Tomography showed colon and small bowel dilatation without any evidence of anatomical or mechanical obstruction. Laparoscopic abdominal exploration confirmed bowel distension without evidence of obstructing lesions. Ogilvie's Syndrome or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) was diagnosed. The patient fully recovered and was discharged six days after the procedure.

Epub 2021 Mar 22.,"BACKGROUND: Despite favorable prognoses, pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies experience significant challenges that may lead to diminished quality of life or family stress. They are less likely to receive subspecialty palliative care (PC) consultation and often undergo intensive end-of-life (EOL) care. We examined ""palliative opportunities,"" or events when the integration of PC would have the greatest impact, present during a patient's hematologic malignancy course and relevant associations. METHODS: A single-center retrospective review was conducted on patients aged 0-18 years with a hematologic malignancy who died between 1/1/12 and 11/30/17. Demographic, disease, and treatment data were collected. A priori, nine palliative opportunity categories were defined. Descriptive statistics were performed. Palliative opportunities were evaluated over temporal quartiles from diagnosis to death. Timing and rationale of pediatric PC consultation were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients (n = 92) had a median of 5.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 6.0) palliative opportunities, incurring 522 total opportunities, increasing toward the EOL. Number and type of opportunities did not differ by demographics. PC consultation was most common in patients with lymphoid leukemia (50.9%, 28/55) and myeloid leukemia (48.5%, 16/33) versus lymphoma (0%, 0/4, p = 0.14). Forty-four of ninety-two patients (47.8%) received PC consultation a median of 1.8 months (IQR 4.1) prior to death. Receipt of PC was associated with transplant status (p = 0.0018) and a higher number of prior palliative opportunities (p = 0.0005); 70.3% (367/522) of palliative opportunities occurred without PC. CONCLUSION: Patients with hematologic malignancies experience many opportunities warranting PC support.

Two leukemic myeloblast populations (CD34(+)CD117(dim) and CD34(+)CD117(bri)) were previously identified in t(8;21) AML, and CD34(+)CD117(dim) cell proportion was determined as an independent factor for this disease outcome. Here, we examined the impact of CD34(+)CD117(dim)/CD34(+)CD117(bri) myeloblast-associated gene expression on t(8;21) AML clinical prognosis. In this study, 85 patients with t(8;21) AML were enrolled. The mRNA expression levels of CD34(+)CD117(dim)-associated genes (LGALS1, EMP3, and CRIP1) and CD34(+)CD117(bri)-associated genes (TRH, PLAC8, and IGLL1) were measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Associations between gene expression and clinical outcomes were determined using Cox regression models. Results showed that patients with high LGALS1, EMP3, or CRIP1 expression had significantly inferior overall survival (OS), whereas those with high TRH or PLAC8 expression showed relatively favorable prognosis. Univariate analysis revealed that CD19, CD34(+)CD117(dim) proportion, KIT mutation, minimal residual disease (MRD), and expression levels of LGALS1, EMP3, CRIP1, TRH and PLAC8 were associated with OS. Multivariate analysis indicated that KIT mutation, MRD and CRIP1 and TRH expression levels were independent prognostic variables for OS.

Epub 2021 Mar 22.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of paranasal sinusitis on the clinical outcome of patients with cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether paranasal sinusitis at the initiation of chemotherapy (SAI) affects the development of infectious complications in children and adolescents with cancer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 0-20 years with cancer who received chemotherapy was performed. SAI was defined as the presence of a fluid level or mucosal swelling or total opacity on sinus computed tomography examination before the initiation of chemotherapy. The primary outcome measures were the incidence of bacteremia, septic shock, and invasive fungal disease (IFD, including proven, probable, and possible cases). RESULTS: SAI was observed in 57 (44%) of 130 enrolled patients. There were no significant differences in age, sex, and disease distribution between the patients with SAI (SAI group) and those without (non-SAI group). There was no significant difference in the 1-year cumulative incidence of bacteremia or septic shock after treatment initiation between the two groups (bacteremia, SAI group 33% vs. non-SAI group 35%, P = 0.53; septic shock, SAI group 4% vs. non-SAI group 4%, P = 0.87). The 1-year cumulative incidence of IFD was higher in the SAI group than in the non-SAI group (22% vs. 6%, P = 0.012). Cumulative incidence analysis after inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment showed that the SAI group was more likely to develop IFD (HR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.1-11.2, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with SAI may be at higher risk for IFD during chemotherapy.","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"PURPOSE: Methotrexate (MTX)/6-Mercaptopurine (6MP)-based maintenance therapy is crucial to cure childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cytotoxicity is mediated by incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) into DNA (DNA-TG) with higher levels in leucocytes being associated with reduced relapse risk. To further understand the dynamics of DNA-TG formation, we measured DNA-TG levels in leucocyte subsets during maintenance therapy and in the months following its discontinuation. METHODS: DNA-TG levels were measured in leucocytes (DNA-TGTotal), polymorph nucleated granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils [DNA-TGPMN]) and mononucleated cells (lymphocytes, monocytes [DNA-TGMNC]) in 1013 samples from 52 patients on ALL maintenance therapy (951 samples during therapy and 62 samples after therapy discontinuation, respectively). RESULTS: Median DNA-TGTotal, DNA-TGPMN and DNA-TGMNC during maintenance therapy were 539, 563 and 384 fmol/microg DNA, respectively. DNA-TGPMN displayed more pronounced fluctuation than DNA-TGMNC (range 0-3084 [interquartile range IQR 271-881] versus 30-1411 [IQR 270-509] fmol/microg DNA). DNA-TGTotal was more strongly correlated with DNA-TGPMN (rS = 0.95, p < 0.0001) than DNA-TGMNC (rS = 0.73, p < 0.0001). DNA-TGPMN correlated less with DNA-TGMNC (rS = 0.64, p < 0.0001) and to a much lesser extent with absolute neutrophil count (rS = 0.35, p < 0.0001). Following discontinuation of therapy, DNA-TGPMN was rapidly eliminated, and not measurable beyond day 22 after discontinuation, whereas DNA-TGMNC was slowly eliminated, and five patients demonstrated a measurable DNA-TGMNC more than 365 days after therapy discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Fluctuations in DNA-TGTotal are predominantly caused by corresponding fluctuations in DNA-TGPMN, thus DNA-TGTotal measures recent TGN incorporation in these short-lived cells. Measurement of DNA-TGTotal at 2-4 weeks intervals provides a reliable profile of DNA-TG levels.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8895-8840', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9144-7972', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0829-4993']",20210323,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Maintenance therapy', '*Mercaptopurine', '*Methotrexate', '*Pharmacokinetics', '*Thioguanine nucleotides']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia that affects adults. Ophthalmic manifestations of leukemia could be observed in both acute and chronic leukemias. Around 35.4% of leukemia patients present with leukemic retinopathy. In this report, we discuss the case of a patient who was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and went on to develop leukemic retinopathy during chemotherapy. A 35-year-old male was diagnosed with APL and received induction therapy with daunorubicin, and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in a seven + three regimen. During the remission phase, he presented with a complaint of decreased vision of the right eye for about three weeks after the initiation of the therapy. On examination, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was found to be 6/60 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. Fundus examination showed intraretinal hemorrhages in the posterior pole of both eyes. Fundus photography of the right eye showed resolved macular bleeding, temporal retinal bleeding, fresh inferonasal, and supraoptic retinal hemorrhage. For the left eye, however, it showed a small hemorrhagic spot temporal to the macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed on both eyes, which showed sub-inner limiting membrane (sub-ILM) hemorrhage in the right macula with normal OCT of the left eye. There are multiple reported ocular manifestations of leukemic retinopathy including flame-shaped hemorrhage, cotton wool spots, and Roth spots. In patients with APL, thrombocytopenia and intracranial hemorrhage are the proposed underlying mechanism of retinal hemorrhage. Terson's syndrome, which is an intracranial hemorrhage with associated retinal hemorrhage, has been reported to occur during ATRA induction therapy. Sub-ILM hemorrhage is relatively uncommon, and it has been associated with multiple primary pathologies such as Valsalva retinopathy, Terson's syndrome, and bleeding dyscrasias. Retinal hemorrhage is a serious complication in leukemic patients; it could be the presenting complaint or even manifest after the initiation of therapy. Early detection and frequent follow-ups are crucial for its management.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Balubaid et al.']",,20210217,PMC7975131,['NOTNLM'],"['aml', 'internal limiting membrane hemorrhage', 'leukemia', 'leukemic retinopathy', 'retinal hemorrhage']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also screening of potential drugs targeting HOXA-AS2 in AML. Methods: The level 3 raw genome-wide RNA sequencing dataset of AML was download from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal, and the potential molecular mechanisms and drugs prediction of HOXA-AS2 in AML were explored using multiple bioinformatics analysis approaches. Results: TCGA AML cohort dataset indicated that HOXA-AS2 was significantly up-regulated in AML bone marrow tissues, and high HOXA-AS2 expression was related to poor overall survival (log-rank P=0.0284, hazard ratio 1.640, 95% confidence interval 1.046-2.573). Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) suggested that the difference in prognosis between AML patients with high- and low-HOXA-AS2 expression may be due to differences in biological processes and pathways, including cell adhesion, angiogenesis, mitogen-activated protein kinase, cell differentiation, and other biological processes, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B and Wnt signaling pathways. We also screened out three potential HOXA-AS2-targeted therapeutic drugs for AML, megestrol, carmustine, and cefoxitin, based on these DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis of HOXA-AS2-co-expressed genes revealed that HOXA-AS2 may act a part in AML by regulating nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factor activity, DNA methylation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell migration, Toll-like receptor 4, and Wnt signaling pathways.

Methods: We studied peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of MDS patients or several leukaemia and MDS cell lines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR for expression levels of VEGF, miR-15a and miR-16. MiRNA transfection and Luciferase reporter assays were conducted to investigate whether VEGF is a target of miR-16.

Inverse correlation between VEGF and miR-16 were determined in cells lines including SKM-1, THP-1, and K562 cells. Overexpression of miR-16 in SKM-1 cells resulted in reduced VEGF secretion and cell protein levels. Direct binding of miR-16 to the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of VEGF was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. The migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells decreased in the presence of medium from SKM-1 cells with overexpressed miR-16.

Despite progress in understanding the biology of EVI1 dysregulation, significant improvements in therapeutic outcome remain elusive. Here, we highlight advances in understanding EVI1 biology and discuss how this new knowledge informs development of novel therapeutic interventions.

However, there are certain cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) wherein no inherent driver mutation is detected resulting in clinical phenotype. It is important to identify key genes and pathways in driving the disease. The aim of the study was to use a gene-based omics approach to molecularly characterize these mutation-positive and negative cases to further strengthen diagnostics and precision medicine. Methods: A microarray profiling was done on CD34 positive cells isolated from two BCR-ABL positive and five BCR-ABL negative samples. JAK2V617F mutation testing was also done to rule out the presence of any other mutation in the latter group. The fold change cut-off was taken as +/-1.5 with p</=0.5 for significant genes. The gene network and pathway analysis were done using DAVID and STRING software. Results: The genes upregulated in BCR-ABL negative samples were shown to be involved in immune regulation, signal transduction and T- and B-cell signalling. The protein-protein interaction network of upregulated genes in these samples were enriched for various immunomodulatory genes such as HLADP, HLADQ, IL7R, CCR7, CD3 subtypes. These genes further formed a network with signal transduction genes such as LCK, FYN, RAG1, DOCK1, AKT3, SMAD3, LEF1. Conclusion: The results suggested a modulation of immune response genes and its subsequent effect on oncogenic signalling in BCR-ABL negative samples as compared to BCR-ABL positive samples. The protein network analysis was enriched for genes involved in Src, TGF-beta and PI3K-AKT pathway contributing to the proliferation of neoplastic clone.",,,20210127,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'CD34', 'JAK2 V617F', 'immune', 'microarray', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms']",,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess variability in techniques and identify predictors of complications for children undergoing port placement. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all 331 patients who underwent venous port placement at a single tertiary children's hospital from May 2018 to June 2020. The primary outcome was early revision or replacement (R/R) for complications occurring within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included radiation exposure and rate of intraoperative conversion to a secondary site. Results The median age was 7 years (Interquartile Range 3-13 years) and the most common diagnoses were leukemia (30.2%), solid tumors (27.8%), and brain tumors (16.9%). Initial approach for port placement was ultrasound-guided internal jugular (IJV) in 255 (147 by surgery and 108 by interventional radiology [IR]) and landmark subclavian vein (SCV) in 76 (all by surgery). Early R/R occurred in 5.1%, including 9.0% of patients with leukemia but 1.1% with solid tumors. Individual proceduralist volume ranged from 2 to 98 cases and was inversely correlated with early R/R (r = -0.12, p = 0.30). In univariate analysis, ports placed by IR had an increased rate of early R/R (9.3%, n = 10) compared to those placed by surgery (3.2%, n = 7, p = 0.036) but this was not significant in multivariable regression controlling for diagnosis and age (Hazard Ratio 2.04; p = 0.19). Mean fluoroscopy time was significantly longer for ports placed by IR (59.9 s) compared to those placed by surgery (15.1 s, p < 0.001). Initial SCV access was associated with an increased (14.5 vs 0.4%) rate of conversion to a secondary site. Conclusions Though venous port placement is a largely safe procedure in children, a substantial minority of patients, particularly those with leukemia, require early R/R. Proceduralist volume and training may influence early R/R, fluoroscopy exposure, and anatomic site preferences.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 5.,"Hematological malignancies are classified as a heterogeneous category of cancers with various degrees of incidence and prognosis and different etiologies. Due to their aggressive essence they should be diagnosed as early as possible to improve prognosis, treatment outcome and survival. Bases on the limitations of previously identified biomarkers in terms of sensitivity, specificity and predictability, it is necessary to develop new diagnostic tools and biomarkers for the early diagnosis of hematological malignancies. Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by almost all cell types in both physiological and pathological conditions. They play major roles in intercellular communication and are recently being considered as disease biomarkers. These nanovesicles carry proteins, lipids and nucleic acids like microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs, which act as translational suppressors via regulating protein-coding genes. The aberrant expression of miRNAs has been shown in various conditions including hematological malignancies. Moreover, it is now known that tumor cells secrete higher amounts of exosomes compared to normal cells. The idea of using exosomal miRNAs in serum as biomarkers is based on their surprisingly high stability and specificity. In the present paper, we reviewed and recommended exosomal miRNA panels including (miR-150, miR-155 and miR-1246), (miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-16-5p and miR-5a-5p), (miR-18a, Let-7b) and (miR192-5p, miR21-5p, miR320b and Let-7d), for their potential to be used as non-invasive biomarkers in different hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, it is quite rare that MM could develop after CLL diagnosed. We reported a 66-year-old female progressed forward myeloma 3 years after she was diagnosed as CLL and conducted an analysis to investigate the epidemiology and clinical features among these patients based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Our data demonstrated that CLL patients were 19% less likely to develop myeloma than general U.S. population (standardized incidence ratio 0.81; 95% confidence interval 0.62-1.03), although without statistical difference. The median overall survival from CLL diagnosed was 90 (58.1-121.9) months, which was the same as general CLL patients according to historical data. But the outcomes of secondary MM was much poorer than general MM patients. Age and gender were independent factors that impact the survival among these patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 6.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients exposed to nilotinib for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) appear to be at risk of arterial complication. The prevalence and aspect of ultrasound asymptomatic arterial lesions are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To describe prevalence and characteristics of ultrasound arterial anomalies in patients treated with nilotinib for CML. METHODS: Patients treated with nilotinib from 2006 to 2015 in the department of the Paoli-Calmettes Institute, Marseille, were included retrospectively. A vascular ultrasound screening was carried out from 2010. The arterial lesions at the first examination were described: plaque and its echogenicity, stenosis or occlusion. A vascular arterial anomaly (VAA) was defined by the presence of a clinical and/or ultrasound anomaly. Patients with or without VAA at initial vascular examination were compared using bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: 74 patients were included (51.4% men, mean age 54.5 years); 25 patients had ultrasound arterial anomalies (33.8%). Carotid bulb was the most involved territory (44%). Arterial anomalies were: 88% plaques, 44%>50% stenosis and 12% occlusion. 72.7% plaques were echolucent or hypoechogenic. A VAA was present in 25 patients with initial vascular evaluation (33.8%). Patients with VAA at baseline were significantly older (64.9 vs 49.3, P<0.001), older at nilotinib initiation (60.8 vs 46.5, P<0.001), with more arterial hypertension (40% vs 12.2%, P=0.01), with more cardiovascular risk factors (P=0.03). In patient with no cardiovascular risk factor 12.5% had VAA (n=24). CONCLUSION: Nilotinib seems to be associated to arterial lesions of unstable lipid-like appearance. The most involved arterial territory was the carotid bulb and the most common lesion was echolucent or hypoechogenic plaque. VAA can occur in patients without cardiovascular risk factors. This result encourages us to systematically screen and follow all patients exposed to nilotinib even those without cardiovascular risk factors.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS: BCR repertoire sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from 12 DLBCL patients. Subsequently, a typing model was built with cluster analysis, and prognostic indicators between the two groups were compared to verify the typing model. Then, mutation and bioinformatics analyses were conducted to investigate the potential biomarkers of prognostic differences between the two groups. RESULTS: Based on BCR sequencing data, we divided patients into two clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2); this classification differed from the traditional typing method (GCB and non-GCB), in which cluster 1 included some non-GCB patients. The progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), metastasis and Shannon diversity index of IGH V-J and survival after chemotherapy were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two clusters, but no statistical significance was found between the GCB and non-GCB groups. The mutation status of 248 genes was significantly different between cluster 1 and cluster 2. Among them, FTSJ3, MAGED2, and ODF3L2 were the specific mutated genes in all patients in cluster 2, and these genes could be considered critical to the different prognoses of the two clusters of DLBCL patients. CONCLUSION: We constructed a new typing model of DLBCL based on BCR repertoire sequencing that can better predict the survival time after chemotherapy.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 63 mature B cell lymphoma patients who were treated in our center. Genotyping of the MTHFR 677 and SLCO1B1 genes was carried out, and the relationships between tumor status, polymorphism of the genes, MTX level, and ADR were analyzed. RESULTS: Altogether, 63 children were included. The mean blood MTX concentration was 0.25 +/- 0.2 umol/L at 45 h. Liver dysfunction and bulky disease were both correlated with MTX level (both P < 0.05). ADRs were higher among patients with blood MTX > 0.5 mmol/l at 45 h than for the groups with lower blood MTX. The MTHFR 677 CT genotype was correlated with liver function damage (P = 0.04); the rs11045879 locus CC genotype of SLCO1B1, stage IV, and bulky disease at the time of diagnosis were correlated with 4 degrees neutropenia (P < 0.05). Stage IV, bulky disease, leukemia stage at the time of diagnosis, and C2 treatment group were correlated with severe anemia (P < 0.05). Stage IV, bulky disease, leukemia stage, renal invasion at the time of diagnosis, and C2 treatment group were associated with severe thrombocytopenia (P < 0.05). Bulky disease and renal invasion at the time of diagnosis were associated with severe mucositis and severe infection (P < 0.05).

Epub 2021 May 15.,"Glycan structures are common posttranslational modifications of proteins, which serve multiple important structural roles (for instance in protein folding), but also are crucial participants in cell-cell communications and in the regulation of immune responses. Through the interaction with glycan-binding receptors, glycans are able to affect the activation status of antigen-presenting cells, leading either to induction of pro-inflammatory responses or to suppression of immunity and instigation of immune tolerance. This unique feature of glycans has attracted the interest and spurred collaborations of glyco-chemists and glyco-immunologists to develop glycan-based tools as potential therapeutic approaches in the fight against diseases such as cancer and autoimmune conditions. In this review, we highlight emerging advances in this field, and in particular, we discuss on how glycan-modified conjugates or glycoengineered cells can be employed as targeting devices to direct tumor antigens to lectin receptors on antigen-presenting cells, like dendritic cells. In addition, we address how glycan-based nanoparticles can act as delivery platforms to enhance immune responses. Finally, we discuss some of the latest developments in glycan-based therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells to achieve targeting of tumor-associated glycan-specific epitopes, as well as the use of glycan moieties to suppress ongoing immune responses, especially in the context of autoimmunity.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 10.,"Phthalimide derivatives are a promising group of anticancer drugs, while aminothiazoles have great potential as elastase inhibitors. In these context fourteen phthalimido-thiazoles containing a dichloro-substituted phenyl ring with high antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines were designed and synthesized. Among the screened derivatives, compounds 5a-5e and 6a-6f showed high activity against human leukemia (MV4-11) cells with IC50 values in the range of 5.56-16.10 microM. The phthalimide-thiazoles 5a, 5b and 5d showed the highest selectivity index (SI) relative to MV4-11 with 11.92, 10.80 and 8.21 values, respectively. The antiproliferative activity of compounds 5e, 5f and 6e, 6f against human lung carcinoma (A549) cells is also very high, with IC50 values in the range of 6.69-10.41 microM. Lead compounds 6e and 6f showed elastase inhibition effect, with IC50 values about 32 muM with mixed mechanism of action. The molecular modeling studies showed that the binding energies calculated for all set of compounds are strongly correlated with the experimentally determined values of IC50. The lead compound 6e also increases almost 16 times caspase 3/7 activity in A549 cells compared to control. We have also demonstrated that compound 6f reduced EGFR tyrosine kinase levels in A549 cells by approximately 31%.

The antimicrobial effect of the compounds was studied using four bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuruginosa, Shigella sonnei and Shigella dysenteriae) and for both complexes the inhibition of bacterial growth was superior to that caused by sulfapyridine, but inferior to that of tetracycline. The dark cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity (under UV-A light) of the complexes in a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line were investigated. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against K562 cells, which undergoes a 2-fold increase on applying 5 min of irradiation with UV-A light. Complex 2 was more effective and a good correlation between cytotoxicity and intracellular concentration was observed, the intracellular copper concentration required to inhibit 50% of cell growth being 3.5 x 10(-15) mol cell(-1).",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have suggested that certain socioeconomic factors such as living in a rural or farming area are associated with worse outcomes. Since 42% of acute myeloid leukemia patients seen in our academic center reside in a rural area, we have a unique opportunity to study outcomes of patients in rural versus urban settings. AIM: This analysis evaluates the effect of geography and socioeconomic factors on the biology, treatment, and overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, with the goal of understanding health care disparities. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient characteristics, cytogenetic data, treatment history, and overall survival were collected and analyzed to identify differences between urban and rural residency. This cohort included 42% of patients who resided in a rural area at the time of acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis. There was no difference in overall survival between the cohorts. The 1 year overall survival for the entire cohort was 47.9%. There was no difference detected in rates of adverse cytogenetics between the rural and urban cohorts. Similar numbers of patients received induction chemotherapy or proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplant between the cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that similar outcomes can be achieved in rural and urban patients, suggesting that intensive efforts at telehealth, education, and collaboration with local oncology practices may be beneficial.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We report a case of MS that presented as pancreatic and cardiac masses where subsequent evaluation of pleural effusion cytology rendered the diagnosis. Primary MS diagnosed via pleural effusion cytology is not yet reported in literature. Herein, we report the case of a 45-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain. An infiltrative mass was identified in the pancreatic head, suspicious for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Despite multiple attempts, Fine needle aspiration cytology of the pancreatic mass failed to render a definitive diagnosis. Subsequent thoracentesis of a right pleural effusion revealed cytologically malignant cells, identified as myeloid blasts after immunohistochemical and flow cytometric evaluation.

RESULTS: PCR-SBT revealed that the patient's mother and brother's HLA-DQB1 sequences did not fully match with any known allele combination. NGS revealed that the novel allele has differed from the closest matched DQB1*03:02 with a T>G substitution at position 233 in exon 2, which resulted in substitution of Valine at codon 46 by Glycine. Pedigree analysis confirmed that the novel HLA-DQB1 allele was inherited from his mother.

Epub 2021 Mar 22.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequently leukemia and categorized into three morphological subtypes named L1, L2 and L3. Early diagnosis of ALL plays a key role in treatment procedure especially in the case of children. Several similarities between morphology of three subtypes ALL (L1, L2, L3) and lymphocyte subtypes (normal, reactive and atypical) as noncancerous cells have remained a high challenge. Diagnosis of ALL and lymphocyte subtypes are done by microscopic viewing examination of cells in the peripheral blood samples by hematologists. Since this exam is time-consuming, boring and dependent on the skill of the hematologists, automatic systems are desired to overcome these limitations. In this study, 312 microscopic images including 958 cells are obtained from blood samples of 7 normal subjects and 14 patients. The first step of proposed system is image enhancement to decreases the effects of various luminosity situations with transformation from RGB to HSV color space and then applying histogram equalization on V channel for equalizing the grey level of image lightness. Nuclei segmentation from the blood cell images is the second step and performed using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. After identify cluster of nuclei, we performed opening and closing process in morphological operation binary in order to remove extra noises and fill some minor holes in the nuclei. Moreover, to discrete the link between nuclei, watershed transform was applied. Then, a set of quantitative features (five geometric features about the size and figure of a cell and 36 statistical features about the spatial arrangement of intensities of nuclei image) are extracted to characterize the properties of these nuclei. In the next step, due to high number of features, the best features are selected by exhaustive search of all of the subsets of features and 13 features are selected. The final step is the classification of L1, L2, L3, normal, reactive and atypical cells by applying Random Forest (RF) classifier and result in 98% accuracy. We compared RF classifier with two other commonly classifiers named: MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), and multi-SVM classifier with more success especially for recognition of L1, normal and reactive cells. So, this system can be used as an assistant diagnostic tool for hematologists to recognize subtypes of ALL and lymphocyte.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1595-7281'],20210322,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Feature selection', 'Random Forest classifier']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an acquired hemolytic anemia in which the destruction of erythrocytes is helped by anti-erythrocyte auto-antibodies. This has a controversial effect on the clinical outcome and survival of patients with CLL. Venetoclax, a second-generation BH3 mimetic compound, is one of the new therapies that has been approved for the treatment of CLL. Venetoclax disrupts the antiapoptotic signaling through BCL2. Common adverse events associated with venetoclax include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea. This case report describes a patient with CLL who developed AIHA when treated with venetoclax. CASE REPORT A patient of 62-year-old woman, who was treated with multiple lines of therapy, presented autoimmune hemolytic anemia after treatment with venetoclax. The anemia was resolved after holding venetoclax and being treated with rituximab. In January 2019, there were reports of 7 patients developing AIHA related to venetoclax therapy in Europe, according to the EudraVigilance database. How venetoclax can cause AIHA is not completely clear. This complication can happen when the erythrocyte antigen is altered by the drug that can produce antibodies. The other described mechanism is the binding of the drug with erythrocytes, which leads to production of an immune response. CONCLUSIONS Although AIHA can be a complication of CLL, it may be caused by treatment with venetoclax. That may be confirmed after eliminating other causes.",,,20210310,PMC7957329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also metabolized by thiopurine methyl-transferase to produce 6-methylmercaptopurine (6MMP). Elevated levels of 6MMP have been associated with toxic effects that may interfere with therapy. Allopurinol is known to inhibit thiopurine methyl-transferase which reduces red cell 6MMP and increases 6TGN. Allopurinol has been utilized successfully in adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have experienced 6MMP related gastrointestinal toxicity. Between August 2015 and August 2018 we started 25 patients with ALL in maintenance on allopurinol in combination with a reduced dose of 6MP. They all had unacceptable side-effects from elevated 6MMP, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, hypoglycemia, fatigue, and liver toxicity. In addition many had a facial rash. All patients showed resolution of symptoms within a few weeks after starting allopurinol. The red cell levels of 6MMP rapidly declined in the first month. The red cell levels of 6TGN transiently increased in spite of the lower 6MP dose. There was no decrease in absolute neutrophil count or hemoglobin. Platelets decreased slightly not requiring therapy modification. Elevated bilirubin normalized, and alanine aminotransferase decreased significantly with most normalizing. All patients continued on allopurinol with reduced dose 6MP until completing therapy. Allopurinol, in conjunction with a reduced dose of 6MP, effectively resolves 6MMP related side-effects in ALL patients on maintenance chemotherapy. This approach may lead to increased adherence to oral 6MP during ALL maintenance in patients with 6MMP induced side-effects.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 22.,"INTRODUCTION: BCR-ABL1-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a high-risk disease with a complex genomic background. Though extensively studied, data on the frequency and mutual associations of present mutations are still incomplete in adult patients. This retrospective study aims to map the genomic landscape of B-other ALL in a cohort of adult patients with a focus on the BCR-ABL1-like ALL subtype. METHODS: We analyzed bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of adult B-other ALL patients treated consecutively at three major Czech teaching hospitals. Samples were analyzed by cytogenetic methods, gene expression profiling, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). RESULTS: Fifty-eight B-other ALL patients (not BCR-ABL1, KMT2A-rearranged, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, or iAMP21) were included in the study. Median follow-up was 23.8 months. Samples from 33 patients were available for a gene expression analysis, 48.9% identified as BCR-ABL1-like ALL. Of the BCR-ABL1-like ALL cases, 18.8% harbored IGH-CRLF2 and 12.5% P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion gene. We observed a higher MRD failure rate in BCR-ABL1-like than in non-BCR-ABL1-like ALL patients after the induction treatment (50.0 vs. 13.3%, p=.05). There was a trend to worse progression-free and overall survival in the BCR-ABL1-like group, though not statistically significant. Deletions in IKZF1 gene were found in 31.3% of BCR-ABL1-like cases. Patients with concurrent IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B, PAX5 or PAR1 region deletions (IKZF1(plus) profile) had significantly worse progression-free survival than those with sole IKZF1 deletion or IKZF1 wild-type (p=.02). NGS analysis was performed in 54 patients and identified 99 short variants in TP53, JAK2, NRAS, PAX5, CREBBP, NF1, FLT3, ATM, KRAS, RUNX1, and other genes. Seventy-five of these gene variants have not yet been described in B-cell precursor ALL to date. CONCLUSION: This study widens existing knowledge of the BCR-ABL1-like and B-other ALL genomic landscape in the adult population, supports previous findings, and identifies a number of novel gene variants.",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4820-4267', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9316-7544', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0567-9887', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1269-6282']",20210322,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-other acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BCR-ABL1-like', 'IKZF1plus', 'adults', 'next-generation sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this autologous immunotherapy, patient-derived T cells are genetically engineered and then infused back to kill the leukemia cells. The observed response rates in ALL are a testament to the success of this therapy. However, there have been instances where the patients either did not respond or relapsed after initial response. Emergence of resistance due to antigen loss and T-cell exhaustion has been observed. This poses a challenge in making this therapy successful for every ALL patient and warrants deeper understanding of emergence of resistance and potential approaches to overcome them. Here we discuss current perspectives and advances in this area.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Chemotherapeutic approaches improved the outcome in majority of the patients, but it is generally associated with severe toxicities and relapse and does not benefit all the patients. With the success of adoptive cell therapies including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in treating certain B-cell malignancies, these therapeutic approaches are also being tested for myeloid malignancies, but the preclinical and limited clinical trial data suggest there are significant challenges. The principal hurdle to efficient targeted immunotherapy approaches is the lack of a unique targetable antigen on cancer cells leading to off-target effects including myelosuppression due to depletion of normal myeloid cells. Advanced age of the patients, comorbidities, immunosuppressive bone marrow microenvironment, and cytokine release syndrome are some other challenges that are not unique to myeloid malignancies but pose significant challenge for the successful adaptation of this approach for treatment. In this review, we highlight the challenges and solutions to adopt chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies to treat myeloid malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

High efficacy of CD19-targeted CAR T cells has been reported in children and adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), with complete responses without detectable minimal residual disease occurring in approximately 80% to 90% of patients. This led to the approval of tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) by the Food and Drug Administration based on the results of the ELIANA trial. Although CD19 CAR T-cell therapy may be curative in children, responses are short-lived in most adult B-ALL patients. In addition, CAR T-cell therapy can be associated with severe, potentially life-threatening, toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Here, we review the recent advances in CAR T-cell therapy for R/R B-ALL and discuss strategies to improve its efficacy while minimizing toxicities.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 22.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, yet data regarding long-term ovarian reserve of female survivors are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a differential pattern of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in female childhood ALL survivors compared with the normal age-matched population. In a cohort of 56 female childhood ALL survivors (median age 29 years; median follow-up 20.6 years), a negative correlation was found between age at leukemia diagnosis and age-adjusted anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels (r = -0.334, p = .031). Despite alkylating agent therapy, AMH levels did not differ significantly from age-related nomograms (age < 30, p = .17; age >/= 30, p = .94). The mean number of children per fertile woman adjusted for maternal age was similar to the national average (2.76 versus 3.11, p = .19). Our results imply that reproductive outcomes are not significantly hampered in female pediatric ALL survivors.

Following administration of blinatumomab, she experienced lineage switch from B-ALL to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myeloid-directed chemotherapy resulted in clearance of AML by flow cytometry, though a residual CD19+ B-ALL population persisted (0.14%). Following bridging blinatumomab, the patient achieved B-ALL and AML remission, as measured by flow cytometry. The patient subsequently underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Unfortunately, she relapsed with CD19+ B-ALL one-month post-transplantation. Next generation sequencing study of IGH/IGL using ClonoSEQ(R) analysis detected 3 dominant sequences all present in her original B-ALL, lineage switched AML, and post-transplant relapsed B-ALL, though the latter showed an additional 4 sequences, three of which were present at low abundance in the original diagnostic sample. The presence of the same clones throughout her disease course suggests cellular reprogramming and differentiation following chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This is the first reported case of lineage switch of B-ALL with t(1;11) and also the first report of a lineage switch case that used ClonoSEQ(R) to define the clonality of the original B-ALL, lineage switched AML, and relapsed B-ALL.",,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7905-6714'],20210322,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'ClonoSEQ(R)', 'KMT2A/EPS15', 'KRAS', 'MLL', 'NRAS', 'blinatumomab', 'infant ALL', 'lineage switch', 't(1;11) (p32;q23)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 21.,"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are increasingly appreciated as being essential for normal hematopoiesis and have a critical role in the progression of hematological malignancies. However, their functional consequences and clinical significance in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain unknown. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis to identify RBP-related genes affecting DLBCL prognosis based on the Gene Expression Omnibus database. By univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression (CPHR) methods, six RBPs-related genes (CMSS1, MAEL, THOC5, PSIP1, SNIP1, and ZCCHC7) were identified closely related to the overall survival (OS) of DLBCL patients. The RBPs signature could efficiently distinguished low-risk from high-risk patients and could serve as an independent and reliable factor for predicting OS. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed 17 significantly enriched pathways between high- versus low-risk group, including the regulation of autophagy, chronic myeloid leukemia, NOTCH signaling pathway, and B cell receptor signaling pathway. Then we developed an RBP-based nomogram combining other clinical risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated high prognostic predictive efficiency of this model with the area under the curve values were 0.820 and 0.780, respectively, in the primary set and entire set. In summary, our RBP-based model could be a novel prognostic predictor and had the potential for developing treatment targets for DLBCL.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

During the course of an extensive flow cytometry phenotyping of immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) we noticed an unexpected expression of NKG2D receptor on granulocytes using the phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated clone 149810 antibody. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 35 patients with GBM and 22 age-matched healthy control (HC) donors were analyzed using flow cytometry, imaging cytometry and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR to validate the observed expression of NKG2D receptor on myeloid cells. RESULTS: Reactivity with PE-149810 was mostly observed on granulocytes from GBM patients on dexamethasone treatment where it correlated with inferior survival rates. Surprisingly, such NKG2D expression on granulocytes was not observed using the allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugate of the same clone 149810 antibody or an indirect staining procedure with unconjugated clone 149810 antibody. Moreover, the PE-conjugate of a different anti-NKG2D clone (1D11) also did not stain granulocytes. Imaging cytometry indicated cell surface and intracellular localization of PE-149810 but not of PE-1D11 in granulocytes. CONCLUSION: Our results uncover an erroneous and false positive reactivity of PE-labeled (but not of APC-labeled or unconjugated) anti-NKG2D antibody 149810 on granulocytes from dexamethasone-treated GBM patients and raise a note of caution for studies of NKG2D expression on non-lymphoid cells.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

It is well documented that inflammation plays a crucial role in the expansion of leukemia. Daphnetin has confirmed anti-inflammatory effects against various diseases. In this experimental study, we evaluated the anti-leukemia and anti-inflammatory effect of daphnetin against benzene-induced leukemia in rats and explored the underlying mechanism. Benzene was used for inducing leukemia in experimental rats. The rats were divided into different groups and the body weight, hematological parameters, bone marrow cells, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators were estimated. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for estimating the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1. Daphnetin-treated rats showed upregulation of body weight compared to other groups. Moreover, Daphnetin reduced blasts in leukemic rats. It also altered hematological parameters such as red blood cells, white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils, respectively. Daphnetin-treated rats showed a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-2, IL-6, and inflammatory mediators including nuclear factor-kappaB. RT-PCR showed upregulated mRNA expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 of daphnetin-treated group rats compared to other groups.

Epub 2021 Mar 21.,"Cytoplasmic lncRNAs have been found to directly interact with target mRNAs and regulate their stability. In this study, we aimed to study the molecular mechanism underlying the function of m(6) A as a central regulator in chemoresistance and CML proliferation. In this study, we established three mice groups (control group, ADR-R group and ADR-R + shLINC00470 group). We detected PTEN mRNA expression in the presence of LINC00470 in the mice models, as well as in the KCL22 and K562 cells. LINC00470 was significantly enriched for PTEN mRNA to exhibit a negative regulatory relationship between LINC00470 and PTEN mRNA. However, the alteration of LINC00470 had no effect on the luciferase activity of PTEN promoter, while the half-life of PTEN mRNA was affected. It was further validated that LINC00470 down-regulated PTEN expression by positively regulating the m6A modification of PTEN mRNA via RNA methyltransferase METTL3. Moreover, the relative expression of LC3II, Beclin-1, ATG7 and ATG5 was all decreased in cells treated with LINC00470, and down-regulated PTEN expression was observed in chemo-resistant cells, while the expression of PTEN was rescued by the transfection of shMETTL3 into chemo-resistant cells. Moreover, the knockdown of METTL3 also restored the normal level of PTEN m(6) A modification and LINC00470 expression in chemo-resistant cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of LINC00470 on CML by reducing the PTEN stability via RNA methyltransferase METTL3, thus leading to the inhibition of cell autophagy while promoting chemoresistance in CML.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We hypothesized that shared genetic risk factors between CLL and NMSC could contribute to the association observed between these diseases. METHODS: We examined the association between (i) established NMSC susceptibility loci and CLL risk in a meta-analysis including 3100 CLL cases and 7667 controls and (ii) established CLL loci and NMSC risk in a study of 4242 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cases, 825 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases and 12802 controls. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for CLL, BCC and SCC were constructed using established loci. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Higher CLL-PRS was associated with increased BCC risk (OR4th-quartile-vs-1st-quartile = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.24, Ptrend = 0.009), even after removing the shared 6p25.3 locus. No association was observed with BCC-PRS and CLL risk (Ptrend = 0.68). These findings support a contributory role for CLL in BCC risk, but not for BCC in CLL risk. Increased CLL risk was observed with higher SCC-PRS (OR4th-quartile-vs-1st-quartile = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08-1.38, Ptrend = 1.36 x 10-5), which was driven by shared genetic susceptibility at the 6p25.3 locus. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the role of pleiotropy regarding the pathogenesis of CLL and NMSC and shows that a single pleiotropic locus, 6p25.3, drives the observed association between genetic susceptibility to SCC and increased CLL risk. The study also provides evidence that genetic susceptibility for CLL increases BCC risk.","['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International', 'Epidemiological Association 2021.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induces JAK-dependent adipocyte lipolysis and altered adipo/cytokine expression, suppressing in vivo adipose expansion in normal and obese mouse models. To characterize LIF receptor (LIFR-alpha)-dependent cytokine signaling in DIO, we created an adipocyte-specific LIFR knockout mouse model (Adipoq-Cre;LIFR (fl/fl) ). Differentiated adipocytes derived from this model blocked LIF-induced triacylglycerol lipolysis. Adipoq-Cre;LIFR (fl/fl) mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) displayed reduced adipose STAT3 activation, 50% expansion in adipose, 20% body weight increase, and a 75% reduction in total hepatic triacylglycerides compared with controls. To demonstrate that LIFR-alpha signals adipocytes through STAT3, we also created an Adipoq-Cre;STAT3 (fl/fl) model that showed similar findings when fed a HFD as Adipoq-Cre;LIFR (fl/fl) mice.

Given the low diagnostic yield from cytopathologic analysis of malignant pleural effusions and the fact that patients with leukemia are often thrombocytopenic and unable to tolerate invasive procedures, the incidence of leukemic effusions may be underestimated. Here, we report a rare case of pleural effusion in a patient with newly diagnosed AML. Initial analysis revealed an exudative, lymphocyte-predominant effusion. High levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA) were detected in pleural fluid, consistent with a diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, the analysis of pleural cytology revealed leukemic cells, permitting the diagnosis of leukemic effusion to be made. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy and pleural effusion resolved without recurrence. This case emphasizes the diagnostic dilemma presented by high levels of ADA in a leukemic pleural effusion, as this association has not been previously considered in the literature.","['(c) 2021 Sing-Ting Wang et al., published by De Gruyter.']",,20210312,PMC7957840,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'adenosine deaminase', 'extramedullary', 'leukemic pleural effusion']",,,['Conflict of interest: There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well known that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) are the preferred drugs for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, they can lead to irreversible resistance which may be responsible for clinical failure after complete remission (CR). Moreover, the differentiation therapy of ATRA-based treatment has not been effective against AML with t(8;21) translocation. Here we aimed to identify the differentiation effect of OGP46 on AML cell lines (HL-60, NB4, and Kasumi-1) and explore its possible mechanisms. We found that OGP46 has significant inhibitory activity against these cells by triggering cell differentiation with cell-cycle exit at G1/G0 and inhibited the colony-formation capacity of the AML cells. It was shown that OGP46 induced the differentiation of NB4 cells via the transcriptional misregulation in cancer signaling pathway by PML-RARalpha depletion, while it was attributed to the hematopoietic cell lineage and phagosome pathway in Kasumi-1 cells, which are all critical pathways in cell differentiation. These results highlight that OGP46 is an active agent not only in the APL cell line NB4 but also in AML-M2 cell lines, especially Kasumi-1 with t(8;21) translocation. Therefore, OGP46 may be a potential compound for surmounting the differentiation blockage in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhao, Wang, Qu, Zhao, Wang, Ke, Liu, Lei, Liu, Hu, Wei and', 'Chen.']",,20210304,PMC7969801,['NOTNLM'],"['AML cells with t(8;21) translocation', 'PML-RARalpha depletion', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'differentiation therapy']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that activates numerous downstream pathways that ultimately produces uncontrolled myeloid proliferation. Although the use of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib have increased the overall survival of CML patients, their use is limited by drug resistance and severe adverse effects. Therefore, there is the need to develop novel compounds that can overcome these problems that limit the use of these drugs. Therefore, in this study, we sought to find novel compounds using Hypogen and Hiphip pharmacophore models based on the structures of clinically approved BCR-ABL TKIs. We also used optimal pharmacophore models such as three-dimensional queries to screen the ZINC database to search for potential BCR-ABL inhibitors. The hit compounds were further screened using Lipinski's rule of five, ADMET and molecular docking, and the efficacy of the hit compounds was evaluated. Our in vitro results indicated that compound ZINC21710815 significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562, BaF3/WT, and BaF3/T315I leukemia cells by inducing cell cycle arrest. The compound ZINC21710815 decreased the expression of p-BCR-ABL, STAT5, and Crkl and produced apoptosis and autophagy. Our results suggest that ZINC21710815 may be a potential BCR-ABL inhibitor that should undergo in vivo evaluation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Huang, Wang, Qiang, Zhao, Wu, Ashby, Li and Chen.']",,20210304,PMC7969810,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'CML', 'ZINC21710815', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'pharmacophore model']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 inhibitor (CDK9i) effectively attenuates acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. However, the effect of CDK9i on B-ALL cells and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that CDK9i induced the apoptosis of B-ALL cells in vitro by activating the apoptotic pathways. In addition, CDK9i restrained the glycolytic metabolism of B-ALL cells, and CDK9i-induced apoptosis was enhanced by co-treatment with glycolysis inhibitors. Furthermore, CDK9i restained the glycolysis of B-ALL cell lines by markedly downregulating the expression of glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) and the key rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Moreover, cell apoptosis was rescued in B-ALL cells with over-expressed c-Myc after treatment with CDK9i, which is involved in the enhancement of glycolytic metabolism. In summary, our findings suggest that CDK9 inhibitors induce the apoptosis of B-ALL cells by inhibiting c-Myc-mediated glycolytic metabolism, thus providing a new strategy for the treatment of B-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Huang, Abudureheman, Xia, Chu, Zhou, Zheng, Zhou, Shi, Li,', 'Zhu, Qing, Ji, Liang, Guo, Yin and Duan.']",,20210304,PMC7969802,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'CDK9 inhibitors', 'c-Myc', 'cell apoptosis', 'glycolysis']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its diagnostic and prognostic value in hematological malignancies remains unclear. Materials and methods: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for relating literature. Diagnostic accuracy variables and disease progression prediction data were pooled by the Meta-Disc version 1.4 software. Review Manager version 5.4 software was applied for prognostic data analysis. Results: A total of 11 studies met our inclusion criteria. In terms of diagnosis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.51 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.38-0.64) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-1.00), respectively. The AUSROC (area under the SROC) curve was 0.89 (95%CI 0.75-1.03). When it comes to the prediction of disease progression, the overall sensitivity and specificity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67-0.94) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.93-1.00), respectively.

Methods: We selected C-type lectin domain family 11, member A (CLEC11A) for study via several public databases, comparing expression among a variety of tumors and normal samples as well as different organs and tissues. To investigated the relationship between CLEC11A expression and clinical characteristics, we derived an AML cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); we also investigated the Bloodspot and HemaExplorer databases. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to evaluate the associations between CLEC11A mRNA expression, as well as DNA methylation, and overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS). DNA methylation levels of CLEC11A from our own 28 de novo AML patients were assessed and related to chemotherapeutic outcomes. Bioinformatics analysis of CLEC11A was carried out using public databases. Results: Multiple public databases revealed that CLEC11A expression was higher in leukemia. The TCGA data revealed that high CLEC11A expression was linked with favorable prognosis (OS p-value = 2e-04; EFS p-value = 6e-04), which was validated in GSE6891 (OS p-value = 0; EFS p-value = 0; RFS p-value = 2e-03). Methylation of CLEC11A was negatively associated with CLEC11A expression, and high CLEC11A methylation level group was linked to poorer prognosis (OS p-value = 1e-02; EFS p-value = 2e-02). Meanwhile, CLEC11A hypermethylation was associated with poor induction remission rate and dismal survival. Bioinformatic analysis also showed that CLEC11A was an up-regulated gene in leukemogenesis. Conclusion: CLEC11A may be used as a prognostic biomarker, and could do benefit for AML patients by providing precise treatment indications, and its unique gene pattern should aid in further understanding the heterogeneous AML mechanisms.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yin, Zhang, Guan, Dou, Liu, Shen, Jia, Xu, Wu and Li.']",,20210302,PMC7966831,['NOTNLM'],"['CLEC11A', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarker', 'expression', 'methylation', 'prognosis']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to GC in leukemia cells is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. Despite the extensive use of GC for many years, molecular mechanisms underlying its resistance in ALL have not been fully uncovered. Recent studies have shown a potential role of EMP1, CASP1, and NLRP3 genes in prednisolone response. In this study on 148 pediatric B-ALL patients, we studied these three genes to assess their association with prednisolone response measured by day 8 blast count after 7 days of induction therapy with prednisolone. Intriguingly, ALL samples exhibited higher expression of EMP1 along with a low expression of CASP1 and NLRP3 compared to disease free normal bone marrow collected from patients with solid tumors. Among the three analyzed genes, only EMP1 was found to be overexpressed in prednisolone poor responders (p=0.015). Further, a comparison of gene expression between cytogenetic subtypes revealed higher expression of EMP1 in BCR-ABL subtype. Expression of EMP1 in multiple gene expression datasets was used for gene set enrichment analysis, which revealed TNF-alpha, IL-2-STAT5 signaling, inflammatory responses and hypoxia as the major positively associated pathways and E2F targets as negatively associated pathways. Interestingly, the clinical remission rate was higher in CASP1 high patients (p=0.048). In univariate survival analysis, higher EMP1 expression was associated with poor prognostic measures while higher expression of NLRP3 and CASP1 was associated with better prognostic measures in our data. Further, multivariate analysis revealed an independent association of high CASP1 and NLRP3 with a better prognosis. This study strengthens the available evidence that mRNA expression of EMP1, CASP1, and NLRP3 may serve as potential biomarkers for risk stratification of pediatric B-ALL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Singh, Kumari, Arora, Verma, Palanichamy, Kumar, Sharma,', 'Bakhshi, Pushpam, Ali, Ranjan, Tanwar, Chauhan, Singh and Chopra.']",,20210305,PMC7973229,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'CASP1', 'EMP1', 'NLRP3', 'leukemia', 'prednisolone resistance']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of Wilms tumor-1 (WT1), brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic (BAALC) and ETS-related gene (ERG) might be considered as prognostic factors in AML patients. The aim of this study was to determine the mRNA expressions of WT-1, BAALC and ERG genes in bone marrow of mononuclear cells and their effects on complete remission in the Iranian AML patients, pre- and post- chemotherapy. Methods: Forty AML patients with normal karyotype were evaluated. The mRNA gene expressions were measured with quantitative real-time PCR in bone marrow of mononuclear cells of AML patients at the baseline and after chemotherapy. The subtypes of AML and flow cytometry panel were also assessed. Complete remission (CR) after the treatment was addressed for all patients. Results: The mRNA expressions of WT-1, BAALC and ERG were significantly decreased after the treatment (p = 0.001, 0.017, 0.036). WT-1 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with CR after chemotherapy (P =0.024). There was also significant correlation between baseline expression of BAALC and CR (P =0.046). No significant correlation was observed between ERG and CR pre- and post- chemotherapy (P =0.464 and 0.781). There was also significant correlation between BAALC mRNA expression and CD34+ (P <0.001). Conclusion: The present study showed that WT-1 decreased significantly after standard chemotherapy which could have favorable effects on CR. Also, the high expression of BAALC could have a poor prognostic role in AML patients. The identification of these gene expressions can be an efficient approach in targeted therapy among AML patients.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1717-2602', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6990-9269']",20201107,PMC7961226,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BAALC', 'Chemotherapy', 'ERG', 'Gene expression', 'WT-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypercalcemia is a rare yet important side-effect of ATRA, especially when it is used concomitantly with a medication that impedes its metabolism by inhibiting cytochrome P-450 in the liver and thus increasing the duration of exposure to ATRA. Azole antifungal drugs such as voriconazole are frequently used in patients undergoing chemotherapy due to a high incidence of fungal infections. These medications inhibit two vital enzymes of cytochrome P-450, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, potentiating the effects of ATRA on calcium metabolism. We present a case of a nine-year-old girl who underwent chemotherapy with all-trans retinoic acid for acute promyelocytic leukemia. The patient was given an anti-fungal cover with voriconazole for extensive fungal chest infection simultaneously. She was found to have asymptomatic hypercalcemia on routine follow-up during the consolidation phase. Both medications were stopped. Subsequently, she was admitted to the ward and managed conservatively with hydration. Serum calcium levels were returned to normal within six days after stopping the combination of ATRA and voriconazole.

However, drug-drug interactions between letermovir and azoles or calcineurin inhibitors and the high financial burden of letermovir remain problematic, especially in resource-limited countries. It has not been clarified whether a lower dose of valganciclovir would constitute an effective strategy for CMV prevention in patients with acute leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT. Methods: We retrospectively assessed 84 consecutive adult patients with acute leukemia who underwent allo-HSCT. These 84 patients were stratified into a valganciclovir prophylaxis group (n = 20) and a non-valganciclovir prophylaxis group (n = 64). Results: Patients in the valganciclovir prophylaxis group had a lower possibility of CMV DNAemia at week 14 after allo-HSCT than those in the non-valganciclovir prophylaxis group (15.0% versus 50.0%; p = 0.012). The cumulative incidence of CMV DNAemia at week 14 was also lower in patients with valganciclovir CMV prophylaxis than in those without (15.0% versus 50.4%; p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis validated these data, showing that a low dose of valganciclovir significantly reduced the risk of CMV DNAemia at week 14 by 88% (hazard ratio: 0.12; 95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.42; p = 0.001). However, these two groups had similar overall survival rates at week 48 (75.0% versus 76.6%; p = 0.805). Four of 20 (20%) patients discontinued valganciclovir prophylaxis because of adverse events. Conclusion: Low-dose valganciclovir prophylaxis could be an alternative to letermovir to prevent CMV infection in allo-HSCT, especially in resource-limited countries.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9744-0368'],20210303,PMC7940724,['NOTNLM'],"['CMV', 'allo-HSCT', 'leukemia', 'prophylaxis', 'valganciclovir']",,,"['Conflict of interest statement: Chieh-Lin Jerry Teng received an honorarium and', 'consulting fees from Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Johnson & Johnson, Amgen, BMS', 'Celgene, Kirin, AbbVie, and MSD.

Additionally, some new pathways, besides the AMPK activation, were discovered, that can explain wide-range properties of metformin. All these properties are now attracting the attention of researchers in the fields other than diabetes and the drug has been reported to have anti-cancer, immunoregulatory and anti-aging effects. Among others, the beneficial effects of metformin in hematological disorders like leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma were reported. Despite a great progress in therapy, these diseases are still incurable in most cases. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel, less toxic and more effective drugs especially for older or chemotherapy-resistant patients.

Because signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively activated in CLL cells and sequence analysis detected putative STAT3-binding sites in the GLI1 gene promoter, we hypothesized that STAT3 induces the expression of GLI1. Western immunoblotting detected GLI1 in CLL cells from 7 of 7 patients, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that CD19+/CD5+ CLL cells co-express GLI1 and confocal microscopy showed co-localization of GLI1 and phosphorylated STAT3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that STAT3 protein co-immunoprecipitated GLI1 as well as other STAT3-regulated genes. Transfection of CLL cells with STAT3-shRNA induced a mark decrease in GLI1 levels, suggesting that STAT3 binds to and induces the expression of GLI1 in CLL cells. An electromobility shift assay confirmed that STAT3 binds, and a luciferase assay showed that STAT3 activates the GLI1 gene.

CRC is the third major types of cancer among males and the second among females worldwide. In China, CRC is the fifth common cancer among both males and females. Western blotting, flow cytometry, RNA interference, immunoprecipitation, xenografts models, and immunohistochemical staining were carried out to evaluate the possible mechanisms of acton of ruxolitinib. The present data suggested that ruxolitinib can suppress CRC cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Firstly, JAK1/2-STAT1 was identified as the target of ruxolitinib. Then, ruxolitinib downregulated myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) mRNA level and decreased its protein level, which enabled Bak to trigger CRC apoptosis. Furthermore, ruxolitinib exerted potent activity against CRC xenograft growth in vivo. High expression of phosphorylated STAT1 (S727) was also confirmed in 44 pairs of human colon carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. Taken together, the results showed that ruxolitinib decreased JAK1/2-STAT1-Mcl-1 protein level and effectively suppressed CRC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.

The presence of genetic mutations in the p53, EGFR, KRAS and BRAF genes were analyzed and the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined. In addition, the expression levels of the proteins p53 and EGFR were investigated. The results identified a genetic mutation in p53, of which its expression levels were upregulated. In addition, the majority of the tumor tissues presented with MSI. Therefore, the present findings suggested that the genetic mutations in p53 caused by MSI following allogeneic HSCT may promote tumorigenesis. In addition, the expression levels of the EGFR protein were upregulated, leading to an increase in MAPK signaling pathway activation, which may also serve an important role.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Spandidos Publications.']",,20210302,PMC7967950,['NOTNLM'],"['graft-versus-host disease', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'immune state', 'multiple primary carcinomas', 'p53']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decitabine is a DNA demethylation agent but it has not been used for T-ALL treatment. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the inhibitory effect of decitabine on T-ALL molt4 cells and determine its regulatory role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Molt4 cells were stimulated with decitabine in vitro, after which cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle analyses were performed to assess cell viability. Subcellular morphology was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Expression levels of phosphate and tension homology (PTEN), genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the corresponding downstream genes were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. The results showed that decitabine induced apoptosis, inhibited proliferation and arrested molt4 cells in the G2 phase. Following decitabine intervention, an increase in the number of lipid droplets, autophagosomes and mitochondrial damage was observed. At concentrations of 1 and 10 microM, decitabine downregulated the expression of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, P70S6 and eukaryotic initiating factor 4E-binding protein 1, which in turn upregulated PTEN expression; however, 50 microM decitabine downregulated PTEN levels. Overall, these results demonstrated that decitabine reduced the viability of molt4 cells partly by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway via PTEN, especially at low decitabine concentrations.",['Copyright: (c) Zhang et al.'],,20210302,PMC7967925,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway', 'T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'decitabine', 'phosphatase and tensin homolog']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 5.,"Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1)-associated protein 2 (BRAP2) is a novel protein that binds to BRCA1 and is located in the cytoplasm. BRAP2 has been demonstrated to bind to regulators of the Ras-Raf-MEK and PI3K/Akt pathways, both of which are involved in carcinogenesis. This suggests that BRAP2 may be capable of regulating both pathways. In the present study, the role of BRAP2 in both pathways was clarified during apoptosis and cell proliferation in a leukemia cell line. A BRAP2-deficient leukemia cell line was generated using CRISPR/Cas9, the BRAP2-deficient and parental cells were treated with a Ras, pan-Raf or PI3K inhibitor, and the changes in signal transduction, apoptosis and cell proliferation were evaluated. BRAP2 knockout attenuated the inhibition of signal transduction of the Ras-Raf-MEK and PI3K/Akt pathways by the Ras, pan-Raf or PI3K inhibitor. BRAP2 deletion also suppressed the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the Ras and pan-Raf inhibitors. However, the loss of BRAP2 did not suppress the cytotoxicity of the PI3K inhibitor but did suppress the PI3K inhibitor-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. The present results indicated that BRAP2 induces apoptosis and the inhibition of cell proliferation via regulating the Ras-Raf-MEK and PI3K/Akt pathways. In leukemia cells, because the Ras-Raf-MEK and PI3K/Akt pathways are activated aberrantly, the simultaneous inhibition of both pathways is desired. The current results indicated that enhancement of the function of BRAP2 may represent a new target in leukemia treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Spandidos Publications.']",,20210305,PMC7967852,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K/Akt pathway', 'Ras-Raf-MEK pathway', 'apoptosis', 'breast cancer susceptibility gene 1-associated protein 2', 'cell cycle arrest', 'leukemia']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By inhibiting these negative regulators of the immune response, immune checkpoint blockade can increase anti-tumor immunity, but has been primarily successful in solid cancer therapy and Hodgkin lymphoma so far. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a well-established cellular immunotherapy option with the potential to cure hematological cancers, but relapse remains a major obstacle. Relapse after allo-HCT is mainly thought to be attributable to loss of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and hence escape of tumor cells from the allogeneic immune response. One potential mechanism of immune escape from the GVL effect is the inhibition of allogeneic T cells via engagement of inhibitory receptors on their surface including PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3, and others. This review provides an overview of current evidence for a role of immune checkpoint molecules for relapse and its treatment after allo-HCT, as well as discussion of the immune mediated side effect graft-vs.-host disease. We discuss the expression of different immune checkpoint molecules on leukemia cells and T cells in patients undergoing allo-HCT. Furthermore, we review mechanistic insights gained from preclinical studies and summarize clinical trials assessing immune checkpoint blockade for relapse after allo-HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kohler, Ruess, Kesselring and Zeiser.']",,20210305,PMC7973115,['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*anti-PD-1', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*immune checkpoint', '*immune checkpoint inhibitor']",,,"['RZ received honoraria from Incyte, Novartis and Mallinckrodt.

Methods: Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats with T2DM were randomly divided into sham, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), LV-APN-EPCs, LV-EPCs, and EPCs groups. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced by the intraluminal suture method. After 1 h of reperfusion, the five interventions were performed by tail-vein injections. The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was used to assess neurological function before and on days 1, 7, and 14 after MCAO. After 14 days, magnetic resonance imaging scanning, hematoxylin and eosin staining, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining, Western blotting analysis, cluster of differentiation (CD) 31 immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to evaluate infarct rate, morphological damage, cell apoptosis, and microvessel density. Results: Compared with PBS, LV-EPCs, and EPCs groups, the LV-APN-EPCs group showed significantly lower mNSS score, lower infarct rate, and less morphological damage (all P < 0.05). In addition, compared with other groups, the LV-APN-EPCs group had significantly increased levels of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) protein, CD31+ microvessels, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and decreased levels of Bcl-2-associated X protein and neuronal apoptosis in the peri-infarct cortex (all P < 0.05).

The primary objectives of our study were to assess temporal trends in the prevalence of BCS among hospitalized patients in the United States using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database and to evaluate demographics, risk factors, and common presentation of BCS. Methods: Data were extracted from the NIS to identify patients >18 years of age using all listed diagnosis of BCS from 1998 to 2017 and analyzed. Results: Between 1998 and 2017, we identified a total of 8435 hospitalizations related to BCS. Over the 19-year period, the hospitalization rate for BCS increased consistently from 4.96 per 1,000,000 US population in 1998 to 10.44 per 1,000,000 in 2017, with an annual percentage change increase of 4.41% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.23%-4.59%, P < 0.0001). The most common risk factor (7.75%) was myeloproliferative disorder (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis, chronic myeloid leukemia) followed (7.32%) by a hypercoagulable state (primary thrombophilia, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or prothrombin gene mutation) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (1.63%). Cirrhosis was present in 18.7%, Portal vein thrombosis in 7.9%, and inferior vena cava thrombosis in 6.4%. The most common manifestations of BCS were ascites (29.9%) or acute kidney injury (18.8%) followed by hepatic encephalopathy (9.6%) and acute liver failure (5.6%).

NO66 is absent in the AML cell lines KG1/KG1a which consist of cells with the immature CD34(+)/CD38(-) phenotype and is regarded as a ""stem cell-like"" model system. Similarly, NO66 is not detectable in CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells purified from healthy donors but is clearly expressed in the more committed CD34(+)/CD38(+) cell population. Loss of NO66 expression in KG1/KG1a cells is due to hyper-methylation of its promoter and is released by DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors. In KG1a cells stably expressing exogenous wild type (KG1a66wt) or enzymatically inactive mutant (KG1a66mut) NO66, respectively, the wild type protein inhibited proliferation and rDNA transcription. Gene expression profiling revealed that the expression of NO66 induces a transcriptional program enriched for genes with roles in proliferation and maturation (e.g.EPDR1, FCER1A, CD247, MYCN, SNORD13). Genes important for the maintenance of stem cell properties are downregulated (e.g. SIRPA, Lin28B, JAML). Our results indicate that NO66 induces lineage commitment towards myeloid progenitor cell fate and suggest that NO66 contributes to loss of stem cell properties.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Disruptions of this process are associated with diseases like leukaemia, which is especially incident in children. The characteristics of self-regulation of this process make them suitable for a mathematical study. In this paper we develop mathematical models of lymphopoiesis using currently available data. We do this by drawing inspiration from existing structured models of cell lineage development and integrating them with paediatric bone marrow data, with special focus on regulatory mechanisms. A formal analysis of the models is carried out, giving steady states and their stability conditions. We use this analysis to obtain biologically relevant regions of the parameter space and to understand the dynamical behaviour of B-cell renovation. Finally, we use numerical simulations to obtain further insight into the influence of proliferation and maturation rates on the reconstitution of the cells in the B line. We conclude that a model including feedback regulation of cell proliferation represents a biologically plausible depiction for B-cell reconstitution in bone marrow. Research into haematological disorders could benefit from a precise dynamical description of B lymphopoiesis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"The blast percentage in bone marrow (BM) can be evaluated through biopsy and aspiration, which is essential for diagnosing myeloid neoplasms especially for dividing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, methods for integrating the results of biopsy and smear have yet to be developed, particularly for cases in which the results fall on both sides of the cut-off value (10% or 20%). We studied 188 cases of MDS/AML initially diagnosed during 2011-2015 by using concomitant BM biopsy and aspiration and used different methods to compare the estimated blast percentages. A linear relationship was noted between the blast percentages estimated through biopsy and smear (R(2)=0.765). When the blast percentage was classified into four relevant clinical categories (<5%, 5-9%, 10-19%, and >/=20%), the total concordance between the results of the biopsy and smear was 76.1%. Although the prognostic values obtained through biopsy and smear were not significantly different, using the higher blast percentage estimation by biopsy and smear fared better in classifying patients into categories of 10-19% and >/=20% and demonstrated survival significance in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that BM blast percentages had no prognostic significance when patients underwent intensive chemotherapy. However, blast percentages of >/=10% indicated poor prognosis for patients receiving only supportive care. In conclusion, most of the clinically relevant categories of blast percentages estimated through concomitant BM biopsy and smear were concordant. When the categories were different, the best prognostic prediction method was to select the higher blast percentage determined through biopsy and smear to diagnose MDS/AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

Fifteen years after the transplantation, he was diagnosed as having esophageal carcinoma Stage II and underwent radical surgery. Seven months after the surgery, he died of the primary disease. Case 3: A 30-year-old female patient received cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation at 3 Gy for Fanconi anemia, followed by unrelated bone marrow transplantation. She developed chronic graft-versus-host disease manifesting as a rash and was administered tacrolimus and methotrexate. Fifteen years after the transplantation, she was diagnosed as having esophageal carcinoma Stage III and underwent radical surgery. She died of sepsis 7 months after the surgery. CONCLUSION: The esophageal carcinomas developing after bone marrow transplantation had the characteristics of secondary solid tumors in all 3 patients, such as early onset, after total body irradiation, association with chronic graft-versus-host disease, and history of use of immunosuppressive drugs. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation require long-term follow-up after the transplantation, considering the possible development of secondary solid tumors, and in regard to secondary solid tumors developing in the gastrointestinal tract, it must be borne in mind that the risk of esophageal carcinoma is particularly high.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6130-1753'],20210320,PMC7981339,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplantation', 'Chronic graft-versus-host disease', 'Esophageal cancer', 'Secondary solid tumors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 20.,"Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is an acquired, T cell-driven bone marrow (BM) failure disease characterized by elevated interferon gamma (IFNgamma), loss of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and altered BM microenvironment, including dysfunctional macrophages (MPhis). T lymphocytes are therapeutic targets for treating SAA, however, the underlying mechanisms driving SAA development and how innate immune cells contribute to disease remain poorly understood. In a murine model of SAA, increased beta-chemokines correlated with disease and were partially dependent on IFNgamma. IFNgamma was required for increased expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 on MPhis. CCR5 antagonism in murine SAA improved survival, correlating with increased platelets and significantly increased platelet-biased CD41(hi) HSCs. T cells are key drivers of disease, however, T cell-specific CCR5 expression and T cell-derived CCL5 were not necessary for disease. CCR5 antagonism reduced BM MPhis and diminished their expression of Tnf and Ccl5, correlating with reduced frequencies of IFNgamma-secreting BM T cells. Mechanistically, CCR5 was intrinsically required for maintaining BM MPhis during SAA. Ccr5 expression was significantly increased in MPhis from aged mice and humans, relative to young counterparts. Our data identify CCR5 signaling as a key axis promoting the development of IFNgamma-dependent BM failure, particularly relevant in aging where Ccr5 expression is elevated.","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"This paper evaluates the scientific basis for the adoption of the linear non-threshold (LNT) dose response model for radiation-induced leukemia. This LNT risk assessment application for leukemia is significant because it: (1) was generalized for all tumor types induced by ionizing radiation and chemical carcinogens at relatively high doses and; (2) it was based on the mechanistic assumption of low dose linearity for somatic cell mutations as determined from responses in mature spermatozoa of fruit flies. A serious problem with the latter assumption is that those spermatozoa lack DNA repair. The acceptance of the LNT dose response model for cancer risk assessment was based on the convergence of recommendations of the BEAR I Genetics Panel (1956a) for reproductive cell gene mutations and those of Lewis (1957a) for somatic cell mutation and its capacity to explain apparent and/or predicted linear dose responses of ionizing radiation-induced leukemia in multiple and diverse epidemiological investigations. Use of that model and related dose response beliefs achieved rapid, widespread and enduring acceptance in the scientific and regulatory communities. They provide the key historical foundation for the sustained LNT-based policy for cancer risk assessment to the present. While previous papers in this series have challenged key scientific assessments and ethical foundations of the BEAR I Genetics Panel, the present paper provides evidence that Lewis: 1) incorrectly interpreted the fundamental scientific studies used to support the LNT conclusion even though such studies show consistent hormetic-J-shaped dose response relationships for leukemia in Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors; and, 2) demonstrated widespread bias in support of an LNT conclusion and related policies, which kept him from making an objective and fair assessment. The LNT recommendation appears to have been uncritically accepted and integrated into scientific and regulatory practice in large part because it inappropriately appealed to existing authority and it garnered the support of those who were willing to risk greatly exaggerating the public's fears of environmentally-induced disease, such as enhanced risk of leukemia, with the goal of stopping the atmospheric testing of atomic bombs. Adoption of the LNT recommendation demonstrated extensive penetration of ideological influence affecting governmental, scientific and regulatory evaluation at the highest levels in the United States. This paper demonstrates that the scientific foundations for cancer risk assessment were inappropriately and inaccurately assessed, unethically adopted and require significant historical, scientific and regulatory remediation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"BACKGROUND: Olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has previously been shown to extend progression-free survival versus placebo when given to patients with relapsed high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer who were platinum sensitive and who had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation, as part of the SOLO2/ENGOT-Ov21 trial. The aim of this final analysis is to investigate the effect of olaparib on overall survival. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done across 123 medical centres in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at baseline of 0-1, had histologically confirmed, relapsed, high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer, including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, and had received two or more previous platinum regimens. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg in two 150 mg tablets twice daily) or matching placebo tablets using an interactive web or voice-response system. Stratification was by response to previous chemotherapy and length of platinum-free interval. Treatment assignment was masked to patients, treatment providers, and data assessors. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival has been reported previously. Overall survival was a key secondary endpoint and was analysed in all patients as randomly allocated. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one treatment dose. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01874353, and is no longer recruiting patients. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2013 and Nov 21, 2014, 295 patients were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either olaparib (n=196 [66%]) or placebo (n=99 [34%]). One patient, randomised in error, did not receive olaparib. Median follow-up was 65.7 months (IQR 63.6-69.3) with olaparib and 64.5 months (63.4-68.7) with placebo. Median overall survival was 51.7 months (95% CI 41.5-59.1) with olaparib and 38.8 months (31.4-48.6) with placebo (hazard ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.54-1.00]; p=0.054), unadjusted for the 38% of patients in the placebo group who received subsequent PARP inhibitor therapy. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse event was anaemia (which occurred in 41 [21%] of 195 patients in the olaparib group and two [2%] of 99 patients in the placebo group). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 50 (26%) of 195 patients receiving olaparib and eight (8%) of 99 patients receiving placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events with a fatal outcome occurred in eight (4%) of the 195 patients receiving olaparib, six of which were judged to be treatment-related (attributed to myelodysplastic syndrome [n=3] and acute myeloid leukaemia [n=3]). INTERPRETATION: Olaparib provided a median overall survival benefit of 12.9 months compared with placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation. Although statistical significance was not reached, these findings are arguably clinically meaningful and support the use of maintenance olaparib in these patients.

Many chemokine axes such as CXCL12/CXCR4 and CCL25/CCR9 have been proved to play important roles in leukemia microenvironment and further affect ALL outcomes.

Identifying key players involved in proliferation of BCP-ALL cells is crucial to propose new therapeutic targets. Runt Related Transcription Factor 1 (RUNX1) and Core-Binding Factor Runt Domain Alpha Subunit 2 Translocated To 3 (CBFA2T3, ETO2, MTG16) are master regulators of hematopoiesis and are implicated in leukemia. METHODS: We worked with BCP-ALL mononuclear bone marrow patients' cells and BCP-ALL cell lines, and performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitations followed by Sequencing (ChIP-Seq), co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP), proximity ligation assays (PLA), luciferase reporter assays and mouse xenograft models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that CBFA2T3 transcript levels correlate with RUNX1 expression in the pediatric t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1 BCP-ALL. By ChIP-Seq in BCP-ALL patients' cells and cell lines, we found that RUNX1 is recruited on its promoter and on an enhancer of CBFA2T3 located - 2 kb upstream CBFA2T3 promoter and that, subsequently, the transcription factor RUNX1 drives both RUNX1 and CBFA2T3 expression. We demonstrated that, mechanistically, RUNX1 and CBFA2T3 can be part of the same complex allowing CBFA2T3 to strongly potentiate the activity of the transcription factor RUNX1. Finally, we characterized a CBFA2T3-mimicking peptide that inhibits the interaction between RUNX1 and CBFA2T3, abrogating the activity of this transcription complex and reducing BCP-ALL lymphoblast proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our findings reveal a novel and important activation loop between the transcription regulator CBFA2T3 and the transcription factor RUNX1 that promotes BCP-ALL proliferation, supporting the development of an innovative therapeutic approach based on the NHR2 subdomain of CBFA2T3 protein.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3718-3210', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5005-0642', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0194-4313', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5630-2417', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0095-742X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2668-9670']",20210320,PMC7981807,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML1', '*CBFA2T3', '*Childhood leukemia', '*Driver loop', '*ETO2', '*Inhibitor', '*NHR2', '*RUNX1', '*Transcription factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) reciprocally regulate the acetylation and deacetylation of nuclear histones. Aberrant activation of HDACs results in uncontrolled proliferation and blockade of differentiation, and HDAC inhibition has been investigated as epigenetic therapeutic strategy against AML. METHODS: Cell growth was assessed with CCK-8 assay, and apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry in AML cell lines and CD45 + and CD34 + CD38- cells from patient samples after staining with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI). EZH2 was silenced with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or overexpressed by lentiviral transfection. Changes in signaling pathways were detected by western blotting. The effect of chidamide or EZH2-specific shRNA (shEZH2) in combination with adriamycin was studied in vivo in leukemia-bearing nude mouse models. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the antileukemia effects of HDAC inhibitor chidamide and its combinatorial activity with cytotoxic agent adriamycin in AML cells. We demonstrated that chidamide suppressed the levels of EZH2, H3K27me3 and DNMT3A, exerted potential antileukemia activity and increased the sensitivity to adriamycin through disruption of Smo/Gli-1 pathway and downstream signaling target p-AKT in AML cells and stem/progenitor cells. In addition to decreasing the levels of H3K27me3 and DNMT3A, inhibition of EZH2 either pharmacologically by chidamide or genetically by shEZH2 suppressed the activity of Smo/Gli-1 pathway and increased the antileukemia activity of adriamycin against AML in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of EZH2 by chidamide has antileukemia activity and increases the chemosensitivity to adriamycin through Smo/Gli-1 pathway in AML cells (Fig. 5). These findings support the rational combination of HDAC inhibitors and chemotherapy for the treatment of AML.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0178-691X'],20210321,PMC7981995,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chemosensitivity', '*Chidamide', '*EZH2', '*Leukemia', '*Smo/Gli-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cattle this dialogue starts as early as days 3-4 when the embryo is still in the oviduct, and it continues to implantation. Immunological processes involving cytokines, mast cells and macrophages form an important part of this dialogue. Amongst the cytokines, interleukin-6 (Il-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are secreted by both the embryo and uterine endometrium and form part of an ongoing and reciprocating dialogue. Mast cells and macrophages populate the uterine endometrium during embryo development and are involved in achieving the correct balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions at the uterus that are associated with embryo attachment and implantation. Embryo loss is the major cause of reproductive wastage in cattle, and livestock generally.

However, previous results remained inconclusive. Thus, we performed this updated meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the association between rs2853669 and the susceptibility of human cancer. A systematic literature search via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted that produced a total of 19 eligible studies containing 23,085 subjects. The relationship was calculated with the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.4 software. The analysis indicated that rs2853669 is associated with an enhanced risk of overall cancer risk. From subgroup analysis, a significantly increased association in five genetic models (p < 0.05) was found among Asians, but no association was observed in Caucasians. Although we did not find any significant correlation between rs2853669 and breast cancer, an increased and statistically significant association was found for both lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. We did not find any association in other cancer types during stratified analysis. Our meta-analysis suggests that rs2853669 polymorphism in TERT gene is associated with an increased risk of overall cancer susceptibility, particularly in the Asian population. Moreover, rs2853669 is significantly associated with lung cancer and acute myeloid lymphoma. However, large-scale studies are needed to confirm our findings.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4924-5319'],20210320,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Genetic polymorphism', 'Meta-analysis', 'Rs2853669', 'TERT']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in the field have historically benefited younger patients; however, a growing understanding of the molecular basis of leukemogenesis has brought multiple targeted agents to the clinic for patients of all ages. These therapies have expanded the therapeutic landscape for elderly patients from more than best supportive care and low-intensity monotherapy. In general, we currently utilize a backbone regimen of a hypomethylating agent (HMA) or low-intensity chemotherapy with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax for the majority of elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. For patients with targetable mutations, we employ a doublet/triplet strategy of HMA + a targeted inhibitor +/- venetoclax, often in the context of a clinical trial. CPX-351 is reserved for patients with secondary or therapy-related AML. In this review, we will outline our approach to the treatment of elderly patients with AML, with particular emphasis on recently approved agents and emerging novel therapies.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5393-7313'],20210320,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Hypomethylating agent', '*Leukemia', '*Venetoclax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2021 Jun 25.,"Emerging evidence shows that histone modification and its related regulators are involved in the progression and chemoresistance of multiple tumors including acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML). Our present study found that the expression of histone lysine demethylase Jumonji domain containing-3 (JMJD3) was increased in AML cells as compared with that in human primary bone marrow (HPBM) cells. Knockdown of JMJD3 can decrease the proliferation of AML cells and increase the chemosensitivity of daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C). By screening the expression of cytokines involved in AML progression, we found that knockdown of JMJD3 can inhibit the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) can attenuate si-JMJD3-suppressed proliferation of AML cells. Mechanistically, JMJD3 can positively regulate the promoter activity and transcription of IL-6 mRNA, while had no effect on its mRNA stability. Further, JMJD3 can regulate the expression of p65, which can directly bind with promoter of IL-6 to increase its transcription. Over expression of p65 significantly attenuated si-JMJD3-suppressed expression of IL-6. Collectively, we revealed that JMJD3 can regulate the proliferation and chemosensitivity of AML cells via upregulation of IL-6. It suggested that JMJD3 might be a potential therapy target for AML treatment.","['(c) 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4535-8236'],20200322,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*IL-6', '*JMJD3', '*proliferation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 May 31.,"Vincristine (VCR) is one of the most widely prescribed medications for treating solid tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adults. However, its major dose-limiting toxicity is peripheral neuropathy that can disrupt curative therapy. Peripheral neuropathy can also persist into adulthood, compromising quality of life of childhood cancer survivors. Reducing VCR-induced neurotoxicity without compromising its anticancer effects would be ideal. Here, we show that low expression of NHP2L1 is associated with increased sensitivity of primary leukemia cells to VCR, and that concomitant administration of VCR with inhibitors of NHP2L1 increases VCR cytotoxicity in leukemia cells, prolongs survival of ALL xenograft mice, but decreases VCR effects on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and mitigates neurotoxicity in mice. These findings offer a strategy for increasing VCR's antileukemic effects while reducing peripheral neuropathy in patients treated with this widely prescribed medication.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 31.,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring by PCR methods is a strong and standardized predictor of clinical outcome in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). However, about 20% of MCL and 40% of FL patients lack a reliable molecular marker, being thus not eligible for MRD studies. Recently, targeted locus amplification (TLA), a next-generation sequencing (NGS) method based on the physical proximity of DNA sequences for target selection, identified novel gene rearrangements in leukemia. The aim of this study was to test TLA in MCL and FL diagnostic samples lacking a classical, PCR-detectable, t(11; 14) MTC (BCL1/IGH), or t(14; 18) major breakpoint region and minor cluster region (BCL2/IGH) rearrangements. Overall, TLA was performed on 20 MCL bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) primary samples and on 20 FL BM, identifying a novel BCL1 or BCL2/IGH breakpoint in 16 MCL and 8 FL patients (80% and 40%, respectively). These new breakpoints (named BCL1-TLA and BCL2-TLA) were validated by ASO primers design and compared as MRD markers to classical IGH rearrangements in eight MCL: overall, MRD results by BCL1-TLA were superimposable (R Pearson = 0.76) to the standardized IGH-based approach. Moreover, MRD by BCL2-TLA reached good sensitivity levels also in FL and was predictive of a primary refractory case. In conclusion, this study offers the proof of principle that TLA is a promising and reliable NGS-based technology for the identification of novel molecular markers, suitable for further MRD analysis in previously not traceable MCL and FL patients.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The study of this oncogenic virus is significant from two different aspects. First, HTLV-1 can be considered as a neglected public health problem, which may spread slowly worldwide. Second, the incidence of HTLV-1 associated diseases due to oncogenic effects and deterioration of the immune system towards autoimmune diseases are not fully understood. Furthermore, knowledge about viral routes of transmission is important for considering potential interventions, treatments or vaccines in endemic regions. In this review, novel characteristics of HTLV-1, such as the unusual infectivity of virions through the virological synapse, are discussed in the context of the HTLV-1 associated diseases (ATL and HAM/TSP).",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9050-9016', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8408-4664', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6814-5992']",20210319,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)', '*adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma', '*human T lymphotropic virus type-1', '*immunological synapse', '*virus-host molecular interactions']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"Disease relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for high-risk acute leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Comprehensive data on outcomes after post-transplant relapse are lacking, especially in pediatric patients. Our objective was to assess the impact of various transplant-, patient-, and disease-related variables on survival and outcomes in patients who relapse after alloHCT. We describe our institutional experience with 221 pediatric patients who experienced disease relapse after their first alloHCT for acute leukemias or MDS between 1990 and 2018. In a multivariable model, being in first complete remission at first alloHCT, longer duration of remission after alloHCT, experiencing GVHD and receiving a transplant in a more recent time period were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a second alloHCT after post-transplant relapse. Of these variables, only longer interval from alloHCT to relapse, receiving a second alloHCT or DLI, and receiving a transplant in a more recent time period were associated with improved overall survival. Our data support pursuing second alloHCT for patients who have experienced relapse after their first transplant, as that remains the only salvage modality with a reasonable chance of inducing long-term remission.","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is the only human lipogenic enzyme available for de novo fatty acid synthesis and is often highly expressed in cancer cells. We found that FASN mRNA levels were significantly higher in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than in healthy granulocytes or CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. Accordingly, FASN levels decreased during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated granulocytic differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, partially via autophagic degradation. Furthermore, our data suggest that inhibition of FASN expression levels using RNAi or (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) accelerated the differentiation of APL cell lines and significantly re-sensitized ATRA refractory non-APL AML cells. FASN reduction promoted translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) to the nucleus, paralleled by activation of CLEAR network genes and lysosomal biogenesis. Together, our data demonstrate that inhibition of FASN expression in combination with ATRA treatment facilitates granulocytic differentiation of APL cells and may extend differentiation therapy to non-APL AML cells.",['(c) 2021.

In gliomas, GLIPR1 promotes the migration and invasion of glioma cells by interaction with the actin polymerization regulator Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and then abolishes the negative effects of Heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein K (hnRNPK). In prostate cancers, high levels of GLIPR1 induce apoptosis and destruction of oncoproteins. In lung cancers, overexpression of GLIPR1 inhibits the growth of lung cancer cells partially through inhibiting the V-ErbB avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog3 (ErbB3) pathway. However, the mechanisms that GLIPR1 performs its function in other tumors still remain unclear. The tumor suppressing role of GLIPR1 has been explored to the cancer treatment. The adenoviral vector-mediated Glipr1 (AdGlipr1) gene therapy and the GLIPR1-transmembrane domain deleted (GLIPR1-DeltaTM) protein therapy both showed antitumor activities and stimulated immune response in prostate cancers. Whether GLPIR1 can be used to treat other tumors is an important topic to be explored. Among which, whether GLPIR1 can be used to treat lung cancer by atomizing inhalation is the key topic we care about. If it does, this therapy has a wide application prospect and is a great progression in lung cancer treatment.",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6398-0355', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6505-4822', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7721-7326', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9716-0195']",20210319,,,,"['11JDG063/Advanced Talents Foundation of Jiangsu University | Senior Talent', 'Foundation of Jiangsu University (Jiangsu University Senior Talent Foundation)', 'BK20191429/Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mechanical removal of leukaemic cells in hyperleukocytosis. However, the effectiveness of leukapheresis remains unclear due to selection and confounding factors in the cohorts. We compared the effectiveness of leukapheresis among the subgroups according to either the 2016 World Health Organization classification or the number of cytogenetic abnormalities with a retrospective, single-centre study from January 2009 to December 2018. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 212) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, n = 97) were included. The 30-day survival rates (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) for AML and ALL were 86.3% (81.6-90.9%) and 94.8% (90.3-99.2%), respectively. For AML, 'primary AML with myelodysplasia-related changes' and 'AML with biallelic mutation of CEBPA' showed better 30-day survival outcomes (P = 0.026) than the other subgroups. A higher platelet count after leukapheresis was associated with better 30-day survival in AML patients (P = 0.029). A decrease in blast percentage count after leukapheresis was associated with better 30-day survival in ALL patients (P = 0.034). Our study suggested that prophylactic platelet transfusion to raise the platelet count to 50 x 10(9)/L or greater might improve clinical outcome in AML patients undergoing leukapheresis.",,,20210319,PMC7979875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The precise regulation of PU.1 expression is crucial for the development of AML, and the discovery of circular RNAs (circRNAs) can add a new layer of information on regulation. Here, we found that circSPI1, the circular RNA derived from the SPI1 gene, is highly expressed in AML but not in normal counterparts. Unlike SPI1, a tumor suppressor and being lowly expressed in AML, we demonstrate that circSPI1 acts as an oncogene, evidenced by the observation that circSPI1 knockdown induces myeloid differentiation and apoptosis of AML cells. We provide mechanistic evidence for multiple regulatory roles of circSPI1 in AML progression. On one hand, circSPI1 contributes to myeloid differentiation of AML cells by interacting with the translation initiation factor eIF4AIII to antagonize PU.1 expression at the translation level. On the other hand, circSPI1 contributes to proliferation and apoptosis by interacting with miR-1307-3p, miR-382-5p, and miR-767-5p; this role is uncoupled with SPI1. Finally, we illustrate the clinical significance of circSPI1 by showing that circSPI1-regulated genes are associated with the clinical outcome of AML patients.

Ex vivo activated and/or expanded NK cells demonstrate cytotoxicity against various tumor cells and are promising therapeutics for adoptive cancer immunotherapy. Genetic modification can further enhance NK effector cell activity or activation sensitization. Here, we evaluated the effect of the genetic deletion of ubiquitin ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma pro-oncogene-b (CBLB), a negative regulator of lymphocyte activity, on placental CD34(+) cell-derived NK (PNK) cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells. METHODS: Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, CBLB was knocked out in placenta-derived CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells, followed by differentiation into PNK cells. Cell expansion, phenotype and cytotoxicity against tumor cells were characterized in vitro. The antitumor efficacy of CBLB knockout (KO) PNK cells was tested in an acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60) tumor model in NOD-scid IL2R gamma(null) (NSG) mice. PNK cell persistence, biodistribution, proliferation, phenotype and antitumor activity were evaluated. RESULTS: 94% of CBLB KO efficacy was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. CBLB KO placental CD34(+) cells differentiated into PNK cells with high cell yield and >90% purity determined by CD56(+) CD3(-) cell identity. Ablation of CBLB did not impact cell proliferation, NK cell differentiation or phenotypical characteristics of PNK cells. When compared with the unmodified PNK control, CBLB KO PNK cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity against a range of liquid and solid tumor cell lines in vitro. On infusion into busulfan-conditioned NSG mice, CBLB KO PNK cells showed in vivo proliferation and maturation as evidenced by increased expression of CD16, killer Ig-like receptors and NKG2A over 3 weeks. Additionally, CBLB KO PNK cells showed greater antitumor activity in a disseminated HL60-luciferase mouse model compared with unmodified PNK cells. CONCLUSION: CBLB ablation increased PNK cell effector function and proliferative capacity compared with non-modified PNK cells. These data suggest that targeting CBLB may offer therapeutic advantages via enhancing antitumor activities of NK cell therapies.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"Ewing sarcomas are driven by EWS-ETS fusions, most commonly EWS-FLI1, which promotes widespread metabolic reprogramming, including activation of serine biosynthesis. We previously reported that serine biosynthesis is also activated in Ewing sarcoma by the scaffolding protein menin through as yet undefined mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether EWS-FLI1 and/or menin orchestrate serine biosynthesis via modulation of ATF4, a stress-response gene that acts as a master transcriptional regulator of serine biosynthesis in other tumors. Our results show that in Ewing sarcoma, ATF4 levels are high and that ATF4 modulates transcription of core serine synthesis pathway (SSP) genes. Inhibition of either EWS-FLI1 or menin leads to loss of ATF4, and this is associated with diminished expression of SSP transcripts and proteins. We identified and validated an EWS-FLI1 binding site at the ATF4 promoter, indicating that the fusion can directly activate ATF4 transcription. In contrast, our results suggest that menin-dependent regulation of ATF4 is mediated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Importantly, our data also reveal that the downregulation of SSP genes that occurs in the context of EWS-FLI1 or menin loss is indicative of broader inhibition of ATF4-dependent transcription. Moreover, we find that menin inhibition similarly leads to loss of ATF4 and the ATF4-dependent transcriptional signature in MLL-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, extending our findings to another cancer in which menin serves an oncogenic role. IMPLICATIONS: These studies provide new insights into metabolic reprogramming in Ewing sarcoma and also uncover a previously undescribed role for menin in the regulation of ATF4.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3033-1938', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3551-4429', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0003-4513', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2288-2174', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1641-2045', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1977-1000', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9309-6141']",20210319,PMC8462528,,,"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA254079/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA248160/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K00 CA234810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA218116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA237421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA200660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA244931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS1686434'],"['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT04067336', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT04065399']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, many novel therapies fail to be adequately evaluated due to low recruitment rates, which slows patient access to emerging treatments. Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), we sought to identify potential patient barriers and enablers to participating in an early phase CAR-T cell therapy trial. DESIGN: We used qualitative semistructured interviews to identify potential barriers and enablers to patients' hypothetical participation in an early phase CAR-T cell therapy trial. We used the TDF and directed content analysis to identify relevant domains based on frequency, relevance and the presence of conflicting beliefs. PARTICIPANTS: Canadian adult patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies. RESULTS: In total, we interviewed 13 participants (8 women, 5 men). Participants ranged in age from 18 to 73 (median=56) and had been living with haematological cancer from a few months to several years. We found participants were unfamiliar with CAR-T cell therapy but wished to know more about treatment safety, efficacy and trial logistics (domains: knowledge, beliefs about consequences). They were motivated by altruistic considerations, though many prioritised personal health benefits despite recognising the goals (ie, establishing safety) of early phase clinical trials (domains: goals, intentions). Every participant valued receiving medical advice from their haematologists and oncologists, though some preferred impartial medical experts to inform their decision making (domain: social influences). Finally, participants indicated that improving access to financial and social supports would improve their trial participation experience (domain: environmental context and resources). CONCLUSION: Using the TDF allowed us to identify factors that might undermine participation to a CAR-T cell therapy trial and to optimise recruitment processes by considering patient perspectives to taking part in early phase trials.Trial regestration: NCT03765177; Pre-results.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 23.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, endemic in North American dairy herds, has production-limiting effects. A literature review of available papers published since 1995 concerning BLV transmission and its control was conducted. Although confirmed transmission routes were reviewed (blood, natural breeding, in utero, colostrum, and milk), there is still a lack of detailed information on other specific risks for transmission (e.g., contact transmission and hoof-trimming knives). Eradication of BLV has been achieved by combined management, segregation, and culling approaches. In contrast, although sole implementation of best management practices aimed at prevention of BLV transmission has decreased within-herd BLV prevalence, it has not eradicated BLV from a herd. Therefore, control and eradication of BLV by best management practices only should be further investigated. Additionally, the role of proviral load in infected cattle was investigated. Cattle with a high proviral load seem to be more likely to infect others, whereas those with a very low proviral load seem to have low risks of transmitting BLV. Information on proviral load could be taken into account when controlling BLV in high-prevalence herds. In conclusion, there is a need for detailed, large-scale studies investigating roles of specific transmission routes, knowing proviral load of infected individuals.","['The Authors.

Accumulating evidence indicates that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the most abundant stromal cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), play a crucial role in cancer progression and response to chemotherapy. To Figure out the role of leukemia-associated fibroblasts (LAFs) in relapsed/refractory leukemia, we constructed the first leukemia-associated fibroblastic tumor cell line, HXWMF-1. METHODS: A cell culture technique was used to establish the leukemia-associated fibroblastic tumor cell line. Molecular and cellular biological techniques including flow cytometry, MTT assay, western blotting, and short tandem repeat (STR) analysis were used to characterize the cell line. Nude mice were used for xenograft studies. RESULTS: We established a LAFs derived tumor cell line HXWMF-1, originated from the subcutaneous xenografts of HXEX-ALL1, a cell line originated from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the second relapse. The HXWMF-1 cell line was authenticated as a tumor cell line and being derived from CAFs based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and STR analyses and tumorigenicity test in nude mice. To clarify the reliability of the method, we got the LAFs derived tumor cells from three different tumor mass of HXEX-ALL1 xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, HXWMF-1 is the first fibroblastic tumor cell line derived from LAFs or CAFs. In addition, the cell line provided firm evidence for that leukemia cells may induce LAFs/CAFs malignant transformation, which may help to develop brand new theory and therapeutic strategies for patients with relapsed /refractory ALL.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2410-1696'],20210319,PMC7977166,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts', 'Cell line', 'Leukemic environment']","['2021YFH0062/Sichuan Science and Technology Program of China', 'SCU2019C4005/Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) could predict relapse in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the prognostic role of WT1 in pediatric AML after allo-HSCT is unclear. Thus, we determined to see whether sequential monitoring of WT1 after allo-HSCT could predict relapse in AML children. METHODS: Pediatric AML patients receiving allo-HSCT from January 21, 2012 to December 20, 2018 at the Peking University Institute of Hematology were included in this study. WT1 expression level was determined by TaqMan-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. WT1 sequential monitoring was performed 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 9, and 12 months post-transplantation and at 6-month intervals thereafter. The primary end point was relapse. The secondary end points included disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for DFS and OS estimates, while competing risk analysis was used for estimating relapse and NRM. RESULTS: Of the 151 consecutive patients included, the median age was 10 years (range, 1-17). The optimal cutoff value of WT1 within 1 year after allo-HSCT to predict relapse was 0.8% (80 WT1 copies/10(4) ABL copies), with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 79%. Compared with WT1 expression < 0.8%, WT1 expression >/=0.8% indicated significantly higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 35.1% vs. 11.3%; P = 0.001), lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS, 60.4% vs. 80.8%; P = 0.009), and lower 5-year overall survival (OS, 64.9% vs. 81.6%; P = 0.038) rates. Multivariate analyses showed that WT1 was an independent risk factor for relapse (HR 2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-6.71; P = 0.014). Both the CIR (5-year CIR: 8.3% vs. 11.3%; P = 0.513) and DFS (5-year DFS: 91.7% vs. 80.8%; P = 0.208) were comparable between patients achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity after preemptive interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment and those without MRD after allo-HSCT, which were better than those of MRD-positive patients without preemptive therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential monitoring of WT1 could predict relapse in pediatric AML after allo-HSCT. WT1-directed immunotherapy may have the potential to prevent relapse and improve survival.",,,20210319,PMC7980537,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Pediatric', 'Relapse', ""Wilms' tumor gene 1""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 6.,"Methotrexate, as a folate antagonist, is one of the first anti-neoplasm drugs offered and is still used as an effective drug in the treatment of various malignancies. Methotrexate has a narrow treatment index and is associated with numerous side effects.In thisresearch, for the first time a double-solvent supramolecular system (DSS) was developed as an extractant without disperser solvent for dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME). DSS - DLLME was applied to the extraction of methotrexate in plasma of children with acute leukemiaprior to itsdetermination by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC - UV). In the present method, two long normal chain alcohols are mixed in a particular ratio, and then it is injected into the sample solution, which is on the magnetic stirrer. In this case, the mixture of the two alcohol changes to new supramolecular aggregate. This new supermolecule is used as an extractant, which has a higher extraction power than any of its components alone. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration graph was linear in the rage of 0.1-150 microg L(-1) with detection limit of 0.03 microg L(-1). Relative standard deviations (RSDs) including intra-day and inter-day of method based on7 replicate determinations of 100.0 microg L(-1)of methotrexate were 2.6% and 4.8%,respectively. The results proved that DSS - DLLME is a sensitive, very simple, inexpensive, environmental friendly, rapid and efficient method for the preconcentration of trace amount of drugs in biological samples.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2021 Mar 11.,"Epidemiological surveys that investigate infectious diseases such as enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) are important. Furthermore, estimating the prevalence of such infectious diseases and associated factors is key to assess the disease impact and design control programs. In this study, we identified a high herd-level seroprevalence of EBL in cattle from the semi-arid Paraiba state, Northeast Region of Brazil, using a planned cross-sectional survey. Herd-level and animal-level prevalence were estimated using a two-stage random sampling survey. In total, 2067 cows aged >/=24 months from 400 herds were sampled. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect specific antibodies directed to the bovine leukosis virus gp51 antigen in both individual and pooled sera. The herd-level and animal-level prevalence was 23.4 % (95 % CI = 19.2-28.1 %) and 10.8 % (95 % CI = 7.5 %-15.3 %), respectively. There were no significant clusters of positive herds (within a radius of 2 km). The factors associated with herd-level prevalence were the exclusive use of hand milking (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.88), herd size (PR = 1.005), artificial insemination (PR = 2.03), purchase of animals in the previous year (PR = 1.87), and peri-urban farms (PR = 2.09). Prevention measures should be applied at the herd-level, particularly for farms located in peri-urban areas, focusing on good hygiene in hand milking, robust practices and standards for artificial insemination, and serological testing of animals prior to purchase.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Using an original proteogenomic approach, we analyzed the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I)-associated immunopeptidome of 19 primary AML samples and identified 58 tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). These TSAs bore no mutations and derived mainly (86%) from supposedly non-coding genomic regions. Two AML-specific aberrations were instrumental in the biogenesis of TSAs, intron retention, and epigenetic changes. Indeed, 48% of TSAs resulted from intron retention and translation, and their RNA expression correlated with mutations of epigenetic modifiers (e.g., DNMT3A). AML TSA-coding transcripts were highly shared among patients and were expressed in both blasts and leukemic stem cells. In AML patients, the predicted number of TSAs correlated with spontaneous expansion of cognate T cell receptor clonotypes, accumulation of activated cytotoxic T cells, immunoediting, and improved survival.

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) utilization and emergency admissions by patients with cancer have increased. The authors aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with cancer admitted through the ED and determine whether cancer types are related to in-hospital mortality. METHODS: The National Emergency Department Information System database of patients visiting EDs in South Korea between 2016 and 2017 was analyzed. Among 6,179,088 adult patients who presented to an ED with nontraumatic medical illness, patients with cancer were identified. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Patients with cancer accounted for 6.8% of ED visits, and 239,630 patients (57.0%) were admitted to the hospital (intensive care unit [ICU], 9.5%; others, 90.5%). The prevalent cancers requiring hospitalization were lung cancer (15.7%), liver cancer (14.2%), and colon cancer (11.6%). The commonest reasons for admission other than cancer-related medical problems (41.4%) were pneumonia (4.8%) and hepatobiliary infection (2.8%). Overall in-hospital mortality was 16.1% (ICU, 28.3%; general wards, 14.8%); lung cancer (22.9%), liver cancer (19.7%), and leukemia/multiple myeloma (17.8%) showed the highest mortality rates. The highest odds for mortality were for lung cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.227; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.124-2.335; P < .001) and liver cancer (adjusted OR, 1.839; 95% CI, 1.751-1.930; P < .001), which were referenced to genitourinary cancer by multivariable logistic regression analysis.

The combination of inotuzumab with low-intensity mini-hyper-CVD (mini-hyper-CVD; cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, cytarabine at 0.5 g/m(2) x 4 doses) chemotherapy has shown encouraging results. The sequential addition of blinatumomab might improve outcome in patients with R/R ALL. METHODS: We used lower intensity chemotherapy, mini-hyper-CVD (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, cytarabine at 0.5 g/m(2) x 4 doses) compared to conventional hyper-CVAD. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients with a median age of 37 years (range, 18-87 years) were treated. Overall, 77 patients (80%) responded, 55 (57%) of whom achieved complete response. The overall measurable residual disease negativity rate among responders was 83%. Forty-four (46%) patients underwent later allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Veno-occlusive disease of any grade occurred in 10 (10%) patients. The rates were 13% with the original schedule and 3% with the use of lower-dose inotuzumab and sequential blinatumomab. With a median follow-up of 36 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 13.4 months, with 3-year OS rates of 33%. The 3-year OS rate for patients with CD22 expression >/=70% and without adverse cytogenetics (KMT2A rearrangements, low hypodiploidy/near triploidy) was 55%.

Standard treatment protocols incorporate a preconditioning regimen of lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR T-cell infusion. However, the connection between preconditioning regimens and patient outcomes is still not fully understood. Optimizing patient preconditioning plans and reducing the CAR T-cell dose necessary for achieving remission could make therapy safer. In this paper, we test treatment regimens consisting of sequential administration of chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy on a system of differential equations that models the tumor-immune interaction. We use numerical simulations of treatment plans from within the scope of current medical practice to assess the effect of preconditioning plans on the success of CAR T-cell therapy. Model results affirm clinical observations that preconditioning can be crucial for most patients, not just to reduce side effects, but to even achieve remission at all. We demonstrate that preconditioning plans using the same CAR T-cell dose and the same total concentration of chemotherapy can lead to different patient outcomes due to different delivery schedules. Results from sensitivity analysis of the model parameters suggest that making small improvements in the effectiveness of CAR T-cells in attacking cancer cells will significantly reduce the minimum dose required for successful treatment. Our modeling framework represents a starting point for evaluating the efficacy of patient preconditioning in the context of CAR T-cell therapy.",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2761-825X'],20210319,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells', '*Combination treatment', '*ODE model', '*Preconditioning', '*Tumor-immune interaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: AALL0331 enrolled 5,377 patients with National Cancer Institute standard-risk B-ALL (age 1-9 years, WBC < 50,000/muL) between 2005 and 2010. Following a common three-drug induction, a cohort of 1,857 eligible patients participated in the low-risk ALL random assignment. Low-risk criteria included no extramedullary disease, < 5% marrow blasts by day 15, end-induction marrow minimal residual disease < 0.1%, and favorable cytogenetics (ETV6-RUNX1 fusion or simultaneous trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17). Random assignment was to standard COG low-intensity therapy (including two pegaspargase doses, one each during induction and delayed intensification) with or without four additional pegaspargase doses at 3-week intervals during consolidation and interim maintenance. The study was powered to detect a 4% improvement in 6-year CCR rate from 92% to 96%. RESULTS: The 6-year CCR and overall survival (OS) rates for the entire low-risk cohort were 94.7% +/- 0.6% and 98.7% +/- 0.3%, respectively. The CCR rates were similar between arms (intensified pegaspargase 95.3% +/- 0.8% v standard 94.0% +/- 0.8%; P = .13) with no difference in OS (98.1% +/- 0.5% v 99.2% +/- 0.3%; P = .99). Compared to a subset of standard-risk study patients given identical therapy who had the same early response characteristics but did not have favorable or unfavorable cytogenetics, outcomes were significantly superior for low-risk patients (CCR hazard ratio 1.95; P = .0004; OS hazard ratio 5.42; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Standard COG therapy without intensified pegaspargase, which can easily be given as an outpatient with limited toxicity, cures nearly all children with B-ALL identified as low-risk by clinical, early response, and favorable cytogenetic criteria.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8409-0589', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1099-3478', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3711-9529', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9844-730X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6857-396X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6029-1538', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4099-4700', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7414-3969', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5492-3957', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6636-3870']",20210319,PMC8274747,,,"['U24 CA196173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['2022/05/10 00:00'],"['Leonard A.

Besides, CLL/SLL encompasses an increased risk of developing other secondary cancers, including a variety of T-cell lymphomas, often of the anaplastic large-cell type or with a cytotoxic phenotype. Here, we report a small series of patients with composite lymphomas consisting of CLL/SLL and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), a hitherto unrecognized association. The 3 patients (1 male/2 females, 68 to 83 y) presented with high-grade-type symptoms. One patient was clinically suspicious for Richter syndrome, in the others CLL/SLL and AITL were concomitant de novo diagnoses. CLL/SLL and AITL were admixed in the same lymph nodes (3/3 cases) and in the bone marrow (1/2 cases). In all cases, the AITL comprised prominent clear cells with a strong T follicular helper immunophenotype and similar mutations consisting of TET2 or DNMT3A alterations, IDH2 R172K/M, and RHOA G17V. The 3 patients received chemotherapy. One died of early AITL relapse. The other 2 remained in complete remission of AITL, 1 died with recurrent CLL, and 1 of acute myeloid leukemia. These observations expand the spectrum of T-cell lymphoma entities that occur in association with CLL/SLL, adding AITL to the rare variants of aggressive neoplasms manifesting as Richter syndrome. Given that disturbances of T-cell homeostasis in CLL/SLL affect not only cytotoxic but also helper T-cell subsets, these may contribute to the emergence of neoplasms of T follicular helper derivation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"BACKGROUND: The use of haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) with posttransplantation cyclophosphamide prophylaxis is gaining traction in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: The Acute Leukemia Working Party/European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry was used to evaluate the outcomes of adult patients with ALL who underwent haplo-HCT during 2011 through 2015 and compared them with the outcomes of those who underwent transplantation during 2016 through 2018. RESULTS: The analysis consisted of 195 patients, including 79 who underwent transplantation during 2011 through 2015 and 116 who underwent transplantation during 2016 through 2018. Overall, the 2-year leukemia-free survival and relapse incidence rates were 56.5% and 21%, respectively. The 100-day incidence of grade 2 through 4 acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) was 34.5%. The rates of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were 22.5% and 64.7%, respectively. Patients who underwent transplantation during 2016 through 2018 experienced improved rates of leukemia-free survival (64.9% vs 47.3%; P = .019) and OS (75.5% vs 53.5%; P = .006). Patients who underwent transplantation during 2016 through 2018 developed more grade 2 through 4 acute GVHD (42% vs 26.4%; P = .047). The incidence of relapse, GVHD-free/relapse-free survival, grade 3 and 4 acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and extensive chronic GVHD did not differ significantly between groups. In multivariate analysis, more recently transplanted patients had a significantly reduced risk of NRM (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.89; P = .022) and improved OS (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.86; P = .014). A comparable analysis of patients who had acute myeloid leukemia during the same timeframes did not reveal any statistically significant differences in any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of adult patients with ALL who receive posttransplant cyclophosphamide has improved over time, with an impressive 2-year OS of 75% and, most recently, an NRM rate of only 17%.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5294-3524'],20210319,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'graft-vs-host disease', 'haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'leukemia-free survival', 'relapse']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 22.9 and 44.5 months, respectively; performance status (PS) >/=2 and >/=3 previous lines of therapy were associated with shorter PFS and overall survival (OS). 48% of patients were on treatment at 12 months; the experience of the centers (>/=5 treated patients) and PS 0-1 were associated with a significantly longer treatment duration (p = 0.015 and p = 0.002, respectively). TP53 disruption had no prognostic significance. The overall response rate to subsequent treatment was 49.2%, with median OS of 15.5 months and not reached in patients who discontinued, respectively, for progression and for toxicity (p < 0.01). Treatment breaks >/=14 days were recorded in 96% of patients and adverse events mirrored those reported in trials. In conclusion, this real-life analysis showed that IR treatment duration was longer at experienced centers, that the ECOG PS and >/=3 lines of previous therapy are strong prognostic factor and that the overall outcome with this regimen was superimposable to that reported in a randomized trial.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 29 patients with primary AML and 30 healthy controls were collected. CD33, CD11b, HLA-DR, CD14, and CD15 were used to label cells, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the numbers of total MDSC and subgroups eMDSC (early-stage MDSC), M-MDSC (monocytic MDSCs), PMN-MDSC (polymorphonuclear-MDSCs) or G-MDSC (granulocytic-MDSC) via two gating strategies. Presence of MDSC in AML was determined after assessment of clinical data. RESULTS: Phenotypic analysis of MDSC by the two gating strategies was consistent. Compared with healthy controls, the numbers of total MDSC (CD33+CD11b+ HLA-DR-) and G-MDSC (CD33+CD11b+ HLA-DR-CD14 not-CD15+ or CD14 not-CD15+ CD11b+) in peripheral blood of AML patients were lower (p < 0.05), while numbers of M-MDSC (CD33+CD11b+ HLA-DR-CD14+CD15- or HLA-DR-/LOWCD14+) and eMDSC (CD33+CD11b+ HLA-DR-/LOWCD14-CD15-) were higher (p < 0.05). The levels of G-MDSC in peripheral blood of AML-M2 patients were higher than those in other subtypes, along with total MDSC, while the levels of eMDSC and M-MDSC in AML-M3 patients were higher than those in other subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of HLA-DR-/LOWCD14+M-MDSC and CD33+CD11b+ HLA-DR-/LOWCD14-CD15- eMDSC in peripheral blood of AML patients indicates potential for MDSC as a diagnostic index in AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 5.,"Drug resistance is a significant obstacle to effective cancer treatment. Drug resistance develops from initially reversible drug-tolerant cancer cells, which offer therapeutic opportunities to impede cancer relapse. The mechanisms of resistance to proteasome inhibitor (PI) therapy have been investigated intensively, however the ways by which drug-tolerant cancer cells orchestrate their adaptive responses to drug challenges remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cyclin A1 suppression elicited the development of transient PI tolerance in mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) cells. This adaptive process involved reversible downregulation of cyclin A1, which promoted PI resistance through cell-cycle arrest. PI-tolerant MLL cells acquired cyclin A1 dependency, regulated directly by MLL protein. Loss of cyclin A1 function resulted in the emergence of drug tolerance, which was associated with patient relapse and reduced survival. Combination treatment with PI and deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) inhibitors overcame this drug resistance by restoring cyclin A1 expression through chromatin crosstalk between histone H2B monoubiquitination and MLL-mediated histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. These results reveal the importance of cyclin A1-engaged cell-cycle regulation in PI resistance in MLL cells, and suggest that cell-cycle re-entry by DUB inhibitors may represent a promising epigenetic therapeutic strategy to prevent acquired drug resistance.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive malignancy of the bone marrow that has a poor prognosis with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, especially in elderly patients. In recent years, small molecule inhibitors targeting AML-associated IDH1, IDH2, and FLT3 mutations have been FDA approved. However, the majority of AML cases do not have a targetable mutation. A variety of novel agents targeting both previously untargetable mutations and general pathways in AML are currently being investigated. Herein, we review selected new targeted therapies currently in early-phase clinical investigation in AML. RECENT FINDINGS: The DOT1L inhibitor pinometostat in KMT2A-rearranged AML, the menin inhibitors KO-539 and SYNDX-5613 in KMT2Ar and NPM1-mutated AML, and the mutant TP53 inhibitor APR-246 are examples of novel agents targeting specific mutations in AML. In addition, BET inhibitors, polo-like kinase inhibitors, and MDM2 inhibitors are promising new drug classes for AML which do not depend on the presence of a particular mutation. AML remains in incurable disease for many patients but advances in genomics, epigenetics, and drug discovery have led to the development of many potential novel therapeutic agents, many of which are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Additional studies will be necessary to determine how best to incorporate these novel agents into routine clinical treatment of AML.",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3495-5932'],20210318,PMC8515252,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Bromodomain inhibitors', '*DOT1L', '*MDM2 inhibitors', '*Menin inhibitors', '*Polo-like kinase inhibitors', '*Targeted therapy']",['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['2022/04/01 00:00'],,['NIHMS1701097'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the effectiveness of arsenic compounds has been recognized and applied clinically, some patients are still found resistant to this chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated that a synthetic thyroid hormone analog (TA), 2-iodo-4-nitro-1-(o-tolyloxy) benzene, had a strong apoptosis effect on U937 cells. U937 cells were treated with TA, and examinted the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), dysfunction of mitochondria, expression of pro-apoptosis and anti-apoptosis, and cleavage of caspase-3 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Further, it is also evaluated that insight molecular mechanism and signaling pathways involved in the study. It is found that TA significantly induced apoptosis in U937 cells through production of ROS, dysfunction of mitochondria, and activation of caspase cascade. It was also observed that MAPK signaling pathway including ERK, JNK, and P38 signals are involved in the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, marked activation of autophagy and ER stress markers such as LC3, P62, Beclin1 and GRP78, CHOP were observed, respectively. Pretreatment with ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) have successfully attenuated and aggravated TA-induced apoptosis, respectively. We further confirmed the active involvement of ER stress and autophagy signals. In conclusion, TA induced apoptosis through ER stress and activation of autophagy, and the latter is not conducive to TA-induced cell death.

In addition, the risk of leukemia is high, and once it develops, the course of acute leukemia is short with poor curative effect. Animal models are powerful tools for studying human diseases and are highly effective preclinical platforms. Animal models of MDS can accurately show genetic aberrations and hematopoietic clone phenotypes with similar cellular features (such as impaired differentiation and increased apoptosis), and symptoms can be used to assess existing treatments. Animal models are also helpful for understanding the pathogenesis of MDS and its relationship with acute leukemia, which helps with the identification of candidate genes related to the MDS phenotype.

The bis[pyrrolyl Ru(ii)] triads absorbed strongly throughout the visible region, with several members having molar extinction coefficients (epsilon) >/= 10(4) at 600-620 nm and longer. Phosphorescence quantum yields (Phi p) were generally less than 0.1% and in some cases undetectable. The singlet oxygen quantum yields (Phi Delta) ranged from 5% to 77% and generally correlated with their photocytotoxicities toward human leukemia (HL-60) cells regardless of the wavelength of light used. Dark cytotoxicities varied ten-fold, with EC50 values in the range of 10-100 muM and phototherapeutic indices (PIs) as large as 5400 and 260 with broadband visible (28 J cm(-2), 7.8 mW cm(-2)) and 625 nm red (100 J cm(-2), 42 mW cm(-2)) light, respectively. The bis[pyrrolyl Ru(ii)] triad with a pyrenyl linker (5h) was especially potent, with an EC50 value of 1 nM and PI > 27 000 with visible light and subnanomolar activity with 625 nm light (100 J cm(-2), 28 mW cm(-2)). The lead compound 5h was also tested in a tumor spheroid assay using the HL60 cell line and exhibited greater photocytotoxicity in this more resistant model (EC50 = 60 nM and PI > 1200 with 625 nm light) despite a lower dark cytotoxicity. The in vitro PDT effects of 5h extended to bacteria, where submicromolar EC50 values and PIs >300 against S. mutans and S. aureus were obtained with visible light. This activity was attenuated with 625 nm red light, but PIs were still near 50. The ligand-localized (3)pipi* state contributed by the pyrenyl linker of 5h likely plays a key role in its phototoxic effects toward cancer cells and bacteria.",['This journal is (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9190-4552', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1841-8435', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4778-0687', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0978-0894', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4231-3446', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8028-5055']",20201006,PMC7953431,,,['R01 CA222227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2'-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Selective SIRT1/2 inhibitors have potential application in the chemotherapy of colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, and myelogenous leukemia. Here we identified novel SIRT1 inhibitors with the scaffold of 5-benzylidene-2-phenyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione. The most potent inhibitor 12n displayed an IC50 of 460 nM and a selectivity for SIRT1 over SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 of 113.5-, 254.3-, and 10.83-fold, respectively. It did not affect the activity of SIRT6. To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism, we determined the inhibition type of the inhibitor by enzyme kinetic analysis, showing that the inhibitor was competitive to the acetyl peptide and noncompetitive to NAD(+). Further, the interaction of the inhibitor in SIRT1 was studied by using molecular docking, which was validated by the structure-activity relationship analysis of the inhibitors and the site-directed mutagenesis of SIRT1. Consistent with the in vitro assays, the inhibitors increased the acetylation level of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner in cells.",['(c) 2021 American Chemical Society.'],,20210301,PMC7957943,,,,['2022/03/11 00:00'],['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The long-term survival of 90 newly-diagnosed APL patients (age range 12-75 years) was retrospectively analyzed.The FLT3-ITD mutation rate was assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing analysis. Its impact on the treatment response, event-free survival(EFS), or overall survival(OS) was investigated in patients with and without the mutations. Results: The FLT3-ITD mutation rate in newly-diagnosed APL patients was 20% (18/90). The white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis in patients with mutations was significantly higher than that in patients without mutations while the FLT3-ITD mutation rate was higher in the high-risk group than in the low/intermediate-risk group. Patients with mutations had a significantly higher early death (ED) rate (16.67% vs 1.39%) for those lacking the mutation (P =0.024). However, the complete remission (CR) and differentiation syndrome (DS) rates in the two groups were similar. Kaplan Meier analysis for EFS and OS at five years showed a significant difference between the patients stratified by FLT3-ITD mutation status (log-rank P =0.010 and P =0.009, respectively). Conclusion: FLT3-ITD mutations can be related to high peripheral WBC counts in APL patients. APL patients with mutations displayed a higher ED rate compared to those without mutations. Patients carrying mutations had reduced five-year EFS and OS rates. Thus, reducing the overall death rate during induction treatment might be an effective way to improve the prognosis of patients with FLT3-ITD mutations.",['(c) 2021 Song et al.'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-6087-9198'],20210312,PMC7965687,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'FLT3-ITD', 'ITD', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'internal tandem duplication', 'prognosis', 'survival']",,,['All authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eosinophilic cardiovascular toxicity mostly consists of endomyocardial damage or eosinophilic vasculitis, while reported cases of venous thrombosis (VT) are scarce. We aimed to report on the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with unexplained VT and eosinophilia, and to identify predictors of relapse. This retrospective, multicenter, observational study included patients aged over 15 years with VT, concomitant blood eosinophilia >/= 1G/L and without any other moderate-to-strong contributing factors for VT. Fifty-four patients were included. VT was the initial manifestation of eosinophil-related disease in 29 (54%) patients and included pulmonary embolism (52%), deep venous thrombosis (37%), hepatic (11%) and portal vein (9%) thromboses. The median [IQR] absolute eosinophil count at VT onset was 3.3G/L [1.6-7.4]. Underlying eosinophil-related diseases included FIP1L1-PDGFRA-associated chronic myeloid neoplasm (n = 4), Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (n = 9), lymphocytic (n = 1) and idiopathic (n = 29) variants of hypereosinophilic syndrome. After a median [IQR] follow-up of 24 [10-62] months, 7 (13%) patients had a recurrence of VT. In multivariate analysis, persistent eosinophilia was the sole variable associated with a shorter time to VT relapse (HR 7.48; CI95% [1.94-29.47]; p = 0.015). Long-term normalization of eosinophil count could prevent the recurrence of VT in a subset of patients with unexplained VT and eosinophilia >/= 1G/L.",,,20210318,PMC7973521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although patient outcomes have improved, novel targeted therapies are needed to reduce the intensity of chemotherapy and improve the prognosis of high-risk patients. Using cell lines, primary cells and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we demonstrate that ALL cells viability is sensitive to NVP-BEP800, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Furthermore, we reveal that lymphocyte-specific SRC family kinases (SFK) are important clients of the HSP90 chaperone in ALL. When PDX mice are treated with NVP-BEP800, we found that there is a decrease in ALL progression. Together, these results demonstrate that the chaperoning of SFK by HSP90 is involved in the growth of ALL. These novel findings provide an alternative approach to target SRC kinases and could be used for the development of new treatment strategies for ALL.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1615-6769'],20210318,PMC7973815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CAR-T therapies face major hurdles such as the lack of tumor-specific antigen (TSA), and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment sometimes caused by the tumorous expression of immune checkpoints (ICPs) such as HLA-G. Indeed, HLA-G is remarkable because it is both a potent ICP and a TSA. HLA-G tumor expression causes immune escape by impairing innate and adaptive immune responses and by inducing a suppressive microenvironment. Yet, to date, no immunotherapy targets it. METHODS: We have developed two anti-HLA-G third-generation CARs based on new anti-HLA-G monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Anti-HLA-G CAR-T cells were specific for immunosuppressive HLA-G isoforms. HLA-G-activated CAR-T cells polarized toward T helper 1, and became cytotoxic against HLA-G(+) tumor cells. In vivo, anti-HLA-G CAR-T cells were able to control and eliminate HLA-G(+) tumor cells. The interaction of tumor-HLA-G with interleukin (IL)T2-expressing T cells is known to result in effector T cell functional inhibition, but anti-HLA-G CAR-T cells were insensitive to this inhibition and still exerted their function even when expressing ILT2. Lastly, we show that anti-HLA-G CAR-T cells differentiated into long-term memory effector cells, and seemed not to lose function even after repeated stimulation by HLA-G-expressing tumor cells. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that HLA-G, which is both a TSA and an ICP, constitutes a valid target for CAR-T cell therapy to specifically target and eliminate both tumor cells and HLA-G(+) suppressive cells.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials demonstrated that PARPi (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose]-ADP polymerase inhibitor) therapy is effective in solid tumors. However, long term effects such as therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) are poorly described. We sought to quantify whether PARPi therapy is associated with the development of MDS/AML. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched (inception to January 6, 2020) and phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that randomized patients with solid tumors to a PARPi or control therapy were included. The PRISMA guidelines were used to extract data independently by multiple authors. We extracted person-time and number of cases of MDS/AML in the PARPi and control arms of each study and pooled results with a random-effects Poisson regression model. The pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) for MDS/AML among patients randomized to PARPi therapy was compared to those randomized to a control. RESULTS: We identified 14 studies that included 5739 patients. Accounting for intra-study clustering, the risk of MDS/AML was similar in patients who were randomly assigned to receive PARPi compared to controls (IRR 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-2.26). In the front-line setting, PARPi therapy was associated with developing MDS/AML (IRR 5.43, 95% CI 1.51-19.60). Among patients treated for recurrence, however, the risk of MDS/AML appeared to be similar among patients randomized to PARPi or control treatment. Among studies that included only patients with a BRCA mutation, the risk of MDS/AML was similar in both treatment groups (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.45-1.53), but PARPi therapy was associated with MDS/AML in studies with an unrestricted population (IRR 2.43, 95% CI 1.17-5.06). CONCLUSION: The pooled overall effect was not statistically significant. However, treatment with PARPi was associated with a statistically significant increase in the incidence of MDS/AML among patients receiving front-line cancer therapy and those with limited prior exposure to chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2021 Mar 19.,"Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is considered to be one of the major limiting factors of assisted reproductive technology (ART) programme success. The current study focused on the investigation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), cytokines and cell adhesion molecules in peripheral blood (PB) and follicular fluid (FF) obtained from 44 women aged between 25 and 39 years old and undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These women were divided into two groups: 22 RIF women with embryo implantation failures after the transfer of at least four fresh or frozen-thawed good quality embryos in a minimum of three ICSI cycles, and 22 ICSI success women (controls) who achieved a clinical pregnancy at their first ICSI attempt. The PB and FF samples were obtained from each patient on the day of oocyte retrieval. MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, TIMP-1, -2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and intercellular adhesion molecules 1 (ICAM1) were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of PB and FF. Our results showed significant decreases in PB MMP-7 and PB VEGF in the RIF group compared with controls [281.11 (33-614) pg/ml vs 119.92 (27-441) pg/ml; P-value = 0.030] and [82.54 (25.94-210.20) pg/ml vs 30.93 (13.62-193.33) pg/ml; P-value = 0.022; respectively]. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed informative area under the curve values for PB MMP-7, as well as for PB VEGF, making them able to be proposed as biomarkers of the RIF. Therefore, circulating MMP-7 and VEGF seem to play an interesting role in embryo implantation in in vitro fertilization (IVF)/ICSI cycles and could be proposed as circulating biomarkers of the RIF. These results could be helpful for clinicians and patients to choose the best rescue strategy and treatment to minimize implantation failure in women undergoing IVF/ICSI procedures after the first attempt.",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3382-989X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5325-6347']",20210319,,['NOTNLM'],"['Assisted reproductive technology', 'Matrilysin', 'Matrix metalloproteinases', 'Recurrent implantation failure', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is an optimal target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that aim for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of ABL1. While these drugs have greatly improved the prognosis for CML, many patients ultimately fail treatment, some requiring multiple lines of TKI therapy. Mutations can occur in the ATP binding site of ABL1, causing resistance by preventing the binding of many of these drugs and leaving patients with limited treatment options. The approved TKIs are also associated with adverse effects that may lead to treatment discontinuation in some patients.

Up to 30 % of cancer deaths are due to tobacco smoking. 23,3 % of 18-64 year-old Germans are current smokers; in addition, 11 % of the population are regularly exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. Tobacco smoking is causally associated with oropharyngeal, laryngeal, nose, paranasal sinus, lung, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular, biliary, colorectal, kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, uterine cervix and ovary cancers and leukemia. Smokers should be encouraged to stop smoking and join programmes of cancer screening. Smoking cessation effectively reduces tobacco-associated cancer risk.",['Thieme.

To understand the response to BTK inhibitors on a molecular level, we performed (phospho)proteomic analyses under ibrutinib treatment. We identified 3466 proteins and 9184 phosphopeptides (representing 2854 proteins) in CLL cells exhibiting a physiological ratio of phosphorylated serines (pS), threonines (pT), and tyrosines (pY) (pS:pT:pY). Expression of 83 proteins differed between unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) CLL (UM-CLL) and mutated IGHV CLL (M-CLL). Strikingly, UM-CLL cells showed higher basal phosphorylation levels than M-CLL samples. Effects of ibrutinib on protein phosphorylation levels were stronger in UM-CLL, especially on phosphorylated tyrosines. The differentially regulated phosphopeptides and proteins clustered in pathways regulating cell migration, motility, cytoskeleton composition, and survival. One protein, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), showed striking differences in expression and phosphorylation level in UM-CLL vs M-CLL. MARCKS sequesters phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, thereby affecting central signaling pathways and clustering of the B-cell receptor (BCR). Genetically induced loss of MARCKS significantly increased AKT signaling and migratory capacity. CD40L stimulation increased expression of MARCKS. BCR stimulation induced phosphorylation of MARCKS, which was reduced by BTK inhibitors. In line with our in vitro findings, low MARCKS expression is associated with significantly higher treatment-induced leukocytosis and more pronounced decrease of nodal disease in patients with CLL treated with acalabrutinib.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5207-8991', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8498-4729', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1433-9702', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7969-2796']",,PMC8377477,,,['Z01 HL002346/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['2022/08/19 00:00'],,,,,['Blood. 2021 Aug 19;138(7):503-504.

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct type of indolent lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) with a high frequency of MYD88(L265P) mutation. Treatment for WM/LPL is highly variable in clinic and ibrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, BTKi) has become a new treatment option for WM. To investigate the clinical impact of genetic alterations in WM, we assembled a large cohort of 219 WMs and 12 LPLs dividing into two subcohorts: a training cohort, patients sequenced by a same targeted 29-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel, and a validation cohort, patients sequenced by allele specific-PCR or other targeted NGS panels. In both training and validation subcohorts, MYD88(L265P) and TP53 mutations showed favorable and adverse prognostic effects, respectively. CXCR4 nonsense/missense mutations (CXCR4(NS/MS)), cytogenetic complex karyotypes, and a family history of lymphoma/leukemia in first-degree relatives were associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes only or more in the validation subcohort. We further investigated the efficacy of various treatments and interaction with genetic factors in the entire cohort. Upfront dexamethasone usage was associated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients who received non-proteasome-containing chemotherapy as first-line treatment independent of genetic factors. Maintenance rituximab was associated with better survival. Ibrutinib/BTKi showed potential benefit in relapsed/refractory patients and patients without CXCR4(NS/MS) including those with TP53 mutations. In conclusion, genetic testing for MYD88(L265P), TP53, and CXCR4 mutations and cytogenetic analysis provide important information for prognosis prediction and therapy selection. The findings in these study are valuable for improving treatment decisions on therapies available for WM/LPL patients with integration of NGS in clinic.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"BACKGROUND: A previous investigation of the occurrence of childhood acute leukemia around the Belgian nuclear sites has shown positive associations around one nuclear site (Mol-Dessel). In the following years, the Belgian Cancer Registry has made data available at the smallest administrative unit for which demographic information exists in Belgium, i.e. the statistical sector. This offers the advantage to reduce the potential misclassification due to large geographical scales. METHODS: The current study performed for the period 2006-2016 uses Poisson models to investigate (i) the incidence of childhood acute leukemia within 20 km around the four Belgian nuclear sites, (ii) exposure-response relationships between cancer incidence and surrogate exposures from the nuclear sites (distance, wind direction frequency and exposure by hypothetical radioactive discharges taking into account historical meteorological conditions). All analyses are carried out at statistical sector level. RESULTS: Higher incidence rate ratios were found for children <15 years (7 cases, RR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.43;6.35) and children <5 years (< 5 cases, RR = 3.62, 95% CI: 1.35;9.74) living less than 5 km from the site of Mol-Dessel. In addition, there was an indication for positive exposure-response relationships with the different types of surrogate exposures. CONCLUSION: Results confirm an increased incidence of acute childhood leukemia around Mol-Dessel, but the number of cases remains very small. Random variation cannot be excluded and the ecological design does not allow concluding on causality.

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been emerging as new players in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Hsa_circ_0005774 (circ_0005774) is an upregulated circRNA in pediatric AML, while its role is uncovered. Thus, we intended to measure the function and mechanism of circ_0005774 in AML leukemogenesis. Real time-quantitative PCR revealed that circ_0005774 was highly expressed in blood of pediatric AML patients and AML cells (HL-60 and NB4), accompanied with downregulated miRNA-192-5p (miR-192-5p) which was a crucial tumor-associated and leukemia-related miRNA. Circ_0005774 was abundant in miRNA response element according to CSCD software, and miR-192-5p was identified as a target of circ_0005774, as evidenced by RNA immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Cell viability assay, flow cytometry and western blotting were performed to measure cell functions. Accordingly, blocking circ_0005774 and/or overexpressing miR-192-5p could enhance apoptosis rate of HL-60 and NB4 cells, but suppress cell viability and cell cycle entrance, accompanied with depression of proliferation markers including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), CyclinD1 and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Meanwhile, depleting miR-192-5p counteracted the role of circ_0005774 knockdown in AML cells. Uncoordinated 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) was previously demonstrated to be associated with diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic strategy for AML, and restoring ULK1 could abrogate miR-192-5p overexpression-induced effects in HL-60 and NB4 cells. Notably, ULK1 was a downstream target of miR-192-5p and indirectly modulated by circ_0005774. In conclusion, circ_0005774 knockdown repressed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis of AML cells partially through regulating miR-192-5p/ULK1 axis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a new sulfonamide, S1, in AL cells K562 and Jurkat. METHODS: The cytotoxic activity of S1 was assessed using MTT method. The involvement of apoptosis in the mechanism of cell death was assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that S1 induced morphological changes suggestive of apoptosis in both K562 and Jurkat cells. Additionally, S1 was not cytotoxic to normal erythrocytes and mononuclear cells and had a highly selective cytotoxicity for AL lineages. The mechanisms of cell death induced by S1 in K562 cells involves cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis, with an increased FasR and AIF expression and the loss of mitochondrial potential. As for Jurkat, we observed cell cycle blockade at G0/G1 phase, phosphatidylserine exposure and the involvement of intrinsic apoptosis only, with mitochondrial potential loss and a reduced expression of Survivin. Although sulfonamide S1 did not altered Bcl-2 and Bax expression in AL cell lines, it was able to activate caspase-3 in K562 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that sulfonamide S1 may be a promising candidate for the development of new drugs for the treatment of ALs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

State of the art digital PCR assays provide for a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. However digital assays are complex and require sophisticated microfluidic tools. Here we present an assay format that enables ultra-precise quantification of RNA targets in a single measurement across a dynamic range of more than six orders of magnitude. The approach is based on hydrogel beads that provide for microfluidic free compartmentalization of the sample as they are used as nanoreactors for reverse transcription, PCR amplification and combined real time and digital detection of gene transcripts. We have applied these nanoreactor beads for establishing an assay for the detection and quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts. The assay has been characterized for its precision and linear dynamic range.

The authors aimed to assess the epidemiology of pediatric leukemia who received LA. The authors reviewed US nationally representative admission records of patients aged less than 20 years in the Kids' Inpatient Database for the years 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2016. Incidence of new leukemia cases who underwent LA were calculated for the years 2009, 2012, and 2016. Cox and logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the risk factors for adverse outcomes. There were 526 admissions for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=328), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=124), or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (n=74) who underwent LA over the study period. The incidence of leukemia cases that required LA was lower in 2016 than in 2009 or 2012 (1.4%, 2.2%, and 2.7%, respectively; P=0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in AML than ALL (hzard ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.1). None with CML died during admission. This first population-based study of LA in pediatric leukemia showed a decreased utilization of LA over recent years. The higher inpatient mortality in AML, as compared with ALL or CML, warrant further investigations.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, our understanding of the regulatory role of miRNAs in the cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) subtype pathway is still poor. The current study integrated miRNA and mRNA profiles to explore novel miRNA-mRNA interactions that affect the regulatory patterns of de novo CN-AML. Methods: We utilized a multiplexed nanoString nCounter platform to profile both miRNAs and mRNAs using similar sets of patient samples (n = 24). Correlations were assessed, and an miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. The underlying biological functions of the mRNAs were predicted by gene enrichment. Finally, the interacting pairs were assessed using TargetScan and microT-CDS. We identified 637 significant negative correlations (false discovery rate <0.05). Results: Network analysis revealed a cluster of 12 miRNAs representing the majority of mRNA targets. Within the cluster, five miRNAs (miR-495-3p, miR-185-5p, let-7i-5p, miR-409-3p, and miR-127-3p) were posited to play a pivotal role in the regulation of CN-AML, as they are associated with the negative regulation of myeloid leukocyte differentiation, negative regulation of myeloid cell differentiation, and positive regulation of hematopoiesis. Conclusion: Three novel interactions in CN-AML were predicted as let-7i-5p:HOXA9, miR-495-3p:PIK3R1, and miR-495-3p:CDK6 may be responsible for regulating myeloid cell differentiation in CN-AML.",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'hematological malignancies', 'interaction', 'mRNA', 'miRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"BACKGROUND: Information on overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is mostly available from clinical trials. We therefore conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study to assess OS, incidence of AEs, and economic burden in real-world practice among Medicare patients treated for CLL. METHODS: Patients with CLL receiving >/=1 systemic therapy from 2013 to 2015 were selected from the Medicare claims database and followed from the start of first observed systemic therapy (index date) through December 2016 or death. OS for patients receiving each of the most commonly observed treatments was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. AEs were assessed among patients receiving these treatments across all observed lines of therapy. All-cause direct medical costs were assessed from the Medicare system perspective. RESULTS: Among 7,965 eligible patients across all observed therapy lines, ibrutinib monotherapy (Ibr; n = 2,708), chlorambucil monotherapy (Clb; n = 1,620), and bendamustine/rituximab (BR; n = 1,485) were the most common treatments. For first observed therapy, 24-month OS estimates for Ibr, Clb, and BR recipients were 69% (95% CI = 68%-71%), 68% (95% CI = 65%-71%), and 79% (95% CI = 77%-81%) respectively. The most frequently recorded AEs in patients receiving these treatments in any observed line of therapy were neutropenia, hypertension, anemia, and infection. For all patients, the mean monthly all-cause cost during the follow-up period was $8,974 (SD = $11,562); cost increased by the number of AEs, from $5,144 (SD = $5,409) among those with 1-2 AEs to $10,077 (SD = $12,542) among those with >/=6 AEs. CONCLUSION: Over two-thirds of patients survived at least 2 years after starting their first observed therapy for CLL. Our findings highlight considerable susceptibility to AEs and unmet medical need in Medicare patients with CLL treated in routine practice. Medicare incurred substantial economic burden following initiation of systemic therapy, and patients with greater numbers of AEs accounted disproportionately for the high overall cost of CLL management.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Aims To assess the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab as first salvage versus second or later salvage in patients with r/r BCP ALL. Materials & Methods Patient-level pooled data were used for this analysis. In total, 532 adults with r/r BCP ALL treated with blinatumomab were included (first salvage, n = 165; second or later salvage, n = 367). Results Compared with patients who received blinatumomab as second or later salvage, those who received blinatumomab as first salvage had a longer median overall survival (OS; 10.4 vs. 5.7 months; HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.26-1.97; P < .001) and relapse-free survival (10.1 vs. 7.3 months; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.98-1.93; P = .061), and higher rates of remission (n = 89 [54%] vs. n = 150 [41%]; odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.85; P = .005), minimal residual disease response (n = 68 [41%] vs. n = 118 [32%]), and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) realization (n = 60 [36%] vs. n = 88 [24%]), and alloHSCT in continuous remission (n = 33 [20%] vs. n = 52 (14%]). In a subgroup analysis, there was no apparent effect of prior alloHSCT on median OS in either salvage group. The safety profile of blinatumomab was generally similar between the groups; however, cytokine release syndrome, febrile neutropenia, and infection were more frequent with second or later salvage than with first salvage. Discussion In this pooled analysis, the logistic regression analyses indicated greater benefit with blinatumomab as first salvage than as second or later salvage, as evident by the longer median OS, longer median RFS, and higher rates of remission. Conclusion Overall, blinatumomab was beneficial as first salvage and as second or later salvage, but the effects were favorable as first salvage.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"The unraveling of the pathophysiology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has resulted in rapid translation of the information into clinical practice. After more than 40 years of slow progress in AML research, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved nine agents for different AML treatment indications since 2017. In this review, we detail the progress that has been made in the research and treatment of AML, citing key publications related to AML research and therapy in the English literature since 2000. The notable subsets of AML include acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML), AML in younger patients fit for intensive chemotherapy, and AML in older/unfit patients (usually at the age cutoff of 60-70 years). We also consider within each subset whether the AML is primary or secondary (therapy-related, evolving from untreated or treated myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm). In APL, therapy with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide results in estimated 10-year survival rates of >/=80%. Treatment of CBF-AML with fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) results in estimated 10-year survival rates of >/=75%. In younger/fit patients, the ""3+7"" regimen (3 days of daunorubicin + 7 days of cytarabine) produces less favorable results (estimated 5-year survival rates of 35%; worse in real-world experience); regimens that incorporate high-dose cytarabine, adenosine nucleoside analogs, and GO are producing better results. Adding venetoclax, FLT3, and IDH inhibitors into these regimens has resulted in encouraging preliminary data. In older/unfit patients, low-intensity therapy with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and venetoclax is now the new standard of care. Better low-intensity regimens incorporating cladribine, low-dose cytarabine, and other targeted therapies (FLT3 and IDH inhibitors) are emerging. Maintenance therapy now has a definite role in the treatment of AML, and oral HMAs with potential treatment benefits are also available. In conclusion, AML therapy is evolving rapidly and treatment results are improving in all AML subsets as novel agents and strategies are incorporated into traditional AML chemotherapy. LAY SUMMARY: Ongoing research in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is progressing rapidly. Since 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved 10 drugs for different AML indications.

10.1097/CM9.0000000000001402.,"BACKGROUND: For patients with B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), many variables have been demonstrated to be associated with leukemia relapse. In this study, we attempted to establish a risk score system to predict transplant outcomes more precisely in patients with B-ALL after allo-SCT. METHODS: A total of 477 patients with B-ALL who underwent allo-SCT at Peking University People's Hospital from December 2010 to December 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. We aimed to evaluate the factors associated with transplant outcomes after allo-SCT, and establish a risk score to identify patients with different probabilities of relapse. The univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent variables. RESULTS: All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment, and 95.4% of patients achieved platelet engraftment. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and non-relapse mortality were 20.7%, 70.4%, 65.6%, and 13.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with positive post-transplantation minimal residual disease (MRD), transplanted beyond the first complete remission (>/=CR2), and without chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) had higher CIR (P < 0.001, P = 0.004, and P < 0.001, respectively) and worse LFS (P < 0.001, P = 0.017, and P < 0.001, respectively), and OS (P < 0.001, P = 0.009, and P < 0.001, respectively) than patients without MRD after transplantation, transplanted in CR1, and with cGVHD. A risk score for predicting relapse was formulated with the three above variables. The 5-year relapse rates were 6.3%, 16.6%, 55.9%, and 81.8% for patients with scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 (P < 0.001), respectively, while the 5-year LFS and OS values decreased with increasing risk score. CONCLUSION: This new risk score system might stratify patients with different risks of relapse, which could guide treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer,', 'Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license.']",,20210312,PMC8143760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare clinical entity. To investigate NLPHL clinical course and treatment a survey was performed within Polish Pediatric Leukaemia/Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG) participating centers. A questionnaire was sent to all participating centers and analysis of clinical data was performed. From 2010 to 2019, 19 pediatric patients with confirmed NLPHL were registered in Poland. Median age of patients was 12.2 (5.5 - 17.8) years. NLPHL occurred mainly in males (n = 17). Most of the patients (n = 16) had early stage disease - Stage I (n = 6) and stage II (n = 10). Four of the six patients with stage I disease (I A, n = 5; I B, n = 1) underwent complete primary resection. One of these relapsed and was treated with CVP (cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, prednisone) chemotherapy. Two other patients who were not resected completely received CVP chemotherapy and no relapses were observed. Thirteen patients presented with unresectable disease. Of these, eight received three CVP chemotherapy cycles, and five were treated with other chemotherapy regimens. Three relapses were observed and these patients were further treated with chemotherapy and rituximab. One patient underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). All patients remain alive. Five-year progression-free survival and overall survival for the entire group of patients was 81.6% and 100%, respectively. NLPHL treatment results are consistent with results noted in other countries.

Epub 2021 Apr 2.,"OBJECTIVE: Bosutinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are approved for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML). In the absence of head-to-head comparisons between second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the objective of this study was to indirectly compare the efficacy of bosutinib with nilotinib and dasatinib in first-line (1L) CP-CML. METHODS: Cross-trial heterogeneity in terms of patient baseline characteristics and imatinib dose escalation are difficult to adjust for in network meta-analyses and anchored matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (MAICs). Therefore, an unanchored MAIC was performed using patient level data from bosutinib (BFORE trial) and published aggregated data from nilotinib (ENESTnd) and dasatinib (DASISION) trials. After matching, cytogenetic and molecular responses, and disease progression, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months were compared between nilotinib versus bosutinb and dasatinib versus bosutinib. RESULTS: The comparison of nilotinib versus bosutinib resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR at and by 24 months, MR4 by 24 months, MR4.5 at and by 24 months, CCyR by 24 months, and disease progression, however, a decreased odds of MR4 at 24 months in favor of bosutinib versus nilotinib was observed. The comparison of dasatinib versus bosutinib by 24 months resulted in no statistically significant differences for MMR, disease progression, and CCyR, however a decreased odds of MR4.5 in favor of bosutinib versus dasatinib was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in these analyses bosutinib demonstrates equivalent efficacy to nilotinib and dasatinib in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5321-561X'],20210402,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*bosutinib', '*dasatinib', '*first line', '*nilotinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML cell lines(K-562 and HL-60) were transfected correspondingly and investigated for cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities by CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays, respectively. The levels of P53, ACSL4, PTGS2, GPX4, and FTH1 in the K-562, and HL-60 cells were measured by western blotting. Also, circKDM4C mediated regulation of ferroptosis was studied. The Phen Green SK probe and confocal laser scanning microscope were used to assess the cellular iron levels. The reactive oxygen species levels were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the C11-BODIPY probe. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the putative binding sites among circKDM4C, hsa-let-7b-5p, and P53. These were verified using the dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, in vitro findings were also verified in vivo using the nude mice. CircKDM4C was significantly down-regulated in AML patients. The overexpression of circKDM4C in AML cell lines inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted ferroptosis. We found that circKDM4C acts as a sponge of hsa-let-7b-5p and thereby regulates p53 which is a target gene of hsa-let-7b-5p. Also, the expression of circKDM4C and hsa-let-7b-5p are negatively correlated, while circKDM4C and p53 are positively correlated to AML patients. Moreover, we found that circKDM4C induces ferroptosis by sponging hsa-let-7b-5p which upregulates the expression of P53. This work emphasizes the role of circKDM4C in AML patients, which could be explored for the therapeutic role.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6792-9880'],20210318,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CircKDM4C', 'P53', 'ferroptosis', 'hsa-let-7b-5p', 'migration and invasion', 'proliferation']",['182300410360/Natural Science Foundation of Henan province'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, 316 benefited from geriatric assessment (GA) including nutritional, cognitive, and functional status and were scored according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and sorror for the prediction of treatment toxicity, morbidity, and mortality. Patients were investigated at diagnosis for three times during follow-up. RESULTS: This study showed that AML and its treatment have no impact on cognitive (P = .554) nor functional status (P = .842 for Activity of Daily Living and P = .087 for Instrumental Activities of Daily Living). The nutritional status improved over time (P = .041). None of these three parameters at baseline, associated or not with ECOG and sorror scores, impacted survivals or toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive, functional, and nutritional status had no impact in this cohort of fit elderly AML patients without unfavorable cytogenetics. The GA tools used provided no additional information compared with ECOG and sorror scores, to predict toxicity, morbidity, or mortality due to intensive chemotherapy.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2021 Mar 17.,"PURPOSE: Dirofilaria immitis, a mosquito-borne nematode that primarily infects dogs, can equally infect cats. Although there have been numerous studies on canine heartworm prevalence in Brazil, there have been few studies on feline infections. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are both life-threatening retroviruses transmitted directly between cats. Infections with Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. are highly prevalent among dogs in Brazil, with Rhipicephalus sanguineus being the main vector for both bacteria. This study aimed to gather information on these infections among dogs and cats in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro by performing rapid point-of-care tests for prophylactic enforcement. METHODS: Surplus samples of serum or plasma from private laboratories were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (SNAP Feline Triple Test or SNAP 4Dx Plus Test). RESULTS: The prevalence of heartworm disease was 7% among dogs and 0.9% among cats, the latter being 12.9% of the former. The prevalence of FIV and FeLV was 4.3 and 11.9%, respectively. Among dogs, the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. was 27.1 and 9.8%, respectively, and Borrelia burgdorferi was not detected. CONCLUSION: Given that such infections circulate among pets, prophylactic measures should be encouraged by small animal practitioners.","['(c) 2021.

In this study, we aimed to refine the spectrum of kidney disorders associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), 2 very rare conditions scarcely described. Methods: Case series. Patients with myeloid neoplasms who were referred to Toulouse University Hospital Nephrology Unit and were diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or urine abnormalities were retrospectively included. Results: Eighteen patients (males n=13, CMML n=8, essential thrombocytosis [ET] n=7, polycythemia vera [PV] n=1, and myelofibrosis n=2) developed kidney disease 7.7+/-2 years after the diagnosis of the malignancy. Twelve patients had AKI at presentation. Eight patients had glomerular presentation (high-range proteinuria 33%, microscopic hematuria 56%). Kidney biopsy (n=14) showed various patterns, including pauci-immune glomerulosclerosis (n=5), extramedullary hematopoiesis (n=6), or tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with polymorphic inflammation (n=8). Immunostaining of CD61 confirmed the infiltration of megakaryocytes within glomeruli or interstitium in 5 of 8 patients. Other pictures of glomerulopathy were identified in 3 patients (IgA nephropathy n=2, AA amyloidosis n=1). Massive kidney infiltration by CMML was identified in 1 patient. After a mean follow-up of 24+/-6 months, malignancy was considered as stable in 11 patients (61%), but 22% of patients had progressed to end-stage renal failure. The remaining had persistently reduced kidney function. No correlation between the malignancy and the renal presentation and outcomes could be identified. Conclusions: Kidney complications of CMML/MPN are heterogenous, and kidney biopsy may help to identify new molecular targets to prevent the development of kidney fibrosis.",['(c) 2021 International Society of Nephrology.

Internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) detected in AML stem cells account for 20-30 percent of AML patients. In this study, we attempted to study the impact of the interaction of FLT3-ITD mutation and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in AML, and the possible mechanisms caused by the impact by bioinformatics. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) revealed that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway positively correlated with the status of FLT3-ITD mutation. Multiple survival analyses were performed on TCGA-AML to screen the prognostic-related genes, and RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 are powerful prognostic candidates for overall survival in AML. WGCNA, KEGG/GO analysis, and the functional roles of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 in AML were clarified by correlation analysis. We found that the expression levels of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 were significantly associated with chemoresistance of AML, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis would regulate RPS6KA1/AP2M1 expression. Besides, miR-138-5p, regulated by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, was the common miRNA target of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1. Taken together, the interaction of FLT3-ITD mutation and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis activated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, and the increased expression of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 caused by hsa-miR-138-5p downregulation regulates the multi-resistance gene expression leading to drug indications.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yu, Chen, Liu, Yao, Li and Ruan.']",,20210226,PMC7959750,['NOTNLM'],"['AP2M1', 'GSVA', 'PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway', 'RPS6KA1', 'WGCNA', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemoresistance', 'prognosis']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study used primary leukemic cells obtained from 53 patients with CLL that were treated with dasatinib. A 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay and Annexin V staining was performed to assess the cytotoxic effects of dasatinib treatment. The XTT assay revealed that the median cytotoxicity of dasatinib was 8.30% (range, 0.00-77.89%). Due to high dispersion of dasatinib activity, patients were divided into sensitive (n=27; 50.94%; median cytotoxicity, 22.81%) and resistant groups (n=26; 49.06%; median cytotoxicity, 0.00%). A median cytotoxicity of 8.30% was selected as a cut off value. Using Annexin V staining and flow cytometry on exemplary sensitive and resistant CLL samples, it was revealed that 17.71 and 1.84% of cells were apoptotic, respectively. The current study presented a case of a patient with concomitant occurrence of CLL and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with a major molecular response after dasatinib treatment. A simultaneous reduction of circulating CLL cells indicated in vivo anti-CLL activity induced by dasatinib. After an in vitro culture of the patient's mononuclear cells with subsequent dasatinib treatment, a higher percentage of CLL cells undergoing apoptosis was obsevered when compared with untreated samples (38.19 vs. 21.99%, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of CLL apoptotic cells (DeltaPsim(low)) measured by chloromethyl-X-rosamine was higher after incubation with dasatinib (7.28%) than in the negative control (2.86%). In conclusion, dasatinib induced antileukemic effects against CML and CLL cells. The results of the current study indicated that dasatinib may induce apoptosis ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo in CLL.",['Copyright: (c) Giannopoulos et al.'],,20210212,PMC7905539,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'kinase inhibitor']",,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Feb 11.,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures made of chromatin and have been identified to have a role in the host's immune defense. Differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (dHL-60) have been used to study the mechanisms of NETs formation, as neutrophils have a short lifespan that limits their use. However, dHL-60 cells are inefficient at generating NETs and therefore are not ideal replacements for neutrophils in studying of NET formation. In the present study, the optimal cell culture conditions and differentiation time that result in the most effective release of NETs from dHL-60 cells upon stimulation were determined. HL-60 cells were cultured in serum (FBS) or serum-free (X-VIVO) medium and differentiated using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). dHL-60 cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or Ca(2+) ionophore (CI). Cell differentiation and apoptosis, as well as the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) were analyzed using flow cytometry. NETs were visualized using fluorescence microscopy and NET quantification was performed using PicoGreen. Induction of HL-60 cells for five days produced the best results in terms of differentiation markers and cell viability. Both ATRA- and DMSO-induced dHL-60 cells were able to release NETs upon PMA and CI stimulation; dHL-60 cells in serum-free medium produced more NETs than those in serum-containing medium. DMSO-dHL-60 (X-VIVO) cells were most efficient at producing NETs and ROS upon stimulation with PMA, while ATRA-dHL-60 (X-VIVO) cells were most efficient at producing NETs and citH3 upon stimulation with CI. It was concluded that DMSO-dHL-60 (X-VIVO) may be a model for the study of ROS-high NETosis and ATRA-dHL-60 (X-VIVO) may be suitable for ROS-low NETosis.",['Copyright: (c) Guo et al.'],,20210211,PMC7903455,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'cell differentiation', 'dimethyl sulfoxide', 'histone citrullination', 'neutrophil', 'neutrophil extracellular traps', 'reactive oxygen species', 'serum-free medium']",,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs prevent and/or treat GVHD by modifying gene expression and inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines, regulating the function of alloreactive T cells, and upregulating the function and number of regulatory T cells.

Mar 17;11(1):6187. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-85734-0.,"Accumulation in target cells is an essential pharmacokinetic step of targeted therapies. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) against the BCR-ABL fusion protein in Chronic Phase-Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CP-CML) cells constitute a unique model in terms of efficacy, specificity, and in vivo demonstration of response heterogeneity by target cells. The overall therapeutic response to nilotinib is heterogeneous with no satisfactory explanation. To better understand the patients' response heterogeneity, we quantified nilotinib uptake by primary CP-CML cells in standardized conditions using flow cytometry, which allowed also distinguishing mature (polymorphonuclear cells) from immature (CD34(+)) cells. Nilotinib was undetectable in 13.3% of PMN and 40% of CD34(+) cells. Moreover, in CD34(+) cells, intracellular nilotinib did not completely abolish BCR-ABL activity (monitored by CrkL phosphorylation inhibition), although nilotinib accumulated well in most CD34(+) cell samples. Intracellular nilotinib concentration was inversely correlated with disease burden parameters, Sokal score, and early haematologic response at day 6 +/- 1 only in PMN, suggesting an intrinsic ability to limit nilotinib entry in the forms with higher tumor cell burdenat diagnosis. These findings suggest that nilotinib accumulation in CP-CML cells is influenced by individual characteristics and intra-clonal heterogeneity, and might be used for pharmacokinetic studies and to assess the therapeutic response.",,,20210317,PMC7969931,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 17.,"T-cell dysfunction is a hallmark of B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), where CLL cells downregulate T-cell responses through regulatory molecules including programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10). Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) aims to restore T-cell function by preventing the ligation of inhibitory receptors like PD-1. However, most CLL patients do not respond well to this therapy. Thus, we investigated whether IL-10 suppression could enhance antitumor T-cell activity and responses to ICB. Since CLL IL-10 expression depends on Sp1, we utilized a novel, better tolerated analogue of the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin (MTMox32E) to suppress CLL IL-10. MTMox32E treatment inhibited mouse and human CLL IL-10 production and maintained T-cell effector function in vitro. In the Emu-Tcl1 mouse model, treatment reduced plasma IL-10 and CLL burden and increased CD8(+) T-cell proliferation, effector and memory cell prevalence, and interferon-gamma production. When combined with ICB, suppression of IL-10 improved responses to anti-PD-L1 as shown by a 4.5-fold decrease in CLL cell burden compared to anti-PD-L1 alone. Combination therapy also produced more interferon-gamma(+), cytotoxic effector KLRG1(+), and memory CD8(+) T-cells, and fewer exhausted T-cells. Since current therapies for CLL do not target IL-10, this provides a novel strategy to improve immunotherapies.","['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 17.,"Pediatric myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous disease group associated with impaired hematopoiesis, bone marrow hypocellularity, and frequently have deletions involving chromosome 7 (monosomy 7). We and others recently identified heterozygous germline mutations in SAMD9 and SAMD9L in children with monosomy 7 and MDS. We previously demonstrated an antiproliferative effect of these gene products in non-hematopoietic cells, which was exacerbated by their patient-associated mutations. Here, we used a lentiviral overexpression approach to assess the functional impact and underlying cellular processes of wild-type and mutant SAMD9 or SAMD9L in primary mouse or human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Using a combination of protein interactome analyses, transcriptional profiling, and functional validation, we show that SAMD9 and SAMD9L are multifunctional proteins that cause profound alterations in cell cycle, cell proliferation, and protein translation in HSPCs. Importantly, our molecular and functional studies also demonstrated that expression of these genes and their mutations leads to a cellular environment that promotes DNA damage repair defects and ultimately apoptosis in hematopoietic cells. This study provides novel functional insights into SAMD9 and SAMD9L and how their mutations can potentially alter hematopoietic function and lead to bone marrow hypocellularity, a hallmark of pediatric MDS.",['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 17.,"Microenvironment contributes to follicular lymphoma (FL) pathogenesis and impacts survival with macrophages playing a controversial role. In the present study, using FL primary samples and HK follicular dendritic cells (FDC) to mimic the germinal center, together with mouse models, we have analyzed the three-way crosstalk of FL-FDC-macrophages and derived therapeutic opportunities. Ex vivo primary FL-FDC co-cultures (n = 19) and in vivo mouse co-xenografts demonstrated that FL-FDC crosstalk favors tumor growth and, via the secretion of CCL2 and CSF-1, promotes monocyte recruitment, differentiation, and polarization towards an M2-like protumoral phenotype. Moreover, FL-M2 co-cultures displayed enhanced angiogenesis, dissemination, and immunosuppression. Analysis of the CSF-1/CSF-1R pathway uncovered that CSF-1 was significantly higher in serum from grade 3A FL patients, and that high CSF-1R expression in FL biopsies correlated with grade 3A, reduced overall survival and risk of transformation. Furthermore, CSF-1R inhibition with pexidartinib (PLX3397) preferentially affected M2-macrophage viability and polarization program disrupting FL-M2 positive crosstalk. In vivo CSF1-R inhibition caused M2 reduction and repolarization towards M1 macrophages and antitumor effect cooperating with anti-CD20 rituximab.

Epub 2021 Mar 17.,"Genome-wide association studies identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting the transcription factor Eomesodermin (EOMES) associated with a significantly increased risk to develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Epigenetic analyses, RNA sequencing, and flow cytometry revealed that EOMES is not expressed in CLL cells, but in CD8(+) T cells for which EOMES is a known master regulator. We thus hypothesized that the increased CLL risk associated with the EOMES SNP might be explained by its negative impact on CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immune control of CLL. Flow cytometry analyses revealed a higher EOMES expression in CD8(+) T cells of CLL patients compared to healthy individuals, and an accumulation of PD-1(+) EOMES(+) CD8(+) T cells in lymph nodes rather than blood or bone marrow in CLL. This was in line with an observed expansion of EOMES(+) CD8(+) T cells in the spleen of leukemic Emicro-TCL1 mice. As EOMES expression was highest in CD8(+) T cells that express inhibitory receptors, an involvement of EOMES in T-cell exhaustion and dysfunction seems likely. Interestingly, Eomes-deficiency in CD8(+) T cells resulted in their impaired expansion associated with decreased CLL control in mice. Overall, these observations suggest that EOMES is essential for CD8(+) T-cell expansion and/or maintenance, and therefore involved in adaptive immune control of CLL.",['(c) 2021.

During lung development TBX2 maintains the proliferation of mesenchymal progenitors, and hence, epithelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis. The pro-proliferative function was traced to direct repression of the cell-cycle inhibitor genes Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b, as well as of genes encoding WNT antagonists, Frzb and Shisa3, to increase pro-proliferative WNT signaling. Despite these important molecular insights, we still lack knowledge of the DNA occupancy of TBX2 in the genome, and of the protein interaction partners involved in transcriptional repression of target genes. METHODS: We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing and expression analyses to identify genomic DNA-binding sites and transcription units directly regulated by TBX2 in the developing lung. Moreover, we purified TBX2 containing protein complexes from embryonic lung tissue and identified potential interaction partners by subsequent liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The interaction with candidate proteins was validated by immunofluorescence, proximity ligation and individual co-immunoprecipitation analyses. RESULTS: We identified Il33 and Ccn4 as additional direct target genes of TBX2 in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Analyzing TBX2 occupancy data unveiled the enrichment of five consensus sequences, three of which match T-box binding elements. The remaining two correspond to a high mobility group (HMG)-box and a homeobox consensus sequence motif. We found and validated binding of TBX2 to the HMG-box transcription factor HMGB2 and the homeobox transcription factor PBX1, to the heterochromatin protein CBX3, and to various members of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin remodeling complex including HDAC1, HDAC2 and CHD4. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that TBX2 interacts with homeobox and HMG-box transcription factors as well as with the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex to repress transcription of anti-proliferative genes in the pulmonary mesenchyme.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8154-0257'],20210317,PMC7968368,['NOTNLM'],"['CBX3', 'HDAC', 'HMGB2', 'Lung development', 'NuRD', 'PBX1', 'Pulmonary mesenchyme', 'Tbx2']",['KI728/11/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the children's motor functions with the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency Second Edition-Short Form and the Nine-hole Peg Test, and we used the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) to evaluate their cognitive performance. Compared to the normative group, children with ALL had lower scores on total motor proficiency and sub-tests scores of motor functions (p < .05), and on the Nine-hole Peg Test performance (p < .05); but their cognitive performance on the MMSE was not significantly different. Children with ALL would likely benefit from structured exercise and rehabilitative interventions during chemotherapy to prevent and/or ameliorate ALL-related motor dysfunction. We also suggest that their cognitive functioning should be further investigated with more extensive well-validated neurocognitive tests for children (e.g., the Wechsler intelligence scales).",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1559-1793', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7334-411X']",20210317,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children with cancer', 'cognitive performance', 'functional evaluation', 'motor skills']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib may be intolerable for some patients. Acalabrutinib is a more selective BTK inhibitor that may be better tolerated by patients who are intolerant to ibrutinib. A phase 2 study of acalabrutinib was conducted in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who were ibrutinib-intolerant and had continued disease activity. Intolerance was defined as having discontinued ibrutinib due to persistent grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) or persistent/recurrent grade 2 AEs despite dose modification/interruption. Patients received oral acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily until disease progression or intolerance. Sixty patients were treated. Overall response rate to acalabrutinib was 73% and three patients (5%) achieved complete remission. At median follow-up of 35 months, the median progressionfree and overall survival were not reached; 24-month estimates were 72% and 81%, respectively. The most frequent AEs with acalabrutinib were diarrhea (53%), headache (42%), contusion (40%), dizziness (33%), upper respiratory tract infection (33%), and cough (30%). Most common reasons for acalabrutinib discontinuation were progressive disease (23%) and AEs (17%). Most patients with baseline samples (49/52; 94%) and all with on-treatment samples (3/3; 100%) had no detectable BTK and/or PLCG2 mutations. Acalabrutinib is effective and tolerable in most patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who are intolerant of ibrutinib.

However, their clinical relevance in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not well characterized. We analyzed the frequency, clinical significance, and prognostic relevance of RAS pathway alterations in 328 pediatric patients with de novo AML. RAS pathway alterations were detected in 80 (24.4%) out of 328 patients: NF1 (n = 7, 2.1%), PTPN11 (n = 15, 4.6%), CBL (n = 6, 1.8%), NRAS (n = 44, 13.4%), KRAS (n = 12, 3.7%). Most of these alterations were mutually exclusive and were also mutually exclusive with other aberrations of signal transduction pathways such as FLT3-ITD (p = 0.001) and KIT mutation (p = 0.004). NF1 alterations were frequently detected in patients with complex karyotype (p = 0.031) and were found to be independent predictors of poor overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (p = 0.007). At least four of seven patients with NF1 alterations had bi-allelic inactivation. NRAS mutations were frequently observed in patients with CBFB-MYH11 and were independent predictors of favorable outcomes in multivariate analysis [OS, p = 0.023; event-free survival (EFS), p = 0.037]. Patients with PTPN11 mutations more frequently received stem cell transplantation (p = 0.035) and showed poor EFS than patients without PTPN11 mutations (p = 0.013). Detailed analysis of RAS pathway alterations may enable a more accurate prognostic stratification of pediatric AML and may provide novel therapeutic molecular targets related to this signal transduction pathway.",,,20210318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment efficacy with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors was found similar to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab in untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with a mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene. To identify patients who specifically benefit from fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab, we developed integrative models including established prognostic parameters and gene expression profiling. Gene expression profiling was conducted on n=337 CLL8 trial samples, ""core"" probe sets were summarized on gene levels and RMA normalized. Prognostic models were built using penalized Cox proportional hazards models with the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty. We identified a prognostic signature of less than a dozen genes, which substituted for established prognostic factors, including TP53 and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene mutation status. Independent prognostic impact was confirmed for treatment, beta2-microglobulin and del(17p) regarding overall survival and for treatment, del(11q), del(17p) and SF3B1 mutation for progression-free survival. The combination of independent prognostic and gene expression profiling variables performed equal to models including only established non-gene expression profiling variables. Gene expression profiling variables showed higher prognostic accuracy for patients with long progression-free survival compared to categorical variables like the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene mutation status and reliably predicted overall survival in CLL8 and an independent cohort. Gene expression profiling based prognostic models can help to identify patients who specifically benefit from fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab treatment.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represents the most common adult hematologic malignancy, and trisomy 12 (tri12) represents a quarter of CLL patients. We report that tri12 human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) allow for the identification of gene networks and targets specific to tri12, which are controlled by comparative normal PSCs. Identified targets are upregulated in tri12 leukemic cells from a cohort of 159 patients with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis and CLL. tri12 signaling patterns significantly influence progression-free survival. Actionable targets are identified using high-content drug testing and functionally validated in an additional 44 CLL patient samples. Using xenograft models, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) inhibitor is potent and selective against human tri12 CLL versus healthy patient-derived xenografts.

We documented a 4%-6% prevalence of hypoglycemia among patients in the two clinics in this study. We aim to reduce morning hypoglycemia in children on chemotherapy for ALL at two community pediatric oncology clinics (A and B) by 50% in 9 months. METHODS: We used the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Model for Improvement as the framework. Prolonged hours of fasting for procedural sedation, gaps in the caregivers' knowledge of hypoglycemia risk, and a lack of awareness of the new mercaptopurine administration guidelines were the most likely contributing factors for hypoglycemia. We developed a hypoglycemia prevention educational program for staff and caregivers followed by a knowledge assessment tool. RESULTS: Each month, the average number of patients seen in both clinics was 43. The monthly average of blood glucose tests in these patients was 94. After implementing the intervention, the percentage of caregivers who received hypoglycemia education reached 88%. Of those, 78% scored >/= 75% in the knowledge reassessment resurvey. The combined average hypoglycemic episodes in the two clinics decreased by 46%. A higher reduction in hypoglycemic episodes was observed in clinic A (75%) compared with clinic B (17%). CONCLUSION: Implementing hypoglycemia education led to a significant drop in hypoglycemic episodes among children on ALL therapy. Despite using a similar approach, one of the two clinics showed a more than fourfold improvement compared with the other.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9785-8035', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8034-7260']",20210317,,,,,,"['Ashraf MohamedConsulting or Advisory Role: AllMed Healthcare Management, Medical', ""Consultant NetworkSpeakers' Bureau: NovartisNo other potential conflicts of"", 'interest were reported.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parts 1 (dose confirmation) and 2 (dose expansion) of this three-part study are reported. Treatment was a single dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib (day 1), followed by a washout period and then twice daily 100 mg acalabrutinib in part 1, or twice daily 100 mg acalabrutinib in part 2. Patients from parts 1 and 2 with r/r chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and r/r mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were assessed as r/r CLL/SLL and r/r MCL cohorts, respectively. Twenty-five patients received treatment (part 1, n = 6). Median age was 71.0 years. Nine (one patient from part 1) and 13 (two patients from part 1) patients were included in the r/r CLL/SLL and r/r MCL cohorts, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 88% of patients (grade >/=3, 36%); the most common were headache (28%) and purpura (24%), both grade 1/2. No AEs resulted in treatment discontinuation or death. Median duration of treatment was 31, 20, and 7 months for part 1, r/r CLL/SLL cohort, and r/r MCL cohort, respectively. Overall response rate (ORR) was 89% and 62% for the r/r CLL/SLL and r/r MCL cohorts, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for the r/r CLL/SLL cohort and was 7 months for the r/r MCL cohort. Acalabrutinib (100 mg twice daily) was generally safe and well-tolerated in adult Japanese patients with B-cell malignancies.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 May 6.,"Non-immune cells are increasingly recognized as important in regulating immunity, but the role of red blood cells (RBC) remains relatively unexplored, despite their abundance in the circulation and a cell surface rich in potential ligands. Here, we determine whether RBC influence the activation state of human B cells. Separation of RBC from peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased B-cell expression of HLA-DR/DP/DQ, whilst reconstitution reduced the levels of B-cell activation markers HLA-DR/DP/DQ, CD86, CD69 and CD40, as well as decreasing proliferative responses and IgM secretion. Inhibition of B cells required contact with RBC and was abrogated by either removal of sialic acids from RBC or blocking the corresponding lectin receptor CD22 on B cells.

Epub 2021 Mar 16.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: For decades, the management of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) has been largely inextricable from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms, and acute myeloid leukemia. Hallmarks of these diseases have been the emergence of unique genomic signatures and discouraging responses to available therapies. Here, we will critically examine the current options for management and review the rapidly developing opportunities based on advances in CMML and JMML disease biology. RECENT FINDINGS: Few clinical trials have exclusively been done in CMML, and in JMML, the rarity of the disease limits wide scale participation. Recent case series in JMML suggest that hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are a viable option for bridging to curative intent with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant or as posttransplant maintenance. Emerging evidence has demonstrated targeting the RAS-pathway via MEK inhibition may also be considered. In CMML, treatment with HMAs is largely derived from data inclusive of MDS patients, including a small number of patients with dysplastic CMML variants. Based on CMML disease biology, additional therapeutic targets being investigated include inhibitors of splicing, CD123/dendritic cell axis, inherent GM-CSF progenitor cell hypersensitivity, and targeting the JAK/STAT pathway. Current evidence is also expanding for oral HMAs. The management of CMML and JMML is rapidly evolving and clinicians must be aware of the genetic landscape and expanding treatment options to ensure these rare populations are afforded therapeutic interventions best suited to their needs.",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4252-2619'],20210316,,['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic stem cell transplant', '*chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*hypomethylating agent', '*juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia']",,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03190915'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data were obtained from population-based PROFILES registry cohorts, including colon, rectum, prostate or thyroid cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma (MM), melanoma, or basal cell carcinoma (BCC)/squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). All patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 from which self-perceived cognitive functioning, fatigue, functioning, and global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) were used. The PROFILES registry data were linked with the Netherlands Cancer Registry to obtain sociodemographic and clinical data. RESULTS: Six thousand seven hundred eighty-six survivors were included (response rate=76%). Survivors, except for melanoma and BCC/SCC, reported on average lower self-perceived cognitive functioning scores compared to their matched controls (all p's<0.01). Largest differences with the norm were observed in thyroid cancer, HL, NHL and MM, and younger survivors (<50 years). Survivors with lower emotional functioning and more fatigue were more likely to report impaired self-perceived cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION: Self-perceived impaired cognitive functioning is prevalent among a wide range of cancer survivors, especially among survivors <50 years. Approaches targeting cognitive problems including attention for co-occurring symptoms such as fatigue and emotional impairments are needed to improve care for these patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Cancer survivors and clinicians should be aware that impaired self-perceived cognitive functioning is a frequently reported consequence of cancer and its treatment among survivors of various cancer types. Clinicians can redirect survivors to a relevant healthcare provider or program to target cognitive problems.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1595-7262'],20210317,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anxiety', 'Cancer survivors', 'Cognitive functioning', 'Fatigue', 'Normative population', 'Quality of life']",['(#480-08-009/Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Feb 14.,"An evidence-based triage plan for cellular therapy distribution is critical in the face of emerging constraints on healthcare resources. We evaluated the impact of treatment delays related to COVID-19 on patients scheduled to undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy at our center. Data were collected in real time between March 19 and May 11, 2020, for patients who were delayed to cellular therapy. We evaluated the proportion of delayed patients who ultimately received cellular therapy, reasons for not proceeding to cellular therapy, and changes in disease and health status during delay. A total of 85 patients were delayed, including 42 patients planned for autologous HCT, 36 patients planned for allogeneic HCT, and 7 patients planned for CAR-T therapy. Fifty-six of these patients (66%) since received planned therapy. Five patients died during the delay. The most common reason for not proceeding to autologous HCT was good disease control in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias (75%). The most common reason for not proceeding to allogeneic HCT was progression of disease (42%). All patients with acute leukemia who progressed had measurable residual disease (MRD) at the time of delay, whereas no patient without MRD at the time of delay progressed. Six patients (86%) ultimately received CAR-T therapy, including 3 patients who progressed during the delay. For patients with high-risk disease such as acute leukemia, and particularly those with MRD at the time of planned HCT, treatment delay can result in devastating outcomes and should be avoided if at all possible.","['(c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

Single-agent alemtuzumab remains the first line of therapy for the treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory patients. Prospective clinical trials are difficult to conduct given that these patients have a short life expectancy after the initial diagnosis. As a result, researchers are implementing the use of targeted therapies in vitro and ex vivo followed by in vivo trials on a small subset of patients which are reviewed here. Newer approaches in the treatment of T-PLL are developing based on recognizing the cytogenetic phenotype of each patient and targeting the identified defective genes that are usually involved in the cell cycle regulation such as protooncogenes, tumor suppressors, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes. These could potentially redirect the management in the near future and improve the overall survival (OS) and the progression-free survival (PFS) for these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Colon Ramos et al.']",,20210209,PMC7948687,['NOTNLM'],"['alemtuzumab', 'bcl2', 'cytogenetic profile', 'hdac inhibitor', 'jak-stat', 'mtcp1', 'refractory', 'relapsed', 't-cell prolymphocytic leukemia', 'tcl1']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although fluid retention is a common adverse effect of imatinib, it rarely necessitates discontinuation of therapy. Isolated ascites has not been reported as a complication of imatinib therapy in patients with CML. Here, we report the case of a 72-year-old male with CML on imatinib (600 mg daily), who developed ascites two weeks after a laparoscopic hernia repair with intraperitoneal placement of a nylon mesh. The ascites was resistant to diuretic therapy and required repeated large-volume paracentesis. Discontinuation of imatinib resulted in arrest of ascites production, but reintroduction of the drug at the same dose two weeks later was rapidly followed by recurrence of ascites requiring further therapeutic paracenteses. It was postulated that peritoneal inflammation had resulted in increased capillary permeability, which was further augmented by imatinib via inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), a tyrosine kinase known to play a significant physiological role in the regulation of interstitial fluid pressure and capillary permeability.

Despite the lack of information regarding the basic underlying mechanisms involved in the development of T2D-mediated AD, some common features of the two conditions have been reported, such as brain atrophy, reduced cerebral glucose metabolism, and insulin resistance. T2D phenotypes such as glucose dyshomeostasis, insulin resistance, impaired insulin signaling, and systemic inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be involved in the progression of AD pathology by increasing amyloid-beta accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and overall neuroinflammation. Similarly, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the generation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptor (RAGE) as a result of chronic hyperglycemia may serve as critical links between diabetes and AD. The natural dietary polyflavonoid anthocyanin enhances insulin sensitivity, attenuates insulin resistance at the level of the target tissues, inhibits free fatty acid oxidation, and abrogates the release of peripheral inflammatory cytokines in obese (prediabetic) individuals, which are responsible for insulin resistance, systemic hyperglycemia, systemic inflammation, brain metabolism dyshomeostasis, amyloid-beta accumulation, and neuroinflammatory responses. In this review, we have shown that obesity may induce T2D-mediated AD and assessed the recent therapeutic advances, especially the use of anthocyanin, against T2D-mediated AD pathology. Taken together, the findings of current studies may help elucidate a new approach for the prevention and treatment of T2D-mediated AD by using the polyflavonoid anthocyanin.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Muhammad Sohail Khan et al.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4902-4698', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5226-4081', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4317-1072']",20210227,PMC7936905,,,,,['The authors declared no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, CPX-351, a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, to deliver a synergistic 5 : 1 molar drug ratio into leukemia cells to a greater extent than normal bone marrow cells and significantly enhance survival compared with conventional treatment in older and newly diagnosed AML patients, but overall survival rate remains low; therefore, the need for new therapeutic options continues. Sodium caseinate (SC), a salt of casein, the main milk protein, has cytotoxic effect in leukemia cell lines, but promotes proliferation of hematopoietic normal cells, while its administration in leukemic mice promotes survival for more than 40 days, but bone marrow surviving mice still harbour leukemic cells, but it is not known whether the combination with cytarabine or daunorubicin can improve survival without damaging normal hematopoietic cells. Here, it is shown that, in vitro, the combination of the IC25 of SC-cytarabine or SC-daunorubicin synergizes in the elimination of leukemic cells, with evident induction of apoptosis, while the proliferation of mononuclear cells of bone marrow is not affected. In leukemic mice, the combined administration of SC-daunorubicin or SC-cytarabine promotes the highest survival rate at 40 days; in addition, no autoproliferating cells were detected in the bone marrow of survivors of more than 60 days, evidence of eradication of leukemic cells, but only the bone marrow of mice treated with the SC-daunorubicin combination proliferated in the presence of interleukin-3, which shows that this combination is not toxic to normal bone marrow cells, thus emerging as a possible antileukemic agent.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Itzen Aguiniga-Sanchez et al.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1692-8287', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2539-9762', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1001-4073', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4876-0688']",20210227,PMC7937462,,,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, safety concerns are often raised when switching from reference to biosimilar products and between different biosimilars. In this prospective observational study we aimed at evaluating the safety of switching between reference and biosimilar rituximab (TRUXIMA and RIXATHON) at Trento General Hospital (Italy). All patients (n = 83) with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL, n = 72) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL, n = 11) who received rituximab between March 2018 and March 2019 were asked to take part in the study. In 2017 and 2018 two tenders were carried out and two different biosimilars became available in the hospital, these were used sequentially. Thus, patients with or without previous treatments with the originator rituximab either received a biosimilar or were switched between different biosimilars. The incidence of adverse events in these groups of patients is described. The study population received 465 rituximab infusions and all received biosimilars. Fifty patients (60%) experienced at least one switch between different biosimilars or between rituximab originator and biosimilar, whereas 33 (40%) received one of the two biosimilars and one patient received reference rituximab. Adverse events (n = 146) were reported in 71 patients (84.5%). Treatment-related grade 3-4 events were reported in 5 patients (5.9%), whereas grade 1 rituximab related infusion events were observed in 6 patients (7.1%). No safety signal emerged in association with the use of a specific biosimilar nor with the practice of switching. Adverse events were similar, in terms of seriousness and frequency, to those described in the literature, providing further support to the clinical safety of rituximab biosimilars.",,,20210316,PMC7966361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapeutic strategies continue to rely on cisplatin, as it remains the most active single agent against hepatoblastoma. However, chemoresistance remains a significant challenge with 54-80% of patients developing resistance to chemotherapy after 4-5 cycles of treatment. Stem cell-like cancer cells (SCLCCs) are a subset of cells thought to play a role in chemoresistance and disease recurrence. We have previously demonstrated that Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases, specifically PIM3, play a role in hepatoblastoma cell proliferation and tumor growth and maintain the SCLCC phenotype. Here, we describe the development of a cisplatin-resistant hepatoblastoma xenograft model of the human HuH6 cell line and a patient-derived xenograft, COA67. We provide evidence that these cisplatin-resistant cells are enriched for SCLCCs and express PIM3 at higher levels than cisplatin-naive cells. We demonstrate that PIM inhibition with AZD1208 sensitizes cisplatin-resistant hepatoblastoma cells to cisplatin, enhances cisplatin-mediated apoptosis, and decreases the SCLCC phenotype seen with cisplatin resistance. Together, these findings indicate that PIM inhibition may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of hepatoblastoma to effectively target SCLCCs and potentially decrease chemoresistance and subsequent disease relapse.",,,20210316,PMC7966748,,,"['T32 CA229102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA183926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA091078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 16.,"Alternative strategies are needed for patients with B-cell malignancy relapsing after CD19-targeted immunotherapy. Here, cell surface proteomics revealed CD72 as an optimal target for poor-prognosis KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged (MLLr) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which we further found to be expressed in other B-cell malignancies. Using a recently described, fully in vitro system, we selected synthetic CD72-specific nanobodies, incorporated them into chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), and demonstrated robust activity against B-cell malignancy models, including CD19 loss. Taking advantage of the role of CD72 in inhibiting B-cell receptor signaling, we found that SHIP1 inhibition increased CD72 surface density. We establish that CD72-nanobody CAR-T cells are a promising therapy for MLLr B-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with MLLr B-ALL have poor prognoses despite recent immunotherapy advances. Here, surface proteomics identifies CD72 as being enriched on MLLr B-ALL but also widely expressed across B-cell cancers. We show that a recently described, fully in vitro nanobody platform generates binders highly active in CAR-T cells and demonstrate its broad applicability for immunotherapy development.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1861.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7741-5368', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3502-5799', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4402-1511', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5532-238X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2499-6618', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5167-537X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7032-4623', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7465-6964']",20210316,PMC8338785,,,"['DP2 GM123500/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA184116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA230188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA082103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['2022/02/01 00:00'],,['NIHMS1686861'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory workup was significant for methemoglobinemia and acute anaemia, and blood film demonstrated evidence of oxidative haemolysis with bite cells. The patient was given a presumptive diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and was managed conservatively with successful resolution of AHRF and stabilisation of haemoglobin level. Seven days after admission, she passed away due to subsequent complications; hence, follow-up G6PD level could not be obtained. Haemolytic anaemia and methemoglobinemia in the setting of recent rasburicase administration should raise clinical suspicion for G6PD deficiency. In non-emergent cases, patients should be screened prior to receiving rasburicase regardless of risk factors. Because rasburicase is often needed emergently, patients at high risk of tumour lysis syndrome should be screened early for G6PD deficiency.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 17.,"Here, we report that COVID-19 hospitalization rates follow an exponential relationship with age, doubling for every 16 years of age or equivalently increasing by 4.5% per year of life (R(2) = 0.98). This mirrors the well-studied exponential decline of both thymus volume and T-cell production, which halve every 16 years. COVID-19 can therefore be added to the list of other diseases with this property, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MERS-CoV, West Nile virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and brain cancers. In addition, the incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women. Since these properties are shared with some non-contagious diseases, we hypothesized that the age dependence does not come from social-mixing patterns, i.e. that the probability of hospitalization given infection rises exponentially, doubling every 16 years. A Bayesian analysis of daily hospitalizations, incorporating contact matrices, found that this relationship holds for every age group except for the under 20s. While older adults have fewer contacts than young adults, our analysis suggests that there is an approximate cancellation between the effects of fewer contacts for the elderly and higher infectiousness due to a higher probability of developing severe disease. Our model fitting suggests under 20s have 49-75% additional immune protection beyond that predicted by strong thymus function alone, consistent with increased juvenile cross-immunity from other viruses. We found no evidence for differences between age groups in susceptibility to infection or infectiousness to others (given disease state), i.e. the only important factor in the age dependence of hospitalization rates is the probability of hospitalization given infection. These findings suggest the existence of a T-cell exhaustion threshold, proportional to thymic output and that clonal expansion of peripheral T-cells does not affect disease risk. The strikingly simple inverse relationship between risk and thymic T-cell output adds to the evidence that thymic involution is an important factor in the decline of the immune system with age and may also be an important clue in understanding disease progression, not just for COVID-19 but other diseases as well.",,,20210317,PMC8086881,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell', '*immunology', '*thymus']","['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '211944/Z/18/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can cause prolonged and refractory diarrhea most commonly in immunocompromised patients, while immunocompetent individuals usually exhibit no symptoms or self-limited diarrhea. PATIENT CONCERNS: We herein report a case of chronic cystoisosporiasis in an immunocompetent patient. A 62-year-old man, who had been first diagnosed with cystoisosporiasis 15 years ago and had been treated with oral administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), complained of persistent watery diarrhea. He was negative for anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody and anti-human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody. DIAGNOSIS: Biopsy specimens from the duodenum revealed oocysts in the atrophic absorptive epithelium and protozoa were detected through stool examination, indicating the recurrence of cystoisosporiasis. Capsule endoscopy showed diffuse atrophic mucosa with white villi in the entire small intestine. We diagnosed him with chronic cystoisosporiasis that occurred in an immunocompetent adult. INTERVENTIONS: Since oral administration of TMP-SMX and ciprofloxacin were ineffective, the intravenous administration of TMP-SMX was initiated. OUTCOMES: Intravenous TMP-SMX exhibited a significant improvement. LESSONS: This case indicates that even immunocompetent individuals may develop recurrent and refractory cystoisosporiasis. Furthermore, intravenous treatment of antibiotic agents should be considered when the impaired absorptive ability from the small intestine is suspected.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Patients were divided into 2 groups using an RDW of 18.65% determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We analyzed the correlation of treatment responses and the RDW compared to common scoring systems, as well as the correlation of the RDW with disease outcome, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and demographic and laboratory factors affecting outcome. Univariate analysis and Cox regression analysis were used.The median age of patients was 40 years, and 51 patients (54.8%) were men. A high RDW could predict treatment response at 3 months (P = .03) and 6 months (P = .02). The RDW was significantly lower in patients who achieved molecular response by 3 months (P < .001) and complete cytogenetic response by 6 months (P = .001) than in those who did not respond. Patients with a high RDW (>18.65%, n = 35) had significantly worse 5-year OS (77.1% vs 96.6%; P = .008) and PFS (80.0% vs 98.3%; P = .002) than those with a low RDW (</=18.65%, n = 58). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a high RDW was an adverse predictor of OS (P = .005, HR (hazard ratio) = 9.741) and PFS (P = .009, HR = 16.735).The RDW is a readily available prognostic marker of outcome in patients with CML-CP and can predict treatment response to TKIs. Further larger and prospective studies are required.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

This study investigated the effect of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs-Ad) exosomes on T lymphocytes and its role in atherosclerosis (AS). METHODS: The exosomes were preliminarily isolated hMSCs-Ad and co-cultured with human H9 T lymphocytes. The effects of hMSCs-Ad exosomes on the proliferation and apoptosis of H9 were examined by performing functional experiments. The serum lipid level and inflammatory factor level in tail vein of mice were measured by biochemical analyzer and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. RESULTS: The hMSCs-Ad-derived exosomes up-regulate the expression of micro (mi)R-125b-1-3p in H9 and AS arterial tissues. miR-125b-1-3p shared a targeted binding site with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 11B gene (BCL11B). miR-125b-1-3p negatively regulated the expression of BCL11B in H9, and that knocking down BCL11B in H9 promoted its apoptosis. Injection of hMSCs-Ad-derived exosomes via the tail vein effectively reduced blood lipid and inflammatory factors, and that relieved the symptoms of AS in AS model mice. CONCLUSIONS: miR-125b-1-3p was expressed in hMSCs-Ad exosomes and can promote T lymphocyte apoptosis and alleviate AS by down-regulating BCL11B expression.

A rapid quantitative analytical method for BCKAs using pillar array columns was developed. alpha-Keto acids were labeled with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB), followed by their separation on octadecylsilane-treated pillar array columns with MeOH/H2O as the mobile phase. Five DMB-labelled alpha-keto acids including the internal standard were separated in 160 s. The lower limits of quantification for DMB-alpha-keto acids were 2-5 muM. The intra- and interday precisions were 2.9-6.6 % and 5.2-10.7 %, respectively. The developed method was applied to BCKA quantification in human plasma samples; KIV, KIC, and KMV concentrations were determined to be 13.8, 24.2, and 15.2 muM, respectively.

Epub 2021 Mar 29.,"The prognosis of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after allogeneic transplantation is dismal when treated with conventional approaches. While single-target CD19 or CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has achieved high complete remission (CR) rates in refractory/relapsed B-ALL, it could not maintain a durable remission in most patients. To prolong relapse-free survival, we sequentially combined CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cells to treat post-transplant relapsed B-ALL patients with both CD19/CD22 antigen expression on lymphoblasts. Patient-derived donor cells were collected to produce CAR-T cells that were transfected by lentiviral vectors encoding second generation CARs composed of CD3zeta and 4-1BB. The second T-cell infusion was scheduled at least 1 month, and usually within 6 months after the first CAR-T treatment. Twenty-seven adult and pediatric patients, including 11 (41%) with extramedullary diseases (EMD), received the first CD19 CAR-T and 23 (85%) achieved CR. Subsequently, 21 out of 27 patients received the second CD22 CAR-T and were followed-up for a median of 19.7 (range, 5.6-27.3) months; 14 cases remained in CR, seven relapsed and two of them died from disease progression; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed overall survival and event-free survival rates of 88.5% and 67.5%, respectively, at both 12 months and 18 months. CAR-T associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 23% of patients, with 8% new-onset acute GVHD and 15% persistent or worsened pre-existing cGVHD before CAR-T. This combination strategy of sequential CD19 and CD22 CAR-T therapy significantly improved the long-term survival in B-ALL patients who relapsed after transplantation.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],['ORCID: 0000-0001-9982-7099'],20210329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since information on clinical features and genetics of adult ALL in Japan is limited, we analyzed 215 subjects aged 16-65 years with untreated ALL enrolled in the Fukuoka Blood & Marrow Transplant Group studies ALL MRD 2002 and 2008. The prevalence of ALL was bimodal, with the larger group aged 56-65 years. Immunophenotypic characterization showed B-lineage is more frequent than T-lineage ALL (78.6 vs 13.0%), with age-related differences. The proportion with BCR-ABL1 rearrangement increased progressively with age, up to 55.7% among subjects aged over 56-65 years. Rearrangements involving the KMT2A gene, ETV6-RUNX1, and TCF3-PBX1 were rare in this study cohort. The overall incidence of hyperdiploidy was only 1.7%, and there were no cases with hypodiploidy. Overall survival varied by age and cytogenetics. Older subjects and those with BCR-ABL1 tended to have inferior outcomes. In this epidemiological study of Japanese adult ALL, the majority of subjects had B-lineage ALL, the T-cell phenotype was most frequent in those aged 16-25, and BCR-ABL1 rearrangement was very common, with prevalence increasing with age.

METHODS: Human ovarian cortex tissue with experimentally induced tumour foci of CML, AML and primary cells of AML patients were exposed to a 24h treatment with 1 muM GSK1070916, an AURKB/C inhibitor, to eliminate malignant cells by invoking mitotic catastrophe. After treatment, the inhibitor was removed, followed by an additional culture period of 6 days to allow any remaining tumour cells to form new foci. Ovarian tissue integrity after treatment was analysed by four different assays. Appropriate controls were included in all experiments. RESULTS: Foci of metastasised CML and AML cells in ovarian cortex tissue were severely affected by a 24h ex vivo treatment with an AURKB/C inhibitor, leading to the formation of multi-nuclear syncytia and large-scale apoptosis. Ovarian tissue morphology and viability was not compromised by the treatment, as no significant difference was observed regarding the percentage of morphologically normal follicles, follicular viability, glucose uptake or in vitro growth of small follicles between ovarian cortex treated with 1 muM GSK1070916 and the control. CONCLUSION: Purging of CML/AML metastases in ovarian cortex is possible by targeting the Mitotic Catastrophe Signalling Pathway using GSK1070916 without affecting the ovarian tissue. This provides a therapeutic strategy to prevent reintroduction of leukaemia and enhances safety of autotransplantation in leukaemia patients currently considered at high risk for ovarian involvement.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2612-5472'],20210316,PMC8266964,['NOTNLM'],"['Aurora kinases', 'Cryopreservation', 'GSK1070916', 'Myeloid leukaemia', 'Ovarian cortex', 'Purging']",['A19-1294/Merck KGaA'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"CONTEXT: The detection of low-level persistent or relapsed B-cell neoplasms, particularly post-therapy, can be challenging, often requiring multiple testing modalities. OBJECTIVE: Here we investigate the utility of CD19-based selection of neoplastic B-cells (CD19S) as an enrichment strategy to improve the detection rate of cytogenetic abnormalities in post-therapy samples of B-cell neoplasms, especially those with low-level disease. DESIGN: In a cohort largely comprised of post-therapy B-ALL and CLL samples, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on CD19-selected cells (CD19S FISH) in 128 specimens from 88 patients, and on non-selected cells (NS FISH) in a subset of cases. The FISH findings were compared with the concurrent flow cytometry (FC) results in all samples and molecular analysis in a subset. RESULTS: CD19S FISH was able to detect cytogenetic aberrations in 86.0% of post-therapy samples with evidence of disease as determined by routine or MRD FC, compared to 59.1% of samples by NS FISH. CD19S FISH detected significantly higher percentages of positive cells compared to NS FISH (p < 0.001). Importantly, CD19S FISH enabled the detection of emergent subclones (clonal evolution) associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: CD19S FISH can be useful in daily diagnostic practice. Compared to NS FISH, CD19S FISH is quantitatively and qualitatively superior for the detection of cytogenetic aberrations in B-cell neoplasms, which are important for risk stratification and optimal management of patients with B-cell neoplasms, especially in the relapsed setting. Although CD19S FISH has a diagnostic sensitivity inferior to that of MRD FC, the sensitivity of this modality is comparable to routine FC for the evaluation of low-level disease in the post-therapy setting. Moreover, CD19S samples are invaluable for additional molecular and genetic analyses.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epub 2021 Mar 16.,"Among cancers, leukemia is a multistep progression that involves genetic modifications of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells to cancerous cells. In recent times, leukemia cases and their mortality rate have increased rapidly. Therefore, the immense need for a therapeutic approach is crucial that can control this type of cancer. Phyllanthin is a lignan compound constituent from the Phyllanthus species and has numerous beneficial effects as a dietary component. The present study aims to determine the impact of phyllanthin on the MOLT-4 cytotoxic effect. MOLT-4 cells and MS-5 cells were cultured at different concentrations of phyllanthin (5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 muM/ml), and the viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. The level of reactive oxygen species, the membrane potential of mitochondria, apoptosis by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCF-DA), rhodamine, acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/propidium iodide (PI) staining, gene expression of signaling molecules, and protein levels were assessed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Phyllanthin did not show toxicity toward MS-5 cells and significantly decreased the cell viability of MOLT-4 cells with an IC50 value of 25 microM/ml. Also, phyllanthin induced the production of reactive oxygen species and led to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. AO/EB and DAPI/PI staining fluorescent image confirmed the induction of apoptosis by phyllanthin treatment. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2, NF-kappaB, and TNF-alpha decreased, but the proapoptotic Bax mRNA expression was increased. The phosphorylated protein levels of p-PI3K1/2, p-ERK1/2, and p-AKT were decreased, whereas the levels of p-p38 and p-JNKT1/2 increased. Our results confirmed that phyllanthin inhibits the MOLT-4 cells, increases apoptosis, and inhibits MOLT-4 migration and cell invasion. Therefore, phyllanthin can be used as a potential target for leukemia treatment.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5071-9860', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5204-5708']",20210316,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT/JNK signaling pathway', 'MOLT-4 cells', 'apoptosis', 'cyclin D1', 'phyllanthin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have shown that leukemic cells secrete C-chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), to disrupt the BMME resulting in loss of hematopoiesis and support of leukemic cell survival and proliferation. In this study, a murine model of blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia (bcCML) that expresses the translocation products BCR/ABL and Nup98/HoxA9 was used to determine the role of CCL3 in BMME regulation. Leukemic cells derived from CCL3(-/-) mice were shown to minimally engraft in a normal BMME, thereby demonstrating that CCL3 signaling was necessary to recapitulate bcCML disease. Further analysis showed disruption in hematopoiesis within the BMME in the bcCML model. To rescue the altered BMME, therapeutic inhibition of CCL3 signaling was investigated using bone-targeted nanoparticles (NP) to deliver Maraviroc, an inhibitor of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), a CCL3 receptor. NP-mediated Maraviroc delivery partially restored the BMME, significantly reduced leukemic burden, and improved survival. Overall, our results demonstrate that inhibiting CCL3 via CCR5 antagonism is a potential therapeutic approach to restore normal hematopoiesis as well as reduce leukemic burden within the BMME.",['(c) 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],,,PMC8594422,['NOTNLM'],"['*MIP1-alpha', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*drug delivery', '*nanoparticles', '*peptide', '*small molecule drug']","['R01 CA166280/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR069655/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002001/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA180615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR056696/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR064200/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA228391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS1748172'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient's previous blood group record was O Rh D positive, and he had a transfusion history of O Rh D positive red blood cells and platelets in other hospital. Initial immunohematological workup results, including adsorption and heat elution, were consistent with the O Rh D-positive blood group, but further workups on follow-up after the commencement of chemotherapy showed that his original blood group was A Rh D positive, in which the A antigen expression was previously masked by the underlying disease condition of the patient.

In a pivotal phase 3 study, patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly diagnosed, high-risk/secondary AML were randomized to receive CPX-351 or conventional 7+3 chemotherapy. In the primary endpoint analysis, CPX-351 demonstrated significantly prolonged median overall survival (OS) vs 7+3.

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood cancers are a significant cause of child deaths worldwide. This study examines the burden of 33 childhood cancers in 183 countries. METHODS: The estimates of age-, sex- and country-wise incidence and deaths due to 33 childhood cancers (below the age 15) for 183 countries were retrieved from GLOBOCAN 2018. The socioeconomic status of a country was measured by human development index (HDI). RESULTS: Globally, an estimated 200 166 cases and 74 956 deaths were attributed to childhood cancers in 2018. The age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) was 103 per million, whereas the age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) stood at 38 per million. ASIR was highest in high-income regions (e.g. North America: 182 per million); ASMR, however, was elevated in low- and medium-income countries (e.g. south-east Asia: 62 per million; North Africa: 51 per million).

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"In children with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) in whom disease progression occurs after an initial watch-and-wait strategy, prolonged low-dose chemotherapy using vinblastine and methotrexate (VBL-MTX) is currently the standard of care. These conventional drugs have been prospectively evaluated but their efficacy and safety profiles are limited, and alternative therapeutic options are therefore essential. Based on the results of clinical trials, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of DTF is currently considered only in adult patients. TKIs such as imatinib show superior therapeutic efficacy to VBL-MTX and tolerable short-term side effects for the treatment of adult DFT, supporting the concept of the use of TKIs for the treatment of paediatric DFT. Moreover, new-generation TKIs, such as pazopanib and sorafenib, have shown improved therapeutic efficacy compared to imatinib in adult non-comparative studies. A tolerable safety profile of TKI therapy in children with disease entities other than DTF, such as leukaemia, has been reported. However, the efficacy and, in particular, the long-term safety of TKIs, including childhood-specific aspects such as growth and fertility, for the treatment of children with DTF should be investigated prospectively, as DFT therapy requires long-term drug exposure.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2520-139X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1709-4448']",20210315,PMC8110972,,,,['2022/03/15 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"Emerging efficacy data have led to the emergency use authorization or approval of COVID-19 vaccines in several countries worldwide. Most trials of COVID-19 vaccines excluded patients with active malignancies, and thus data on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the vaccines in patients with cancer are currently limited. Given the risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, decisions regarding the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in patients participating in trials of investigational anticancer therapies need to be addressed promptly. Patients should not have to choose between enrolling on oncology clinical trials and receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical trial sponsors, investigators and treating physicians need operational guidance on COVID-19 vaccination for patients with cancer who are currently enrolled or might seek to enrol in clinical trials. Considering the high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer, the benefits of vaccination are likely to far outweigh the risks of vaccine-related adverse events. Herein, we provide operational COVID-19 vaccine guidance for patients participating in oncology clinical trials. In our perspective, continued quality oncological care requires that patients with cancer, including those involved in trials, be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination, which should not affect trial eligibility.",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1781-2518', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8970-7675', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5169-7085', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9201-3217', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0758-7911', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6064-6837']",20210315,PMC7957448,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA242845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA180964/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000371/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['COVID19 and Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group'],,,['Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2021 Mar 23;:.

We evaluated treatment outcomes of Taiwanese pediatric AML patients in the past 20 years. Overall, 860 de novo AML patients aged 0-18 years and registered in the Childhood Cancer Foundation of R.O.C during January 1996-December 2019 were included. Survival analysis was performed to identify factors that improved treatment outcomes. Regardless of treatment modalities used, patients during 2008-2019 had better 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates than patients during 1996-2007. For patients received the TPOG-AML-97A treatment, only 5-year OS rates were significantly different between patients diagnosed before and after 2008. Patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 had similar relapse-free survival rates, but 5-year OS rates were better during 2008-2019. However, the survival of patients who received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations (HSCT) did not differ significantly before and after 2008. For patients without relapse, the 5-year OS improved during 2008-2019. Non-relapse mortality decreased annually, and cumulative relapse rates were similar. In conclusion, 5-year EFS and OS rates improved during 2008-2019, though intensities of chemotherapy treatments were similar before and after 2008. Non-relapse mortality decreased gradually. Further treatment strategies including more intensive chemotherapy, novel agents' use, identification of high-risk patients using genotyping and minimal residual disease, early intervention of HSCT, and antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered for future clinical protocol designs in Taiwan.",,,20210315,PMC7960737,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence suggests that alterations in the non-hematopoietic microenvironment (bone marrow niche) can contribute to or initiate malignant transformation and promote disease progression. One of the key components of the bone marrow (BM) niche are BM stromal cells (BMSC) that give rise to osteoblasts and adipocytes. It has been shown that the balance between these two cell types plays an important role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. However, data on the number of BMSC and the regulation of their differentiation balance in the context of hematopoietic malignancies is scarce. We established a stringent flow cytometric protocol for the prospective isolation of a CD73(+) CD105(+) CD271(+) BMSC subpopulation from uncultivated cryopreserved BM of MDS and AML patients as well as age-matched healthy donors. BMSC from MDS and AML patients showed a strongly reduced frequency of CFU-F (colony forming unit-fibroblast). Moreover, we found an altered phenotype and reduced replating efficiency upon passaging of BMSC from MDS and AML samples. Expression analysis of genes involved in adipo- and osteogenic differentiation as well as Wnt- and Notch-signalling pathways showed significantly reduced levels of DLK1, an early adipogenic cell fate inhibitor in MDS and AML BMSC. Matching this observation, functional analysis showed significantly increased in vitro adipogenic differentiation potential in BMSC from MDS and AML patients. Overall, our data show BMSC with a reduced CFU-F capacity, and an altered molecular and functional profile from MDS and AML patients in culture, indicating an increased adipogenic lineage potential that is likely to provide a disease-promoting microenvironment.",,,20210315,PMC7961144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, considering the cytotoxicity of this plant and signs of anticancer activity in the plant, unfortunately, there is still no proper treatment for leukemia cancer cells. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the anticancer effect of hypericin in the treatment of leukemia cancer and its possible mechanism of action. Methods: In this study, the K562 cell line was treated with different concentrations of hypericin for 24 and 48 h. Detection of cell death was performed by 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2-tetrazolium bromide assay. The rate of cell apoptosis was measured by Annexin V/propidium iodide assay using flow cytometry. The expression of Bax, Bcl2, Myc, Mdm2, and P53 genes was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction test, and immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis was used for further evaluation of P53. Results: The results showed that hypericin has a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on the K562 (in much less dose compared with cisplatin). According to flow cytometry results, cell apoptosis after exposure to hypericin for 24 h was 53%, and ICC analysis on p53 confirmed this. Furthermore, after 24 h of exposure to hypericin with IC50 concentration, the expression of P53 and Bax genes increased and the expression of the Bcl2, Myc, and Mdm2 gene decreased. Conclusion: The results showed that hypericin exerts its cytotoxicity on K562 cancer cells by downregulating Mdm2 and Myc. Based on the data acquired from the present study and many investigations till now, hypericin can be a good option for leukemia cancer cells treatment.",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Herbal medicine', 'K562', 'Mdm2', 'Myc', 'hypericin']",,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a balance between production of ROS and antioxidative defense is disturbed, state of oxidative stress occurs. Oxidative stress leads to many diseases. There are few biomarkers that are used for better understanding how oxidative stress is involved in cancer pathophysiology. This review focuses on 8-hidroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidative enzymes as biomarkers for measurement of oxidative stress in different types of cancer. This review also deals with the product of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde (MDA), and across a variety of cancers. To address this aim, analysis of studies of breast, prostate, lung, colon, cervical, ovarian, brain, bladder, renal, thyroid cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been conducted. In general, levels of antioxidative enzymes are mostly lower in cancer patients, while 8-OHdG and MDA are higher. Further research is needed, with focus on correlation levels of these biomarkers and advancement of the disease. Moreover, all studies explored the idea of those biomarkers as a useful tool in determining the levels of oxidative stress.

The primary mechanism of action of these infused T cells is the direct killing of tumor cells expressing the cognate antigen. However, understanding why only some T cells are capable of killing, and identifying mechanisms that can improve killing has remained elusive. METHODS: To identify molecular and cellular mechanisms that can improve T-cell killing, we utilized integrated high-throughput single-cell functional profiling by microscopy, followed by robotic retrieval and transcriptional profiling. RESULTS: With the aid of mathematical modeling we demonstrate that non-killer CAR T cells comprise a heterogeneous population that arise from failure in each of the discrete steps leading to the killing. Differential transcriptional single-cell profiling of killers and non-killers identified CD137 as an inducible costimulatory molecule upregulated on killer T cells. Our single-cell profiling results directly demonstrate that inducible CD137 is feature of killer (and serial killer) T cells and this marks a different subset compared with the CD107a(pos) (degranulating) subset of CAR T cells. Ligation of the induced CD137 with CD137 ligand (CD137L) leads to younger CD19 CAR T cells with sustained killing and lower exhaustion. We genetically modified CAR T cells to co-express CD137L, in trans, and this lead to a profound improvement in anti-tumor efficacy in leukemia and refractory ovarian cancer models in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Broadly, our results illustrate that while non-killer T cells are reflective of population heterogeneity, integrated single-cell profiling can enable identification of mechanisms that can enhance the function/proliferation of killer T cells leading to direct anti-tumor benefit.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) in primary TNBCs are reported to be responsible for metastatic spread of the disease and resistance to chemotherapy, but no available therapeutic tools target BCSCs. We previously reported that the ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on BCSCs and that inhibition of its expression hampers TNBC growth. We therefore hypothesized that the anti-GD2 antibody dinutuximab (ch14.18) targets GD2(+) BCSCs and inhibits TNBC growth. METHOD: To test our hypothesis, we first determined GD2 expression via immunohistochemistry in frozen primary tumor samples from patients with TNBC (n=89). Then, we examined the effects of dinutuximab on TNBC cell adhesion, migration, and mammosphere formation in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo using TNBC cell-line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. RESULTS: We found that GD2 was expressed in around 60% of primary TNBC tumors at variable levels and was associated with worse overall survival of patients with TNBC (p=0.002). GD2 was found to be expressed in tumors and stroma, but normal ducts and lobules in adjacent tissues have shown low or no GD2 staining, indicating that GD2 is potentially a novel biomarker for tumor and its microenvironment. Treatment with dinutuximab significantly decreased adhesion and migration of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells. Moreover, dinutuximab treatment inhibited mTOR signaling, which has been shown to be regulated by GD2 in BCSCs. Dinutuximab also reduced tumor growth in nude mice bearing TNBC cell-line xenografts. Finally, dinutuximab in combination with activated natural killer cells inhibited tumor growth in a TNBC PDX model and improved overall survival of tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSIONS: Dinutuximab successfully eliminated GD2(+) cells and reduced tumor growth in both in vivo models. Our data provide proof-of-concept for the criticality of GD2 in BCSCs and demonstrate the potential of dinutuximab as a novel therapeutic approach for TNBC.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 15.,"Calicheamicin antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are effective therapeutics for leukemias with two recently approved in the United States: Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) targeting CD33 for acute myeloid leukemia and Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) targeting CD22 for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Both of these calicheamicin ADCs are heterogeneous, aggregation-prone, and have a shortened half-life due to the instability of the acid-sensitive hydrazone linker in circulation. We hypothesized that we could improve upon the heterogeneity, aggregation, and circulation stability of calicheamicin ADCs by directly attaching the thiol of a reduced calicheamicin to an engineered cysteine on the antibody via a disulfide bond to generate a linkerless and traceless conjugate. We report herein that the resulting homogeneous conjugates possess minimal aggregation and display high in vivo stability with 50% of the drug remaining conjugated to the antibody after 21 days. Furthermore, these calicheamicin ADCs are highly efficacious in mouse models of both solid tumor (HER2(+) breast cancer) and hematologic malignancies (CD22(+) non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Safety studies in rats with this novel calicheamicin ADC revealed an increased tolerability compared with that reported for Mylotarg.

MRTFA couples transcriptional regulation to actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and the transcriptional targets of the MRTFA-serum response factor complex include genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins as well as immediate early genes. Previous work has shown that MRTFA promotes the differentiation of many cell types, including various types of muscle cells and hematopoietic cells, and MRTFA's interactions with other protein partners broaden its cellular roles. However, despite being first identified as part of the recurrent t(1;22) chromosomal translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, the mechanisms by which MRTFA functions in malignant hematopoiesis have yet to be defined. In this review, we provide an in-depth examination of the structure, regulation, and known functions of MRTFA with a focus on hematopoiesis.

How this translates to the functional capacity of cells remains unclear. Here, we studied global protein abundance, phosphorylation, and protein maturation by proteolytic processing in 11 pediatric B- and T- cell ALL patients and 19 corresponding xenografts. METHODS: Xenograft models were generated for each pediatric patient leukemia. Mass spectrometry-based methods were used to investigate global protein abundance, protein phosphorylation, and limited proteolysis in paired patient and xenografted pediatric acute B- and T- cell lymphocytic leukemia, as well as in pediatric leukemia cell lines. Targeted next-generation sequencing was utilized to examine genetic abnormalities in patients and in corresponding xenografts. Bioinformatic and statistical analysis were performed to identify functional mechanisms associated with proteins and protein post-translational modifications. RESULTS: Overall, we found xenograft proteomes to be most equivalent with their patient of origin. Protein level differences that stratified disease subtypes at diagnostic and relapse stages were largely recapitulated in xenografts. As expected, PDXs lacked multiple human leukocyte antigens and complement proteins. We found increased expression of cell cycle proteins indicating a high proliferative capacity of xenografted cells. Structural genomic changes and mutations were reflected at the protein level in patients. In contrast, the post-translational modification landscape was shaped by leukemia type and host and only to a limited degree by the patient of origin. Of 201 known pediatric oncogenic drivers and drug-targetable proteins, the KMT2 protein family showed consistently high variability between patient and corresponding xenografts. Comprehensive N terminomics revealed deregulated proteolytic processing in leukemic cells, in particular from caspase-driven cleavages found in patient cells. CONCLUSION: Genomic and host factors shape protein and post-translational modification landscapes differently. This study highlights select areas of diverging biology while confirming murine patient-derived xenografts as a generally accurate model system.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1171-5864'],20210315,PMC7958471,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'N termini', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteome', 'Xenograft']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the function of circRNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still remains unknown. METHODS: In the current study, the RNA expression profiles were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. The differentially expressed RNAs were identified using R software and the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed using Cytoscape. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify the candidate circRNA-mediated aberrant signaling pathways. The hub genes were identified by MCODE and CytoHubba plugins of Cytoscape, and then a subnetwork regulatory module was established. RESULTS: A total of 27 circRNA-miRNA pairs and 208 miRNA-mRNA pairs, including 12 circRNAs, 24 miRNAs and 112 mRNAs were included in the ceRNA network. Subsequently, a subnetwork, including 4 circRNAs, 5 miRNAs and 6 mRNAs, was established based on related circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this work analyzes the characteristics of circRNA as competing endogenous RNA in AML pathogenesis, which would provide hints for developing novel prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for AML.",,,20210315,PMC7962291,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CircRNA', 'Competing endogenous RNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 89 non-APL children with AML treated in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The remission status was analyzed after chemotherapy, the long-term survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the influencing factors for the prognosis were detected using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was realized in 71 cases (79.8%) after the first course of treatment, 13 cases (14.6%) after the second course of treatment, and 5 cases (5.6%) after the third course of treatment. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate were 53.9% and 66.3%, respectively. The children were divided into low-risk group (n=31), middle-risk group (n=36) and high-risk group (n=22). In the three groups, the 5-year OS rate was 74.2%, 72.2% and 45.5%, respectively, while the 5-year EFS rate was 67.7%, 55.6% and 31.8%, respectively. Extramedullary infiltration at the time of initial diagnosis [HR=3.313 (95% CI: 1.748-13.664)], CD56+ [HR=1.592 (95% CI: 1.172-2.255)] and recurrence time <1 year [HR=3.040 (95% CI: 1.087-5.508)] were independent risk factors affecting the prognosis, and CR achieved after the first course [HR=0.786 (95% CI: 0.228-0.803)] was an independent factor improving the prognosis of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis is poor in non-APL children with AML who have extramedullary infiltration at the time of initial diagnosis, CD56+ and recurrence time <1 year, and CR achieved after the first course is an independent factor improving the prognosis of patients.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 46 children with relapsed or refractory B-ALL, who were admitted to and treated in our hospital from January 2015 to October 2017, and the remission and post-infusion adverse reactions were observed in all the patients. Besides, the survival of the patients was followed up and recorded, and the influencing factors for the prognosis were identified by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Bone marrows were routinely monitored after infusion of CAR-T cells. It was found that 35 children patients achieved morphologic complete remission, had a lower level of minimal residual disease (MRD) than that before treatment and exhibited a response rate of 76.1%, of whom there were 33 cases of MRD-negative remission. Different degrees of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 41 out of 46 children, consisting of 37 (80.4%) cases of grade I-II CRS and 4 (8.7%) cases of grade III-IV CRS. The concentrations of serum interleukin (IL)-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) obviously rose during CRS, and their peak values in the patients with grade III-IV CRS were notably higher than those in grade I-II CRS patients (p<0.001). At the end of follow-up, the median follow-up time was 28.2 months, and the 3-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 28.3% and 13.0%, respectively. The results also showed that tumor burden >/=5% prior to CAR-T cell therapy [hazard ratio (HR) =3.496, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.448-9.891, p=0.014] and non-combination with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) therapy (HR =0.890, 95% CI =0.543-0.904, p=0.025) were independent risk factors for the prognosis of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-cluster of classification (CD) 19 CAR-T cell therapy is safe and efficacious against relapsed or refractory B-ALL in children. Reducing the tumor burden before infusion of CAR-T cells and combined with HSCT after infusion are independent factors for improving the prognosis of the patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soluble forms (sPD-1/sPD-L1/sPD-L2) exist in the peripheral blood, but their biological and clinical significance is unclear. METHOD: Time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (TRIFMA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to measure sPD-1, sPD-L1, and sPD-L2 levels in serum from 131 lymphoma patients and 22 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Patients had higher sPD-1 and sPD-L2 levels than healthy individuals. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, patients with high International Prognostic Index score had higher sPD-1 levels and sPD-L2 levels correlated with subtype according to cell of origin. Compared to other lymphoma types, follicular lymphoma displayed higher sPD-1 and lower sPD-L1 levels along with lower ligand/receptor ratios. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to simultaneously characterize pretherapeutic sPD-1, sPD-L1, and sPD-L2 in a variety of lymphoma subtypes. The relation between higher sPD-1 levels and adverse prognostic factors suggests a possible biological role and potential clinical usefulness of sPD-1. Moreover, the reverse expression pattern in follicular lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma/leukemia may reflect biological information relevant for immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 pathway.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as a major adverse effect after blinatumomab therapy. Here, we evaluated the possible association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes, disease response, and CRS in r/r ALL patients who received blinatumomab between 2012 and 2017 at our center (n = 66), using patients' archived DNA samples. With a median duration of 9.5 months (range: 1-37), 37 patients (56.1%) achieved CR/CRi, 54 (81.8%) experienced CRS (G1: n = 35, G2: n = 14, G3: n = 5), and 9 (13.6%) developed neurotoxicity. By multivariable analysis, after adjusting for high disease burden, one SNP on IL2 (rs2069762), odds ratio (OR) = 0.074 (95% CI: NE-0.43, P = .01) and one SNP on IL17A (rs4711998), OR = 0.28 (95% CI: 0.078-0.92, P = .034) were independently associated with CR/CRi. None of the analyzed SNPs were associated with CRS. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a possible association between treatment response to blinatumomab and SNPs.

Care at specialized cancer centers (SCC: Children's Oncology Group affiliated and/or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center) has been found to improve outcomes in patients with leukemia, but studies have not considered location of care and outcomes in EWS and OS patients, an ideal group to evaluate given their specialized multidisciplinary treatment needs. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with primary EWS and OS (2000-2014) were identified using the California Cancer Registry linked with hospitalization data. Patients were divided into age groups (0-18, 19-39, >/=40 years), and classified on whether they received all versus part/none of their inpatient treatment at a SCC within 1 year of diagnosis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors associated with survival. RESULTS: There were 531 ES and 959 OS patients. Five-year overall survival was better for patients with EWS (all: 63% vs. part/none: 42%) and OS (all: 64% vs. part/none: 47%) who received all of their treatment at a SCC. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, receiving all inpatient cancer treatment at a SCC was associated with superior overall survival (EWS HR: 0.49, CI 0.37-0.67; OS HR: 0.78, CI 0.63-0.97). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that treatment for EWS and OS at a SCC is associated with significantly improved survival even after adjustment for known prognostic factors.

To exploit this altered metabolism, we assessed publicly available databases to identify FAO enzyme overexpression. Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD; ACADVL) was found to be overexpressed and critical to leukemia cell mitochondrial metabolism. Genetic attenuation or pharmacological inhibition of VLCAD hindered mitochondrial respiration and FAO contribution to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in decreased viability, proliferation, clonogenic growth, and AML cell engraftment. Suppression of FAO at VLCAD triggered an increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity that was insufficient to increase glycolysis but resulted in adenosine triphosphate depletion and AML cell death, with no effect on normal hematopoietic cells. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of VLCAD in AML cell biology and highlight a novel metabolic vulnerability for this devastating disease.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5440-6434', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9089-8816', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6492-681X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0096-5959', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8180-6457', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2431-4368']",,PMC8225921,,,['R01 DK078775/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],['2022/06/24 00:00'],,,,,['Blood. 2021 Jun 24;137(25):3465-3467.

We previously demonstrated the potent activity of immune checkpoint blockade in this clinical setting with ipilimumab or nivolumab. To define the molecular and cellular pathways by which CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab can reinvigorate an effective graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response, we integrated transcriptomic analysis of leukemic biopsies with immunophenotypic profiling of matched peripheral blood samples collected from patients treated with ipilimumab following HSCT on the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network 9204 trial. Response to ipilimumab was associated with transcriptomic evidence of increased local CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation. Systemically, ipilimumab decreased naive and increased memory T-cell populations and increased expression of markers of T-cell activation and costimulation such as PD-1, HLA-DR, and ICOS, irrespective of response. However, responding patients were characterized by higher turnover of T-cell receptor sequences in peripheral blood and showed increased expression of proinflammatory chemokines in plasma that was further amplified by ipilimumab. Altogether, these data highlight the compositional T-cell shifts and inflammatory pathways induced by ipilimumab both locally and systemically that associate with successful GVL outcomes.

OBJECTIVE.-: To characterize the clinicopathologic features of tMBL. DESIGN.-: During a 10-year period, we retrospectively identified non-bone marrow/peripheral blood cases with monotypic B cells detected by tissue-based flow cytometry but without an identifiable lymphomatous infiltrate on routine histopathology. We excluded cases with prior diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma or MBL. RESULTS.-: Fifty-four cases were identified (35 lymph node, 3 splenic, and 16 soft tissue/viscera). Forty-six cases were CLL-type, 2 were atypical CLL, and 6 were non-CLL. tMBL was detectable by immunohistochemistry in 14 cases (26%, all CLL-type). Concurrent blood flow cytometry, available in 10 cases, showed 4 with low-count MBL (3 CLL-type, 1 with non-CLL-type), 5 with high-count MBL (all CLL-type), and 1 case negative for clonal population. With median follow-up of 51 months, 2 patients had progression of disease (CLL, 68.7 months; and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 5.9 months). Patients with immunohistochemistry-detectable tMBL had increased monoclonal B cells per total lymphocyte events (P = .01), morphologic evidence of bone marrow involvement (P = .04), higher white blood cell count (P = .02), and increased absolute lymphocyte count (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS.-: tMBL spans an immunophenotypic spectrum similar to MBL, is detectable by immunohistochemistry in a minority of cases (often CLL immunophenotype), and is likely systemic in most cases. Development of overt lymphoma is uncommon but may occur, warranting clinical follow-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present two cases of ibrutinib-associated severe uveitis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. CASE DESCRIPTION: Our first case is a 65-year-old woman who presented with acute onset of bilateral fibrinous anterior uveitis 1 day after starting ibrutinib. Her vision was hand movements in the right eye and 20/120 in the left with hyperaemic discs and subretinal fluid. Ibrutinib was stopped and she experienced a significant improvement under local and oral steroid treatment. The second case is a 64-year-old male with subacute onset of bilateral hypertensive anterior uveitis with pupillary seclusion and right eye hyphaema. He was on ibrutinib for the past 9 months. His vision at presentation was 20/80 and 20/60 for the right and left eye, respectively. He responded poorly to local steroid treatment until ibrutinib was stopped due to cardiac side-effects, after which his uveitis resolved and treatment was stopped. CONCLUSION: The temporal association between changes in ibrutinib treatment and our patients' ocular inflammation suggests a causative link. Ibrutinib increases Th1-based immune responses which is proposed as a mechanism for drug-induced uveitis. Its antiplatelet effect may explain the fibrinous nature of the inflammation and hyphaema.",,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9914-2775'],20210315,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anterior uveitis', 'complications of uveitis', 'immunology', 'pharmacology', 'retina', 'systemic drug retinal toxicity', 'uveitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no standard treatment for locally advanced or metastasised malignant SFT (MSFT). Here, the case of a 17-year-old male patient with final pathology diagnosis of MSFT is reported. Preoperative biopsy pathology results suggested an Ewing sarcoma that was positive for CD99 antigen, vimentin, friend leukaemia integration 1 transcription factor, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2, and synaptophysin; and negative for CD34 antigen, S-100 protein (S-100), smooth muscle antigen, cytokeratin, and Wilms tumour 1 associated protein. The Ki67 positive rate was 8%, so the patient initially received eight cycles of conversion chemotherapy (vincristine, etoposide, ifosfamide and pirarubicin for one cycle, and vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide and etoposide for 7 cycles in total). The tumour shrunk significantly and was surgically removed. The final pathology diagnosis was MSFT that was positive for CD99 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6, and negative for CD34, tumour protein 63, S-100, desmin, and epithelial membrane antigen. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed no gene translocation in EWS RNA binding protein 1, SS18 subunit of BAF chromatin remodelling complex or FUS RNA binding protein. The patient finally accepted adjuvant radiotherapy of 5600 cGy. Disease-free survival has been > 1 year, with no recurrence or metastasis detected to date. MSFT is rare and treatment for locally advanced or metastatic MSFT remains controversial. The efficacy of the present therapeutic strategy requires further research.",,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5518-0529', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0716-4334']",,PMC7952856,['NOTNLM'],"['Malignant solitary fibrous tumour', 'adjuvant radiotherapy', 'case report', 'conversion chemotherapy', 'surgery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 10.,"Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are often present in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with an incidence rate of approximately 30%. Recently, many FLT3 inhibitors have been developed and exhibit positive preclinical and clinical effects against AML. However, patients develop resistance soon after undergoing FLT3 inhibitor treatment, resulting in short durable responses and poor clinical effects. This review will discuss the main mechanisms of resistance to clinical FLT3 inhibitors and summarize the emerging strategies that are utilized to overcome drug resistance. Basically, medicinal chemistry efforts to develop new small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors offer a direct solution to this problem. Other potential strategies include the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with other therapies and the development of multitarget inhibitors. It is hoped that this review will provide inspiring insights into the discovery of new AML therapies that can eventually overcome the resistance to current FLT3 inhibitors.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2189-9356', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0169-349X']",20210310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we explore similarities and differences between adult and pediatric CML with a focus on therapeutic advances and emerging clinical questions. RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric CML is effectively treated with long-term targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Newly diagnosed pediatric patients in chronic phase can now be treated with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While treatment-free remission is possible in adults in chronic phase with optimal response to therapy, data are currently insufficient to support stopping TKI in pediatrics outside of a clinical trial. Knowledge gaps remain regarding long-term and late effects of TKIs in pediatric CML. Targeted therapy has markedly improved outcomes for pediatric CML, while raising a number of clinical questions, including the possibility of treatment-free remission and long-term health implications of prolonged TKI exposure at a young age.",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3369-7516'],20210314,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*Childhood CML', '*Chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Pediatric CML', '*Targeted biologic therapy', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of large, phase 3 trials conducted in both the frontline and the relapsed/refractory settings resulted in the approval of ibrutinib for all CLL. Indeed, the role of chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is fast dwindling. The limitations of ibrutinib, e.g. the development of resistance-conferring C481 BTK mutations and the toxicity issues of atrial fibrillation and bleeding, in particular, have also become apparent with longer-term follow-up. This has spurred the development of second-generation, irreversible inhibitors with greater selectivity for BTK and third-generation, reversible BTK inhibitors to address C481 site mutations. The last 3 years have also witnessed enormous growth in the therapeutic role of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) antagonist venetoclax, initially approved (in 2016) only for patients with relapsed, 17p-deleted CLL. Venetoclax, in combination with CD20 antibodies, is currently approved for both treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory patients, regardless of genomic subtype. Robust results have also been reported for ibrutinib plus venetoclax, and ""triple"" combinations of a BTK inhibitor, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab are now being pursued. The major questions facing the field at present are how best to select patients for BTK inhibitor monotherapy versus venetoclax/obinutuzumab upfront, what to do after failure of both BTK inhibitor(s) and venetoclax, and the ideal way to integrate measurable residual disease data into decisions regarding treatment choice, duration, and discontinuation.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Gandhi V et al.'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3172-9166'],20210226,PMC7946394,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'acalabrutinib', 'duvelisib', 'ibrutinib', 'obinutuzumab', 'reversible BTK inhibitors', 'venetoclax', 'zanubrutinib']",,,"['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Jacqueline Barrientos', 'received honoraria from Janssen; had a consultancy/advisory role with AbbVie,', 'AstraZeneca, Bayer, Genentech, Gilead, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, and', 'Sandoz; received research funding from AbbVie, Oncternal Therapeutics, and', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company.No competing interests were disclosed.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Dec 21.,"Variation in the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been associated with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Because antibiotics induce dysbiosis, we examined the association of broad-spectrum antibiotics with subsequent aGVHD risk in pediatric patients undergoing HCT for acute leukemia. We performed a retrospective analysis in a dataset merged from 2 sources: (1) the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, an observational transplantation registry, and (2) the Pediatric Health Information Services, an administrative database from freestanding children's hospitals. We captured exposure to 3 classes of antibiotics used for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia: (1) broad-spectrum cephalosporins, (2) antipseudomonal penicillins, and (3) carbapenems. The primary outcome was grade II-IV aGVHD; secondary outcomes were grade III-IV aGVHD and lower GI GVHD. The adjusted logistic regression model (full cohort) and time-to-event analysis (subcohort) included transplantation characteristics, GVHD risk factors, and adjunctive antibiotic exposures as covariates. The full cohort included 2550 patients at 36 centers; the subcohort included 1174 patients. In adjusted models, carbapenems were associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV aGVHD in the full cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.51) and subcohort (sub hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.72), as well as with an increased risk of grade III-IV aGVHD (subHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.52). Early carbapenem exposure (before day 0) especially impacted aGVHD risk. For antipseudomonal penicillins, the associations with aGVHD were in the direction of increased risk but were not statistically significant. There was no identified association between broad-spectrum cephalosporins and aGVHD. Carbapenems, more than other broad-spectrum antibiotics, should be used judiciously in pediatric HCT recipients to minimize aGVHD risk. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying this association.",,,20201221,PMC7946150,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute graft versus host disease', '*antibiotics', '*carbapenems', '*pediatrics']","['P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 HL143153/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM075766/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 HL138660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['2022/02/01 00:00'],,['NIHMS1657273'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of all patients with AML (n = 65) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 7) who received the combination of HMA and venetoclax at our institution. Outcomes measured included complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rates, duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS). Patient mutational profiles and transfusion requirements were also assessed. Of 26 newly diagnosed AML patients, the CR/CRi rate was 53.8%. The median DOR and OS were 6.9 months and not reached, respectively. Of 39 R/R AML patients, the CR/CRi rate was 38.5%. The median DOR and OS were both 8.1 months. Responders to HMA and venetoclax were enriched for TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations, while nonresponders were associated with FLT3 and RAS mutations. Adaptive resistance was observed through various mechanisms including acquired RAS pathway mutations. Of transfusion-dependent patients, 12.2% and 15.2% achieved red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independence, respectively, while 44.8% and 35.1% of RBC and platelet transfusion independent patients, respectively, became transfusion dependent. In total 59.1% of patients developed a >/=grade 3 infection and 46.5% neutropenic fever. HMA + venetoclax can lead to impressive response rates with moderately durable remissions and survival. However, the benefits of this combination are diminished by the significant toxicities from infection, persistent cytopenias, and transfusion requirements.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

The 5-year cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis ranges from 11% to 20% in adolescents and young adults to 3% to 8% in patients aged 30 years and older. Most symptomatic patients have multiple joints affected, which in turn poses a risk factor for developing severe osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis has a multifactorial genesis. Treatment-associated risk factors for developing osteonecrosis depend on the therapeutic context including the use of glucocorticosteroids and the simultaneous and/or intensified use of asparaginase (ASP) which may, among others, exert its effect on blood supply to the bone through hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, bloodstream infections, and genetic factors may additionally impact the risk of osteonecrosis. In this article, the authors used the best available evidence in the literature to develop management recommendations for the use in the context of steroid and asparaginase containing regimens.

stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) has demonstrated encouraging results in younger patients. There is also an increasing need for haplo-SCT in older patients. However, the high risk of treatment-related mortality (TRM) in older patients is still a major concern. We aimed to investigate a novel conditioning regimen (Bu/Flu/Cy/ATG) followed by haplo-SCT in older patients. Method: This prospective, single-arm clinical trial was performed at Peking University Institute of Hematology, China. Patients were enrolled if they were (1) diagnosed with acute leukemia or MDS; (2) without MSD and MUD, and with HID available; and (3) age >/=55 years. The Bu/Flu/Cy/ATG regimen consisted of the following agents: Ara-C (2 g/m(2)/day, injected i.v.) on days-10 and-9; BU (9.6 mg/kg, injected i.v. in 12 doses) on days-8,-7, and-6; Flu (30 mg/m(2)/day, injected i.v.) from day-6 to day-2; Cy (1 g/m(2)/day, injected i.v.) on days-5 and-4; semustine (250 mg/m(2), orally) on day-3 and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) [2.5 mg/kg/day, rabbit, SangStat (Lyon, France)] on days-5,-4,-3, and-2. The primary endpoint was 1-year TRM. Results: From April 1, 2018 to April 10, 2020, a total of 50 patients were enrolled. All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment with complete donor chimerism. The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 aGVHD at day-100 was 22.0%. The cumulative incidences of CMV viremia and EBV viremia on day 100 were 68.0 and 20.0%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of TRM at 1-year was 23.3%. and the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 1 year after transplantation was 16.5%. The overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 1 year were 63.5 and 60.2%, respectively. The outcomes were also comparable with patients who received Bu/Cy/ATG regimen using a propensity score matching method. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study suggested that a novel conditioning regimen followed by haploidentical HSCT might be a promising option for older patients.

MPAL are at higher risk of induction failure. Lineage switch (B to M or vice versa) or persistence of only the lymphoid or myeloid clone is frequently observed in biphenotypic/bilineal cases, highlighting their lineage plasticity. The prognosis of MPAL remains bleak, with an event-free survival (EFS) of less than 50% in children. A lymphoid-type therapeutic approach appears to be more effective but failures to achieve complete remission (CR) remain significant. KMT2A fusions account for 75-80% of leukemia in infants under one year of age and remains a major pejorative prognostic factor in the Interfant-06 protocol with a 6 years EFS of only 36%. The search for other therapeutic approaches, in particular immunotherapies that are able to eradicate all MPAL clones, is a major issue. We describe here the feasibility and tolerance of the combination of two targeted immunotherapies, blinatumomab and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, in a 4-year-old infant with a primary refractory KTM2A-rearranged MPAL. Our main concern was to determine how to associate these two immunotherapies and we describe how we decided to do it with the parents' agreement. The good MRD response on the two clones made it possible to continue the curative intent with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant at 9 months of age. Despite a relapse at M11 post-transplant because of the recurrence of a pro-B clone retaining the initial lymphoid phenotype, the child is now 36 months old, in persistent negative MRD CR2 for 12 months after a salvage chemotherapy and an autologous CAR T cells infusion, with no known sequelae to date. This case study can thus lead to the idea of a sequential combination of two immunotherapies targeting two distinct leukemic subclones (or even a single biphenotypic clone), as a potential one to be tested prospectively in children MPAL and even possibly all KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Brethon, Lainey, Caye-Eude, Grain, Fenneteau, Yakouben,', 'Roupret-Serzec, Le Mouel, Cave and Baruchel.']",,20210226,PMC7953899,['NOTNLM'],"['blinatumomab', 'children', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'infant', 'mixed phenotype acute leukemia']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of different ANA patterns in cancers is poorly understood, especially in leukemia. This study aimed to investigate the association between ANA patterns and the outcome of leukemia in a retrospective cohort. Methods: A total of 429 adult patients initially diagnosed with leukemia at Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2014 to December 2018 were included in this study, including information on patients without positive ANAs at the time of initial diagnosis, preexisting autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, etc. The data were retrieved up to December 2020. The final sample included 196 adult patients. The risk of death outcome according to ANA patterns was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and the overall survival for ANA patterns was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curve. Results: ANAs with a nucleolar pattern versus negative ANA were associated with a two-fold increased risk of death outcome in leukemia, independent of sex, age, leukemia immunophenotype, cytogenetic abnormality, treatment, and blood transfusion. Further analysis revealed that the association was more significant in elder patients (>/=60 years) and patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor or chemotherapy (P for interaction = 0.042 and 0.010). Notably, the patients with a nucleolar pattern had shorter survival than the patients with a non-nucleolar pattern or without ANA (p < 0.001). Conclusion: ANAs with a nucleolar pattern are a significant predictor of poor prognosis, providing clues for prognostic assessment in patients with leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Zhao, Liu, Kang and Cai.']",,20210226,PMC7952743,['NOTNLM'],"['antinuclear antibody', 'cohort', 'leukemia', 'overall survival', 'the nucleolar pattern']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This includes stimulation of anti-tumor immunity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. Treatment of AML and MDS patients with the HMAs confers upregulation of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) expression including the highly immunogenic CTA NY-ESO-1. This leads to activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells for elimination of cancer cells, and it establishes the feasibility to combine cancer vaccine with HMAs to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. Moreover, decitabine and guadecitabine induce the expression of immune checkpoint molecules in AML cells. In this review, the accumulating knowledge on the immunopotentiating properties of decitabine and guadecitabine in AML and MDS patients are presented and discussed. In summary, combination of decitabine or guadecitabine with NY-ESO-1 vaccine enhances vaccine immunogenicity in AML patients. T cells from AML patients stimulated with dendritic cell (DC)/AML fusion vaccine and guadecitabine display increased capacity to lyse AML cells. Moreover, decitabine enhances NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity or CD123-specific chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells antileukemic activities against AML. Furthermore, combination of either HMAs with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy may circumvent their resistance. Finally, clinical trials of either HMAs combined with cancer vaccines, NK cell infusion or ICB therapy in relapsed/refractory AML and high-risk MDS patients are currently underway, highlighting the promising efficacy of HMAs and immunotherapy synergy against these malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wong, Hassan and Yaacob.']",,20210225,PMC7947882,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer vaccine', 'chimeric antigen receptor-engineered (CAR)-T cell therapy', 'hypomethylating agents', 'immune checkpoint', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have discussed the historical aspects of APL treatment along with the challenges associated with chemotherapy-based approaches and our experience with the use of single agent arsenic trioxide (ATO) which was one of the first successful, non-chemotherapy approaches used for APL. Subsequently, we have reviewed the data from major clinical trials in low-intermediate risk APL and high risk APL which guide the current clinical practice in APL management. With accumulating data on oral ATO, we postulate that the treatment for low-intermediate risk APL will be a completely oral ATO + ATRA regimen in the future. While for high-risk APL, we believe that minimal anthracycline use with ATO + ATRA might become the standard of care soon.

Methods This retrospective study analyzed outcomes after induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma at a tertiary care cancer center from January 2015 to December 2016. Information regarding demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory investigations were extracted and reviewed. Results Of the total 160 patients, 110 were males, and the mean age of the sample was 4.6 +2.8 years. B-cell leukemia (pre-B-ALL) was diagnosed in 84% (n=134), while 10% (n=6) had acute T-cell leukemia (pre-T-ALL) and 6% (n=10) had lymphoma. Sixteen patients (10%) died within the defined induction period, with 14 deaths occurring due to infections and two deaths resulting from chemotherapy-related toxicity. Conclusion Based on our findings, there is a significant prospect of mortality from infections during induction chemotherapy in patients with pediatric hematological malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Wali et al.']",,20210207,PMC7943861,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'induction chemotherapy', 'lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'mortality']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is involved in the pathogeny of multiple entities (hematological diseases, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular and renal pathology etc.), as well as in the pharmacokinetics of specific treatments for these pathologies. Chronic myeloid leukemia is a chronic myeloproliferative disease for which current standard treatment is BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The innovation of this therapy has significantly improved life expectancy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, but in some cases, this treatment becomes ineffective, installing the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy. There were described two types of tyrosin kinase inhibitors resistance: primary and secondary resistance. In the present paper we proposed to evaluate the involvement of oxidative in the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy, in the clonal instability in chronic myeloid leukemia and in the progression of the disease to an advanced stage. We concluded that oxidative stress can play a dual role in the evolution of chronic myeloid leukemia: on the one hand it can promote genomic instability and accelerate the progression of the disease to advanced stages associated with tyrosin kinase inhibitors resistance and, on the other hand, it can contribute to leukemic cell apoptosis. It seems to be outlined a fragile balance between the pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of the reactive oxygen species, closely related to their level in the leukemic cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014, Medical University Publishing House Craiova.']",,20201231,PMC7948018,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Oxidative stress', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Therapeutic resistance', 'Tyrosin-kinase inhibitors']",,,['None to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the current improvements in the prognosis of this malignancy, it always ends with relapse, and therefore new therapy approaches for destroying resistant cancer cells are needed. Presently, there is great hope being placed in the use of immunotherapy against refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma which is unresponsive to any other currently known drugs. The most promising one is CAR-T cell therapy which has already shown tremendous success in treating other malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and could potentially be administered to multiple myeloma patients. CAR-T cells equipped with receptors against BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), which is a surface antigen that is highly expressed on malignant cells, are now of great interest in this field with significant results in clinical trials. Furthermore, CAR-T cells with other receptors and combinations of different strategies are being intensively studied. However, even with CAR-T cell therapy, the majority of patients eventually relapse, which is the greatest limitation of this therapy. Serious adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity should also be considered as possible side effects of CAR-T cell therapy. Here, we discuss the results of CAR-T cell therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, where we describe its main advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, we also describe the current results that have been obtained on using combinations of CAR-T cell therapies with other drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Jasinski, Basak and Jedrzejczak.']",,20210224,PMC7943463,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)', '*CAR-T cells', '*T lymphocyte', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*immunotherapy', '*multiple myeloma']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WAS patients suffer from microthrombocytopenia, characterized by a diminished number and size of platelets, though the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we identified FLI1 as a direct transcriptional regulator of WAS and its binding partner WIP. Depletion of either WAS or WIP in human erythroleukemic cells accelerated cell proliferation, suggesting tumor suppressor function of both genes in leukemia. Depletion of WAS/WIP also led to a significant reduction in the percentage of CD41 and CD61 positive cells, which mark committed megakaryocytes. RNAseq analysis revealed common changes in megakaryocytic gene expression following FLI1 or WASP knockdown. However, in contrast to FLI1, WASP depletion did not alter expression of late-stage platelet-inducing genes. N-WASP was not regulated by FLI1, yet its silencing also reduced the percentage of CD41+ and CD61+ megakaryocytes. Moreover, combined knockdown of WASP and N-WASP further suppressed megakaryocyte differentiation, indicating a major cooperation of these related genes in controlling megakaryocytic cell fate. However, unlike WASP/WIP, N-WASP loss suppressed leukemic cell proliferation. WASP, WIP and N-WASP depletion led to induction of FLI1 expression, mediated by GATA1, and this may mitigate the severity of platelet deficiency in WAS patients. Together, these results uncover a crucial role for FLI1 in megakaryocyte differentiation, implicating this transcription factor in regulating microthrombocytopenia associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Sample, Gajendran, Kapranov, Liu, Hu, Zacksenhaus, Li,', 'Hao and Ben-David.']",,20210226,PMC7953068,['NOTNLM'],"['*FLI1', '*N-WASP', '*WASP', '*WIP', '*Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome', '*immunodeficiency', '*megakaryopoiesis', '*microthrombocytopenia']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several small-molecule drugs have been developed for the treatment of HCC, the choice of an agent for patients who require systemic chemotherapy at an advanced stage is still limited. The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved tumor suppressive pathway commonly dysregulated in HCC, which makes it a promising target for anti-HCC therapies. Homoharringtonine (HHT) is an FDA-approved anti-leukemia drug with proven strong anti-tumor activity in solid tumors. In this study, we found that HHT could significantly inhibit HCC cell growth by suppressing cell proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, HHT repressed cell invasion and migration remarkably. Additionally, HHT induced cell cycle arrest at S phase and promoted apoptosis. Most importantly, we showed that HHT-induced apoptosis was a consequence of the Hippo pathway activation.

Catalytic and anti-cancer activities of the poly-peptide were evaluated using standard in vitro biochemical methods. Medium nutrients were selected by one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach while Plackett-Burman design (PBD) screened potential factors for optimization. Path of steepest ascent (PSA) and response surface methodology (RSM) of a Min-Run-Res V fractional factorial of a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to optimize factor levels towards improved enzyme activity. A multi-objective approach using desirability function generated through predictor importance and weighted coefficient methodology was adopted for optimization. The approach set optimum bioprocess conditions as 49.55 g/L molasses, 64.98% corn steep liquor, 44.23 g/L asparagine, 1.73 g/L potassium, 0.055 g/L manganese and 0.043 g/L chromium (III) ions, at a composite desirability of 0.943 and an L-asparaginase activity of 5216.95U. The Sephadex-200 partially-purified polypeptide had a specific activity of 476.84 U/mg; 0.087U glutaminase activity, 36.46% yield and 20-fold protein purification. Anti-cancer activity potentials of the catalytic poly-peptide were dose-dependent with IC50 (microg/mL): 4.063 (HL-60), 13.75 (HCT-116), 15.83 (HeLa), 11.68 (MCF-7), 7.61 (HepG-2). The therapeutic enzyme exhibited 15-fold more cytotoxicity to myeloid leukemia cell line than to normal (HEK 238 T) cell. Optimum temperature and pH for activity were within physiological range. However, significant interactions between exposure time and levels of each of temperature and pH made interpretations of residual enzyme activities difficult. The manganese-dependent L-asparaginase from Aspergillu s candidus UCCM 00117 is recommended for further anticancer drug investigations.","['(c) The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2021.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9601-5546', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6752-7048', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2027-9825', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5436-9434', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7844-9954', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2196-471X']",20210309,PMC7942987,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-cancer activity', 'Aspergillus candidus', 'L-Asparaginase activity', 'Renewable substrates', 'Selectivity index', 'Sequential optimization']",,,"['Conflict of interestThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare that are', 'relevant to the content of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are no universally approved revaccination guidelines for non-transplanted oncology patients. This study aimed to share our experience of revaccination in childhood cancer survivors to plan future vaccination schedules. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in a Pediatric Oncology Department of a university-affiliated hospital. Patients who were diagnosed with malignancy other than leukemia constituted the study population. Patients were directed for revaccination 6 months after the cessation of treatment. Revaccination was performed according to patients' vaccination status before chemotherapy and seronegativity. Results: Of the 64 patients in the study, 44 (68.75%) were boys. The mean age at the time of diagnosis and at start of vaccination was 8.8+/-5.3 years and 10.6+/-5.1 years, respectively. Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most common diagnosis. The vaccination schedule of 7 patients was interrupted because of chemotherapy; after completing the missing vaccine doses, the serology of 2 patients was negative for at least 2 antigens. The vaccination schedule of 57 patients was completed before beginning chemotherapy and 52 of them were seronegative for at least 1 antigen. No adverse reactions or life-threatening infections were observed because of vaccinations. Conclusion: There are different approaches when vaccinating the oncology patients after chemotherapy. Watching out for the four touchstones mentioned in our study will protect the patient and do no harm. More studies are needed to constitute universal and standardized revaccination guidelines for these patients.","['(c)Copyright 2021 by the Ataturk University School of Medicine - Available online', 'at www.eurasianjmed.com.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1283-1712', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1329-1287', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7479-7444']",,PMC7929592,['NOTNLM'],"['Vaccination', 'chemotherapy', 'pediatric oncology']",,,['Conflict of Interest: The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCL is characterized by peripheral blood involvement by malignant plasma cells and an aggressive clinical course leading to poor survival. There is considerable overlap between MM and PCL with respect to clinical, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features, but circulating plasma cell count exceeding 20% of peripheral blood leukocytes or an absolute plasma cell count of >2000/mm(3) distinguishes it from MM. After initial stabilization and diagnosis confirmation, treatment of PCL in a fit patient typically includes induction combination chemotherapy containing novel agents typically, with proteasome inhibitors (such as bortezomib) and immunomodulatory drugs (eg, lenalidomide), followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and multidrug maintenance therapy using novel agents post-HSCT. Long-term outcomes have improved employing this strategy but the prognosis for non-HSCT candidates remains poor and new approaches are needed for such PCL patients not eligible for HSCT. Here, we report a case of primary PCL, and a comprehensive and up to date review of the literature for diagnosis and management of PCL. We also present the findings of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. Since PCL is often associated with extra-medulary disease, including PET scan at the time of staging and restaging may be a novel approach particularly to evaluate the extra-medullary disease sites.",['(c) The Author(s) 2021.'],"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4641-2217', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6914-7439']",20210226,PMC7917418,['NOTNLM'],"['Plasma cell leukemia', 'autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'multiple myeloma', 'novel agents']",,,"['Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

diffuse large-B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients suffer from refractory disease or relapse after R-CHOP first-line treatment. Many ongoing clinical trials for DLBCL patients involve microtubule targeting agents (MTAs), however, their anticancer activity is limited by severe side effects. Therefore, we chose to improve the therapeutic window of the MTA monomethyl auristatin E developing a nanoconjugate, T22-AUR, that selectively targets the CXCR4 receptor, which is overexpressed in many DLBCL cells (CXCR4(+)) and associated with poor prognosis. Methods: The T22-AUR specificity towards CXCR4 receptor was performed by flow cytometry in different DLBCL cell lines and running biodistribution assays in a subcutaneous mouse model bearing CXCR4(+) DLBCL cells. Moreover, we determined T22-AUR cytotoxicity using cell viability assays, cell cycle analysis, DAPI staining and immunohistochemistry. Finally, the T22-AUR antineoplastic effect was evaluated in vivo in an extranodal CXCR4(+) DLBCL mouse model whereas the toxicity analysis was assessed by histopathology in non-infiltrated mouse organs and by in vitro cytotoxic assays in human PBMCs. Results: We demonstrate that the T22-AUR nanoconjugate displays CXCR4-dependent targeting and internalization in CXCR4(+) DLBCL cells in vitro as well as in a subcutaneous DLBCL mouse model. Moreover, it shows high cytotoxic effect in CXCR4(+) DLBCL cells, including induction of G2/M mitotic arrest, DNA damage, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Furthermore, the nanoconjugate shows a potent reduction in lymphoma mouse dissemination without histopathological alterations in non-DLBCL infiltrated organs. Importantly, T22-AUR also exhibits lack of toxicity in human PBMCs. Conclusion: T22-AUR exerts in vitro and in vivo anticancer effect on CXCR4(+) DLBCL cells without off-target toxicity. Thus, T22-AUR promises to become an effective therapy for CXCR4(+) DLBCL patients.",['(c) 2021 Falgas et al.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1438-8515', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2661-9525']",20210305,PMC7944372,['NOTNLM'],"['DLBCL', 'MMAE', 'nanomedicine', 'targeted drug delivery']",,,"['AV, EV, UU, RM, IC are cited as inventors in three patents: PCT/EP2018/061732,', 'covering Nanostructured Proteins and uses thereof; PCT/EP2018/069303, covering', 'Therapeutic Nanoconjugates and uses thereof; and PCT/EP2012/050513', '(WO2012/095527), covering Methods and reagents for efficient and targeted', 'delivery of therapeutic molecules to CXCR4 cells, all licensed to Nanoligent.

We report this case to describe florid interstitial hemorrhages as a novel feature of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. CASE REPORT A young man presented with intermittent visible hematuria and acute kidney injury after a course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate for upper respiratory tract illness. Renal biopsy demonstrated acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with multifocal intense interstitial hemorrhages, intratubular red blood cells, and red blood cell casts. At the same time, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Leukemic cellular infiltration and other potential causes of tubulointerstitial nephritis were ruled out. CONCLUSIONS Drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis can be associated with florid interstitial hemorrhages.

Some cell signaling pathways play an important role in AML survival, proliferation and self-renewal properties and are abnormally activated or suppressed in LSCs. This includes the NF-kappaB, Wnt/beta-catenin, Hedgehog, Notch, EGFR, JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, TGF/SMAD and PPAR pathways. This review aimed to discuss these pathways as molecular targets for eliminating AML LSCs. Herein, inhibitors/activators of these pathways were summarized as a potential new anti-AML therapy capable of eliminating LSCs to guide future researches.

Epub 2021 Feb 24.,"BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are hematologic malignancies that mostly affect the elderly and have a poor prognosis. Azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) are the most widely used hypomethylating agents. However, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared AZA and DAC head to head in MDS or AML. This study intended to conduct a network meta-analysis to compare the 2 drugs to provide more guidance using evidence-based medicine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search for RCTs was performed till July 31, 2020. The network meta-analysis was conducted using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the incidence of adverse events, and the secondary endpoints were complete remission (CR) rate, overall remission rate (ORR), and AML-free survival. There were 6 RCTs with 1072 MDS patients, and 3 RCTs with 1256 AML patients. RESULTS: In MDS, AZA showed better AML-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.9), whereas DAC had the possibility of achieving better CR and ORR, and AZA had the possibility of obtaining better OS with lower toxicity. As for elderly AML patients, DAC had the possibility of achieving superior CR, ORR, and OS, while the toxicity was relatively higher. Furthermore, subgroup analysis for patients >/= 75 years old or of high risk in MDS suggested that AZA achieved better OS. CONCLUSION: For MDS, especially patients with intermediate or high risk disease with advanced age and poor general condition, AZA may be a better choice, while DAC may be of more benefit in elderly AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism by which T cells link information regarding nutrient supply to clonal expansion and effector function is still enigmatic. Herein, we report that the metabolic sensor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical link between cellular energy demand and translational activity and, thus, orchestrates optimal expansion of T cells in vivo. AMPK deficiency did not affect T cell fate decision, activation, or T effector cell generation; however, the magnitude of T cell responses in murine in vivo models of T cell activation was markedly reduced. This impairment was global, as all T helper cell subsets were similarly sensitive to loss of AMPK which resulted in reduced T cell accumulation in peripheral organs and reduced disease severity in pathophysiologically as diverse models as T cell transfer colitis and allergic airway inflammation. T cell receptor repertoire analysis confirmed similar clonotype frequencies in different lymphoid organs, thereby supporting the concept of a quantitative impairment in clonal expansion rather than a skewed qualitative immune response. In line with these findings, in-depth metabolic analysis revealed a decrease in T cell oxidative metabolism, and gene set enrichment analysis indicated a major reduction in ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA translation in AMPK-deficient T cells. We, thus, provide evidence that through its interference with these delicate processes, AMPK orchestrates the quantitative, but not the qualitative, manifestation of primary T cell responses in vivo.",['(c) 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2495-790X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9328-4871']",,PMC8252394,['NOTNLM'],"['*AMPK', '*T cell', '*cellular metabolism', '*translation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Apr 14.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of malignant hematologic diseases characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, which may lead to chronic anemia and transfusion dependency, with up to 30% of patients progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Studies suggest transfusion dependency may impact overall survival (OS); however, there is a lack of evidence concerning the association between transfusion status (TS) and OS in patients with MDS who become transfusion independent (TI) after treatment. In addition, the holistic impact of TS on other clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes has not been well understood. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to understand this impact. Ten studies were included and showed consistent decrease in OS in transfusion dependent (TD) compared with TI patients. These findings were confirmed by a meta-analysis (MA) reporting better OS prognosis for TI patients. A second SLR was conducted to understand the association between TS and other clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes. Twenty-eight studies were included and showed better prognosis for other outcomes, including AML progression and leukemia-free survival for TI patients. Risk of AML progression and cumulative non-leukemic death assessed by the MA showed a trend toward worse prognosis and higher risk of AML progression for TD patients. Lower healthcare resource utilization, better quality of life, and reduced non-leukemic death for TI patients were observed. Studies not eligible for MA also showed better clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes for TI patients. These findings contribute to understanding the association between transfusion dependence and OS among other outcomes in patients with MDS.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2021 Mar 14.,"CD19-directed treatment in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) frequently leads to the downmodulation of targeted antigens. As multicolour flow cytometry (MFC) application for minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment in BCP-ALL is based on B-cell compartment study, CD19 loss could hamper MFC-MRD monitoring after blinatumomab or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy. The use of other antigens (CD22, CD10, CD79a, etc.) as B-lineage gating markers allows the identification of CD19-negative leukaemia, but it could also lead to misidentification of normal very-early CD19-negative BCPs as tumour blasts. In the current study, we summarized the results of the investigation of CD19-negative normal BCPs in 106 children with BCP-ALL who underwent CD19 targeting (blinatumomab, n = 64; CAR-T, n = 25; or both, n = 17). It was found that normal CD19-negative BCPs could be found in bone marrow after CD19-directed treatment more frequently than in healthy donors and children with BCP-ALL during chemotherapy or after stem cell transplantation. Analysis of the antigen expression profile revealed that normal CD19-negative BCPs could be mixed up with residual leukaemic blasts, even in bioinformatic analyses of MFC data. The results of our study should help to investigate MFC-MRD more accurately in patients who have undergone CD19-targeted therapy, even in cases with normal CD19-negative BCP expansion.",['(c) 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3450-0498', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9634-5828', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9816-2299', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1735-0093', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0889-6986']",20210314,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*CD19 targeting', '*CD19-negative precursors', '*flow cytometry', '*minimal residual disease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TG02 is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that simultaneously targets both of these facets of CLL pathogenesis. First, its inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 blocked the activation of RNA polymerase II and transcription. This led to the depletion of Mcl-1 and rapid induction of apoptosis in the primary CLL cells. This mechanism of apoptosis was independent of CLL prognostic factors or prior treatment history, but dependent on the expression of BAX and BAK. Second, TG02, which inhibits the members of the BCR signaling pathway such as Lck and Fyn, blocked BCR-crosslinking-induced activation of NF-kappaB and Akt, indicating abrogation of BCR signaling. Finally, the combination of TG02 and ibrutinib demonstrated moderate synergy, suggesting a future combination of TG02 with ibrutinib, or use in patients that are refractory to the BCR antagonists. Thus, the dual inhibitory activity on both the CLL survival pathway and BCR signaling identifies TG02 as a unique compound for clinical development in CLL and possibly other B cell malignancies.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7129-4005', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7290-2711', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2086-6031', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1449-4286', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6177-7572']",20210313,PMC7956145,,,"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 13.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy comprised of molecular subtypes largely characterized by aneuploidy or recurring chromosomal rearrangements. Despite extensive information on the ALL transcriptome and methylome, there is limited understanding of the ALL chromatin landscape. We therefore mapped accessible chromatin in 24 primary ALL cell biospecimens comprising three common molecular subtypes (DUX4/ERG, ETV6-RUNX1 and hyperdiploid) from patients treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Our findings highlight extensive chromatin reprogramming in ALL, including the identification ALL subtype-specific chromatin landscapes that are additionally modulated by genetic variation. Chromatin accessibility differences between ALL and normal B-cells implicate the activation of B-cell repressed chromatin domains and detail the disruption of normal B-cell development in ALL. Among ALL subtypes, we uncovered roles for basic helix-loop-helix, homeodomain and activator protein 1 transcription factors in promoting subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and distinct gene regulatory networks. In addition to chromatin subtype-specificity, we further identified over 3500 DNA sequence variants that alter the ALL chromatin landscape and contribute to inter-individual variability in chromatin accessibility. Collectively, our data suggest that subtype-specific chromatin landscapes and gene regulatory networks impact ALL biology and contribute to transcriptomic differences among ALL subtypes.","['(c) 2021.

Nevertheless, current treatment continues to use short-term applications of 6-TG with only sparse information on toxicity. 6-TG is metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) which underlies clinically relevant genetic polymorphism. We analyzed the association between hepatic SOS reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) and short-term 6-TG application in 3983 pediatric ALL patients treated on trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 (derivation cohort) and defined the role of TPMT genotype in this relationship. We identified 17 patients (0.43%) with hepatic SOS, 13 of which with short-term exposure to 6-TG (P < 0.0001). Eight of the 13 patients were heterozygous for low-activity TPMT variants, resulting in a 22.4-fold (95% confidence interval 7.1-70.7; P </= 0.0001) increased risk of hepatic SOS for heterozygotes in comparison to TPMT wild-type patients. Results were supported by independent replication analysis. All patients with hepatic SOS after short-term 6-TG recovered and did not demonstrate residual symptoms. Thus, hepatic SOS is associated with short-term exposure to 6-TG during treatment of pediatric ALL and SOS risk is increased for patients with low-activity TPMT genotypes.",['(c) 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 13.,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare, heterogeneous myeloid malignancy classified as a myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) overlap syndrome by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its initial presentation can be incidental or associated with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative symptoms and up to 20% of patients harbor a concurrent inflammatory or autoimmune condition. Persistent monocytosis is the hallmark of CMML but diagnosis can be challenging. Increased understanding of human monocyte subsets, chromosomal abnormalities, and somatic gene mutations have led to more accurate diagnosis and improved prognostication. A number of risk stratification systems have been developed and validated but using those that incorporate molecular information such as CMML Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS)-Mol, Mayo Molecular, and Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM) are preferred. Symptom-directed approaches forms the basis of CMML management. Outcomes vary substantially depending on risk ranging from observation for a number of years to rapidly progressive disease and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. Patients who are low risk but with symptoms from cytopenias or proliferative features such as splenomegaly may be treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or cytoreductive therapy, respectively, with the goal of durable symptoms control. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation should be considered for intermediate to high risk patients. The lack of effective pharmaceutical options has generated interest in novel therapeutics for this disease, and early phase clinical trial results are promising.",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2872-1961', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4707-7916']",20210313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDGFRA/B-rearranged patients usually manifest as imatinib-sensitive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). FGFR1- and JAK2- rearranged cases may manifest as MPNs or aggressive lymphomas/leukemias and historically have had a dismal prognosis, although clinical trials with targeted treatment are promising. A negative screen for M/Leo in a patient with myeloid features should prompt consideration of a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic leukemia-not otherwise specified.

Given the unusual clinical and imagiological evolution even after decompressive craniectomy, we suspected cerebrospinal fluid hypotension. Spine imaging revealed signs of post-lumbar puncture fistula; we hence performed a blind blood patch. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing cerebrospinal fluid hypotension in critical pediatric patients is important. Less-conventional life-saving measures, such as a blind blood patch, may be considered in such patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia.

Epub 2021 Mar 13.,"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) reprograms the surrounding bone marrow (BM) stroma to create a leukaemia-supportive niche. To elucidate the contribution of immune cells to the leukaemic microenvironment, we investigated the involvement of monocyte/macrophage compartments, as well as several recruitment pathways in B-ALL development. Immunohistochemistry analyses showed that CD68-expressing macrophages were increased in leukaemic BM biopsies, compared to controls and predominantly expressed the M2-like markers CD163 and CD206. Furthermore, the ""non-classical"" CD14(+) CD16(++) monocyte subset, expressing high CX3CR1 levels, was significantly increased in B-ALL patients' peripheral blood. CX3CL1 was shown to be significantly upregulated in leukaemic BM plasma, thus providing an altered migratory pathway possibly guiding NC monocyte recruitment into the BM. Additionally, the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) strongly increased in leukaemic BM plasma, possibly because of the interaction of leukaemic cells with mesenchymal stromal cells and vascular cells and due to a stimulatory effect of leukaemia-related inflammatory mediators. C5a, a macrophage chemoattractant and M2-polarizing factor, further appeared to be upregulated in the leukaemic BM, possibly as an effect of PTX3 decrease, that could unleash complement cascade activation. Overall, deregulated monocyte/macrophage compartments are part of the extensive BM microenvironment remodelling at B-ALL diagnosis and could represent valuable targets for novel treatments to be coupled with classical chemotherapy.",['(c) 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2810-1263', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7976-3654', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7809-7269']",20210313,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*bone marrow microenvironment', '*chemokines', '*macrophages', '*mesenchymal stromal cells', '*monocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 13.,"The prognosis of 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) acute leukemia (AL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is poor. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is an important prognostic factor for relapse. Thus, we aimed to identify the evolution of KMT2A before and after allo-HSCT and the efficacy of preemptive immunotherapies for KMT2A-r AL patients receiving allo-HSCT. KMT2A expression was determined through TaqMan-based RQ-PCR technology. Preemptive immunotherapies included interferon-alpha and donor lymphocyte infusion. We collected 1751 bone marrow samples from 177 consecutive KMT2A-r AL patients. Pre-HSCT KMT2A positivity was correlated with post-HSCT KMT2A positivity (correlation coefficient=0.371, P<0.001). The rates of achieving KMT2A negativity after allo-HSCT were 96.6%, 92.9%, and 68.8% in the pre-HSCT low-level group (>0, <0.1%), intermediate-level group (>/= 0.1%, <1%), and high-level group (>/=1%), respectively. The rates of regaining KMT2A positivity after allo-HSCT were 7.7%, 35.7%, 38.5%, and 45.5% for the pre-HSCT KMT2A-negative, low-level, intermediate-level, and high-level groups, respectively (P<0.001). The 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse after allo-HSCT was as high as 53.7% in the pre-HSCT KMT2A expression >/= 0.1% group, which was compared to the KMT2A-negative group (15.1%) and KMT2A <0.1% group (31.2%). The clinical outcomes of patients with post-HSCT KMT2A positivity were poorer than those of patients with persistent KMT2A negativity. Although post-HSCT preemptive immunotherapies might help to achieve KMT2A negativity, the long-term efficacy was unsatisfactory. Thus, pre-HSCT KMT2A positivity was significantly associated with post-HSCT KMT2A positivity. The clinical outcomes of patients with post-HSCT KMT2A positivity were poor, which might not be overcome by commonly used immunotherapies.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9881-7945'],20210313,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Donor lymphocyte infusion', 'Interferon', 'KMT2A', 'Minimal residual disease']","[""2018-4-4089/Capital's Funds for Health Improvement and Research"", 'BMU2020PY007/Nanhu Scholars Program for Young Scholars of Xinyang Normal', 'University (CN)', '81930004/the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017YFA0104500/National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (CN)', '81670175/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81870137/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81900173/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81621001/Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of', 'China', '2019-I2M-5-034/CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this phase 1/2 study (NCT02265731), Japanese patients (>/=60 years) with untreated (ineligible for induction chemotherapy) or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia received oral venetoclax 400 mg/day (3-day ramp up in cycle 1) plus subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine 75 mg/m2 on days 1-7 per 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: As of 10 December 2019, six patients were enrolled (median age: 75 years; untreated: n = 5; relapsed/refractory: n = 1); median treatment duration: 10.3 months (range, 0.7-29.4). Most common grade >/= 3 adverse events were lymphopaenia and febrile neutropaenia (n = 4 each). Four patients reported serious adverse events; only an event of grade 3 fungal pneumonia was considered possibly related to both study drugs, requiring dose interruption of venetoclax and delay of azacitidine. Five (83%) patients had responses (complete remission: n = 3). Median time to first response of complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery was 1.0 month (range, 0.8-5.5); median overall survival: 15.7 months (95% confidence interval: 6.2, not reached). CONCLUSIONS: Venetoclax plus azacitidine was well tolerated and showed high response rates in Japanese patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

METHODS: In total, 147 blood, bone marrow, and tissue specimens were sequenced, including 81% B-cell, 15% T-cell, and 3% natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms. RESULTS: Of the cases, 92 (63%) of 147 displayed at least one pathogenic variant while 41 (28%) of 147 had two or more. Low mutation rates were noted in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytoses and samples with small T- and NK-cell clones of uncertain significance. Pathogenic molecular variants were described in specific disorders and classified according to their diagnostic, prognostic, and potential therapeutic value. Diagnostically, in addition to confirming the diagnosis of 15 of 15 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, 10 of 12 T large granular lymphocytic leukemias, and 2 of 2 hairy cell leukemias (HCLs), the panel helped resolve the diagnosis of 10 (62.5%) of 16 challenging cases lacking a specified diagnosis based on standard morphology, phenotype, and genetic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, implementation of this targeted lymphoid NGS panel as part of regular hematopathology practice was found to be a beneficial adjunct in the evaluation of low-grade LPDs.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

Epub 2021 Mar 12.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1 have revolutionized therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), paving the way for clinical development in other diseases. Despite success, targeting leukemic stem cells and overcoming drug resistance remain challenges for curative cancer therapy. To identify drivers of kinase-independent TKI resistance in CML, we performed genome-wide expression analyses on TKI-resistant versus sensitive CML cell lines, revealing a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression signature. Nucleocytoplasmic fractionation and luciferase reporter assays confirmed increased NF-kappaB activity in the nucleus of TKI-resistant versus sensitive CML cell lines and CD34(+) patient samples. Two genes that were upregulated in TKI-resistant CML cells were proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPases 1 (PSMD1) and 3 (PSMD3), both members of the 19S regulatory complex in the 26S proteasome. PSMD1 and PSMD3 were also identified as survival-critical genes in a published small hairpin RNA library screen of TKI resistance. We observed markedly higher levels of PSMD1 and PSMD3 mRNA in CML patients who had progressed to the blast phase compared with the chronic phase of the disease. Knockdown of PSMD1 or PSMD3 protein correlated with reduced survival and increased apoptosis in CML cells, but not in normal cord blood CD34(+) progenitors. Luciferase reporter assays and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that PSMD1 and PSMD3 promote NF-kappaB protein expression in CML, and that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) further activates NF-kappaB in scenarios of TKI resistance. Our data identify NF-kappaB as a transcriptional driver in TKI resistance, and implicate PSMD1 and PSMD3 as plausible therapeutic targets worthy of future investigation in CML and possibly other malignancies.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8331-8206', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6533-9150']",20210312,PMC7952820,,,"['K22 CA216008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite rapid advances, the various mechanisms inducing resistance development remain to be defined in detail. Here we report that loss-of-function mutations (LOF) in the histone methyltransferase EZH2 have the potential to confer resistance against the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine. We identify seven distinct EZH2 mutations leading to loss of H3K27 trimethylation via multiple mechanisms. Analysis of matched diagnosis and relapse samples reveal a heterogenous regulation of EZH2 and a loss of EZH2 in 50% of patients. We confirm that loss of EZH2 induces resistance against cytarabine in the cell lines HEK293T and K562 as well as in a patient-derived xenograft model. Proteomics and transcriptomics analysis reveal that resistance is conferred by upregulation of multiple direct and indirect EZH2 target genes that are involved in apoptosis evasion, augmentation of proliferation and alteration of transmembrane transporter function. Our data indicate that loss of EZH2 results in upregulation of its target genes, providing the cell with a selective growth advantage, which mediates chemotherapy resistance.",,,20210312,PMC7955088,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We developed a model of demand and supply of PCR monitoring of CML patients in 60 LMICs. PCR testing was assumed to use Cepheid's GeneXpert(R) (IV) system. We included costs of GeneXpert(R) instruments, uninterrupted power supplies, warranties, calibration kits, test cartridges, and shipping. We calculated the country-specific monetary gap in PCR monitoring, stratified by country priority defined as the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) through The Max Foundation initiatives. RESULTS: The 5-year gap in PCR monitoring was $29.1 million across all countries, 22% ($6.4 million) in countries with all five TKIs available, 20% ($5.7 million) in countries with four TKIs available, 50% ($14.5 million) in countries with three TKIs available, 8% ($2.2 million) in countries with two TKIs available, and 1% ($0.3 million) in countries with one TKI available. The gap was highest in South Asia (52%; $15.1 million) and lowest in Latin America (6%; $1.9 million). Excluding labor costs, the bulk of the resource needs (86%; $25.2 million) were for procurement of BCR-ABL cartridges. CONCLUSION: Removing the 5-year gap in PCR monitoring capacity for CML in LMICs will require the mobilization of significant resources and will likely lead to better treatment outcomes and reduced treatment costs through optimization of treatment, discontinuation of therapy in appropriate patients, and facilitation of clinical research. Development of streamlined monitoring guidelines for resource-limited countries should be considered.",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3834-7141'],20210312,PMC7953726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem affects both developed and developing countries. A high mortality rate has been observed in low-income counties. Despite its high fatality rate, less attention has been paid to the problem in developing countries, including Ethiopia. For this reason, childhood cancer is not well documented in the study setting. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of childhood cancer in Ethiopia. METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study design from January 1, 2019, to March 30, 2019, was conducted in the pediatrics treatment center. A systematic random sampling technique has used to select 1270 children in the pediatric outpatient department. The data were entered using Epi info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. We checked model fitness for the advanced statistical methods, but it was difficult to proceed with logistic regression model to see the association between dependent and explanatory variables because of the unmet x(2) assumption. We presented the results by using tables and figures. RESULTS: From the total 1270 study participants, 1257 were included in the final analysis provided that a 98.97% response rate. Out of these, 10(0.8%) children were diagnosed with cancer. Regarding its types, two each, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Wilms tumor, Hodgkin lymphoma, and one each non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Parotid cancer, Retinoblastoma, and Breast cancer were reported. The prevalence of childhood cancer was 0.9 and 0.7% among male and female children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Eight children diagnosed with cancer per 1000 children who visited the pediatric outpatient department.

Herein we examined 22 cases of NPM1-mutated de novo AML in patients older than 75, with a median age of 84. All diagnostic samples were sequenced aiming for coverage of the most relevant AML-associated mutations. For comparison with younger patients, we used already published data on several cohorts. A total of 76 mutations including 50 different variants were identified in 16 recurrently mutated AML genes. Compared with younger patients, a significant enrichment of TET2 and SRSF2 was observed, together with a reduced frequency of DNMT3A mutations. Our results indicate that the mutational pattern may be different in the very old as compared to younger patients with NPM1-mutated AML.HighlightsThe mutational spectrum of NPM1-mutated AML in patients above 75 years displays distinct features.A significant enrichment of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations together with a reduced frequency of DNMT3A mutations was observed in the elderly.NPM1 mutation is a secondary event in the development of AML in the very old.",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7911-7265', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1782-4423']",20210312,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*NGS', '*NPM1', '*NPM1-mutation', '*elderly', '*old']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The co-crystal structure of 3b in complex with fully active CDK2 was solved, revealing the binding mode of 3b in the ATP pocket and a hydrogen bonding interaction with hinge region residue Leu83.

Epub 2021 Feb 15.,"The number of cancer cases continues to increase worldwide, and unfortunately the main systemic treatments available have numerous of side effects. Ruthenium complexes have shown to be promising chemotherapeutic agents, since they present low toxicity and are more selective for tumor tissues. We report the synthesis, characterization and biological properties of two new ruthenium (II) complexes containing Lapachol and Lawsone as ligands: (1) [Ru(Law)(dppb)(phen)]PF6 and (2) [Ru(Lap)(dppb)(phen)]PF6, where Law = Lawsone, Lap = Lapachol, dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphine)butane and phen = 1,10-phenanthroline. The ability of the complexes (1) and (2) to interact with CT-DNA (Calf Thymus) was investigated, and the results indicate that the complexes have shown a weak interaction with this macromolecule. Complexes (1) and (2) showed a moderate interaction with BSA, via a spontaneous process with the involvement of van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions. Both complexes were tested against human lung cancer cell lines, chronic human myeloid leukemia, murine melanoma and human cervical and non-tumoral murine fibroblast adenocarcinoma, human lung fibroblasts and monkey kidney epithelia. The potential for cytotoxicity was tested out using the MTT assay and the neutral red test, to calculate inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and selectivity indices (IS). Both complexes showed a higher selectivity index of 1.17 and 10.91, respectively, for the HeLa tumor line. Studies of toxicological evaluation, using the micronucleus test and the comet assay against non-tumor cells, as well as an assessment of the potential for acute toxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In the in vitro micronucleus test, complex (1) showed the least genotoxic potential, and in the in vitro comet assay both compounds had revealed a genotoxic potential at 0.5 and 1.0 mg L(-1), with no difference between 24 h and 48 h exposure times. In the acute toxicity tests on zebrafish embryos, complex (1) showed sublethal effects such as decreased blood circulation and heartbeat rate, which were less pronounced than with complex (2). In contrast to complex 2, which caused lethality even before 48h, complex (1) did not cause the death of the embryos at concentrations up to (2.0 mg L(-1)). Complex (2) also lead to a delay in the embryo. Cell based in vitro methods thus proved able to provide specific toxicological data, allowing a significant reduction in \animal experimentation. Given that in vitro tests cannot completely replace animal tests, the use of less advanced developmental stages such as zebrafish embryos, which - at least in the European Union - are not regarded protected, could be shown to be an excellent alternative for testing with, e.g., mammals.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is increasingly clear that the continuous activation of JNKs has a role in cancer development and progression. Therefore, JNKs represent attractive oncogenic targets for cancer therapy using small molecule kinase inhibitors. Studies showed that the two major JNK proteins JNK1 and JNK2 have opposite functions in different types of cancers, which need more specification in the design of JNK inhibitors. Some of ATP- competitive and ATP non-competitive inhibitors have been developed and widely used in vitro, but this type of inhibitors lack selectivity and inhibits phosphorylation of all JNK substrates and may lead to cellular toxicity.

A retrospective review of 845 patients who underwent HCT was conducted. Cumulative incidence of AVN was 6.3% at 4 years. The following risk factors were significantly associated with AVN risk on univariate analysis: age < 45 (p=0.004), moderate to severe chronic GvHD (p<0.001), reduced intensity conditioning (p=0.02), and a diagnosis of acute leukemia (p=0.045). Multivariate analysis confirmed two risk factors: younger age (<45 years), 9.0% vs 4.4% (p=0.011, hazard ratio (HR) 2.134), and moderate-severe chronic GvHD, 15.4% vs 2.1% (p<0.001, HR 4.950). A risk score model was generated assigning a score to each risk factor. A score of 1 was assigned to moderate-severe GvHD or those with age <45. Total score was calculated, thus dividing patient into three groups: low (score 0, n=349, 41.3%), intermediate (score 1, n=379, 44.9%), and high risk (score 2; n=116, 13.7%). This risk score could stratify the patients according to AVN risk (p<0.001). The risk of AVN was 1.5% in the low risk, 6.2% in the intermediate risk, and 20.8% in the high risk groups.

METHODS: Patients with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were selected as subjects. Genotypes 1/2 and genotypes F/f were analyzed using the nested PCR technology, while EBER and LMP1 subtypes were analyzed by the nested PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Type 1 was more dominant than type 2, found in 59 out of 82 (72%) leukemia and in 31 out of 35 (88.6%) MDS, while type F was more prevalent than type f in leukemia (83/85, 97.6%) and MDS (29/31, 93.5%) samples. The distribution of EBV genotypes 1/2 was not significantly different among leukemia, MDS, and healthy donor groups, neither was that of EBV genotypes F/f. EB-6m prototype was the dominant subtype of EBER in leukemia and MDS (73.2% [30/41] and 83.3% [10/12], respectively). The frequency of EB-6m was lower than that of healthy people (96.7%, 89/92), and the difference was significant (p < 0.05). China 1 subtype was the dominant subtype of LMP1 in leukemia and MDS (70% [28/40] and 90% [9/10], respectively), and there was no significant difference in the distribution of LMP1 subtypes among the 3 groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The distribution of EBV 1/2, F/f, EBER, and LMP1 subtypes in leukemia and MDS was similar to that in the background population in Northern China, which means that these subtypes may be rather region-restricted but not associated with leukemia and MDS pathogenesis.","['(c) 2021 S.

In both approaches, the sulfonylation reaction occurred regioselectively at the purine N9 position lacking any concurrent N7 derivatives, except in the case of a smaller methyl substituent on SO2 and the free amino group at C6 of the purine ring. The tautomeric features of initial N9 unsubstituted purines, as well as stability trends among the prepared N-9-sulfonylpurine derivates, were investigated using DFT calculations with an important conclusion that electron-donating C6 substituents are beneficial for the synthesis as they both promote the predominance of the desired N9 tautomers and help to assure the stability of the final products.

Therefore, the objective of our study was to investigate the impact of CD56-expression on blast counts in myeloid neoplasms comparing bone marrow aspirates to biopsies. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 75 patients diagnosed with MDS and AML. We compared patients with (n = 36) and without (n = 39) CD56-expression by flow cytometry with respect to their blast quantities assessed on bone marrow aspirates versus biopsies. RESULTS: The frequency of CD56-expression on blasts correlated with higher blast counts on biopsies vs. aspirate smears (rs = 0.52; P = .001). This difference in blast counts was only significant in the CD56 high expressing subgroup (median 68%, 5.5%-95% in biopsy compared to median 32.5%, 1.5%-90% in aspirate; P < .01). The percentage of CD56-positive blasts among the total blast population was lower in the peripheral blood compared to bone marrow (median 31%, 6%-88% vs. 55%, 14%-98%; P = .016). The discrepancy in the blast count between the aspirate and trephine biopsy would have led to misclassification of four cases as MDS instead of AML, if diagnosis had based on the bone marrow aspirate blast count alone. CONCLUSION: Counting blasts in bone marrow aspirates of CD56-positive AML and MDS may be linked to underestimation, potentially leading to misclassification of these myeloid neoplasms, and should therefore be adjusted considering the results obtained on trephine biopsies for reliable diagnosis.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7046-0825'],20210311,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD56', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'blast quantification bone marrow aspirate', 'bone marrow biopsy', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']","['University Hospital Basel, Switzerland']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging evidence suggests that patients with MGRS and MGNS could benefit from treatments used for myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, depending on the underlying pathology. However, the treatment of MGRS and MGNS is not standardized, and potentially effective therapies might not be reimbursed because these conditions do not formally meet the criteria for malignant processes. The present review aims at establishing standards for the evaluation and management of MGRS and MGNS, which can facilitate the diagnosis of and provide therapeutic options for treating practitioners and patients affected by these conditions. The careful design and execution of clinical trials for patients with MGRS and MGNS are positively encouraged.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We assessed the outcome of ALL overall, and the two major subsets of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative ALL by age, time periods, ethnicity, median household income, and geographic county area. A total of 12 788 patients diagnosed with ALL from 1980 to 2017 were included. We performed an analysis to better evaluate the outcome evolution in ALL according to time period and patient's demographic factors. The overall 5-year survival rates have improved significantly over time, from 51% before 1990 to 72% since 2010. The survival rates for children (age 0 to 14 years) and adolescents (age 15 to 19 years) have improved from 73% and 55% before 1990 to 93% and 74% since 2010, respectively. Similarly, the rates had improved from 33% to 59% for adults 20 to 29 years old, 24% to 59% for 30 to 39 years old, and 14% to 43% for 40 to 59 years old between the two time periods. The rates remained under 30% in older patients (60+ years). Since 2010, patients with Ph-negative ALL had 5-year survival rate of 73% and those with Ph-positive ALL 50%. African Americans, Hispanic ethnicity, and lower household income were associated with inferior survival. The outcome of patients with ALL showed continued improvement across all age groups in the US. The recent introduction of targeted therapies, together with optimized supportive care, will continue to improve outcomes, particularly in older patients.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307']",20210401,,,,['CA021765/National Cancer Institute Grant'],,,,,,,,,,,['Am J Hematol. 2021 Jun 1;:.

Nevertheless, there are still few studies analyzing the consequence of polymorphisms for the Glutathione-S-transferases (GST) gene to drug response in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This study reports, the influence of GSTP1*B and GSTT1/GSTM1null polymorphisms in response to imatinib in CML patients in a Brazilian population. One hundred thirty-nine CML patients from the Clinical Hospital of Goiania, Goias, Brazil, treated with imatinib were enrolled in this study. Genotyping of GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes deletions were performed by qPCR and of GSTP1 gene was performed by RFLP-PCR. The frequency of GSTP1*1B, GSTT1 and GSTM1null polymorphisms were determined for all patients. The influence of each patient's genotypes was analyzed with the patient's response to imatinib treatment. Brazilian CML patients revealed GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes deletions. GSTT1 deletion was found in 19.3% of patients and GSTM1 deletion in 48.7% of patients with CML. GSTT1/GSTM1 deletion was found in 11.7% in Brazilian CML patients. The ""G allele"" of GSTP1*B, is associated with later cytogenetic response in imatinib therapy. While, the gene presence combined with GG genotype (GSTM1 present/GSTPI-GG) conferred a tend to a later cytogenetic response to patients. GSTP1*B and GSTT1/GSTM1null polymorphisms influence treatment response in CML. Brazilian CML patients presenting GSTP1 AA/AG genotypes alone and in combination with GSTT1 null reach the cytogenetic response faster, while patients presenting GSTP1-GG and GSTMI positive genotypes may take longer to achieve cytogenetic response. As a result, it allows a better prognosis, with the use of an alternative therapy, other than reducing treatment cost.",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4565-5516', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1778-0299', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8548-9946', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9960-1417', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7389-6125', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8281-7334', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0362-0988', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8739-8327', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0829-3157', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4143-9007']",20210311,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Cytogenetic response', 'GST', 'Imatinib', 'Personalized medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work evaluates the content validity and psychometric properties of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue) in patients with CLL to determine if it is fit for purpose in CLL research. METHODS: The FACIT-Fatigue yields a 13-item total score from a five-item symptom subscale and an eight-item impact subscale. To evaluate content validity, cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted with 40 patients with CLL in the first-line or relapsed or refractory setting. Psychometric properties, including structural validity, internal consistency, construct and known-groups validity, were investigated using data from a phase 3 trial in relapsed or refractory CLL (NCT02970318). RESULTS: Interviewed patients considered the FACIT-Fatigue items relevant to their CLL experience, understood the terminology and agreed with response options. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the presence of symptom and impact subscales, but also supported unidimensionality of the FACIT-Fatigue. The FACIT-Fatigue total, symptom and impact subscales demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha > 0.85 and McDonald's omega omega > 0.90), and strong correlations with relevant EORTC QLQ-C30 scales (all Spearman's r >/= 0.5). Known-groups validity was shown by significant differences between groups defined by baseline performance status, hemoglobin level and constitutional symptoms (all p < .0001). Cluster analysis supported FACIT-Fatigue score thresholds of 30 and 34 to define a severe fatigue population.

However, its effects in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) remain undefined. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AHR activation on malignant cells in patients with MDS/AML. We found that AHR was expressed aberrantly in patients with MDS/AML. Further studies demonstrated that inhibiting AHR decreased the mitochondrial dehydrogenase content and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in MDS/AML cells. Activating AHR with L-kynurenine (Kyn) increased AHR expression, which was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial dehydrogenase content and MMP in MDS/AML cells. Moreover, the expression level of mitochondria-associated mitochondrial transcription factor A was increased after activating AHR with L-Kyn when compared with that in the control group but decreased after inhibiting the AHR signal. Activating AHR in MDS/AML cells enhanced the resistance to cytarabine. These findings indicated that activating the AHR signaling pathway reshaped the metabolism in MDS/AML cells, thus contributing to the resistance to cytarabine.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Here, we establish an in silico pipeline to identify specific PPI sub-networks containing mutated proteins as potential targets, which we apply to mutation data of four different leukaemias. Our method is based on extracting cyclic interactions of a small number of proteins topologically and functionally linked in the Protein-Protein Interaction Network (PPIN), which we call short loop network motifs (SLM). We uncover a new property of PPINs named 'short loop commonality' to measure indirect PPIs occurring via common SLM interactions. This detects 'modules' of PPI networks enriched with annotated biological functions of proteins containing mutation hotspots, exemplified by FLT3 and other receptor tyrosine kinase proteins. We further identify functional dependency or mutual exclusivity of short loop commonality pairs in large-scale cellular CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening data. Our pipeline provides a new strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets for drug discovery.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Innate and adaptive immunity is closely related to the progression of leukemia. Macrophages within the leukemic microenvironment have a tendency toward a leukemia-permissive phenotype. However, the characteristics of macrophages in leukemia, including their kinetics, gene expression, and functional roles have not been fully illuminated. Methods: In the current study, the characteristics of peritoneal resident macrophages, which were large peritoneal macrophages (LPM), from mice with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9-induced AML were investigated. AML-associated large macrophages (AML-LPM) were gated as F4/80(high) MHC-II(-) by flow cytometry. To further investigate the relationship between the leukemic microenvironment and macrophage characteristics, RNA sequencing was performed. Meanwhile, apoptosis, killing ability, and phagocytic function of peritoneal resident macrophages in MLL-AF9-induced AML were assessed. Results: The results suggested that AML microenvironment was found to affect the kinetics and morphology of peritoneal resident macrophages. The results of RNA sequencing suggested that the gene expression of AML-LPMs differed significantly from that of normal LPMs. The AML microenvironment also had effects on the apoptosis, killing ability, and phagocytic function of peritoneal resident macrophages. Conclusions: These data suggest that peritoneal resident macrophages in mice with AML induced by MLL-AF9 show an M2-like phenotype. The reversal of macrophage polarization in the leukemic microenvironment may potentially enhance the immunotherapeutic effect in AML.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Hyperglycemia results in injury to vascular endothelial cells, including monocyte-endothelial adhesion, which is considered to be the initiating factor of vascular endothelial cell injury. Connexin 43 (Cx43) plays a key role in this adhesion process. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of Cx43 on monocyte-endothelial adhesion in GDM-induced injury of vascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from umbilical cords from pregnant women with and without GDM. THP-1 cells (a human leukemia monocytic cell line) adhering to HUVECs, related molecules [intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)], and the activity of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/Nuclear factor- kappa B (PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB) signaling pathway were compared between the normal and GDM-HUVECs. Oleamide and specific small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) were used to inhibit Cx43 expression in GDM-HUVECs to observe the effects of Cx43 on the adhesion of THP-1 cells and HUVECs. Results: A much higher number of THP-1 cells adhered to GDM-HUVECs than to normal HUVECs. This was accompanied by an increased expression of Cx43, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, as well as activation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. After the inhibition of Cx43 expression in GDM-HUVECs with oleamide and specific siRNA, THP-1-HUVEC adhesion, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, and activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB signaling pathway were all attenuated. Hyperglycemia was able to increase expression of Cx43 in HUVECs. Conclusions: For the first time, Cx43 expression was found to be substantially higher in GDM-HUVECs than in normal HUVECs. Hyperglycemia caused the overexpression of Cx43 in HUVECs, which resulted in the activation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and the increase of its downstream adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, ultimately leading to increased monocyte-endothelial adhesion.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, the lack of indicators to serve as precise and reliable means of predicting breast cancer prognosis has yet to be addressed. This study aims to reveal the prognostic relevance of mutations in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) by large-scale circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis in China. Methods: We performed ctDNA panel-captured sequencing of 958 blood samples from MBC patients including 494 hormone receptor (HR)-positive cases, 130 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive cases, and 177 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases. The somatic mutations and potential targets were assessed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: In 801 of the 958 MBC blood samples, 663 mutated genes and 5,829 nonsynonymous alterations were identified. Mutated genes of the highest frequency were tumor protein p53 (TP53, 54%), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA, 41%), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1, 12%), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia protein 3 (MLL3, 11%), DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A, 10%), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2, 10%), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3, 8%), FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1, 7%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN, 6%), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP3K1, 6%). Enriched mutations and driver genes in MBC varied across stages and in multiple subtypes. Moreover, TP53, ERBB2, or coexisting TP53/PIK3CA mutations in MBC were remarkably related with shorter PFS. Mutated DNA damage response (DDR) genes were significantly associated with tumor mutation burden and mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity score, as well as with worse clinical outcome. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the mutations of TP53, PIK3CA, ERBB2, and in particular, DDR genes, in MBC might be relevant indicators of unfavorable prognosis in MBC.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Nine months after first admission the patient developed acute myeloid leukemia with DNMT3a and TET2 mutations. Retrospective analysis of the cardiac biopsy revealed the identical mutations and matched with the diagnosis of an extremely rare primary extramedullary manifestation of an AML (myelosarcoma). The patient received induction-chemotherapy and was planned for consolidating allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Hypersensitivity (RR =0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-1.01; Rho=0.05) and hepatic injury rate (RR =0.45; 95% CI, 0.27-0.75; Rho=0.002) were lower in the PEG-Asp group. The frequency of administration and length of hospital stay of patients in the PEG-Asp group were less than those in the E. coli L-Asp group (both Rho<0.0001). Conclusions: Current evidence pointed out a similar efficacy in the two groups. The PEG-Asp group showed a lower hypersensitivity and hepatic injury rate. In addition, using PEG-Asp decreased the frequency of administration and the length of hospital stay, which, to some extent, might reduce patients' burden caused by medical resource consumption.",['2021 Translational Pediatrics.

treating several relapsed or refractory hematological tumors. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an adverse event with high incidence during CAR-T treatment. A further understanding of the characteristics and related risk factors of CRS is important for effective management. A total of 142 patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocyte leukemia (ALL), lymphoma, or multiple myeloma (MM) received lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of CAR-T cells. The characteristics of CRS at different time points after treatment were monitored and risk factors were analyzed. The incidence of CRS for ALL, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma were 82%, 90%, and 90% respectively. Fever was observed on a median of day 3 for ALL, day 1 for lymphoma, and day 8.5 for MM after CAR-T cell infusion, and the duration was different between grade 1-2 CRS and grade 3-5 CRS. Disease types, peak concentration of IL-6, and CRP were associated with CRS. For patients with ALL, numbers of lymphoblast in bone marrow before lymphodepletion, peak concentration of IL-6, and CRP were independent risk factors of CRS. Clinical stage of lymphoma patients and high tumor burden in marrow of MM patients were independent risk factors of CRS. In conclusion, the characteristics and risk factors of CRS in different B-cell hematological tumors are different and should be managed individually during CAR-T cell therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yan, Zhang, Cao, Zhang, Liu, Huang, Cheng, Qiao, Wang, Wang,', 'Gao, Shi, Sang, Zhu, Li, Sun, Wu, Qi, Li, Wang, Li, Liu, Zheng, Qian, Zhang and', 'Xu.']",,20210223,PMC7940756,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphocyte leukemia', '*chimeric antigen receptor T cell', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*lymphoma', '*multiple myeloma']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reactivation can be prevented by nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA), but it is unclear how long NA should be continued. Here, we report 3 cases of HBV reactivation with discontinuation of NA following the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies after HSCT. Three male patients aged 34, 59, and 54 years received allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) for chronic myeloid leukemia, mixed phenotype acute leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome, respectively. Before HSCT, 2 patients were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 1 patient was negative for HBsAg and positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen. NA (lamivudine or entecavir) was started at the same time as HSCT and stopped after the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies. In all patients, the serum HBV DNA levels were increased after the discontinuation of NAs. Two of the three patients developed severe hepatitis with high levels of HBV DNA (7.5 and 7.4 log IU/mL, respectively). A patient without hepatitis was re-administered NA soon after the HBV DNA started to increase (3.3 log IU/mL). Interestingly, the 2 patients who developed hepatitis cleared HBsAg promptly after the recovery from hepatitis and they could stop NAs without the reversion of HBsAg. It was speculated that transplanted immune cells, which were naive for HBV, react strongly with HBV antigens that were increased after the NA discontinuation. The discontinuation of NA after allo-HSCT is not recommended generally because strong hepatitis might be induced even after several years.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by S.

This study determined the frequencies of fusion genes in Sudanese patients with AML and their clinical impacts. Methods: This study was conducted at Alzaeim Alazhari University, Khartoum, Sudan. A total of 97 patients with AML were recruited in the study from different clinics in Khartoum state. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine types of fusion genes. Results: The highest frequency of genetic defects was observed for AML1-ETO fusion gene (57.6%) followed by MLL-AF9 (35.1%) and FUS-ERG (7.2%). No significant differences in blast cells, hemoglobin, total white blood cells, and platelets were found between different gene fusion groups (P > 0.05). In addition, no differences in the frequency of splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy were observed between different gene fusion groups (P > 0.05).

Epub 2020 Nov 13.,"Imatinib, the first Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) has revolutionized the management by inhibiting BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. According to earlier reports there are concerns regarding the adverse effect of imatinib on haemostasis by causing platelet dysfunction. Here we studied platelet function using platelet aggregometry, in 19 CML chronic phase (CML-CP) patients on imatinib therapy, in complete haematologic response (CHR). The median duration of imatinib therapy before performing the test was 154 days. This study reveals that there are large inter-individual variations in platelet functions among imatinib treated patients and different levels of variability have been seen for different agonists. Most common aggregation abnormality (< 50% aggregation) was seen with low dose collagen (1 mug/ml) in 31.57% patients. Despite in-vitro platelet aggregation defects, none of the patients showed any bleeding symptoms. This enigma can possibly be explained by the fact that platelet specific agonists, epinephrine and collagen act in synergy for platelet aggregation compared against individual low dose agonists, supported by ex-vivo experiments in normal healthy control group (n = 5) (p value < 0.0004 for epinephrine, p value < 0.0001 for collagen).

Serum GDF15 level was measured at diagnosis in all patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Remission and survival statuses were assessed at 90 days following treatment. GDF15 level was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.001). GDF15 level correlated positively with age (P < 0.001), hemoglobin level (P = 0.027), and platelet count (P = 0.024). High GDF15 above the median level was associated with inferior OS (P = 0.044) together with high platelet count (P = 0.006) and high bone marrow blast percent (P = 0.038). There was no statistically significant difference between patients with GDF15 above and below the median level regarding DFS (P = 0.881).

Epub 2020 May 26.,"Inherited polymorphic sequence variations in drug transport genes like ABCB1 impact a portion of patients with hematologic malignancies that show intrinsic or acquire resistance to treatment. Keeping in view inter-individual sensitivities for such drugs, we through this case-control study tested whether ABCB1 C3435T and G2677T polymorphisms have any influence on the risk and treatment response in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Genotyping for ABCB1 polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 100 CML and 80 B-ALL patients along with 100 age and gender matched healthy controls. ABCB1 C3435T and G2677T polymorphism showed no association with CML. Genotype distribution revealed significant higher frequency of TT genotype for both SNPs in B-ALL cases and associated with increased B-ALL risk (OR 2.5, p = 0.04 for 3435TT; OR 2.4, p = 0.04 for 2677TT). There was no significant difference in genotype frequency of 3435C > T and 2677G > T among resistant and responsive groups for the two leukemia types. Kaplan-Meier survival plots revealed significantly lower event free survival in CML and B-ALL patients that were carriers of 3435TT genotype (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis considered 3435TT genotype as independent risk factor for imatinib resistance in CML cases (HR 6.24, p = 0.002) and increased relapse risk in B-ALL patients (HR 4.51, p = 0.03). The current study provides preliminary evidence of a significant association between variant TT genotype and increased B-ALL risk. Also, results suggest that ABCB1 3435TT genotype increases imatinib resistance in CML and influence therapeutic outcome in B-ALL.",['(c) Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion 2020.'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-2481-1268'],20200526,PMC7900282,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BCR-ABL1', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Kashmir', 'RFLP']",,,['Conflict of interestThe authors have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 11.,"Folate-mediated one carbon (1C) metabolism supports a series of processes that are essential for the cell. Through a number of interlinked reactions happening in the cytosol and mitochondria of the cell, folate metabolism contributes to de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis, to the methionine cycle and redox defence. Targeting the folate metabolism gave rise to modern chemotherapy, through the introduction of antifolates to treat paediatric leukaemia. Since then, antifolates, such as methotrexate and pralatrexate have been used to treat a series of blood cancers in clinic. However, traditional antifolates have many deleterious side effects in normal proliferating tissue, highlighting the urgent need for novel strategies to more selectively target 1C metabolism. Notably, mitochondrial 1C enzymes have been shown to be significantly upregulated in various cancers, making them attractive targets for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. In this article, we present a detailed overview of folate-mediated 1C metabolism, its importance on cellular level and discuss how targeting folate metabolism has been exploited in blood cancers.

At the 5-year data cut-off, 81/190 patients entering the TFR phase (42.6%) were still in TFR, with 76 (40.0%) in MR(4.5). Patients who lost major molecular response (MMR) entered a treatment re-initiation phase; 90/91 patients entering this phase (98.9%) regained MMR and 84/91 patients (92.3%) regained MR(4.5). The Kaplan-Meier estimated treatment-free survival rate at 5 years was 48.2%. No disease progression or CML-related deaths were reported. Whereas the incidence of adverse events (AEs) declined from 96 weeks following the start of TFR, an increase in AE frequency was observed for patients in the treatment re-initiation phase.

Rapidly developed patient-derived xenografts (pdx) could be a helpful tool for analyzing the effect of drugs against an individual's tumor by growing the tumor in an immunodeficient animal. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice enable efficient in vivo expansion of vital tumor cells and generation of personalized xenografts. However, they are not amenable to large-scale rapid screening, which is critical in identifying new compounds from large compound libraries. The development of a zebrafish model suitable for pdx could facilitate large-scale screening of drugs targeted against specific malignancies. Here, we describe a novel strategy for establishing a zebrafish model for drug testing in leukemia xenografts. We used chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia for xenotransplantation into SCID zebrafish to evaluate drug screening protocols. We showed the in vivo efficacy of the ABL inhibitor imatinib, MEK inhibitor U0126, cytarabine, azacitidine and arsenic trioxide. We performed corresponding in vitro studies, demonstrating that combination of MEK- and FLT3-inhibitors exhibit an enhanced effect in vitro. We further evaluated the feasibility of zebrafish for transplantation of primary human hematopoietic cells that can survive at 15 day-post-fertilization. Our results provide critical insights to guide development of high-throughput platforms for evaluating leukemia.",,,20210311,PMC7952715,,,"['U54 CA156735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MD012392/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half of the patients with Ph-like ALL have kinase rearrangements or fusions. We examined the frequency and spectrum of these fusions using a retrospective cohort of 212 newly diagnosed patients with childhood B-cell ALL. Samples without known chromosomal alterations were subject to multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to identify known Ph-like kinase fusions. Immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) capture and kinase capture were applied to samples without known kinase fusions. We detected known kinase fusions in five of 212 patients, comprising EBF1-PDGFRB, ETV6-ABL1, ZC3HAV1-ABL2, EPOR-IGH, and CNTRL-ABL1. Two patients with P2RY8-CRLF2 were identified. Patients with non-Ph kinase fusions had inferior 5-year event-free survival and overall survival compared with patients with other common genetic alterations. The prevalence of non-Ph kinase fusions in our Taiwanese cohort was lower than that reported in Caucasian populations.
