The clinical course of CLL is marked by frequent relapse, and there are limited therapeutic options for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. The morphologically mature CLL clone regulates the microenvironment through modulation of the cytokine milieu that aids its growth and survival, and has a role in immune escape.

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pathogenesis and natural history of MS and examines the available treatment options for patients with RRMS, worsening RRMS, or SPMS, with a focus on mitoxantrone. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966-present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1994-present) were searched for relevant randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trials using the terms mitoxantrone, Novantrone, and multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: Five randomized, blinded, controlled trials and an ongoing open-label Phase IV safety study were identified and included in this review. In one randomized, double-blind trial (N=25), patients with RRMS who received mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 monthly had significantly reduced relapse rates at 1 year compared with those who received placebo (P=0.014). In a 2-year, randomized, partially blinded trial (N=51), patients with active RRMS who received mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 monthly had significantly fewer relapses compared with those who received placebo (P<0.001), and significantly fewer patients had confirmed progression of disability (1-point increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score) (P=0.02). In a randomized, double-blind trial (N=49), patients with relapsing SPMS who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 monthly for 3 months followed by 12 mg/m2 g3mo for up to 32 months had significant improvements in EDSS scores compared with those who received methylprednisolone 1 g IV monthly for 3 months followed by 1 g IV g3mo (P=0.002 at 1 year, P=0.045 at 2 years) and significant reductions in the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (P=0.002 at 1 and 2 years, P=0.03 at 3 years). In a randomized, partially blinded Phase II trial in 42 patients with active RRMS or SPMS, patients who received mitoxantrone 20 mg IV monthly and methylprednisolone 1 g IV monthly had significantly fewer new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI (P<0.001) and significantly fewer relapses (P<0.01) at 6 months compared with those who received methylprednisolone alone. In a pivotal Phase III trial (N=194), patients with worsening RRMS or SPMS who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 g3mo for 2 years had significantly fewer relapses (P<0.001) and significantly less deterioration in disability, as measured by change in EDSS score (P=0.019), compared with those who received placebo. In a nonrandomized subgroup of patients from this study (n=110), those who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 g3mo had a significant reduction in the number of T2-weighted MRI lesions at 24 months (P=0.027). The most common adverse events in these studies included nausea and/or vomiting (18%-85%), alopecia (33%-61%), amenorrhea (8%-53%), urinary tract infections (6%-32%), and upper respiratory tract infections (4%-53%). Leukopenia was reported in 10% to 19% of patients. Use of mitoxantrone can lead to serious adverse effects, particularly cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, and, rarely, leukemia. Long-term use of mitoxantrone may compromise left ventricular function. Limited cardiotoxicity was reported in the clinical studies; in the pivotal clinical trial, 2 patients who received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 had decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction to <50% of baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In the available clinical trials, mitoxantrone provided effective treatment for worsening RRMS or SPMS. When mitoxantrone is used as recommended, the risks of substantial myelosuppressive and cardiotoxic effects can be reduced by careful patient selection, drug administration, and monitoring. The lifetime cumulative dose should be strictly limited to 140 mg/m2, or 2 to 3 years of therapy.","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Jun 5.,"In human cells, the N-terminal matrix (MA) domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag targets assembly to specific membrane compartments. In murine fibroblasts, membrane targeting of Gag and assembly of HIV-1 are inefficient. These deficiencies are relieved by replacement of HIV-1 MA with murine leukemia virus (MLV) MA in chimeric proviruses. In this study, we examined chimeric HIV-1 carrying tandem MLV and HIV-1 MA domains and found that the addition of MLV MA to the N-terminus of HIV-1 Gag enhanced membrane binding in murine cells, but was not sufficient to stimulate virus production. Removal of HIV MA was required to observe more efficient Gag processing and increased virus production in murine cells. Deletion of the globular head of MA also alleviated the blocks to membrane binding and Gag processing in murine cells, yet did not lead to increased virus production. These MA-dependent, cell-type-specific phenotypes suggest that host factors interact with the globular head of MA to regulate membrane binding and additional membrane-independent step(s) required for assembly.","['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)']",,,20060605,"['AI-055321/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA098523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As suggested in recent reports, this plasticity can expand to include nonhematopoietic lineages, and, indeed, the HSC may repopulate liver and muscle tissues, as well. Considering the flexibility in HSC differentiation, these processes are regulated by a relatively small number of factors, some of which are expressed in all lineages, whereas others are activated only in a specific cell type. Combined evidence from many studies suggests that alternative subsets of these factors work in a combinatorial manner to regulate specific promoters for the induction of a specific lineage. RUNX1 and PU.1 have a fundamental role in HSC differentiation in that multifactor complexes are assembled around these proteins leading to tissue-specific and synergistic gene activation. Here we describe the relationship of RUNX1 with PU.1 as a facet of the combinatorial relationships that determine hematopoietic lineage commitment.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",62,,,"['R01 CA96448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082935/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL72691/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL79580/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further define the effects of doxorubicin on cell metabolism, we measured cellular respiration, cellular ATP, DNA fragmentation, and cytochrome c leakage in Jurkat (supersensitive), human leukemia-60 (HL-60, sensitive), and HL-60/MX2 (resistant) cells following exposure to 1.0 microM doxorubicin for 30 min. The measurements were made after 24 h of exposure to the drug. In Jurkat and HL-60 cells, doxorubicin treatment increased cellular mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP content by 2-3-fold. The increment in oxygen consumption was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) and by the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A. In HL-60/MX2 cells, which are resistant because of a reduced topoisomerase II activity, doxorubicin treatment was without effect on either respiration or ATP content, suggesting that topoisomerase II was essential for induction of apoptosis and stimulation of respiration and ATP content. The conclusion that both of the latter processes were products of oxidations in the mitochondrial respiratory chain was supported by the further observation that rotenone and sodium cyanide inhibited oxygen consumption and substantially lowered ATP content in the treated and untreated cells. Thus, oxidative phosphorylation is enhanced in cells briefly incubated with doxorubicin for as long as 24 h post drug exposure despite apoptosis-associated mitochondrial insults caused by the drug.","['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Mercaptoethylamines)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '05P3K9I49L (N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to blocking differentiation, AML1-ETO is also shown to induce growth arrest in AML cells, which is unfavorable for leukemogenesis harboring the t(8;21) translocation. However, its precise mechanism is still unclear. Here we provide the first demonstration that the conditional expression of AML1-ETO by the ecdysone-inducible system dramatically increases the expression of connexin 43 (CX43), together with growth arrest at G1 phase in leukemic U937 cells. We also show that the CX43 induction inhibits the proliferation of U937 cells at G1 phase, while the suppression of CX43 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively overcomes the growth-inhibitory effect of AML1 -ETO in leukemic cells. Furthermore, either AML1-ETO or CX43 induction elevates cell-cycle negative regulator P27(kip1) protein by inhibiting its degradation, which is antagonized by siRNA against CX43. Taken together, our data indicate that CX43 plays a role in AML1-ETO-induced growth arrest possibly through the accumulation of P27(kip1) protein. The potential mutation or/and epigenetic alterations of CX43 and its related gene(s) deserve to be explored in AML1-ETO-positive AML patients.","['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Connexin 43)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Benzophenone was nominated for study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences based on its potential for occupational and consumer exposure and the lack of long-term toxicity data. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to benzophenone (greater than 99% pure) in feed for 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. Results of 14-week toxicity studies in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were reported earlier (NTP, 2000). 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm benzophenone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 15, 30, and 60 mg benzophenone/kg body weight to males and 15, 30, and 65 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Survival of 1,250 ppm males was significantly less than that of controls. Mean body weights of 1,250 ppm males were markedly less than those of the controls during year 2 of the study, and weights of exposed females were consistently less than controls throughout the study. Feed consumption by 1,250 ppm males was less than that by the controls after week 70; feed consumption by 1,250 ppm females was generally less than that by the controls throughout the study. There was a positive trend in the incidences of renal tubule adenoma in males, and the incidences in 625 and 1,250 ppm males exceeded the historical control range for all routes; these neoplasms were accompanied by significantly increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia. Due to these findings, additional kidney sections were evaluated; results indicated additional renal tubule adenomas in all groups of males and renal tubule hyperplasia in all groups of males and females. The incidences of pelvic transitional epithelium hyperplasia and the severity of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of male rats. Increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in all exposed groups of females exceeded the historical control range from feed studies, and the incidence in 625 ppm females was significantly greater than that in the controls. Male rats exposed to 312 or 625 ppm had significantly increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. One 625 ppm female and two 1,250 ppm females had histiocytic sarcomas, and the incidence in the 1,250 ppm group exceeded the range in the historical controls. Liver lesions included significantly increased incidences of hepatocytic centrilobular hypertrophy in all exposed groups of males and females, cystic degeneration in 625 and 1,250 ppm males, and bile duct hyperplasia in all exposed groups of females. Incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm were lower than expected after adjusting for body weight. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm benzophenone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg body weight to males and 35, 70, and 150 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Survival of all exposed groups of mice was generally similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of exposed females were less than vehicle controls. Feed consumption by exposed males and females was similar to that by the controls. In male mice, there were significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in the 625 and 1,250 ppm groups, and these incidences exceeded the historical control range. All hepatocellular neoplasms combined occurred with a positive trend. In female mice, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in the 625 and 1,250 ppm groups were higher than expected after adjusting for the lower body weights in these groups. Incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and females. All exposed groups of male mice had significant increases in the incidences of multinucleated hepatocytes and chronic active inflammation. The incidences of cystic degeneration of hepatocytes in 625 and 1,250 ppm males were significantly increased. The incidence of histiocytic sarcoma in 625 ppm females was significantly increased and exceeded the historical control range. The incidences of kidney nephropathy and mineralization in exposed groups of females and the severity of nephropathy in exposed groups of males were significantly increased. The incidences of metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were significantly increased in 1,250 ppm males and females. The incidences of hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles in the spleen were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in 312 and 625 ppm females. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Benzophenone was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537, with or without hamster or rat liver activation enzymes. No significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were seen in bone marrow samples from male mice administered benzophenone three times by intraperitoneal injection. In addition, no increases in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were noted in peripheral blood of male or female mice administered benzophenone for 14 weeks in dosed feed. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenoma; mononuclear cell leukemia in male F344/N rats may have been related to benzophenone exposure. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in female F344/N rats based on the marginally increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and histiocytic sarcoma. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily adenoma. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma; the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in female B6C3F1 mice may have been related to benzophenone exposure. Administration of benzophenone in feed resulted in increased incidences and/or severities of nonneoplastic lesions in the kidney and liver of male and female rats and in the liver, kidney, nose, and spleen of male and female mice. Decreased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma in female rats were related to benzophenone exposure.","['0 (Benzophenones)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '701M4TTV9O (benzophenone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Jun 1.,"Intravenous infusion of autologous chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells transduced with an adenovirus encoding CD40-ligand (CD154) caused rapid reductions in leukemia-cell counts and lymphnode size. We hypothesized that CD40-ligation via CD154 sensitized CLL cells to death-receptor-mediated apoptosis. We found that CD154-expressing cells induced expression of CD95 and the BH3-interacting-domain death agonist (Bid) in CLL, regardless of whether the leukemia cells had functional p53. Such treatment also induced p73, a p53-related transcription factor regulated by c-Abl kinase, and enhanced the sensitivity to fludarabine (F-ara-A) of CLL cells lacking functional p53. Transduction of CLL cells with an adenovirus encoding p73 also induced Bid and CD95 and enhanced the sensitivity to F-ara-A of p53-deficient CLL cells. However, inhibition of c-Abl with imatinib suppressed CD154-induced expression of p73, p73-induced expression of Bid and CD95, and blocked the sensitization of p53-deficient CLL cells to CD95-mediated or F-ara-A-induced apoptosis. Conversely, CLL cells transduced with an imatinib-resistant c-Abl mutant could be induced by CD154 to express p73 and Bid even when treated with imatinib. These results indicate that CD154 can sensitize leukemia cells to apoptosis via the c-Abl-dependent activation of p73 and mitigate the resistance of p53-deficient CLL cells to anticancer drug therapy.","['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,20060601,"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA881534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895435,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although early studies in the Group primarily focused on chemotherapy for hematologic and pediatric malignancies, the Radiation Oncology Committee was established in 1972, reflecting the broadening scope of clinical investigation with an increased emphasis on solid tumor research. A major early contribution of the Radiation Oncology Committee was the recognition of the importance of formalized radiation quality review, which led to the development of the Quality Assurance Review Center. The committee has been instrumental in designing trials, in conjunction with our medical oncology and surgical oncology colleagues, to assess multimodality therapy. The results of many of these studies have had important implications for clinical practice. Recent efforts have explored our major research theme of treatment intensification via radiotherapy dose modulation and novel combinations of radiotherapy with sensitizing agents, with an emphasis on safely implementing advanced technologies in the cooperative group setting.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chaired initially by Edward Henderson and then David Van Echo, the committee was also the repository of studies in diseases for which CALGB did not have a formal committee, such as testis cancer and sarcoma. In 1990, following the appointment of Richard Schilsky as Chair, the name of the committee was changed to the Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (PET) Committee to reflect a more specific focus and scientific agenda (i.e., studies of chemotherapy pharmacology and development of new agents). Three PET Committee reference pharmacology laboratories (led by Merrill Egorin, Tony Miller, and Mark Ratain) were established to measure drug concentrations in biological fluids and to perform pharmacokinetic analyses. In addition, the PET Committee embarked on a number of multi-institution phase I studies. These phase I studies included studies of special populations, including the first prospective study of an anticancer agent (paclitaxel) in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In addition, the Committee studied a number of phase I combinations destined for phase II evaluation in disease-specific committees. Following Dr. Schilsky's election as CALGB Group Chair in 1994, Mark Ratain took over as Chair of the PET Committee and continued to emphasize population pharmacology as the primary theme of the Committee's research agenda. In addition, the PET Committee began to develop novel clinical trial designs, including the first completed randomized discontinuation trial of an antineoplastic agent. Most recently, the PET Committee has launched an ambitious research program in pharmacogenetics, facilitated in large part through the recruitment of Howard McLeod as Vice Chair. This area of research is a collaborative effort with the NIH Pharmacogenetics Research Network and has the potential to definitively address the hypothesis that germ line polymorphisms are a significant determinant of the toxicity and efficacy of anticancer therapy. It is anticipated that the results of the current studies will contribute significantly to the goal of individualizing cancer treatment.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Committee's objective is to focus attention on issues specifically relevant to the treatment of cancer in the older patient. Two strategies were developed to achieve this objective: (a) to initiate projects and protocols within the Committee and (b) to foster the initiation of studies by other CALGB committees. The research themes of the Committee and the main thrust of committee's research activities are (a) understanding and overcoming barriers to clinical trials participation; (b) treatment efficacy and pharmacokinetic/pharmacologic issues related to chemotherapy and hormone therapy in the older cancer patient; and (c) improving the quality of life for older cancer patients.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We now examined the effects of PUFA and TTA in rats transplanted with either acute promyelocytic leukemia or acute T-cell leukemia. The rats were randomized to isoenergetic diets containing either lard (control), omega3 (n-3) PUFA, or TTA. RESULTS: Whereas TTA prolonged survival (P < 0.05) in both types of rat leukemia, n-3 PUFA had no significant effect compared with controls. Only TTA inhibited (P < 0.05) leukemic infiltration in the bone marrow and spleen, probably due to apoptosis of the leukemic cells. Plasma metalloproteinase activity, a marker of metastatic activity, was significantly reduced in TTA-fed rats only. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of TTA, but not of n-3 PUFA, in rats with acute leukemia, prolonged their survival. TTA intake was also associated with reduced leukemic cell burden as well as diminished extramedullar dissemination. TTA represents a modified fatty acid that exerts unique effects on malignant hematopoietic cells, and the present study indicates that TTA may have a therapeutic potential in patients with acute leukemias.","['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Sulfides)', '7ZU5I25S2O (1-(carboxymethylthio)tetradecane)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) virus or adeno-associated viral vectors have been used to study the tumor suppressor function of FHIT in solid tumors, but these tools have not been effective in leukemias. We have generated a chimeric FHIT-containing adenovirus composed of Ad5 and the group B adenovirus called F35 with which we have been able to efficiently infect hematopoietic cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Infection efficiency of Ad5/F35-FHIT and Ad5/F35-GFP viruses was tested in leukemia cell lines that lacked FHIT expression, and biological effects of successful infection were assessed. An acute myelogenous leukemia, a chronic myelogenous leukemia, and four acute lymphoblastic leukemia human cell lines were examined as well as two EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines that expressed endogenous FHIT. RESULTS: Two of four acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, Jurkat and MV4;11, which were efficiently infected with Ad5/F35-FHIT, underwent growth suppression and massive induction of apoptosis without apparent activation of caspase-8 or caspase-2 and late activation of caspase-3. Treatment of infected cells with caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibitors partially blocked FHIT-induced apoptosis. The two remaining infected acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, Molt-3 and RS4;11, were apparently unaffected. Restoration of FHIT expression in the chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line and the acute myelogenous leukemia KG1a cell line also induced apoptosis but at later time points than seen in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat and MV4;11 cell lines. I.v. injection of Ad5/F35-FHIT-infected Jurkat cells resulted in abrogation of tumorigenicity in the NOD/SCID xenogeneic engraftment model. CONCLUSION: FHIT restoration in some FHIT-deficient leukemia cells induces both antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects involving the intrinsic caspase apoptotic pathway.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",,,,"['CA56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78890/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Dec 15;22(24):6304.

Modulation of the multidrug ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB1 has not resulted in improved outcome in AML, raising the question whether leukemic CD34+ CD38- cells are targeted by this strategy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ABCB1-mediated transport in leukemic CD34+ CD38- cells compared with their normal counterparts was assessed by quantitating the effect of specific ABCB1 modulators (verapamil and PSC-833) on mitoxantrone retention [defined as efflux index (EI), intracellular mitoxantrone fluorescence intensity in the presence/absence of inhibitor]. RESULTS: ABCB1 was the major drug transporter in CD34+ CD38- cells in normal bone marrow (n = 16), as shown by the abrogation of mitoxantrone extrusion by ABCB1 modulators (EI, 1.99 +/- 0.08). Surprisingly, ABCB1-mediated drug extrusion was invariably reduced in CD34+ CD38- cells in AML (n = 15; EI, 1.21 +/- 0.05; P < 0.001), which resulted in increased intracellular mitoxantrone retention in these cells (mitoxantrone fluorescence intensity, 4.54 +/- 0.46 versus 3.08 +/- 0.23; P = 0.004). Active drug extrusion from these cells occurred in the presence of ABCB1 modulators in the majority of samples, pointing in the direction of redundant drug extrusion mechanisms. Residual normal CD34+ CD38- cells could be identified by their conserved ABCB1-mediated extrusion capacity. CONCLUSION: ABCB1-mediated drug extrusion is reduced in leukemic CD34+ CD38- progenitor cells compared with their residual normal counterparts. Redundant drug transport mechanisms confer mitoxantrone transport from leukemic progenitors.

In patients with CML in complete cytogenetic remission during IFN-alpha treatment, we detected some reactivity of CD8(+) T cells against BCR-ABL in IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays, which was weaker as compared with proteinase 3 (PR3)- or prame-directed responses, suggesting that the BCR-ABL protein is less immunogenic as compared with other CML-derived antigens.","['0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show, using KG-1 and MV4-11 AML cells and recombinant 293 cells, that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA), valproic acid (VPA), and FK228 potentiated ATRA induction of FR-beta gene transcription and FR-beta mRNA/protein expression. ATRA and/or TSA did not induce de novo FR synthesis in any of a variety of FR-negative cell lines tested. TSA did not alter the effect of ATRA on the expression of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha, beta, or gamma. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that HDAC inhibitors act on the FR-beta gene by enhancing RAR-associated histone acetylation to increase the association of Sp1 with the basal FR-beta promoter. Under these conditions, the expression level of Sp1 is unaltered. A decreased availability of putative repressor AP-1 proteins may also indirectly contribute to the effect of HDAC inhibitors. Finally, FR-beta selectively mediated growth inhibition by (6S) dideazatetrahydrofolate in a manner that was greatly potentiated in AML cells by ATRA and HDAC inhibition. Therefore, the combination of ATRA and innocuous HDAC inhibitors may be expected to facilitate selective FR-beta-targeted therapies in AML.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (trophoblastic beta 1-glycoprotein receptor, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)']",,,,"['CA 103964/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 80183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA095673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current frontline therapy for CML is imatinib, an inhibitor of BCR-ABL. Although imatinib has a high rate of clinical success in early phase CML, treatment resistance is problematic, particularly in later stages of the disease, and is frequently mediated by mutations in BCR-ABL. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets oncogenic pathways and is a more potent inhibitor than imatinib against wild-type BCR-ABL. It has also shown preclinical activity against all but one of the imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants tested to date. Analysis of the crystal structure of dasatinib-bound ABL kinase suggests that the increased binding affinity of dasatinib over imatinib is at least partially due to its ability to recognize multiple states of BCR-ABL.

We found that Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with a nearly 3-fold increase in cellular glutathione levels and with increased resistance to cell death after treatment with etoposide or SN-38, a derivative of camptothecin, in leukemia 697 cells with wild-type p53. Treatment of Bcl-2-overexpressing 697 cells (697-Bcl-2) with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, reduced cellular glutathione levels and completely abolished Bcl-2-mediated drug resistance. Morphologic studies revealed that nonapoptotic cell death was induced in 697-Bcl-2 cells after treatment with BSO plus etoposide or SN-38. Activation of caspase-3/7 and cytochrome c release could not be detected in 697-Bcl-2 cells after these drug treatments. Notably, we showed that proteasome-mediated down-regulation of Puma and Noxa proteins occurs in 697-Bcl-2 cells after treatment with BSO plus topoisomerase inhibitor, although there is an increase in the protein levels of p53 in these 697-Bcl-2 cells. In contrast, parental 697 cells underwent typical apoptosis with up-regulation of Puma and Noxa proteins, followed by cytochrome c release and caspase-3/7 activation after treatment with topoisomerase inhibitor in the presence or absence of BSO. Our data suggest that BSO may possess a unique activity to overcome Bcl-2-mediated drug resistance by stimulating the signals that can bypass mitochondrial process in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activated forms of the Abl kinases (BCR-Abl, Tel-Abl, and Tel-Arg) induce the development of human leukemia; it is not known, however, whether Abl kinases are activated in solid tumors or whether they contribute to tumor development or progression. Previously, we showed that Abl kinases are activated downstream of growth factor receptors, Src family kinases, and phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) in fibroblasts and influence growth factor-mediated proliferation, membrane ruffling, and migration. Growth factor receptors, Src kinases, and PLCgamma1 are deregulated in many solid tumors and drive tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, we found that Abl kinases are constitutively activated, in highly invasive breast cancer cell lines, downstream of deregulated ErbB receptors and Src kinases. Furthermore, activation of Abl kinases promotes breast cancer cell invasion, as treatment of cells with the Abl kinase inhibitor, STI571, or silencing c-Abl and Arg expression with RNA interference dramatically inhibits Matrigel invasion. This is the first evidence that (a) Abl kinases are deregulated and activated in a nonhematopoietic cancer, (b) activation of Abl kinases in breast cancer cells occurs via a novel mechanism, and (c) constitutive activation of Abl kinases promotes invasion of breast cancer cells. These data suggest that pharmacologic inhibitors targeted against Abl kinases could potentially be useful in preventing breast cancer progression in tumors harboring activated Abl kinases.","['62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",,,,"['R01 CA116784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR20171/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address quality assurance in this technically challenging area, the European Union (EU) has funded the EQUAL project to develop methodologic external quality assessment (EQA) relevant to diagnostic and research laboratories among the EU member states. We report here the results of the EQUAL-quant program, which assesses standards in the use of TaqMan probes, one of the most widely used assays in the implementation of real-time PCR. METHODS: The EQUAL-quant reagent set was developed to assess the technical execution of a standard TaqMan assay, including RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR quantification of target DNA copy number. RESULTS: The multidisciplinary EQA scheme included 137 participating laboratories from 29 countries. We demonstrated significant differences in performance among laboratories, with 20% of laboratories reporting at least one result lacking in precision and/or accuracy according to the statistical procedures described. No differences in performance were observed for the >10 different testing platforms used by the study participants.

Epub 2006 Jun 5.,"All-trans-retinoic acid and the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) are potent regulators of the growth of cancer cells. This study investigates the individual and combined effects of PML, when overexpressed by the recombinant PML adenovirus, and all-trans-retinoic acid on the proliferation of human estrogen-receptor negative SKBR-3 and estrogen-receptor positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. All-trans-retinoic acid caused a significant degree of cell death in SKBR-3 cells and MCF-7 cells, and PML elicited a similar incidence of or slightly more cell death in MCF-7 cells. Dual-treated cells displayed significantly less cell death than did single-treated cells in the same cell line. We concluded that PML and all-trans-retinoic acid cause cell death by different pathways: PML activates ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and p21; arrests the cell cycle; and later causes cell death; and all-trans-retinoic acid activates proteasome function, caspase cleavage, and apoptosis. The combined use of all-trans-retinoic acid and PML gene therapy may not be the best treatment for patients with cancer, because the ubiquitinylation of PML and its subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation by retinoic acids occur before overexpressed PML exhibits tumor-suppressive activity.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,20060605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular parameters as viability, cell number, metabolic activity and total protein amount were monitored in screening experiments with subsequent cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis detection to determine the cellular response of the different tumor types to various concentrations of photoactivated hypericin. The results show concentration dependence of the photosensitizer's cytotoxicity on the studied cell lines, with higher sensitivity of U937 cells. Whereas the two extreme hypericin concentrations (1 x 10(-9) M and 1 x 10(-6) M) resulted in similar changes in all tested cellular parameters on the two studied cell lines, 1 x 10(-8) M and 1 x 10(-7) M hypericin treatment resulted in different responses of the cell lines in all monitored parameters except for viability. Although leukemic cells proved sensitive to both 1 x 10(-8) M and 1 x 10(-7) M hypericin, significant changes on HT-29 cells were detected only after the 1 x 10(-7) M hypericin concentration. Cell-cycle arrest was related to simultaneously occurring apoptosis in colon cancer. Remarkable is the difference in cell-cycle profile where G2/M arrest in colon cancer cells versus accumulation of leukemic cells in the S phase appears. This suggests that hypericin treatment affecting the cell-cycle machinery of different cancer cells is not universal in effect.","['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neoplasm was composed predominantly of blasts that expressed CD68, CD117, myeloperoxidase, and lysozyme, with occasional immature eosinophils. Although blood and bone marrow examinations showed no morphologic evidence of leukemia, conventional cytogenetic studies of marrow demonstrated inv(16)(p13q22) in 4 of 20 metaphases; fluorescence in situ hybridization of the bladder neoplasm also showed inv(16). Following chemotherapy, the patient has been in complete remission for 32 months. In our literature review, we identified 7 cases of MS involving bladder, only 3 without evidence of an associated myeloid neoplasm in marrow, none with cytogenetic data. A high index of suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis of MS involving bladder.

There have been several reports indicating that double light-chain gene rearrangements or dual light-chain expression can occur in B-cell malignant neoplasms, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Currently, it is a common notion that demonstration of light-chain restriction in a B-cell population is generally considered proof of monoclonality and indicates malignancy. OBJECTIVE: To increase awareness of the existence of the dual kappa/lambda immunoglobulin light-chain expressing B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, to emphasize the importance of visual inspection of flow cytometric data, and to present the guidelines for flow cytometric interpretation of dual kappa/lambda coexpressing populations. DATA SOURCES: Through comprehensive literature review, this article discusses the current understandings regarding the dual light-chain expression in B-cell neoplasms, the cellular and molecular mechanisms, and the clinical and diagnostic implications of dual light-chain expression. CONCLUSIONS: Dual kappa/lambda light-chain expressing B-cell leukemia/lymphomas do exist. Recognition of the dual kappa/lambda light-chain expression on B cells has diagnostic implication in leukemia/lymphoma immunophenotyping.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated whether VPA induces MK differentiation in a UT-7 cell line through histone acetylation in the GpIIIa gene region and activation of the ERK pathway. UT-7 cells, derived from megakaryoblastic leukemia, were treated with VPA at various concentrations, and the expression of differentiation markers as well as the gene expression profile was assessed. Flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis, and RT-PCR demonstrated that VPA induced the expression of the early MK markers GpIIIa (CD61) and GpIIb/IIIa (CD41) in a dose-dependent manner. The VPA-treated cells showed hyperacetylation of the histones H3 and H4; in particular, histone acetylation was found to have been associated with CD61 expression, in that the GpIIIa promoter showed H4 hyperacetylation, as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, activation of the ERK pathway was involved in VPA-mediated CD61/CD41 expression and in cell adhesion, as demonstrated by using the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126. In conclusion, the capacity of VPA to commit UT-7 cells to MK differentiation is mediated by its inhibitory action on HDAC and the long-lived activation of ERK1/2.","['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (ITGB3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (U 0126)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High levels of Jaw1/LRMP mRNA have been found in germinal centre B-cells and in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of 'germinal centre' subtype. This paper documents Jaw1/LRMP expression at the protein level in human tissues by immunohistochemical and western blotting analysis using an antibody reactive with paraffin-embedded tissues. Jaw1/LRMP was highly expressed in germinal centre B-cells (in keeping with gene expression data), in 'monocytoid B-cells', and in splenic marginal zone B-cells. It was absent, or present at only low levels, in mature T-cells, although cortical thymocytes were weakly positive. Among lymphoid neoplasms, Jaw1/LRMP was found in germinal centre-derived lymphomas (follicle centre lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease) but not in T-cell neoplasms (with the exception of a single T lymphoblastic lymphoma). Classical Hodgkin's disease and myeloma lacked Jaw1/LRMP but many cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (but not mantle zone lymphoma) were Jaw1/LRMP-positive. Approximately half of the marginal zone lymphomas were Jaw1/LRMP-positive. In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, Jaw1/LRMP was found in three-quarters (24/32) of the cases classified phenotypically as being of 'germinal centre' type, but it was also expressed in almost half (13/28) of the 'non-germinal centre' cases. A similar proportion of 'non-germinal centre' cases were positive for the protein products of two other genes expressed highly in germinal centre cells (HGAL/GCET2 and PAG). The fact that all three of these proteins are expressed in a significant proportion of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas assigned to the 'non-germinal centre' category indicates that the immunophenotypic categorization of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to cellular origin may be more complicated than currently understood. Finally, the expression of Jaw1/LRMP in other types of lymphoma and in non-lymphoid tissues/tumours may be of interest in differential diagnosis and research.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IRAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.'],,,,,,,,

Therefore, we focused on pediatric patients diagnosed with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) treated uniformly according to the NHL-BFM95 protocol. We used loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of 25 microsatellite markers located on chromosome 6q14-q24. Fragment-length analysis was performed on ABI-PRISM3100 Genetic-Analyzer. Eligibility criterion was > or =3 informative markers. Between April 1995 and March 2003, 185 T-LBL patients were treated according to the NHL-BFM95 protocol. Five-year event-free (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 79+/-3 and 87+/-3% (median follow-up 4.7 [1.2-10.1] years). Sixty-one patients were evaluable for LOH analysis, including 18 out of 23 patients with relapse. EFS and DFS were 67+/-6 and 69+/-6% for these 61 patients. Testing of 853 markers in the 61 patients identified the presence of LOH in 19 patients (31%): 13 of the 18 relapse patients and five of the 41 in complete remission (odds ratio 18.7, 95% confidence interval 4.7-75.3). One LOH-positive patient died from treatment-related toxicity. We conclude that LOH on chromosome 6q14-q24 may have conferred a high risk of relapse on our group of children with T-LBL treated according to the NHL-BFM95 protocol.",,,,20060601,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal NOTCH1 signaling is initiated by the binding of ligand to the extracellular subunit, which renders the transmembrane subunit susceptible to two successive cleavages within and C terminal to the heterodimerization domain, catalyzed by metalloproteases and gamma-secretase, respectively. Because mutations in the heterodimerization domain of NOTCH1 occur frequently in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we assessed the effect of 16 putative tumor-associated mutations on Notch1 signaling and HD domain stability. We show here that 15 of the 16 mutations activate canonical NOTCH1 signaling. Increases in signaling occur in a ligand-independent fashion, require gamma-secretase activity, and correlate with an increased susceptibility to cleavage by metalloproteases. The activating mutations cause soluble NOTCH1 heterodimers to dissociate more readily, either under native conditions (n = 3) or in the presence of urea (n = 11). One mutation, an insertion of 14 residues immediately N terminal to the metalloprotease cleavage site, increases metalloprotease sensitivity more than all others, despite a negligible effect on heterodimer stability by comparison, suggesting that the insertion may expose the S2 site by repositioning it relative to protective NOTCH1 ectodomain residues. Together, these studies show that leukemia-associated HD domain mutations render NOTCH1 sensitive to ligand-independent proteolytic activation through two distinct mechanisms.","['0 (Ligands)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,"['R56 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA119130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119130-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1489116,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed transplantation outcome in 49 consecutive children with severe thalassemia who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation with related-donor (n=28) and unrelated-donor (n=21) stem cells between September 1992 and May 2005 at the Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University (Bangkok, Thailand). Analysis of engraftment, frequency of procedure-related complications, and thalassemia-free survival showed no advantage from use of related-donor stem cells. The 2-year thalassemia-free survival estimate for recipients of related-donor stem cells was 82% compared with 71% in the unrelated-donor stem cell group (P=.42). The present study provides evidence to support the view that it is quite reasonable to consider unrelated-donor stem cell transplantation an acceptable therapeutic approach in severe thalassemia, at least for patients who are not fully compliant with conventional treatment and do not yet show irreversible severe complications of iron overload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a phase I/II study that analyzed the feasibility of mobilizing stem cells from normal donors with peg-G-CSF and the ability of these cells to restore hematopoiesis in allogeneic transplant recipients after myeloablative conditioning. Administration of 6 mg of peg-G-CSF resulted in suboptimal stem cell mobilization, with a peak peripheral blood CD34+ count of 29+/-5/microL. Apheresis 4 days after peg-G-CSF yielded 2.7+/-.4x10(6) CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight, and all donors required a second collection on day 5 to yield a total of 4.2+/-.5x10(6) CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight. After escalation of the dose to 12 mg, the peak CD34+ count was 99+/-11/microL and 12 of 13 donors collected sufficient stem cells for transplantation in a single apheresis (8.9+/-1.4x10(6) CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight). Late transient increases in serum hepatic transaminases were noted, but other side effects (predominantly bone pain) were otherwise similar to those seen in donors mobilized with standard G-CSF. Median neutrophil and platelet engraftments occurred on days 18 and 14, respectively, after transplantation and were identical to those seen with in recipients of grafts mobilized with standard G-CSF. With a median follow-up of 357 days, the incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 50% and there have been no relapses to date. Mobilization of stem cells with peg-G-CSF in normal donors is feasible and 12 mg results in mobilization characteristics similar to those of standard G-CSF.","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, human)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP53 is located at chromosome band 17p13 and its absence can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the interphase nuclei of 8-10% patients with B-CLL. To study the cytogenetic mechanism for loss of TP53, metaphase and interphase FISH studies were conducted on 16 B-CLL patients to investigate 17p10 to 17p12, a chromosome region known to be rich in low-copy DNA repeats. Loss of TP53 was caused by an isochromosome with breakpoints between 17p10 and 17p11.2 in four patients, an unbalanced translocation involving 17p10 to 17p11.2 in nine patients, and an unbalanced translocation involving 17p11.2 to 17p12 in three patients. These findings indicate that loss of TP53 results from the absence of nearly the entire chromosome 17 p-arm rather than to monosomy 17 or deletions of TP53. Translocations or isochromosome formations at sites of low-copy DNA repeats in 17p10 to 17p12 appear to be the mechanism for the loss of TP53 in B-CLL.",,,,,['R01 CA95241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent recurring chromosomal aberrations identified in B-CLL patients are trisomy 12 and deletions of 13q, 17p, and 11q. Cases with deletions of 11q and 17p have a poor prognosis, whereas cases with deletions in 13q have a favorable prognosis. It was previously shown that CLL patients with trisomy 12 and del(13)(q14) have a higher rate of asynchronous replication of normal structural genes when compared to those with normal karyotypes. We studied the replication pattern of the structural locus 21q22 and the imprinted gene SNRPN and its telomere (15qter) and the random aneuploidy of chromosomes 9 and 18 in CLL patients with trisomy 12 and deletions of 11q and 17p, and compared the results to those of CLL patients without these aberrations and to healthy controls. Random aneuploidy rate was higher in the group of patients with trisomy 12 as compared to all other groups. The replication pattern with higher asynchronous pattern was found in both aberration groups compared to the CLL patients without the aberrations and to the control group with involvement of 21q22 and 15qter, whereas the highest synchronous group was found in the 2 aberrations CLL patient groups compared to the other groups with the imprinted locus SNRPN. The existence and significance of chromosomal aberrations in CLL have a deleterious effect on the processes of cell cycle and gene replication and may have biological and prognostic implications.","['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear)', '0 (SNRPN protein, human)', '0 (snRNP Core Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data concerning the genomic alterations of LSC are almost nonexistent. Here, we report on the first molecular cytogenetic characterization of a metastatic LSC. Cytogenetic and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) analyses showed a near-triploid karyotype with numerous structural aberrations and four to six small supernumerary marker chromosomes containing chromosome 9 sequences. Comparative genomic hybridization on arrays (array CGH) detected an amplification of 9p23 approximately p24.3 and gains of 1q11 approximately q23.3, 3q26.2 approximately q29, and 17q23.2 approximately q24.1. The 9p amplification was also detected in the primary tumor and another metastasis of the same patient, indicating it was a significant element in the pathogenesis of this LSC case. Complementary FISH analysis showed that the small supernumerary chromosomes were isochromosomes for 9p23 approximately p24.3. These isochromosomes were lacking alpha-satellite sequences although they were still stable after 55 passages in culture. As demonstrated by immunostaining with anti-centromere antibodies, they contained a functional centromere. So-called analphoid ""neocentromeres"" are rare and have been mainly described in constitutional abnormal karyotypes. This case is the third description of the identification of neocentromeres in cancer, (i.e. well-differentiated liposarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia), and is the first one in a carcinoma. Our results suggest that the 9p23 neocentromere of this case of LSC might be similar to a 9p23 neocentromere previously identified in two constitutional cases. The frequency of neocentromere formation in solid tumors may indeed be underestimated and may have a significant implication in chromosomal instability in tumor cells.","['0 (KDM4C protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ETV6 is predominantly a nuclear phosphoprotein that represses transcription by binding directly to the promoters of target genes. The nuclear localization mechanism of ETV6, however, is not well understood. In this report, we provide evidence that a nuclear localization signal (NLS) exists in the C-terminal region of ETV6. ETV6 proteins with mutations outside of amino acids 332-452 localize to the nucleus, whereas proteins with mutations within amino acids 332-452 remain in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, when a fragment of ETV6 comprised of amino acids 332-452 was fused to cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase protein, the fusion protein was able to enter the nucleus. These results strongly indicate that residues 332-452 mediate nuclear localization of ETV6.","['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 5.,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells are genetically normal, pluripotent cells, capable of self-renewal and differentiation into all cell lineages. While leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) maintains pluripotency in mouse ES cells, retinoic acid and other nuclear hormones induce neuro-glial differentiation in mouse and human ES cells in culture. Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-dependent nuclear receptor transcription factors that regulate cell growth and differentiation in many cell types. However, the role of PPARs in the regulation of ES cell growth and differentiation is not known. In this study, we show that LIF induces proliferation and self-renewal of mouse D3-ES cells in culture. However, treatment with 15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-Prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ2), a natural ligand for PPARgamma, or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) results in a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation and self-renewal in D3-ES cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that LIF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, TYK2 and STAT3 in 30 min and treatment with 15d-PGJ2 or ATRA results in a dose-dependent decrease in LIF-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 in D3-ES cells. However, treatment of D3-ES cells with Ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 for 48 h in culture resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PPARgamma protein expression. These results suggest that PPARgamma agonists regulate LIF signaling through JAK-STAT pathway leading to growth and self-renewal of ES cells.","['0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,20060505,"['3R01NS042257-01A2S1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5R01NS042257-01A3/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5R21CA106207-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes aberrant expression of these genes in ovarian cancer, the commonest cause of death amongst gynaecological malignancies. METHODS: Eph and ephrin expression was determined using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Correlation of gene expression was measured using Spearman's rho statistic. Survival was analysed using log-rank analysis and (was visualised by) Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: Greater than 10 fold over-expression of EphA1 and a more modest over-expression of EphA2 were observed in partially overlapping subsets of tumors. Over-expression of EphA1 strongly correlated (r = 0.801; p < 0.01) with the high affinity ligand ephrin A1. A similar trend was observed between EphA2 and ephrin A1 (r = 0.387; p = 0.06). A striking correlation of both ephrin A1 and ephrin A5 expression with poor survival (r = -0.470; p = 0.02 and r = -0.562; p < 0.01) was observed. Intriguingly, there was no correlation between survival and other clinical parameters or Eph expression. CONCLUSION: These data imply that increased levels of ephrins A1 and A5 in the presence of high expression of Ephs A1 and A2 lead to a more aggressive tumor phenotype. The known functions of Eph/ephrin signalling in cell de-adhesion and movement may explain the observed correlation of ephrin expression with poor prognosis.","['0 (Ephrin-A1)', '0 (Ephrin-A2)', '0 (Ephrin-A5)']",,,20060601,,PMC1501040,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This conclusion was tempered since a mechanism for leukemia induction could not be identified. Chemically induced leukemia is a well-studied phenomenon with benzene and a number of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs recognized as capable of causing this effect. Abundant in vitro and in vivo data in animals and humans demonstrate that exposure to sufficient doses of these recognized leukemogens can initiate a cascade of events leading to hematopoietic toxicity and the subsequent development of leukemia. This review addresses the biological plausibility that formaldehyde might be capable of causing any type of leukemia by providing a broad overview of the scientific data that must be considered in order to support or refute a conclusion that a particular substance might be leukemogenic. Data on benzene and selected chemotherapeutic cancer drugs are used as examples and are briefly summarized to demonstrate the similar biological events thought to result in leukemogenesis. These data are compared and contrasted with the available data on formaldehyde in order to judge whether they fulfill the criteria of biological plausibility that formaldehyde would be capable of inducing leukemia as suggested by the epidemiological data. Based on the epidemiological data, it is reasonable to expect that if formaldehyde was capable of inducing leukemia, in vivo and in vitro data would offer supporting evidence for biological plausibility. In particular, there is (1) no evidence to suggest that formaldehyde reaches any target organ beyond the site of administration including the bone marrow, (2) no indication that formaldehyde is toxic to the bone marrow/hematopoietic system in in vivo or in vitro studies, and (3) no credible evidence that formaldehyde induces leukemia in experimental animals. As discussed in this review, based on the key biological events that occur in the process of chemically induced leukemia, there is inadequate biological evidence currently available to corroborate existing weak epidemiological associations. This provides an insufficient database to conclude that there is a causal relationship for formaldehyde and leukemia risk.","['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Safety, that is, absence of damage to normal cells in the course of the laser thermolysis was also low due to less than optimal protocol of cancer cell targeting with nanoparticles (NP). The objective of this study was two-fold: to optimize NP targeting to real tumor (human) cells and to better understand physical mechanisms of cell damage for improved control of the laser ablation. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have suggested (1) two-stage targeting method to form clusters of light-absorbing gold NPs selectively in target cells, and (2) the cell damage mechanism through laser-induced generation of vapor bubbles around NP clusters. Experimental investigation of laser nano-thermolysis of leukemia cells was performed using 30 nm spherical gold nanoparticles as a light absorbing agent, and photothermal and fluorescent microscopies as well as flow cytometry as methods to monitor microbubble formation and resulting damage of leukemia cells in human bone marrow specimens. RESULTS: NP clusters were formed and visualized using fluorescence microscopy at cell membranes and in cytoplasm of B-lymphoblasts. Laser irradiation of cells (532 nm, 10 nanoseconds, 0.6 J/cm2) induced microbubbles selectively in leukemia cells with large clusters, but not in cells with single NPs or small clusters. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that only 0.1%-1.5% of tumor cells and 77%-84% of normal bone marrow cells survived laser pulse. CONCLUSIONS: Two-stage cell targeting method permits formation of NP clusters selectively in diagnosis-specific tumor cells. The clusters serve as effective sources of photothermally-induced microbubbles, which kill individual target cells after a single laser pulse. The laser fluence threshold for generation of microbubbles is inversely proportional to the volume of NP clusters.",['7440-57-5 (Gold)'],,,,"['R44 CA110137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 CA110137-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 CA110137-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Mice with a disruption in both alleles of the PU.1 locus were found to lack macrophages and B cells and had delayed appearance of neutrophils. In addition, critical decrease of PU.1 expression is sufficient to cause acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and lymphomas in mice. Recently, we reported that heterozygous mutations in the PU.1 gene are present in some patients with AML. Thus, we hypothesised that PU.1 mutations might also contribute to the development of acute leukaemias of the B-cell lineage. Here, we screened 62 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) at diagnosis for genomic mutations by direct sequencing of all five exons of the PU.1 gene. We found no genomic alteration of the PU.1 gene suggesting that PU.1 mutations are not likely to be common in B-ALL.","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,20060530,,PMC2361337,,,"['Br J Cancer. 2006 Aug 21;95(4):554.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The British Columbia Cancer Agency Lymphoid Cancer database was used to identify adolescents (16 years to 21 years) and young adults (22 years to 45 years) receiving primary treatment for HL between 1981 and 2004. All patients were treated using adult protocols. RESULTS: The study population included 259 adolescents and 890 young adults. There were no significant differences in histologic subtypes, sex, stages, or presence of B symptoms or bulky disease between adolescents and adults. Equal proportions of adolescents and adults were treated with radiation alone (38% v 35%), chemotherapy alone (13% v 15%), or combined-modality programs (49% v 50%). There was no difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between adolescents and adults, with 10-year PFS rates of 77% versus 80% (P = .67) and 10-year OS rates of 91% versus 89% (P = .42).

Whether additional intensification can add to this effect has not yet been determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,770 patients (age 16 to 85 years) with de novo or secondary AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were randomly assigned upfront for induction therapy containing one course with standard dose and one course with high-dose cytarabine, or two courses with high-dose cytarabine, and in the same step received postremission prolonged maintenance or busulfan/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation. RESULTS: The complete remission rate in patients younger than 60 and > or = 60 years of age was 70% and 53%, respectively. The overall survival at 3 years in the two age groups was 42% and 19%, the relapse-free survival was 40% and 19%, and the ongoing remission duration was 48% and 22%, respectively. There were no significant differences in these results between the two randomized induction arms or between the two postremission therapy arms. There was no significant difference in any prognostic subgroup according to secondary AML/MDS, cytogenetics, WBC, lactate dehydrogenase, and early blast clearance. CONCLUSION: The regimen of one course with standard-dose cytarabine and one course with high-dose cytarabine for induction, and prolonged maintenance for postremission chemotherapy in patients with AML is not improved by additional escalation in cytotoxic treatment.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jul 1;29(19):2739'],['J Clin Oncol. 2006 Dec 1;24(34):5471-2; author reply 5472-3.

Epub 2006 May 30.,"CONTEXT: The human endometrium acquires the ability to allow embryo attachment just for a specific period of time during each menstrual cycle. Understanding of the opposite functional status, referred to as refractoriness, can potentially be used to improve receptivity in infertile patients or as an interceptive approach to prevent gestation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to analyze the endometrial gene expression profile induced by an inert intrauterine device (IUD) at the time of implantation. DESIGN: We used a microarray containing more than 16,000 cDNAs to investigate the gene expression profile of receptive vs. refractory endometrium in the same women induced by the presence of an IUD. We compared the gene expression profile of endometrium obtained at LH+7 (window of receptivity) from the same women (n = 5) at the following time points: month 1, corresponding to the natural cycle before IUD insertion; month 3, just before IUD removal; and months 5 and 15. Data were validated by quantitative RT-PCR for IGF binding protein-3, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-gamma, glycodelin, and leukemia inhibitory factor and immunohistochemistry for glycodelin. RESULTS: We identified 147 genes significantly dysregulated in the refractory endometrium (78 up- and 69 down-regulated). Interestingly, 52 of these genes have previously been reported to be regulated during window of implantation. Surprisingly, the majority of genes (96.6%) remained dysregulated 2 months after IUD removal, but 1 yr later most of them (80%) returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that a refractory endometrium in a fertile woman produced by an IUD is induced by preventing the normal transition to a receptive gene expression profile through effects on a specific subset or cluster of genes that impact on endometrial receptivity.",,,,20060530,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 30.,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis of ligands, such as transferrin and LDL, is suppressed when clathrin synthesis is blocked by RNA interference in HeLa cells. We have found that domains containing the adapter complex 2 (AP2)-coated vesicle adapter and the endocytic accessory proteins CALM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein), epsin, and eps15/eps15R (EGF receptor pathway substrate 15-related) nevertheless persist at the plasma membrane. They are similar in size and number to those seen in clathrin-expressing cells. Here we characterize these membrane domains by fluorescence and electron microscopy in detail. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements suggest that the exchange between membrane-bound and free cytosolic AP2 molecules is not significantly influenced by the depletion of clathrin. The AP2 membrane domains are dispersed upon interfering with protein-protein interactions that involve the alpha appendage domain of AP2. Electron microscopy of cellular cortices revealed that the AP2 membrane domains lack any curvature, suggesting that clathrin is essential for driving coated pit invagination. A model for coated vesicle formation, incorporating a mechanism commonly referred to as a ""Brownian ratchet,"" is consistent with our observations.","['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 2)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (epsin)']",,,20060530,,PMC1482644,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 30.,"We have recently demonstrated that heterochromatin HP1 proteins are aberrantly distributed in lymphocytes of patients with immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial dysmorphy (ICF) syndrome. The three HP1 proteins accumulate in one giant body over the 1qh and 16qh juxtacentromeric heterochromatins, which are hypomethylated in ICF. The presence of PML (promyelocytic leukaemia) protein within this body suggests it to be a giant PML nuclear body (PML-NB). The structural integrity of PML-NBs is of major importance for normal cell functioning. Nevertheless, the structural organisation and the functions of these nuclear bodies remain unclear. Here, we take advantage of the large size of the giant body to demonstrate that it contains a core of satellite DNA with proteins being organised in ordered concentric layers forming a sphere around it. We extend these results to normal PML-NBs and propose a model for the general organisation of these structures at the G2 phase. Moreover, based on the presence of satellite DNA and the proteins HP1, BRCA1, ATRX and DAXX within the PML-NBs, we propose that these structures have a specific function: the re-establishment of the condensed heterochromatic state on late-replicated satellite DNA. Our findings that chromatin-remodelling proteins fail to accumulate around satellite DNA in PML-deficient NB4 cells support a central role for PML protein in this cellular function.","['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,20060530,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Jun 2.,"Permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp) positive cells are known to be encoded by the multidrug-resistance gene (MDR1), and characterized by a reduced ability to accumulate drugs. The vinblastin-resistant, Pgp positive CEM-VLB 1000 and its wild type (Pgp-negative and vinblastin-sensitive) counterpart CEM-T4 human leukemia cells, when treated with the alkaloid sanguinarine, were both found to undergo apoptosis at concentrations of 1.5 microg/ml and oncosis/blister cell death (BCD) at concentrations of 12.5 microg/ml. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of sanguinarine to overcome Pgp-mediated multidrug-resistance (MDR), and also to characterize the cell death processes of apoptosis and oncosis (or bimodal cell death) induced by sanguinarine in MDR cells. The cell death processes of apoptosis and oncosis in CEM-VLB 1000 and CEM-T4 cell lines were found to be qualitatively similar when assessed by light microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) end-labeling, annexin-V-binding, trypan blue exclusion and western blot analysis. Western blotting revealed an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and activation of caspase-3 in apoptosis but not oncosis in both cell lines. The Pgp-positive CEM-VLB 1000 cells and their wild type CEM-T4 cells were both equally sensitive to sanguinarine. Thus, sanguinarine may overcome the phenomenon of Pgp-mediated MDR by inducing apoptosis through increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and activating caspase-3, and oncosis, which involved neither.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'AV9VK043SS (sanguinarine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,20060602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated the course of nucleosomal DNA, thymidine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and leukocytes in sera of 25 patients with acute myeloid leukemia during the first cycle of induction chemotherapy and tested their power to distinguish between patients with complete remission and those with no remission. RESULTS: Almost all patients showed strongly decreasing levels of nucleosomal DNA during the first week, in some cases after initial peaks. In overall analysis of variance, DNA levels could clearly distinguish between patients with complete remission, who had higher DNA values, and those with insufficient response (p = 0.017). The area under the curve of DNA values of days 2-4 after start of therapy (AUC 2-4) discriminated between both groups with a sensitivity of 56% at a specificity of 100%. Further, pretherapeutic levels and AUC 2-4 of nucleosomal DNA correlated significantly with blast reduction after 16 days. A tendency to higher levels in patients with complete response was also found for thymidine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and leukocytes, however the difference did not reach the level of significance (p = 0.542, p = 0.260, and p = 0.144, respectively).

The relationship between bleeding and PLT count was explored with the Italian data. RESULTS: A total of 897 patients with acute leukemia received 10,506 PLT transfusions. Grade 3 or Grade 4 WHO bleeding frequency was 28.1 percent (252/897) but varied by country: Italy, 10.8 percent (27/250); United States, 36.4 percent (217/598); Canada, 18.9 percent (7/37); and the United Kingdom, 8.3 percent (1/12). Grade 1 or Grade 2 bleeding was reported only in the Italian study (46.4%[116/250] and 11.6%[29/250], respectively). The relative rates of WHO Grade 2, 3, or 4 bleeding for PLT counts in the ranges of 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 (x10(9)/L) were 8.8, 1.9, 1.8, and 1.2, respectively, compared to those counts within the range of 20 to 29 (x10(9)/L). CONCLUSION: The study provides descriptive data on PLT use and frequency of bleeding. When PLT counts were 0x10(9) to 4x10(9) per L there was an eightfold increase in bleeding and a twofold risk increase when counts were 5x10(9) to 14x10(9) per L compared to the 20x10(9) to 29x10(9) per L reference range. The increased rate of bleeding at low counts occurred despite PLT therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,['BEST Collaborative (Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion)'],,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been established as a therapeutic agent for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, and has been used for MM patients in clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the role of c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) in ATO-induced apoptosis in MM lines. The exogenous interleukin (IL)-6 dependent MM line, ILKM-3, and independent MM lines, U266 and XG-7, were treated with a therapeutic concentration of ATO with or without JNK inhibitor 1 (a JNK-specific inhibitor) and anisomycin (a JNK activator). Their cell growth, cell cycle, JNK activation and NF-kappaB activation were investigated. ATO induced apoptosis in U266 and ILKM-3 regardless of their exogenous IL-6 dependency. This apoptosis, accompanied with decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential, sustained activation of JNK but not cell cycle arrest. Pretreatment of JNK inhibitor prevented ATO-induced apoptosis in ATO-sensitive lines. Combined treatment with ATO and anisomycin induced sustained activation of JNK and apoptosis in the ATO-insensitive MM line, XG-7. Results of various time period treatments of ATO showed that sustained activation of JNK was needed in ATO-induced apoptosis in MM. IkBalpha phosphorylation was not associated with ATO-sensitivity of MM lines. These findings suggest that sustained activation of JNK plays a critical role in ATO-induced apoptosis in MM cell lines. Cotreatment with ATO and the agent, which can induce sustained activation of JNK, might improve the outcome in MM therapy.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study population consisted of 2729 atomic bomb survivors in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, who had no previous history of cancer at baseline. The baseline survey, including analysis of antibody to HTLV-1, took place during 1985-1987 and follow-up was performed until the end of 2001. There were 553 incident cases of malignant neoplasms during the observation period. After adjustment for sex, age and other variables, HTLV-1 infection was not associated with the risk of developing cancers of all sites, excluding adult T-cell leukemia (rate ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.4), stomach, colon and rectum, lung, female breast or other minor sites, but was associated with increased risk of liver cancer (rate ratio 2.1, 95%CI 1.0-4.6). The point estimate of the rate ratio for thyroid cancer was 3.0, but this was not significantly higher than 1 because of the small number of events (n = 11) and low prevalence of HTLV-1 seropositivity. These findings support the idea that HTLV-1 infection is not associated with an increased general cancer risk. Confounding by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the interaction between HTLV-1 and HCV may explain the increased risk of liver cancer among HTLV-1 carriers. Further follow-up may be required to determine if HTLV-1 carriers are at increased risk of thyroid cancer.",['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their presence has been noted to interfere with the flow-cytometric analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), because their immunophenotype is similar to B-precursor cell lymphoblasts. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is a clinical condition characterized by increased platelet destruction due to sensitization of platelets by autoantibodies. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and clinical impact of bone marrow hematogones in cases of acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) among children. This was done by immunophenotyping of bone marrow lymphocytes of ITP cases and controls and follow up of cases. This study was done on 25 cases of ITP, 12 females and 13 males, their age ranged from 2 to 13 years. A control group was included in the study, 15 cases of apparently healthy children with matching age and sex taken from among bone marrow donors. Cases and controls were subjected to bone marrow lymphocyte immunophenotyping with flow-cytometry to verify the presence of hematogones. A statistically significant increase in the percentage of hematogones was demonstrated in their bone marrows. An increased percentage of CD10+ lymphocytes was demonstrated; with a mean of 18+/-15.2%, CD19+ with a mean of 27+/-16.3% and CD34+ with a mean of 3.7+/-3.2%. No correlation was found between the percentage of hematogones and peripheral platelet count or bone marrow lymphocytic count. In conclusion, there is an increase in the bone marrow hematogones in ITP cases in comparison to normal controls. This could be the sequence of an immunological response to the cause which determined the disease, or the regeneration of the stem cell compartment following transient damage.","['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Commercially dedicated cancer cDNA macroarrays (Atlas Human Cancer 1.2) containing 1176 genes were used. Different statistical approaches (hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and SAM) were used to analyze the expression data. RT-QPCR and immunohistochemical studies were used for validation of results. RESULTS: RT-QPCR validated the increased expression of LCN2 (lipocalin 2) and for the first time PLAT (tissue-type plasminogen activator or tPA) in malignant pancreas as compared with normal pancreas. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the increased expression of LCN2 protein localized in epithelial cells of ducts invaded by carcinoma. The analysis of PLAT and LCN2 transcripts in 12 samples obtained through EUS-guided FNA from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma showed significantly increased expression levels in comparison with those found in normal tissues, indicating that a sufficient amount of high quality RNA can be obtained with this technique. CONCLUSION: Expression profiling is a useful method to identify biomarkers and potential target genes.

During the G2/M arrest, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), p21 and p27 were increased in a time-dependent manner. Analysis of the cell cycle regulatory proteins demonstrated that THDA did not change the steady-state levels of cyclin B1, cyclin D3 and Cdc25C, but decreased the protein levels of Cdk1, Cdk2 and cyclin A. THDA also caused a marked increase in apoptosis, which was associated with activation of caspase-3 and proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.

Epub 2006 May 30.,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is a highly effective agent in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), whereas other hematopoietic tumors are less responsive to this agent and mechanisms underlying As2O3,-resistance are poorly understood. To better understand the complex network of GSH-related pathways in As2O3 sensitivity, we investigated the role of GSH and GSH-relevant enzymes in an APL cell line sensitive to As2O3 (NB4) and in a resistant subclone (AsR). Cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis were investigated in NB4 cells before and after treatment with 1 muM As2O3 and in AsR cells. In these experimental cell models, GSTP1-1, JNK1 and JNK2 proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting, and a kinase assay for JNK1 was performed. GSH levels as well as the activities of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, gamma-Glutamylcysteynilsinthetase and superoxide dismutase were measured. NB4 cells treated with As2O3 showed a high level of oxidative stress and an increase of GSH levels. GSTP1-1 polymerization and JNK1 activation were detectable after 24 h and were followed by an increase of the apoptotic rate starting at 72 h. Neither GSTP1-1 polymerization nor JNK activation was found in AsR cells that showed a very low apoptotic rate. Our results suggest that APL sensitivity to As2O3 might be, at least in part, mediated by the balance between association and dissociation of JNK from GSTP1-1, depending on the redox status of the cell.

Epub 2006 May 29.,"UNLABELLED: Despite the very high percentage of long-term remissions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children, some of them suffer from recurrence of the disease. New treatment modalities, e.g. effective geno- and immunotherapy are needed. The use of neoplasmatic cells to present tumor antigens is one of the approaches in cancer vaccines. ALL cells lack the expression of costimulatory molecules and are poor antigen presenting cells (APCs) for T-cell activation. CD40/40L interaction stimulates B-cells to proliferate, differentiate, upregulate costimulatory molecules and increase antigen presentation. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that ALL cells can be turned into professional APCs by CD40L activation. Children with B-cell precursor ALL were enrolled into the study. Mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood were stimulated with CD40L and interleukin 4. RESULTS: 1) after culture we noted upregulation of all assessed costimulatory, adhesion and activatory molecules i.e. CD1a, CD11c, CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD123, HLA class I and II; 2) CD40L activated ALL cells induced proliferation of allogeneic T-cells (measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation). These results confirm the possibility of enhancing the immunogenicity of ALL cells with the CD40L system and indicate that this approach can be used in immunotherapeutic trials.","['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,20060529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 24.,"During embryonic development, the structures of the nephron from the glomerulus to distal tubule derive from the metanephric mesenchyme. The mesenchymal cells change their cell type and produce highly organized epithelia under the influence of signals from the ureteric bud. The morphological sequence of this conversion includes the formation of a corona of mesenchymal cells surrounding the tips of the ureteric bud, followed by the development of a pre-tubular aggregate, which evolves into preliminary forms of the segmented nephron. Currently, these stages are largely based on histomorphologic criteria and expression of marker molecules. However, to dissect the effects of inductive signals from the ureteric bud in more detail, a sophisticated readout of stages in the conversion process is required, based on the onset of epithelial polarity and the occurrence of vectorial transport. In this review, we discuss some of the new approaches in establishing the staging of the conversion process.","['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (cytokine-like factor-1)']",15,,20060524,"['DK055388/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK058872/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRD after induction therapy, before high-dose methotrexate and early intensification as well as at 1 year and 2 year maintenance therapy was detected by multiparameter-flow-cytometry (MP-FCM). RESULTS: (1) The probability of 39-month event-free survival (EFS) for patients with a level of MRD < 10(-4), was significantly higher than for those with a higher MRD [(83.00 +/- 9.90)% vs 0.00%, P < 0.01]. (2) Univariate analysis indicated that the MRD level at achieving complete remission (CR) had no relationship with the biologic features at presentation (gender, age, white blood cells and cytogenetic abnormalities), but did with Philadelphia chromosome, the time reaching CR, ALL-XH-99 risk group and lymphoblasts in bone marrow on day 19 after induction therapy (P < 0.05). (3) Multivariate analysis suggested that MRD level after the first induction course was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 5.381; 95% CI 0.004 to 0.624; P < 0.05).

Three days later they were pulsed with frozen thawing L7212 leukemia-related antigen. Mice bearing leukemia received allo-BMT at d 0, and then were divided into control group (A), T cells group (B) and DC + T cells group (C) to receive respective immune therapy at d 14.

RESULTS: AML cells displayed a significant reduction or lack of E-cadherin gene and protein expression, the positive rates were 23.6% and 18.2% (P < 0.01), respectively. All normal bone marrow cells were E-cadherin positive. Thirty-eight of the 55 patients (69.1%) were E-cadherin 5' CpG island methylated whereas the normal controls were completely unmethylated. Twenty-nine of thirty-one (93.5%) E-cadherin-negative samples showed abnormal hypermethylation of the E-cadherin CpG islands.

METHODS: From January 1998 to May 2003, 75 patients with newly diagnosed AML were enrolled on the protocol AML-XH-99. Biological features at presentation [gender, age, white blood cells, platelet count, French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, cytogenetic abnormalities] and therapy-related factors [bone marrow (BM) blast cell counts at 48 h after the first induction course, complete remission (CR) rate after the first course of induction therapy] were analyzed. The probability of event-free survival (pEFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the distributions of pEFS were compared using log-rank test. Chi-square analysis or Fisher exact test was used to compare differences in the distribution of presenting biological features. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: (1) Univariate analysis of the proportion of patients attaining CR after induction indicate that FAB M(5), BM blasts >or= 0.150 at 48 h after the first induction course and no response to the first induction course were associated with lower CR rates (P = 0.001, 0.011, 0.000 respectively). Univariate analysis also demonstrated that the 5-year pEFS for patients with age < 1 year or > 10 years, platelet count < 20 x 10(9)/L, FAB M(5), hepatomegaly, BM blasts >or= 0.150 at 48 h after the first induction course and no response to the first induction course, central nervous system (CNS) leukemia was unfavorable, while the outcome of patients with cytogenetic abnormalities of t (8; 21) or t (15; 17) were better. (2) Multivariate analysis suggested that cytogenetic abnormality of t (15; 17), achieved CR after the first induction course and no CNS leukemia were independent favorable prognostic factors.

Matched donors can be found on international registries of unrelated volunteers for a proportion of the remaining patients. For those patients in need of an allogeneic transplant, but for whom a suitable matched related or unrelated adult donor cannot be found, the use of banked unrelated umbilical cord blood has emerged as a potential option. However, there is uncertainty about the applicability of this technique for the majority of adult patients as a result of limitations in the number of cells in banked cord blood units and the degree of mismatching for histocompatibility antigens. AIMS: The aim of this study was to define the feasibility of allogeneic stem cell transplantation using single unrelated cord blood units in a cohort of adults with poor prognosis leukaemia or lymphoma. METHODS: Nine patients with haematological malignancies (five with acute myeloid leukaemia, one with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, one with Hodgkin lymphoma and two with non-Hodgkin lymphomas) received transplants of cryopreserved cord blood after conditioning therapy with high-dose cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation and antithymocyte globulin. Cord units contained a median 2.6 x 10(7) nucleated cells/kg recipient bodyweight and were matched for four (seven cases) or five (two cases) major histocompatibility complex class 1 and 2 antigens. Patients were given post-transplant immunosuppression with cycosporin and methylprednisolone. RESULTS: Neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 10(9)/L was seen by median day 30 after transplant in all seven patients who survived more than 1 month post-transplant. Platelet recovery to 50 x 10(9)/L occurred by median day 81 in five evaluable patients. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV was seen in four of seven evaluable patients and limited chronic GVHD was seen in four of five. Infection was the most common complication. Four patients died before day 100 of infection (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia, respiratory syncitial virus pneumonia), GVHD and multi-organ failure, and intracranial bleeding. Five patients survived 7-69 months post-transplant, without evidence of relapse of the underlying malignancy. CONCLUSION: Unrelated cord blood transplantation is feasible in adults with high-risk malignancy, with infection relating to immunocompromise being the major limitation.","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 26 patients (19 males and 7 females) were divided into four groups according to cumulative dose of anthracycline (ATC): non-anthracycline group (N group), seven cases; low anthracycline cumulative dose group (L group), five cases (<or=200 mg/m(2)); medium anthracycline cumulative dose group (M group), seven cases (200-<400 mg/m(2)); high anthracycline group (H group), seven cases (>or=400 mg/m(2)). DOB infusion was begun at 5 microg/kg per min (gamma) and increased up to 30 gamma. Cardiac function and cardiac reserved function at rest, after low-dose and high-dose DOB stress, were estimated. RESULTS: In the H group, % left ventricular posterior wall thickening (%PWT) at rest and ratio of maximum early filling peak velocity (E) and atrial contraction peak velocity (A) from the left ventricular transmitral flow wave (E/A) and %PWT at DOB 5 gamma stress were significantly lower than in other groups (P<0.05). After DOB 30 gamma stress in groups given>00 mg/m(2) end-systolic wall stress was significantly higher and E/A and %PWT were significantly lower than those of other groups (P<0.05). ATC cumulative dose strongly correlated with %PWT after DOB 30 gamma stress (P<0.001).

Because Ras plays an important role in tumour progression and the ras mutation is one of the most frequent aberrations in cancer, FTIs have been expected to exert excellent therapeutic activities. Phase I and II clinical trials confirmed relevant antitumour activity and low toxicity; however, no improvement in overall survival has been reported in Phase III trials. The exact mechanism of action of this class of agents is currently unknown. Increasing lines of evidence indicate that the cytotoxic actions of FTIs are not due to the inhibition of Ras proteins exclusively, but to the modulation of other targets, including RhoB, the centromere-binding proteins and other proteins that have not yet been identified.

A mortality study was conducted through December 31, 1982. An original study did not detect elevated leukemia mortality but did detect increased lung cancer mortality. The present study is an update of the mortality of the original cohort. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of workers employed 1 month or more between 1940 and 1979 at two Ohio shoe manufacturing plants. Vital status was ascertained through December 31, 1999. RESULTS: Seven thousand eight hundred twenty eight workers, contributing 300,777 person years, were available for analysis. An excess of lung cancer deaths persisted with additional years of follow-up (SMR = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.54). Trend tests did not indicate a positive trend between lung cancer risk and duration of employment. Mortality from leukemia was not significantly elevated in the updated analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a possible association between lung cancer mortality and exposure to chronic, low-levels of organic solvents. Although the strength of this conclusion was weakened by the lack of increasing lung cancer risk in relation to duration of employment, other studies have supported this association.","['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Solvents)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)']",,,,,,,,,,"['Published 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The concentrations of tyropeptin A required to reduce the growth rate by 50 % and to kill all cells were 10 and 100 times lower for bloodstream-form trypanosomes than for human leukaemia HL-60 cells, respectively. Enzymatic analysis showed that the trypsin-like activity of the trypanosome proteasome and the chymotrypsin-like activity of the mammalian proteasome are particularly sensitive to inhibition by tyropeptin A. The results suggest that natural compounds targeting the trypsin-like activity of the proteasome may serve as leads for rational drug development of novel anti-trypanosomal agents.","['0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', '0 (tyropeptin A)']",,,20060529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that sequence variations in the rex gene of each virus result in amino acid differences significantly more often than variations in the tax gene. For all three viruses the highest ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes was found in the rex gene. In the overlapping regions of tax and rex, the second codon position of Rex corresponds to the third codon position of Tax. Nucleotide C was present in all genes of the three viruses at the highest frequency and this bias was most pronounced in the rex gene. More specifically we found that the C bias and nucleotide variation is greatest at the second codon position of Rex and the third codon position of Tax in the area of tax/rex overlap. Changes in the second codon position of Rex always resulted in amino acid change whereas changes in the third codon position of Tax resulted in amino acid changes less than a third of the time. Analysis of the amino acid frequencies in both proteins shows that there is a disproportionately large percentage of the amino acids alanine, proline, serine and threonine (the four amino acids whose second codon position is C) in Rex. These findings led us to hypothesize that the Rex protein can withstand more amino acid changes than can the Tax protein suggesting that the Tax protein experiences higher evolutionary constraints and is the more conserved of the two proteins.",['0 (Codon)'],,,,['T32GM07127/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present work was to identify new molecular markers for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We applied methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR (MS/AP-PCR) to isolate sequences differentially methylated in HNSCC. The most frequently hypermethylated fragment we found maps close to a cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) island on chromosome 9q33.2, and hypermethylation of this CpG island was associated with transcriptional silencing of an alternative transcript of the LHX6 gene. Using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), hypermethylation of this fragment was detected in 13 of 14 (92.8%) HNSCC cell lines studied and 21 of 32 (65.6%) primary tumors, whereas little or no methylation was seen in 10 normal oral mucosa samples. We extended this investigation to other cancer cell lines and methylation was found in those derived from colon, breast, leukemia and lung, and methylation was also found in 12/14 primary colon tumors. These findings suggest that differentially methylated (DIME)-6 hypermethylation is a good cancer marker in HNSCC as well as in other kinds of neoplasias and confirm the importance of searching for markers of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LHX6 protein, human)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,20060529,['R33CA89837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the pathological outcome of AML patients with cytogenetic abnormalities differs considerably, we hypothesized that their proteome may also differ specifically in their expression pattern, protein interaction pathways and post-translational modifications (PTM). We performed this study using 42 AML patients diagnosed for various cytogenetic abnormalities based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MS) and MSMS tandem MS. We could identify significant differences in the proteome and PTM of peptides, later confirmed by other methods, between cytogenetic groups. The interactome analysis based on computational bioinformatics reveals major regulating networks: MAPK8 and MYC for complex aberrant karyotype, TP53 for t(8;21), TP53-MYC-PRKAC for 11q23 and JUN and MYC for Inv(16). Further, we analysed 42 MS spectra representative of hnRNPH1, calreticulin and hnRNPA2/B1 in a peak explorer, which reveals a cytogenetic-specific PTM of beta-O-linked N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) of hnRNPH1 in AML patients with 11q23 translocation, an acetylation of calreticulin in t(8;21) translocation and methylation of hnRNPA2/B1 in patients with translocations of t(8;21) and inv(16).

Epub 2006 May 29.,"Differentiation therapy is being developed as an additional therapeutic option for the treatment of several forms of cancer, including myeloid leukemia. In model systems, the physiologically active form of vitamin D, 1, alpha25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), induces monocytic differentiation of human myeloid cells, but the mechanism is not clear. We report here, the first direct connection between the signal provided by 1,25D and the molecular circuitry known to be involved in monocytic differentiation. Specifically, we show that 1,25D selectively increases the expression of the gene encoding kinase suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR-1) in HL60 cells, while other differentiation-inducing agents such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide do not significantly increase KSR-1 expression. Further, the upregulation of KSR-1 gene by 1,25D is competed by ZK159222, an antagonist of vitamin D receptor (VDR) action, and can occur in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, showing that the effect is direct. Most importantly, we have identified a vitamin D responsive element (VDRE) in the promoter region of the human KSR-1 gene, to which VDR binds in a 1,25D-dependent manner, in vitro and in vivo. This binding is paralleled by increased association of RNA polymerase II with the transcription start site of KSR-1 gene, and the VDRE is functional in reporter assays. Our findings offer a potential mechanism for a signaling pathway that contributes to 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells.","['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (ZK159222)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (KSR-1 protein kinase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,20060529,"['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA44722-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2843694,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS170005'],,,,

It is an IkappaB family protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation of a number of NF-kappaB target genes. In this study, interleukin (IL)-6-induced BCL3 expression and its effect on survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells were examined. We demonstrate the upregulation of BCL3 by IL-6 in INA-6 and other MM cell lines. Sequence analysis of the BCL3 gene locus revealed four potential signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) binding sites within two conserved intronic enhancers regions: one located within enhancer HS3 and three within HS4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed increased Stat3 binding to both enhancers upon IL-6 stimulation. Silencing Stat3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated BCL3 expression by IL-6. Using reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that BCL3 transcription depends on HS4. Mutation of the Stat motifs within HS4 abolished IL-6-dependent BCL3 induction. Furthermore, BCL3 transcription was inhibited by its own gene product. This repressive feedback is mediated by NF-kappaB sites within the promoter and HS3. Finally, we show that overexpression of BCL3 increases apoptosis, whereas BCL3-specific siRNA does not affect the viability of INA-6 cells suggesting that BCL3 is not essential for the survival of these cells.","['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,20060529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this prospective study, we firstly analyzed endothelial cell derived microparticles (EMP) in 19 hematopoietic stem cell recipients. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) served as positive controls. EMP were analyzed by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), detecting the particels via expression of CD62 (E-selectin) and anionic phospholipids binding to annexin V. RESULTS: EMP were not significantly influenced by conditioning regimens with non-myeloablative chemotherapy and 4 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) or by myeloablative regimens containing 12 Gy TBI. During acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), significantly higher levels of EMP were detected than in patients without aGVHD (18.5/microl s=10.1 vs. 14.6/microl SD = 11.5; P = 0.004) while infectious complications did not alter EMP levels significantly. Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids tendentially elevated EMP levels.

Therefore, the authors tested the ability of a pharmacologic preconditioning strategy using the well-known macrolide antibiotic erythromycin to induce tolerance against transient global cerebral ischemia in vivo. They also investigated whether tolerance induction by erythromycin involves transcriptional and translational changes of cerebral B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) expression. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were treated with erythromycin (25 mg/kg intramuscularly) or vehicle and subjected to 15 min of transient global cerebral ischemia 6, 12, or 24 h after pretreatment. Neurologic deficit was evaluated once daily, and neuronal cell survival was assessed after 7 days of reperfusion. Additional animals were similarly pretreated, and cerebral bcl-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression was analyzed 6 and 24 h later. RESULTS: Erythromycin improved postischemic neuronal survival in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors and reduced functional deficit, with 12 h being the most efficient pretreatment interval. Bcl-2 mRNA in hippocampus was transiently up-regulated 6 h after erythromycin, but neuronal Bcl-2 protein remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Erythromycin can induce cerebral ischemic tolerance in vivo (pharmacologic preconditioning), suggesting a potential clinical strategy of preemptive neuroprotection. Changes in bcl-2 expression after erythromycin were small and transient. The induction of bcl-2-related pathways, although important for other preconditioning regimens, may therefore be less relevant for the neuroprotective effects of pharmacologic preconditioning using erythromycin.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63937KV33D (Erythromycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon removal of the C-terminal 16 amino acids, designated as the R peptide, the fusion activity of the Env protein is activated. To extend our understanding of the inhibitory effect of the R peptide and investigate the specificity of inhibition, we constructed chimeric influenza virus-MuLV hemagglutinin (HA) genes. The influenza virus HA protein is the best-studied membrane fusion model, and we investigated the fusion activities of the chimeric HA proteins. We compared constructs in which the coding sequence for the cytoplasmic tail of the influenza virus HA protein was replaced by that of the wild-type or mutant MuLV Env protein or in which the cytoplasmic tail sequence of the MuLV Env protein was added to the HA cytoplasmic domain. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and Western blot analysis showed that all chimeric HA proteins were effectively expressed on the cell surface and cleaved by trypsin. In BHK21 cells, the wild-type HA protein had a significant ability after trypsin cleavage to induce syncytium formation at pH 5.1; however, neither the chimeric HA protein with the full-length cytoplasmic tail of MuLV Env nor the full-length HA protein followed by the R peptide showed any syncytium formation. When the R peptide was truncated or mutated, the fusion activity was partially recovered in the chimeric HA proteins. A low-pH conformational-change assay showed that similar conformational changes occurred for the wild-type and chimeric HA proteins. All chimeric HA proteins were capable of promoting hemifusion and small fusion pore formation, as shown by a dye redistribution assay. These results indicate that the R peptide of the MuLV Env protein has a sequence-dependent inhibitory effect on influenza virus HA protein-induced membrane fusion and that the inhibitory effect occurs at a late stage in fusion pore enlargement.","['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)', '0 (Hemagglutinins, Viral)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (R peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",,,,"['DE015543/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI066870/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI054337/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE015543/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R13 AI066870/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI054337/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI054337/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1472558,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first stage, the SFFV envelope glycoprotein interacts with the erythropoietin receptor and a short form of the receptor tyrosine kinase sf-Stk, resulting in constitutive activation of signal transducing molecules and the development of erythropoietin (Epo)-independent erythroid hyperplasia and polycythemia. The second stage results from the outgrowth of a rare virus-infected erythroid cell that expresses nonphysiological levels of the myeloid transcription factor PU.1. These cells exhibit a differentiation block and can be grown as murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell lines. In this study, we examined SFFV MEL cells to determine whether their transformed phenotype was associated with a block in the activation of any Epo signal-transducing molecules. Our studies indicate that Epo- or SFFV-induced activation of STAT1/3 DNA binding activity is blocked in SFFV MEL cells. The block is at the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, although Jak2 phosphorylation is not blocked in these cells. In contrast to Epo, alpha interferon can induce STAT1 phosphorylation and DNA binding in SFFV MEL cells. The SFFV-transformed cells were shown to express elevated levels of the hematopoietic phosphatase SHP-1, and treatment of the cells with a phosphatase inhibitor restored STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. MEL cells derived from Friend murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or ME26 MuLV-infected mice, which do not express PU.1, express lower levels of SHP-1 and are not blocked in STAT1/3 DNA-binding activity. Our studies suggest that SFFV-infected erythroid cells become transformed when differentiation signals activated by STAT1/3 are blocked due to high SHP-1 levels induced by inappropriate expression of the PU.1 protein.","['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)']",,,,"['Z01 BC005657-16/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1472600,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have synthesized three derivatives of Bobel-24 (Bobel-4, Bobel-16, and Bobel-30) and tested their activities as putative antileukemic agents. We have found that Bobel-24 and Bobel-16 were dual inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, whereas Bobel-4 and Bobel-30 were selective against 5-lipoxygenase. We have tested the antiproliferative activity of these compounds on a panel of cell lines derived from myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (K562, Raji, HL-60, and Molt4). The cytotoxic IC(50) in these cell lines ranged between 14 and 50 micromol/L, but it was higher for nontransformed cells such as 32D, NIH3T3, or human leukocytes. All compounds showed cytotoxic activity on all tested cell lines, accompanied by DNA synthesis inhibition and arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. Bobel-16, Bobel-4, and Bobel-24 induced a caspase-independent cell death in K562 and Raji cells, accompanied by chromatin condensation, cytochrome c release, and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential in a concentration-dependent manner and production of reactive oxygen species. As the proto-oncogene MYC is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and survival of leukemia cells, we tested its effect on bobel activity. Bobel-24 induced down-regulation of MYC in K562 and, consistently, ectopic expression of MYC results in partial protection towards the cytotoxic effect of Bobel-24. In conclusion, Bobel derivatives induce a caspase- and Bcl-2-independent cell death in which mitochondrial permeabilization and MYC down-regulation are involved.

Patients with AML after induction show LBC reduction in a hypoplastic BM and also demonstrate a varying number of residual BM plasma cells (PCs). AIM: To relate PC number to several blood and BM parameters as well as clinical features such as infection and survival. METHODS: On the 14th day after the start of chemotherapy (D+14) BM samples were examined for residual PCs in 60 adult (>or=15 years) patients undergoing AML-induction chemotherapy, and the proportion of PCs was related to blood and BM parameters including French-American-British (FAB) subtype, other inflammatory cells, antecedent infection, attainment of complete remission and 36-month survival. RESULTS: Median PC proportion of 11.3% (range 0.1-48.7%) in D+14 BM aspirates and 10.7% (0.6-41%) in trephine biopsies was observed. Their number showed a direct relationship with residual BM lymphocytes (r=0.368; p=0.025). Higher numbers of residual PCs also reflected the presence of infection before diagnosis and coincident with treatment (p=0.039). Although we could not demonstrate an association between PC numbers and 36-month survival, PC numbers were significantly higher in patients with residual leukaemia at D>14 (p=0.007).

Epub 2006 Feb 28.,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits nerve sprouting. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the spatial distribution of nerve sprouting and neurotrophic gene expression after MI. METHODS: We created MI in mice by coronary artery ligation. The hearts were removed 3 hours to 2 months after MI and examined for nerve fiber density and neurotrophic factor gene expression using Affymetrix microarray and mRNA analyses. RESULTS: The density of nerve fibers immunopositive for growth-associated protein (GAP)-43 was the highest 3 hours after MI both in the peri-infarct area and in the area remote to infarct, resulting in sympathetic (but not parasympathetic) hyperinnervation in the ventricles. The GAP-43-positive nerve fiber density of myocardium was greater in the outer transverse loop than in the inner vertical loop. The differences between these two myocardial loops peaked within 3 hours after MI and persisted for 2 months afterward. Gene expression of nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-beta(3), and interleukin-1alpha was increased up to 2 months after MI compared with normal control. Expression of these growth factors was more pronounced and persistent in the peri-infarct area than in the remote area. CONCLUSION: MI induces sympathetic nerve sprouting in both peri-infarct and remote areas, more in the outer transverse loop. Selective up-regulation of nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-beta(3), and interleukin-1alpha occurred in the peri-infarct area and, to a lesser extent, in the remote area.","['0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)']",,,20060228,"['M01-RR00425/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P50HL52319/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL57872/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL66389/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL71140/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL73393/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL78932/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Heart Rhythm. 2006 Jun;3(6):737-8.

Dex-induced apoptosis is dramatically inhibited by downregulation of BIM by shRNA or by pretreatment with a p38-MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, which also reduces BIM induction.

Dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, and subsequent induction of pro-caspase-9 and -3 processing preceded apoptosis in HL-60 cells, confirmed by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, changes in the cell membrane and the appearance of a sub-G1 DNA peak. Furthermore, treatment with HC-EA caused a rapid loss of intracellular glutathione content and stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidants such as catalase, N-acetylcysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and superoxide dismutase, but not allopurinol and diphenylene iodonium, significantly inhibited HC-EA-induced cell death. Apoptosis was completely prevented by a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-FMK).

Epub 2006 May 15.,"PML-RARalpha is a chimeric transcription factor tightly associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. PML-RARalpha plays an important role in the aberrant transcription repression on the target genes of wild-type retinoic acid receptors. Here, we demonstrated that HDAC3, one component of the N-CoR transcription repressor complex, is a key regulator of the transcription repression by PML-RARalphain vivo. Using immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that PML-RARalpha interacts with N-CoR/HDAC3 in vivo without ligand. Next, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, this N-CoR/HDAC3 co-repressor complex was recruited to the endogenous target promoters (RARbeta and CYP26) through PML-RARalpha.

Normal mature megakaryocytes are, perhaps, the largest cells in the marrow. In contrast, their annucleated platelets progeny are the smallest subcellular fragments in the circulation, which in spite of their size, play crucial roles in thrombostasis and haemostasis. Megakaryopoiesis involves complicated and multi-step biological processes. Research over the last decade has resulted in certain important new discoveries, such as the specific megakaryocyte-forming haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) subpopulation, thrombopoietin (Tpo), formation and release of platelets, etc. Substantial understanding of the specific lineage commitment, differentiation, and the molecular regulatory mechanisms of megakaryopoiesis has also been achieved. Despite existing controversies and questions, megakaryopoiesis remains an exciting field in biomedical research. Certain recent biological findings as well as future research in megakaryopoiesis are summarised in this article.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Scatter factor/HGF levels in pretreatment plasma samples from 171 men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer enrolled in CALGB 9480 were quantified by solid-phase, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic importance of SF/HGF with adjustment for established prognostic factors. Median SF/HGF was 991 pg/mL (range, 212-2733 pg/mL). In a univariate analysis, although plasma SF/HGF levels above versus below the median value did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.0862), the cutoff point of > 935 pg/mL was associated with a significant reduction in overall survival (P = 0.0334). Patients with SF/HGF levels > 935 pg/mL experienced a median survival of 15 months compared with 19 months for men with SF/HGF levels < or = 935 pg/mL. In a multivariate analysis, adjusting for SF/HGF, prostate-specific antigen, lactate dehydrogenase, and performance status, only plasma alkaline phosphatase was significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.5; P = 0.0017). CONCLUSION: Higher plasma levels of SF/HGF in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer are associated with a decreased patient survival. Currently, SF/HGF levels do not appear to be of value as a contributor to multivariate models for prediction of outcome, but the association with decreased survival suggests that SF/HGF might be a potential target for therapy.",['67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)'],,,,"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe and validate a new automated method based on vector quantization algorithms to analyze multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping data in a series of 307 peripheral blood (PB) samples. Our results show that the automated method of analysis proposed compares well with currently used manual approach and significantly improves semiautomated approaches and, that by using it, a highly efficient discrimination with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity can be made between normal/reactive PB samples and cases with B-CLPD based on the total B-cell number and/or the sIgkappa+/sIglambda+ B-cell ratio. In addition, the method proved to be able to detect the presence of pathologic neoplastic B-cells even when these are present at low frequencies (<5% of all lymphocytes in the sample) and in poor-quality samples enriched in 'noise' events.",,,,20060525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the molecular response by regular reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 31 newly diagnosed patients. The real-time RT-PCR results are reported as normalized DoseN and log-reduction (3.0-4.9 log-reduction as minor and > or =5.0 log-reduction as major molecular response). After induction therapy and completion of consolidation, minor molecular response was documented in 35.5 and 96.8% patients, respectively, which was equivalent to the regular RT-PCR (22.6 and 96.8%), whereas the major molecular response rate was significantly lower (12.9 and 90.3%, respectively). All patients achieved major molecular response during and after maintenance therapy. During the follow-up study, loss of major molecular response was observed in two patients, which was associated with subsequent loss of minor molecular response, positive RT-PCR and then documentation of central nervous system leukemia or clinical relapse in 3-6 months. For summary, we demonstrated that the real-time RT-PCR is potentially superior to regular RT-PCR in evaluation of molecular response in APL patients and that reporting real-time RT-PCR data by log-reduction is feasible and clinically relevant.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,20060525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 25.,"In the last few years, it has become clear that the processes of tumor angiogenesis, metastasis and invasiveness are highly dependent on components of the blood coagulation cascade. One of the key proteins in coagulation is tissue factor (TF). In addition, TF is also known as a mediator of intracellular signaling events that can alter gene expression patterns and cell behavior. TF significantly participates in tumor-associated angiogenesis and its expression levels have been correlated with the metastatic potential of many types of hematological malignancies. Signaling pathways initiated by both, tissue factor-activated factor VII (TF-FVIIa) protease activation of protein-activated receptors (PARs), and phosphorylation of the TF-cytoplasmic domain, appear to regulate these tumoral functions. Advances in antiangiogenic therapies and preclinical studies with TF-targeted therapeutics are hopeful in the control of tumor growth and metastasis, but continued studies on the regulation of TF are still needed. In the last few years, the use of approaches of functional genomics and proteomics has allowed the discovery of new proteins involved in the origin of the neoplasia and their participation in the development of the disease. This review attempts to establish a cellular and molecular causal link between cancer coagulopathy, angiogenesis and tumor progression in hematological malignancies.","['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",91,,20060525,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2006 Aug;20(8):1356-7.

Epub 2006 May 25.,"Although the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is successfully used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), inherent mechanisms confer primary resistance to leukemic patients. In order to search for potentially useful genes in predicting cytogenetic response, a retrospective gene expression study was performed. Leukocyte RNA isolated before imatinib from interferon-alpha-pretreated chronic phase CML patients (n=34) with or without major cytogenetic remission (< or =35% Philadelphia (Ph)+ metaphases) during the first year of treatment was comparatively analyzed using Affymetrix U133A chips. Using support vector machines for gene classification, an outcome-specific gene expression signature consisting of 128 genes was identified. Comparative expression data of specific genes point to changes in apoptosis (e.g. casp9, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1, hras), DNA repair (msh3, ddb2), oxidative stress protection (glutathione synthetase, paraoxonase 2, vanin 1) and centrosomes (inhibitor of differentiation-1) within primary resistant patients. Independent statistical approaches and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies support the clinical relevance of gene profiling.

However, despite impressive cytogenetic response rates achieved with this agent in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, those with advanced-stage CML frequently obtain more modest responses that are in many instances of short duration. Several mechanisms of resistance to imatinib have been described among patients that develop clinical resistance to imatinib. Point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain that impair the ability of imatinib to inhibit the kinase activity represent the leading cause of resistance. Several approaches are being pursued to overcome these mutations. In addition, many other protein kinases implicated in signaling transduction downstream Bcr-Abl play critical roles in the pathogenesis of CML, thus representing potential therapeutic targets. Multiple compounds are being screened to identify inhibitors of these kinases. This article focuses on the current state of development of new kinase inhibitors for the therapy of CML.","['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients with auto-GVHD required immunosuppression, and 3 of 7 were hospitalized because of GVHD. The median duration of GVHD was 517 days (range, 60-867 days). Auto-GVHD was associated with an abnormally high CD4/CD8 ratio because of severe depletion of CD8(+) T cells, pointing to a potential pathomechanism. High non-relapse-related mortality led to the discontinuation of the trial. Current results do not support the use of high-dose alemtuzumab combined with total body irradiation (TBI) and autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT).

Substantial evidence suggests that the antiproliferative effect of these TZD members in cancer cells is independent of PPARgamma activation. To discern the role of PPARgamma in the antitumor effects of TZDs, we have synthesized PPARgamma-inactive TZD analogs which, although devoid of PPARgamma activity, retain the ability to induce apoptosis with a potency equal to that of their parental TZDs in cancer cell lines with varying PPARgamma expression status. Mechanistic studies from this and other laboratories have further suggested that troglitazone and ciglitazone mediate antiproliferative effects through a complexity of PPARgamma-independent mechanisms. Evidence indicates that troglitazone and ciglitazone block BH3 domain-mediated interactions between the anti apoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) members Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and proapoptotic Bcl-2 members. Moreover, these TZDs facilitate the degradation of cyclin D1 and caspase-8-related FADD-like IL-l-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory protein through proteasome-mediated proteolysis, and down-regulate the gene expression of prostate-specific antigen gene expression by inhibiting androgen activation of the androgen response elements in the promoter region. More importantly, dissociation of the effects of TZDs on apoptosis from their original pharmacological activity (i.e. PPARgamma activation) provides a molecular basis for the exploitation of these compounds to develop different types of molecularly targeted anticancer agents. These TZD-derived novel therapeutic agents, alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs, have translational relevance in fostering effective strategies for cancer treatment.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",83,,,"['CA-112250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-94829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA101875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray analysis has shown a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily, Lefty, to be the single most abundant inhibitor in stem cells and in maternal decidua that supports embryo implantation. Lefty is regulated by pathways such as Smad (Sma and Mad [mothers against decapentaplegic]) and WNT (wingless-type) and by the transcriptional factor Oct3/4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4), which support ""stemness."" Lefty is also induced upon exit from the state of stemness, including forced in vitro differentiation, and leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal. Lefty is a candidate in cell-fate decisions because of its unique ability to modulate the expression of TGF-beta family proteins such as Nodal and by blanket inhibition of the activity of members of this family which require EGF-CFC (epidermal growth factor-Cripto, Frl-1, and Cryptic) as a coreceptor.","['0 (LEFTY1 protein, human)', '0 (Left-Right Determination Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",76,,20060525,['1U01HD43165-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we identified a novel MSA reactive with 155 and 140 kDa nuclear proteins [anti-155/140 antibody (Ab)] and determined the clinical feature of DM patients positive for this autoantibody (autoAb). METHODS: Sera from 52 Japanese patients with DM, 9 with PM, 48 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 126 with systemic sclerosis and 18 with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia were examined by immunoprecipitation assays. Positive sera were further characterized by immunodepletion and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Seven of the 52 (13%) Japanese patients with DM immunoprecipitated 155 and 140 kDa proteins from 35S-labelled K562 leukaemia cell extract. No patients with SLE, systemic sclerosis or idiopathic interstitial pneumonia as well as healthy controls were positive for this autoAb. Patients with anti-155/140 Ab developed heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules or sign and flagellate erythema significantly more frequently than those negative. Notably, internal malignancy was found at significantly higher frequency in those positive than those negative (71 vs 11%; P < 0.005). In contrast, none of these patients positive for this autoAb had interstitial lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: This novel MSA is associated with cancer-associated DM and may serve as a diagnostic serological marker for this specific subset.","['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,,20060525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 25.,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells capable of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation into the three embryonic germ layers under appropriate conditions. Mechanisms for control of the early period of differentiation, involving exit from the pluripotent state and lineage commitment, are not well understood. An emerging concept is that epigenetic histone modifications may play a role during this early period. We have found that upon differentiation of mouse ES cells by removal of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor, there is a global increase in coupled histone H3 phosphorylation (Ser-10)-acetylation (Lys-14) (H3 phosphoacetylation). We show that this occurs through activation of both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Early ES cell differentiation is delayed using pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK and p38 pathways. One common point of convergence of these pathways is the activation of the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). We show here that MSK1 is the critical mediator of differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation using both the chemical inhibitor H89 and RNA interference. Interestingly, inhibition of H3 phosphoacetylation also alters gene expression during early differentiation. These results point to an important role for both epigenetic histone modifications and kinase pathways in modulating early ES differentiation.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,20060525,['R01DK064243/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,S0021-9258(18)95244-0 [pii] 10.1074/jbc.M602734200 [doi],,,

Their ability to migrate to the adjacent lymphatic system is relevant since their efficacy does also rely on their potential to interact with lymphocytes. METHODS: We studied the transmigration of DCs derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), from peripheral blood monocytes, and from leukemic cells. DCs from monocytes and leukemic cells could be generated within 1 week, whereas DCs from HPC needed 2 weeks for maturation. RESULTS: While DCs from all sources showed similar morphologic features and allostimulatory capacities, their transmigration capacities varied: HPC-derived DCs showed the highest migratory response to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3alpha and beta. Monocyte-derived DCs were equally attracted to MIP-3beta and stroma-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha. Only few leukemic DCs migrated in response to SDF-1. Other chemoattractants tested included MIP-1alpha and RANTES. Replacement of fetal bovine by human serum did not change the DC's overall migratory capacities. It did, however, influence the responsiveness to certain chemokines. CONCLUSION: Although DCs from all three sources are immunocompetent antigen-presenting cells, our findings suggest that HPC and monocyte-derived DCs can be administered subcutaneously and intravenously, but that leukemic DCs should be injected into the lymph node.",['0 (Chemokines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD33 belongs to a family of sialic acid-binding cell surface proteins named Siglecs, among which there are 7 other functional CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs). We sought to characterize the spectrum of expression of the other CD33rSiglecs on bone marrow precursors and AML cells and asked if they can potentially serve as targets for therapy. METHODS: Cell surface CD33rSiglecs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The ability of certain anti-Siglec antibodies to target toxin-mediated cell killing of Siglec-expressing cell lines was characterized and compared. RESULTS: We demonstrate that Siglecs-3, -5, -6, -7, and -9 are expressed on subsets of normal bone marrow precursors, including promonocytes and myelocytes. Furthermore, most AML (but not ALL) cells express these Siglecs. There is substantial variability in Siglec type and expression level between cases, with each having a unique ""CD33rSiglec fingerprint."" Individual anti-Siglec antibodies along with a saporin toxin-conjugated secondary antibody can target myelomonocytic leukemia cells for death, and targeting of multiple Siglecs improves cell killing. Cytotoxicity was further enhanced by sialidase treatment of target cells, which improves antibody binding. We also confirmed that antibody binding induced rapid internalization of Siglecs from the cell surface, which is a requirement for cell killing via saporin. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple CD33rSiglecs are expressed on normal and malignant myelomonoyctic cells. Targeting these Siglecs, possibly in combinations, could improve anti-CD33 antibody therapy or be used as an alternative to anti-CD33.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",,,,"['P01 HL057345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 31888/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mit-Vero cells stimulated higher rates of blastocysts (Day 7, 40 vs 27%) and hatched blastocyst (Day 10, 38 vs 12%) formation than Unt-Vero cells. These rates were comparable to those obtained with BOECs; blastocyst hatching was slightly higher following co-culture with Mit-Vero cells (36%) than BOECs (29%). Blastocyst formation was similar in ECS- vs BSA-supplemented medium; however, hatching was greatest (37%) during co-culture in medium +10% ECS. While the addition of LIF throughout the co-culture period was ineffective, addition of the cytokine beginning at Day 4 slightly increased blastocyst formation rates. Evaluation of LIF secretion using ELISA revealed detectable levels of the cytokine in Mit-Vero-conditioned medium (50 pg/10(5) cells); this may explain the minimal influence of exogenous LIF during embryo co-culture. Mit-Vero cells provided comparable support of bovine embryo development when used even up to 2 wk after establishment as monolayers.

To investigate the effect of addition of hLIF on the subsequent development of morulae, SOF medium was supplemented with 8 mg/ml BSA instead of HS. To test whether hLIF affects the subsequent development of IVF-derived bovine blastocysts, only good blastocysts that developed from SOF medium with or without hLIF at Days 7 and 8 of culture were frozen by a conventinal slow freezing method and again cultured in SOF medium with or without the addition of hLIF for 3 d after thawing (4 groups). Survival of frozen-thawed bovine embryos was evaluated for re-expansion and hatching of blastocysts during 3 d of culture. There was no significant difference in the developmental rate of Day 5 embryos to blastocysts between those cultured with (47.8%) and without (47.6%) addition of hLIF. However, the addition of hLIF before freezing significantly increased the hatching rate of IVF-derived bovine morulae (P < 0.05), whereas addition of hLIF after thawing did not increase the subsequent development of blastocysts. These results suggest that hLIF added at the Day 5 morula stage may contribute to bovine embryonic development through the hatching process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this population, a genetic polymorphism causes wide differences in the activity of thiopurine S-methyletransferase (TPMT)--the rate-limiting enzyme of the thiopurine degradation metabolism--leading to the necessity of drug dose adjustments. It is not yet known if similar differences exist in the inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH; EC 1.1.1.205), the rate-limiting enzyme of the thiopurine synthesis. To test this, we established and validated a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)-based assay to determine the IMPDH enzyme activity in erythrocytes. The remarkable features of this assay are its simple erythrocyte separation/haemolysis and assay conditions and a distinct segregation of xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP) from the clear supernatant after precipitation. The probes were processed without a time-consuming extraction and heating procedure and the assay demonstrated a good intra- and interday stability as well as a recovery rate of approximately 100%. The IMPDH enzyme activity was measured in erythrocytes of 75 children with diagnosis of ALL before starting antileukaemic therapy and their activity compared to those of 35 healthy adult controls. The measured enzyme activity was wide ranging in both groups.

Our recent findings indicated that antioxidant and anticancer activities were due to p-methylaminophenol moiety (8) in 2, and that p-octylaminophenol (7), which has an elongated alkyl chain, was more potent than 8. This finding lets us to investigate whether compounds containing alkyl or acyl chains linked to an aminophenol residue as long as 2 and 1, would show activities greater than 2. For this purpose, we prepared p-dodecanoylaminophenol (3), p-decanoylaminophenol (4), p-dodecylaminophenol (5), and p-decylaminophenol (6). The p-alkylaminophenols, 5 and 6, exhibited superoxide scavenging activities, but not p-acylaminophenols, 3 and 4. Elongation of the alkyl chain length reduced superoxide trapping capability (8>7>6>5). In contrast, lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes was reduced by 5 and 6 in dose-dependent manner. Compounds 3 and 4 were poor lipid peroxidation inhibitors, being approximately 400- to 1300-fold lower than 5 and 6. In addition, all compounds inhibited cell growth of human leukemia cell lines, HL60 and HL60R, in dose-dependent manners (5>6>3=4). The HL60R cell line is resistant against 1. Growth of both cell lines was suppressed by 5 and 6 in a fashion dependent on the length of the aminophenol alkyl chain, but not by 3 and 4. These results indicate that 5, a potent anticancer agent greater than 2, may potentially have clinical utility, and that its anticancer activity is correlated with inhibitory potency against lipid peroxidation, but not with superoxide scavenging activity.","['0 (Aminophenols)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)']",,,20060524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three APL patients (de novo, 2; therapy-related, 1) in a cohort of 59 cases given oral-As(2)O(3) for induction and maintenance treatment developed secondary cancers (nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 2; colonic adenocarcinoma, 1) at 16, 36 and 55 months post-As(2)O(3) therapy. Retrospective analysis of biomarkers (Epstein Barr virus serology and quantification, carcinoembryonic antigen) showed the potential presence of cancers before or shortly after As(2)O(3) therapy, suggesting that As(2)O(3) had not initiated these malignancies. Compared against matched background population, there was an increased risk of second cancer (p=0.012, standard incidence ratio=6.5; 95% confidence interval=1.4-19.0).","['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,20060524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 24.,"B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by an accumulation of B lymphocytes expressing CD5. To date, the biological significance of this molecule in B-CLL B cells remains to be elucidated. In this study, we have analysed the functional consequences of the binding of an anti-CD5 antibody on B-CLL B cells. To this purpose, we have measured the percentage of viability of B-CLL B cells in the presence or in the absence of anti-CD5 antibodies and also examined some of the biochemical events downstream the CD5-signalling. We demonstrate that anti-CD5 induces phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C (PKC), while no activation of Akt/PKB and MAPKs is detected. This signalling cascade results in viability in a group of patients in which we observe an increase of Mcl-1 levels, whereas the levels of bcl-2, bcl-x(L) and XIAP do not change. We also report that this pathway leads to IL-10 production, an immunoregulatory cytokine that might act as an autocrine growth factor for leukaemic B cells. Inhibition of PKC prevents the induction of Mcl-1 and IL-10, suggesting that the activation of PKC plays an important role in the CD5-mediated survival signals in B cells from a subset of B-CLL patients.","['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,20060524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PTLV envelope glycoprotein surface component (SUgp46) comprises a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that alternates hypervariable and highly conserved sequences. To further delineate highly conserved motifs in PTLV RBDs, we investigated the intrahost variability of HTLV-1 and STLV-1 by generating and sequencing libraries of DNA fragments amplified within the RBD of the SUgp46 env gene. Using new and highly cross-reactive env primer pairs, we observed the presence of Env quasispecies in HTLV-1 infected individuals and STLV-1 naturally infected macaques, irrespective of the clinical status. These intrahost variants helped us to define highly conserved residues and motifs in the RBD.

Comparison of changes in electricity consumption (a surrogate for exposure) to changes in childhood-leukemia rates, known as ecologic correlation, have been used to argue both for and against the association between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. In this paper we explore what can be learned from such an ecologic approach. We first examine separately the evidence on trends in exposure to EMFs and on trends in leukemia rates, and then compare the two. Both incidence rates and exposures have increased, but there are so many approximations and assumptions involved in connecting the two trends that we cannot regard the ecologic evidence as providing any meaningful evidence for or against a causal link.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PrPSc is thought to be the causative agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The mechanisms involved in the intercellular transfer of PrPSc are still enigmatic. Recently, small cellular vesicles of endosomal origin called exosomes have been proposed to contribute to the spread of prions in cell culture models. Retroviruses such as murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been shown to assemble and bud into detergent-resistant microdomains and into intracellular compartments such as late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. Here we report that moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) infection strongly enhances the release of scrapie infectivity in the supernatant of coinfected cells. Under these conditions, we found that PrPC, PrPSc and scrapie infectivity are recruited by both MuLV virions and exosomes.

Epub 2006 May 25.,"Low levels of gene delivery in vivo using replication-defective retroviral vectors have severely limited their application for clinical protocols. To overcome this problem, we describe here a semi-replication-competent retrovirus (s-RCR) in which the gag-pol and envelope (VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus G protein) genes were split into two vectors. This system offers potential advantages over both replication-defective vectors, in terms of efficiency of in vivo spread through a tumor, and all-in-one replication-competent vectors in terms of the payload of therapeutic genes that can be carried. We achieved a viral titer of s-RCR viruses approximately 70-fold higher than VSV-G pseudotyped, replication-defective vectors. In addition, s-RCR vectors induced tumor killing by the cytotoxicity of VSV-G during viral spread. Inclusion of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk30) gene into vectors significantly improved tumor killing activity followed by ganciclovir (GCV) treatment in vitro under conditions of low-level viral replication. However, at high levels of viral spread, VSV-G-mediated cytotoxicity predominated. Xenografts of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, preinfected by semi-replicative green fluorescent protein vectors (semi-GFP), were completely non-tumorigenic in nude mice. Implantation of cells preinfected by semi-replicative TK30 vectors (semi-TK30) mixed with parental HT1080 cells at a ratio of 1:1 efficiently prevented tumor growth in mice treated by GCV. Direct intratumoral injection of HT1080 tumors growing in nude mice, or B16 murine melanoma in immunocompetent mice, with semi-TK30 viruses significantly prolonged survival. Injection of autologous cells (B16) producing semi-TK30 vector into B16 tumors prolonged survival only in mice treated with GCV but not with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In contrast, when xenogeneic cells (293T) producing semi-TK30 vectors were injected into B16 tumors, an optimal survival advantage was obtained in mice treated with PBS rather than GCV. These data indicate that complex interactions exist between direct cytotoxicity of VSV-G and HSVtk expression when placed in the context of additional immune parameters, which combine to determine the efficacy of the therapy. Taken together, our data suggest that s-RCR vectors have some potential advantages for development to deliver genes into tumors for cancer treatment but that a combination of factors will impact on the decision as to whether the s-RCR strategy is worth developing to full clinical trials.","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,20060525,['CA 85931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thrombotic PE occurred in 2.32% of all cancer patients and comprised 88.6% of the total number of all PE events. The incidence of thrombotic PE was high in those with adenocarcinoma, leukemia and large cell carcinoma, and was low in those with hepatic cell carcinoma. The incidence of PE was high when tumor was present in hematogenous tissue, lungs, ovaries, pancreas and the biliary system, and was low when tumor was present in the liver. The incidence of tumor PE was high with large cell carcinoma, hepatic cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, and was also high when tumor was present in the lungs, ovaries, kidneys and liver. There was a significant correlation between the incidence of tumor PE and the incidence of tumor invasion into large veins.

In this study, the relationship of two ERCC1 polymorphisms, 8092C>A and 19007G>A, with susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was investigated in 183 childhood patients. For the ERCC1 8092C>A polymorphism, individuals carrying the ERCC1 8092CC genotype had a significantly higher risk when compared with those carrying at least one A allele gene (AA/AC). Analysis after stratification for sex showed that the males carrying ERCC1 8092CC genotype were associated with highly significant increased risk of ALL (1.94-fold) but not females. There was no association between ERCC1 19007G>A polymorphism and ALL risk when all patients as a group were analyzed. However, the males carrying ERCC119007A allele were associated with highly significant increased risk of ALL (2.36-fold). For the ERCC1 8092C>A polymorphism, individuals under 8 years old (median age) carrying CC genotype had significantly higher risk. However, the 19007G>A polymorphism was not associated with such age-related ALL risk. These results suggest that the ERCC1 8092C>A polymorphism may be related to the occurrence of childhood ALL in a Chinese population.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (ERCC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",,,20060524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 4.,"Insufficient T-cell response to human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) is a potential risk factor in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We established an assay system for detecting HTLV-I-specific T-cell response by using recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) proteins fused with HTLV-I Tax protein that was divided into three portions, Tax-A, -B, and -C, corresponding to the N-terminal, central and C-terminal regions, respectively. When splenocytes from rats immunized with plasmids encoding Tax cDNA were incubated with these recombinant proteins, strong interferon gamma (IFN-gamma-producing responses occurred against GST-Tax proteins but not against control GST proteins. No such Tax-specific responses were observed in splenocytes from naive rats. Cocktails of oligopeptides corresponding to the Tax-A, -B, and -C regions also induced IFN-gamma-producing responses when incubated with splenocytes from immunized rats, but required higher amounts of antigens and there were a shorter periods of sustained T-cell responses than with GST-Tax protein-based assay. Although splenocytes from immunized rats predominantly reacted against GST-Tax-B protein, they failed to react with peptide cocktails corresponding to the Tax-B region, likely because the major epitope was interrupted in the initially prepared series of peptides. Using a newly prepared peptide series we found that splenocytes predominantly reacted with a peptide located in the Tax-B region that overlaps with a previously identified cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitope of this rat strain. Using this system, we examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from an ATL patient who underwent complete remission following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PBMC from this patient produced a significant Tax-specific T-cell response predominantly against GST-Tax-A protein. This is consistent with the previous finding that this patient exhibited a strong HLA-A2-restricted CTL response to Tax 11-19 epitope, which is located in the Tax-A region. This study provides a diagnostic tool, useful for monitoring HTLV-I-specific T-cell immunity in patients and for surveying HTLV-I-carriers to identify an immunological group at high risk for ATL development, regardless of their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. It is also useful for predicting the location of T-cell epitopes, which may be applicable in future vaccine strategies.","['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,20060504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We cloned the full-length cDNA of Lp-PLA(2) from differentiated THP-1 cells, and subcloned the cDNA into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1. In addition, we introduced an N-terminal Kozak sequence for high-level translation initiation and a C-terminal sequence of 6 histidine residues for purification. The fusion enzyme was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. Recombinant Lp-PLA(2) activity was measured using [(3)H]PAF as a substrate, and we examined the enzyme activity of recombinant Lp-PLA(2) pretreated with the known Lp-PLA(2) inhibitor SB435495. RESULTS: We successfully cloned the full-length Lp-PLA(2) gene from differentiated THP-1 cells. The fusion enzyme was expressed in Sf9 insect cells at a high level and purified efficiently through a 2-step procedure. The recombinant Lp-PLA(2) activity was measured using [(3)H]PAF as a substrate, and proved to be enzymatically active.

The objective of this review was to assess the impact of HDAraC during induction therapy for patients with AML based on results from randomized trials. METHODS: All randomized trials in the field were identified by using a predefined search strategy. Trials that assessed the impact of HDAraC compared with SDAraC as induction therapy for adult patients with AML in a randomized fashion and that reported the relevant endpoints were included. Data were extracted from each trial by both reviewers according to prespecified criteria. RESULTS: No differences between HDAraC and SDAraC were found with regard to complete remission rates (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.92-1.10). The weighted mean difference (WMD) for median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 4.19 in favor of HDAraC (95% CI, 0.59-7.78; P = .02). The WMD for 4-year RFS was 10.98 in favor of HDAraC (95% CI, 1.02-20.94; P = .03). The WMD for median overall survival (OS) was - 0.22 for HDAraC compared with SDAraC (95% CI, - 2.76-2.32; P = .9). Data regarding the median OS was heterogeneous between studies (chi-square P = .00), with 2 studies in favor of HDAraC and 2 studies in favor of SDAraC. The WMD for 4-year OS was 6.21 in favor of HDAraC (95% CI, 2.70-9.72; P = .0005). CONCLUSIONS: Induction therapy with HDAraC improved long-term disease control and overall survival in adults age < 60 years with de novo AML. It remains unknown whether patients should receive HDAraC during induction or if it is to be given during postremission therapy. Further analyses should focus on this issue and on the effects of HDAraC in prognostically different subgroups of patients with AML.",['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],9,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on patients with biopsy-proven nontransformed and transformed follicular lymphoma (FL), B-cell small-cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL/CLL), or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who underwent PET and computed tomography (CT) scans within 3 weeks. Standard uptake values (SUV) of all abnormal foci were measured. RESULTS: In FL, PET demonstrated 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity for staging. PET was more specific than CT for detecting recurrence or assessing therapeutic responses (91% vs. 50%). FDG avidity among patients with WHO Grades 1, 2, and 3 disease was not significantly different (analysis of variance [ANOVA]). For MZL staging, PET had moderate sensitivity (71%) and outperformed CT alone in the depiction of extranodal sites (85% vs. 57% sensitivity). In SLL/CLL, PET sensitivity was 53% and underestimated disease extent in 5 of 19 patients (26%) compared with CT. PET did not affect initial management but confirmed suspected recurrences in 75% of patients. Nontransformed FL had a higher SUV (ANOVA, P < .05) compared with MZL and SLL/CLL. SUV was higher in transformed than in nontransformed tumors (P < .001, Student t test). CONCLUSIONS: PET usefulness in staging low-grade lymphomas varies depending on histology. PET sensitivity is excellent in FL and moderate in MZL. PET is more specific than CT for follow-up in all types. PET has limited usefulness for SLL/CLL staging. However, a suggestive pattern of hazy and mild uptake was often noted in positive scans. In all low-grade lymphomas, the emergence of foci of intense uptake should raise suspicion of conversion to high-grade disease.",['0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)'],,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

ESFT arising as a second cancer was reviewed and characterized at our childhood cancer center. METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 11,183 patients age <21 years who were treated for a primary cancer between March 1962 and December 2003 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. All cases of ESFT were confirmed to have a rearranged EWS gene. RESULTS: Six cases of ESFT (1.3% of 479 second cancers) were identified in patients previously treated for lymphoma (n = 3), leukemia (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), or Wilms tumor (n = 1). None of these patients had a family history suggestive of a familial cancer syndrome. The median time between diagnosis of primary cancer and diagnosis of ESFT was 5.9 years (range, 3.1-18.3 years). ESFT occurred in typical anatomic locations: rib (n = 2), chest wall soft tissues (n = 2), pelvis (n = 1), and extremity (n = 1). One tumor arose at the margin of a previous radiotherapy field and 1 arose distant from previous radiotherapy fields; all other patients had not received radiotherapy. Three patients are alive at the time of this report, including 2 whose ESFT was diagnosed more than 8 years ago. CONCLUSIONS: ESFT occurs rarely after treatment of a primary cancer during childhood, and most cases do not appear to be related to radiation therapy. Long-term survival can be achieved in some patients, and therefore secondary ESFT should be treated with curative intent.","['0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EWSR1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",,,,"['CA 23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 16.,"UNLABELLED: Respiratory viruses are the most common infections in healthy children. The impact of these infections in cancer patients has been only recently recognized in Chile. AIM: To establish the frequency and epidemiological-clinical profile of respiratory virus infections in children younger than 15 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia requiring hospitalization due to a febrile neutropenic episode. METHODS: All children < 15 years of age requiring hospitalization in the Regional Hospital of Valdivia, Chile, with cancer, fever and neutropenia between November 1 2002 and October 31 2004 were studied. Nasopharyngeal aspirate were obtained and tested by direct immunofluorescent assays for influenza A-B virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 25% of 44 febrile neutropenia episodes occurring in 25 patients. Viruses detected were, influenza (3/11), parainfluenza (3/11) RSV (2/11), adenovirus (1/11), parainfluenza + RSV (1/11), and parainfluenza + adenovirus (1/11). Four (36%) of cases were nosocomial. Respiratory symptoms were present in 9 children, seven of whom had inferior respiratory tract symptoms. One patient died of persistent RSV infection, agranulocytosis and extensive bilateral pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 25% of febrile neutropenic episodes in children with ALL. This high detection rate together with the frequent involvement of the lower respiratory tract and the possibility of death strongly favors the inclusion of respiratory virus diagnostic tests in the evaluation of these children during autumn and winter season.",,,Infecciones por virus respiratorios en ninos con leucemia linfoblastica aguda y neutropenia febril: Estudio prospectivo.,20060516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these provide powerful tools to our knowledge, few studies have addressed the question whether hematopoietic cell lines represent accurate and reliable model systems. To improve the molecular characterization of these model systems, we analyzed 17 myeloid leukemia cell lines using DNA microarray technology. By array-based comparative genomic hybridization, we identified recurrent genomic DNA gains and losses, as well as high-level amplifications. Parallel analysis of gene expression helped delineate potential candidate genes, and unsupervised analysis of gene expression data revealed cell lines to cluster in part based on underlying cytogenetic abnormalities. Comparison with clinical leukemia specimens showed that key signatures were retained, as myeloid cell lines with characteristic cytogenetic aberrations co-clustered with leukemia samples carrying the respective abnormality. Signatures were also quite robust, as expression data from cell lines correlated highly with published data. Thus, our analyses demonstrate myeloid cell lines to exhibit conserved and stable signatures reflecting the underlying primary cytogenetic aberrations. Our refined molecular characterization of myeloid cell lines supports the utility of cell lines as faithful and powerful model systems and provides additional insights into the molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 23.,"Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene. Imatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein and is an effective, frontline therapy for chronic-phase CML. However, accelerated or blast-crisis phase CML patients and Ph+ ALL patients often relapse due to drug resistance resulting from the emergence of imatinib-resistant point mutations within the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain. This has stimulated the development of new kinase inhibitors that are able to over-ride resistance to imatinib. The novel, selective BCR-ABL inhibitor, AMN107, was designed to fit into the ATP-binding site of the BCR-ABL protein with higher affinity than imatinib. In addition to being more potent than imatinib (IC50< 30 nM) against wild-type BCR-ABL, AMN107 is also significantly active against 32/33 imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. In preclinical studies, AMN107 demonstrated activity in vitro and in vivo against wild-type and imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-expressing cells. In phase I/II clinical trials, AMN107 has produced haematological and cytogenetic responses in CML patients, who either did not initially respond to imatinib or developed imatinib resistance. Dasatinib (BMS-354825), which inhibits Abl and Src family kinases, is another promising new clinical candidate for CML that has shown good efficacy in CML patients. In this review, the early characterisation and development of AMN107 is discussed, as is the current status of AMN107 in clinical trials for imatinib-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL. Future trends investigating prediction of mechanisms of resistance to AMN107, and how and where AMN107 is expected to fit into the overall picture for treatment of early-phase CML and imatinib-refractory and late-stage disease are discussed.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",30,,20060523,,PMC2361347,,,['Br J Cancer. 2019 Jul;121(3):282.

Antibiotic and granulocyte colony stimulating factor prophylaxis reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia but uncertainty remains regarding their role in clinical practice. We review recent literature to clarify the issue. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research confirms that prophylactic antibiotics decrease febrile neutropenia and infection-related mortality in acute leukaemia patients and those receiving high dose chemotherapy. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis also decreases the incidence of febrile neutropenia and all-cause mortality in the first cycle of moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy for solid tumours. There is no convincing evidence that colonization of individuals with resistant organisms due to antibiotic prophylaxis increases febrile neutropenia or mortality. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor prophylaxis reduces infection-related mortality in patients with greater than 20% risk of febrile neutropenia. SUMMARY: Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukaemia and high dose chemotherapy for solid tumours. It should also be offered to those receiving moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy for solid tumours and lymphomas during the first cycle of chemotherapy. Prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor is indicated for patients at greater than 20% risk of febrile neutropenia. Further research is indicated to determine whether combining granulocyte colony stimulating factor and antibiotic prophylaxis causes a further reduction in infection-related mortality.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that the expression of DEK is under direct control of E2F transcription factors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that the DEK promoter is bound by endogenous E2F in vivo. The DEK promoter is transactivated by E2F and mutation of E2F binding sites eliminates this effect. Expression levels of DEK in human tumors have been investigated by tissue micro array analysis. We find that DEK is overexpressed in many solid tumors such as colon cancer, larynx cancer, bladder cancer, and melanoma.","['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)']",,,20060601,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess efficacy and toxicity of the most common therapies--surgery followed by chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone--we began a controlled clinical trial in patients in early stage (I and II 1). METHODS: One hundred and two patients were randomized to be treated with surgery followed by six cycles of CEOP-Bleo (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin at standard doses) (52 cases) or with chemotherapy alone (49 cases). RESULTS: Complete response rates were 94% [95% confidence interval (CI): 88-99%] and 96% (93-100%), respectively. Actuarial curves at 5 yr showed that event-free survival were 70% (95% CI: 59-74%) in patients treated with surgery and chemotherapy, that were not statistically significant to 67% (95% CI: 51-69%) in the patients who received chemotherapy (p = 0.5). Also, overall survival that was not statistically significant: 78% (95% CI: 70-88%) in the combined treatment and 76% (95% CI: 70-87%) in chemotherapy (p = 0.8). Acute and late toxicity were mild and well controlled. No acute leukemia or second neoplasm has been observed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of surgery and chemotherapy did not improve outcome in patients with early-stage high-grade gastric MALT lymphoma.

Using a human CD8 x A2.1/Kb mouse derived TCR specific for natural peptide-A2.1 (pA2.1) complexes comprising residues 81-88 of the human homolog of the murine double-minute 2 oncoprotein, MDM2(81-88), we found that the heterodimeric CD8 alpha beta coreceptor, but not normally expressed homodimeric CD8 alpha alpha, is required for tetramer binding and functional redirection of TCR- transduced human T cells. CD8+T cells that received a humanized derivative of the MDM2 TCR bound pA2.1 tetramers only in the presence of an anti-human-CD8 anti-body and required more peptide than wild-type (WT) MDM2 TCR+T cells to mount equivalent cytotoxicity. They were, however, sufficiently effective in recognizing malignant targets including fresh leukemia cells. Most efficient expression of transduced TCR in human T lymphocytes was governed by mouse as compared to human constant (C) alphabeta domains, as demonstrated with partially humanized and murinized TCR of primary mouse and human origin, respectively. We further observed a reciprocal relationship between the level of Tg WT mouse relative to natural human TCR expression, resulting in T cells with decreased normal human cell surface TCR.

While the main function of NF-kappaB is to promote the host's immune response, the NF-kappaB pathway is frequently dysregulated by invading viral pathogens. Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of a fatal malignancy known as adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and an inflammatory disease named tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). HTLV-1 encodes an oncoprotein, Tax, which plays a significant role in the initiation of cellular transformation and the elicitation of the host's inflammatory responses.

We evaluated bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 450 adult patients with AML of the GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto)/AML12 EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) trial to (1) search for new exon-12 NPM mutations; (2) determine whether NPM immunostaining on paraffin-embedded biopsies predicts NPM mutations; and (3) investigate altered nucleocytoplasmic NPM traffic in primary AML cells. Fourteen NPM mutations, including 8 new variants, were identified. All 200 AML cases expressing cytoplasmic NPM (NPMc(+) AML) carried NPM mutations. None of the 250 cases with nucleus-restricted NPM (NPMc(-) AML) was mutated. At the C-terminus, NPM leukemic mutants carried mutations of only tryptophan 290 or of both tryptophans 288 and 290 and a new nuclear export signal (NES) motif, which appear to underlie their nuclear export. The specific Crm1/exportin-1 inhibitor leptomycin-B relocated NPM mutants from cytoplasm to nucleus of primary NPMc(+) AML cells, demonstrating that nuclear export is NES dependent. NPM mutants bound and recruited wild-type NPM into leukemic cell cytoplasm. Because alterations at C-terminus of leukemic NPM mutants are similar, immunohistochemistry detects all exon-12 NPM mutations and is a valuable, inexpensive tool in the diagnostic-prognostic work-up of patients with AML with normal karyotype.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",,,20060523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in mice have shown gonadotropin stimulation using equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) affects the endometrium, implantation, and fetal development. Evidence from clinical studies also indicates that stimulation with recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (rhFSH) may be detrimental to the endometrium and implantation rates. We investigated the effect of rhFSH in mice on maternal plasma hormone concentrations and uterine gene and protein expression and the effect of a stimulated maternal environment on pregnancy. Adult females were stimulated with rhFSH or eCG, followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). On day 4 of pseudopregnancy, mice either had embryos transferred to the uterus or were killed, and blood and uterine samples were collected. Pregnancy outcomes were examined on day 15. Gonadotropin stimulation increased plasma progesterone concentrations on day 4 compared with controls, whereas estradiol concentrations were unaffected. Stimulation also reduced uterine leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) mRNA, but the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (Esr1 and Pgr), homeobox gene Hoxa10, and Vegf mRNA were unchanged. Furthermore, distribution of uterine PGR protein expression was altered by stimulation, but LIF protein was unchanged. Stimulated embryo transfer recipients had lower pregnancy rates than controls, and fetuses from the rhFSH group had reduced weight, length, and maturity. These results demonstrate that gonadotropin stimulation with rhFSH or eCG alters the preimplantation maternal environment, which results in reduced pregnancy rates and fetal development in the mouse.","['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",,,20060523,['U01 HD044644/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 23.,"Cross-linking of CD38 on hematopoietic cells induces activation, proliferation and differentiation of mature T and B cells and mediates apoptosis of myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells. In addition to acting as a signaling receptor, CD38 is also an enzyme capable of producing several calcium-mobilizing metabolites, including cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR). It has been previously postulated that the calcium-mobilizing metabolites produced by CD38 may regulate its receptor-based activities. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the enzyme activity of CD38 controls the apoptosis of an anti-CD38-stimulated leukemic B cell. We show that anti-CD38-induced apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells, a murine pro-B cell line, is not affected by blocking the calcium-mobilizing activity of cADPR or by inhibiting intracellular or extracellular calcium mobilization. In addition, we demonstrate that blocking CD38 enzyme activity with 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-nicotinamide arabinoside adenine dinucleotide has no effect on apoptosis and that Ba/F3 cells expressing catalytically inactive mutant forms of CD38 still undergo apoptosis upon CD38 cross-linking. Instead, we find that anti-CD38-induced apoptosis is dependent on tyrosine kinase and caspase activation, and that this process appears to be potentiated by the presence of membrane microdomains. Thus, the receptor-mediated functions of CD38 can be separated from its enzyme activity in a murine leukemic cell line, suggesting that CD38 plays multiple, but independent, biologic roles.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '108646-17-9 (nicotinamide arabinoside adenine dinucleotide)', '119340-53-3 (Cyclic ADP-Ribose)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,20060523,['AI-43629/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the association of adiponectin levels with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs). We measured adiponectin levels in 19 patients with CLL and 30 patients with MPD (chronic myelogenous leukemia, 15; polycythemia vera, 9; myelofibrosis, 4; essential thrombocythemia, 2). The data were (chronic myelogenous leukemia, 15; polycythemia vera, 9; myelofibrosis, 4; essential thrombocythemia, 2). The data were compared with results from a control group of healthy volunteers who were matched according to age, sex, and body mass index. The adiponectin levels in patients with CLL were lower than in the controls (4.71 +/- 1.33 microg/mL versus 16.61 +/- 3.91 microg/mL; P <.001). They were also significantly lower in patients with MPD than in the controls (8.95 +/- 1.33 microg/mL versus 16.16 +/- 4.77 microg/mL; P <.001). In addition, we compared the adiponectin levels of MPD patients who were treated with interferon (IFN) to the levels of patients who were not treated with IFN. Adipnectin levels were significantly higher in IFN-treated patients (11.03 +/- 1.39 microg/mL versus 6.87 +/- 1.79 microg/mL; P <.001). These results suggest that lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis negatively influence adiponectin levels. Adiponectin may be related to inflammatory cytokine release.

There is an acute morbidity and mortality associated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, a need for long term follow-up, the possibility of treatment failure and the issue of cost. In general, the value of a scoring system is in its ability to quantify disease burden, classify patient subgroups and predict disease course. Successful scoring systems are disease-specific, have been validated in an independent population and are useful in different countries, centres and individuals. There should be good discrimination of poorly responsive and optimally responsive populations and a high rate of prediction of the disease course for individual patients. Optimal utility should be provided by a few variables which are independent, highly predictive and easy to obtain. Other considerations include economic evaluation and adaptation for population changes over time. CONCLUSION: Experience gained from the use of staging and scoring systems in haematology provides useful insights into their potential use in Fabry disease and other lysosomal storage diseases. Such systems may help to predict whom to treat, when to treat and what response is likely to be achieved.",['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],,,,,,,,,['Acta Paediatr Suppl. 2006 Apr;95(451):41-2.

A murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based MGIN vector was used to express Rz1-9, Rz1-14, ASPsi-gag, Rz1-9ASPsi-gag, or Rz1-14ASPsi-gag RNA in a CD4+ T lymphoid cell line. Stable transductants were shown to express similar levels of interfering RNA. HIV-1 replication was inhibited in cells expressing Rz1-9 and Rz1-14. Little inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed in cells expressing ASPsi-gag RNA. Thus, the multimeric hammerhead ribozymes inhibit HIV-1 replication better than the antisense RNA. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cells expressing Rz1-9ASPsi-gag or Rz1-14ASPsi-gag RNA was worse than that obtained with the multimeric ribozymes alone. This result suggests that co-expression of antisense RNA decreases the anti-HIV potential of ribozymes. The multimeric ribozymes and the antisense RNA were designed to target different sites within the HIV-1 RNA. They are not expected to interact with each other. Neither are they expected to compete with each other for binding to the HIV-1 RNA. Instead, the antisense RNA binding to its (1553 nt-long) target site may have resulted in a decreased ribozyme turn over. Furthermore, since the antisense RNA/HIV-1 RNA hybrids are degraded by the cells, the co-expressed antisense RNA may have led to ribozyme degradation.","['0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)']",,,20060901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They include many different types of disorders such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which are themselves divided into multiple subcategories. Most T-cell malignancies arise as a result of chromosomal abnormalities, including T-cell receptor rearrangement anomalies. Viral infections are implicated in the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and some cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma have been linked to Epstein-Barr virus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. With the possible exception of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, which often has an indolent course, T-cell malignancies have not responded well to conventional chemotherapeutic treatment. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer has changed the outlook for patients with T-cell malignancies. Recent studies with single-agent alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, have shown improved response rates and survival in patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Preliminary data also suggest that alemtuzumab may have activity in patients with heavily pretreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma who are refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Preclinical studies with mice bearing human adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells suggest that alemtuzumab may have a potential therapeutic role in this setting. Treatment of T-cell hematologic malignancies with alemtuzumab appears promising. Earlier treatment and combination with chemotherapeutic agents may improve treatment outcome for patients with these malignancies and allow for consolidation with stem cell transplant strategies in selected patients.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improvements in clinical outcomes, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant and potentially lethal complication. One approach by which GVHD has been managed is through introduction of new agents, such as alemtuzumab, into the conditioning regimen. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen, which is highly expressed on both B and T lymphocytes. By depleting T cells in both the donor and the recipient, alemtuzumab has been shown to prevent development of both acute and chronic GVHD, without inhibiting the benefits associated with the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Clinical trials have shown that alemtuzumab is able to decrease the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD without impairing engraftment. Furthermore, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia therapy, alemtuzumab has been shown to purge malignant cells from the host to allow for harvesting for the purpose of autologous transplantation. Despite results showing that alemtuzumab can play an important role in managing GVHD, little information is available regarding a standardized dosing schedule. Greater insight into alemtuzumab's pharmacokinetic activity would assist in developing a schedule that can optimize alemtuzumab-mediated T-cell depletion to prevent GVHD, while retaining sufficient host T-cell activity to encourage the graft-versus-leukemia effect and prevent relapse.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of alemtuzumab, a CD52 monoclonal antibody with significant clinical activity in chemotherapy refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, is accompanied by a side effect profile different from that resulting from chemotherapy. The intravenous administration of alemtuzumab is usually accompanied by transient infusion-related side effects manifesting primarily as flu-like symptoms. These reactions can be reduced by use of corticosteroid prophylaxis, and will subside gradually during continued treatment. Alternatively, administration of alemtuzumab subcutaneously may markedly reduce the occurrence of general side effects but results in limited transient local skin reactions in most patients. Neutropenia (grade 4) may occur in approximately 20% of patients, but is usually transient and/or responds promptly to colony stimulating factor therapy; episodes of febrile neutropenia are infrequent. The major side effect of alemtuzumab is T-cell depletion, leading to an increased risk of infection, in particular reactivation of cytomegalovirus. This event typically occurs 3 to 8 weeks after initiation of therapy, coinciding with the T-cell nadir. With vigilance and early detection, these infections are usually manageable and do not cause organ failure. Preliminary data indicate that other infections following alemtuzumab therapy do not seem to occur at a frequency that is higher than expected, probably because of the general prophylactic use of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole) and valacyclovir in combination with clinical tumor regressions. The overall safety profile of alemtuzumab appears to be beneficial in relation to disease severity and prognosis in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has traditionally been considered indolent, with a prolonged clinical course. However, a large proportion of patients with CLL have severe symptoms, a poor prognosis, and often require more immediate treatment of their leukemia. Over the last 5 years, technology has transformed the approach to treating patients with CLL. Molecular markers are now available that characterize patients with poor-risk disease who may benefit from earlier or more aggressive therapeutic intervention. Biological markers have also been identified that assist in predicting responses to specific agents and may help select an effective therapeutic approach. The advent of more targeted monoclonal antibody therapies, used in combination with chemotherapy regimens or as monotherapy, has the potential to eradicate disease to a point of undetectability by the most sensitive tests available, thereby possibly extending the goal of therapy to include a cure. Because recent data have shown that achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow is one of the most important factors in predicting duration of remission, MRD may be an appropriate therapeutic end point for patients with poor-risk CLL. The use of rituximab with the cytotoxic agents cyclophosphamide and fludarabine has achieved complete remission with no detectable CLL, as assessed by MRD techniques in a significant proportion of previously untreated and previously treated CLL patients. Monotherapy with alemtuzumab has also been shown to achieve a complete response with undetectable MRD in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. This article reviews recent advances in identifying patients who have poor-risk disease and explores the potential importance of MRD status as an outcome measure of CLL therapy.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many patients experience a relapse after an initial response or become refractory to these agents. The introduction of immunotherapeutic agents has provided renewed hope for fludarabine-refractory patients. Several clinical trials have shown the efficacy of alemtuzumab in patients with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including those with poor prognostic factors. Current studies indicate that treatment with alemtuzumab can achieve remissions with undetectable residual disease, as assessed by highly sensitive methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction or 4-color flow cytometry. These results suggest new applications for alemtuzumab such as combination treatment with chemotherapeutics or immunotherapeutics, maintenance therapy, and in vivo bone marrow purging prior to transplantation.

Treatment paradigms were dramatically altered by the availability of novel and active targeted agents, particularly the monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab and rituximab. These agents are now playing an increasingly important role in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Alemtuzumab is being used earlier in the course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with a more intact immune system, when it is likely to have its greatest activity. The immunosuppressive properties of monoclonal antibodies are also being explored in the stem cell transplant setting, including in vivo purging and, with alemtuzumab, for the management of graft-versus-host disease. Rituximab has become ubiquitous in the treatment of most B-cell malignancies. Further research with this antibody is focused on optimizing its use and determining its role in each of the relevant disease states. In addition, newer antibodies are in development for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell malignancies. New treatment regimens, including combinations of monoclonal antibodies, could enhance complete response rates and prolong progression-free survival, perhaps eventually improving our ability to cure patients with lymphoid malignancies.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to analyze diagnostic and therapeutic problems in children with parameniingeal neoplasms treated in Departments of Paediatric Oncology in Gdansk and Lublin between 1992 and 2004. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study includes 32 patients (M/F: 23/9), aged 2 to 17 years, mean 6,3 years. In 17 children MTM was diagnosed: in nine NHL-B-cell and in six--nasopharyngeal carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma). The diagnosis of NHL-B and undifferentiated MTM were made in two children treated previously for NHL-nonB and retinoblastoma. Two cases of NHL appeared in a girl with ataxia-teleangiectasia syndrome. RESULTS: Initial symptoms lasted from 2 weeks to 24 months, mean 4,5 months for the whole group. In NHL patients mean period ofsymptoms was 4,5 weeks, in MTM- 5,5 months and in lynmphoepithelioma--7 months. Symptoms associated with the tumours localisation (snoring, breathing through the mouth, epistaxis, chronic purulent rhinitis, dysphagia and earache) predominated and were treated initially as upper respiratory tract infections. Cervical lymph nodes enlargement was observed in 30% children with MTM and 83% with lymphoepithelioma. Most of patients presented with highly advanced stages of neoplasms. MTM and NHL-B treatment was conducted according to the protocol approved by the Polish Paediatric Solid Tumours and Leukaemia/Lymphoma Studies Group. In patients with lymphoepithelioma different treatment schemes were administered, including chemo- and radiotherapy. Good response to therapy was found in 13/32 patients (41%). The group included 24% children with MTM (all with embryonic subtype), 56% with NHL-B and 67% with lymphoepithelioma. All these patients attained complete remission after standard line I therapy. But 13 children with MTM, four with NHL-B and two with lymphoepithelioma required more aggressive line II treatment because ofpoor response to therapy (NR) or relapse. Finally, 20 of 32 followed-up patients (62,5%) are in durable complete remission from 10 months to 11 years 4 months (mean 4 years) after therapy discontinuation. This group consists of all nine patients with NHL-B, 67% children with lymphoepithelioma and 41% with MTM. In six children (30%) persistent complications of oncological treatment occurred, including: hypoacusia, postradiation defect of the eye ball, postsurgical facial nerve palsy and cranio-nasal fistula complicated with pneumocephaly. A patient with MTM of maxillary sinus developed a second neoplasm 2 years after first therapy. This was glioblastoma multiforme located in the left parietal lobe (outside the radiation field). At present, the boy is in complete remission 2,5 years after treatment for the second tumour Among 32 children with parameningeal neoplasms 11 patients died (nine with MTM and two with lymphoepithelioma), all in the phase of disease progression (five NR and six after relapse). In two of them (with MTM) the direct cause of death was myelosupressive, gastrotoxic and infectious complications of antitumour therapy. One child still undergoes treatment for MTM relapse.",,,Nowotwory zlosliwe o lokalizacji okolooponowej u dzieci w materiale dwoch osrodkow onkologicznych--trudnosci diagnostyczne i terapeutyczne.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This assay was based on hybridization of analytes to the biotin-labeled capture ODNs followed by ligation with digoxigenin-labeled detection ODN. The bound duplex was then detected by anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase using Attophos (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as substrate. S1 nuclease and major factors such as the hybridization temperature, concentration of capture probe, and the use of detergent were evaluated toward assay sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy. RESULTS: The method is selective to the parent drugs with minimal cross-reactivity (<6%) with 3'-end deletion oligomers for both G3139 and GTI-2040. A linear range of 0.05 to 10 nM (r2 > 0.99) was observed for GTI-2040 in a variety of biological matrices. For both G3139 and GTI-2040, the within-day precision and accuracy values were found to be <20% and 90-110%, respectively; the between-day precision and accuracy were determined to be <20% and 90-120%. Addition of S1 nuclease combined with washing step greatly improved the assay linearity and selectivity. The utility of this assay was demonstrated by simultaneous determination of GTI-2040 in plasma and its intracellular levels in treated acute myeloid leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: The validated hybridization enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method is specific for quantitation of PS ODNs in biological samples to picomolar level. This method provides a powerful technique to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics and intracellular uptake of PS ODNs in patients and shows its utility in clinical evaluations.","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '236391-66-5 (GTI2040)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)']",,,20060525,"['R21CA105879/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA 76576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 23.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is one of the most common hematological malignancies. Despite a variety of therapeutical approaches including high-dose cytostatic treatment with subsequent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as well as vaccination, cures remain rare exceptions. An important issue for future immunological treatments is the identification and characterization of appropriate tumor-associated antigens. However, the number of tumor-associated antigens in MM is limited. PBK/TOPK and activated serin kinase 2 (PAK2) are novel serin kinases that have recently been identified. PBK/TOPK is overexpressed in Burkitt lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and MM; PAK2 is expressed in malignant lymphatic cells. The cyclin kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) is overexpressed in MM compared to normal plasma cells. We hereby identified and characterized for the first time HLA-class-I-restricted immunogenic peptides in the amino acid sequences of PAK2 and CDKN1A. Using two independent prediction algorithms, we identified two peptides in PAK2 and three peptides in CDK1NA with high binding to HLA-A2. Using an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay, we could demonstrate the presence and functional activity of CD8-peptide-specific T cells with all tested peptides. To show HLA-A2-restricted antigen recognition, the specific inhibition of T cell recognition was demonstrated with an anti-HLA-A2-blocking antibody. By analysis of peripheral blood of 34 healthy donors for the presence and functional activity of CD8 T cells specific for these peptides, we could demonstrate that peptide T-cell precursors specifically recognizing at least one of the tested peptides are present in 50-60% of the tested donors and that these T-cell precursors can be expanded in vitro. We conclude that PAK2- and CDKN1A-derived peptides can elicit a strong and consistent CD8 T-cell response in an in vitro model. Further investigations will examine the presence and functionality of such T cells in the tumor-bearing host.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",,,20060523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 22.,"PURPOSE: To compare conventional sibling bone marrow transplantation (CBMT), BMT with alternative donor (ABMT), and chemotherapy (CT) for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and an early first marrow relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After informed consent, 214 patients with ALL and early marrow relapse began multiagent induction therapy. One hundred sixty-three patients with fewer than 25% marrow blasts and count recovery at the end of induction (second remission [CR2]) were allocated by donor availability. Fifty patients with sibling donors were allocated to CBMT. Seventy-two patients were randomly allocated between ABMT and CT while 41 patients refused allocation. RESULTS: Overall, 3-year event free survival from entry is 19% +/- 3%. Thirty-two of 50 CBMT patients (64%) and 19 of 37 ABMT patients (51%) underwent transplantation in CR2 with 3-year disease-free survival of 42% +/- 7% and 29% +/- 7%. The 3-year DFS is 29% +/- 7%, 21% +/- 7%, and 27% +/- 8% for patients allocated to CBMT, ABMT, and CT, respectively. Contrary to protocol, 12 of 35 patients allocated to CT underwent BMT in CR2. Of these, five patients died after BMT and 5 patients relapsed. CONCLUSION: More than one half of patients died, failed reinduction, or relapsed again before 3 months after CR2 (median time to BMT). Intent-to-treat pair-wise comparison of ABMT with CT, CT with CBMT, and CBMT with ABMT yields hazards of 1.2, 1.1, 0.8 with P values of .56, .80, and .36, respectively. Outcomes remain similar and poor for children with ALL and early marrow relapse. BMT is not a complete answer to the challenge of ALL and early marrow relapse.",,,,20060522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2006.,"Like c-Fos, HBZ (HTLV-I bZIP factor) is able to interact with c-Jun but differs considerably from c-Fos in its ability to activate AP-1-responsive genes since HBZ rather inhibits transcriptional activity of c-Jun. To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in this down-regulation of c-Jun activity, a large number of HBZ/c-Fos chimeras was constructed and analyzed for their ability to interact with c-Jun, to bind to the AP-1 motif and to stimulate expression of a reporter gene containing the collagenase promoter. By this approach, we demonstrate that the DNA-binding domain of HBZ is responsible for its inhibitory effect on the trans-activation potential of c-Jun. However, unexpectedly, we found that exchange of a cluster of six charged amino acids immediately adjacent to the DNA contact region altered significantly transcriptional activity of chimeras. This particular subdomain could be involved in efficient presentation of the AP-1 complex to the transcriptional machinery. To confirm this role, specific residues present in the cluster of HBZ were substituted for corresponding amino acids in c-Fos. Unlike the JunD-activating potential of wild-type HBZ, this mutant was no longer able to stimulate JunD activity, confirming the key role of this particular cluster in regulation of Jun transcriptional potency.","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,20060522,,PMC1464409,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 22.,"OBJECTIVE: Among >2500 nontyphoid Salmonella serotypes, Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis shows a high predilection to cause systemic infections in humans. The objective of this study was to delineate the clinical and microbiologic features of pediatric patients with Salmonella Choleraesuis infections. METHODS: Between May 1999 and February 2003, a total of 33 patients who were <18 years of age had culture-confirmed S Choleraesuis infections. Clinical features, laboratory values, treatment, outcome, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the bacterial isolates were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 24 males and 9 females with a mean age of 3 years. Fever (rectal temperature > or =38 degrees C; 94%) was the most common clinical presentation. Sixteen (52%) had fever lasting >5 days before admission. Only 18 (54%) patients had diarrhea. The most common mode of infection is occult bacteremia without focal infection. Compared with data obtained from adult patients, the gastrointestinal manifestations appeared more frequently seen in pediatric patients. However, among the 18 who presented with diarrhea, 14 had concomitant bloodstream infection. Only 1 patient, who was a case of acute leukemia, died of S Choleraesuis sepsis. Resistance to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol was found in 6%, 28%, 88%, 76%, and 83% of the isolates, respectively. CONCLUSION: Children with S Choleraesuis infections usually presented with occult bacteremia with mild gastrointestinal involvement. The mortality of S Choleraesuis infections in previously healthy children is low. Ciprofloxacin resistance among S Choleraesuis isolates from pediatric patients was lower than that of isolates from adult patients. In view of the high rate of multidrug resistance, third-generation cephalosporins seem to be the drug of choice for treatment of invasive S Choleraesuis infections.",,,,20060522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study has been performed in a paediatric oncology unit of the Salah Azaiz Institute between 1989 and 2005. It concerns 58 girls and 57 boys with a median age of 7.9 years(4 months to 18 years) treated for cancer disease predominantly lymphoma (22%), sarcoma (23.2%) or leukaemia (8.5%) proposed for insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC). RESULTS: Excluding 2 insertion failures (1.6%), we placed 123 CVC (double for 10 patients), 43 (35%) exteriorised (EC) and 80 (65%) connected to an implantable site (IS). Catheters were placed in the subclavian vein in 59.2% of cases vs 32% for internal jugular vein and 8.8% for femoral vein. Early complications included 15 cases of multiple punctures (12%), 4 cases of pneumothorax (3.2%) and 6 of arterial punctures (4.8%) originating a cervical subcutaneous haematoma in 1 patient (0.8%). Late complications were represented by infection in 7 cases (5.7%). We observed 2 cases of intracardiac catheter migration due to catheter disconnection from the IS (1.6%) and 2 cases of thrombosis (1.8%). The mean life of CVC was longer for IS (305.2 days) than for EC (64.4 days). CONCLUSION: Implantable sites are effective progress for venous access in children with cancer. They improved the quality of care in pediatric oncology.",,,Profil epidemiologique et complications des voies veineuses centrales en oncologie pediatrique: a propos de 125 cas.,20060522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if retroviruses activate intracellular signaling, we transduced HeLa cells with amphotropic retroviruses produced by TelCeB6 cells and examined cell lysates for activated Rac1. We found that retroviruses activate Rac1. Rac1 activation was blocked when cells were depleted of cholesterol, cultured in suspension, or incubated with an anti-beta(1) integrin antibody, and when viruses were treated with heparinase III. Retrovirus activation of Rac1 did not require the amphotropic envelope protein. Gene transfer was reduced 2.4-fold when viruses were treated with heparinase III, but did not change when cells were transduced in the presence of function-blocking anti-beta(1) integrin antibodies. The implications of these findings with respect to retrovirus-cell interactions are discussed.","['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",,,20060512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, no comprehensive or systematic review on the pharmacokinetics of IGIV has been published despite the availability of many published individual studies. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published studies of the pharmacokinetics of IGIV. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a search of PubMed/MEDLINE from January 1966-September 2005 and EMBASE from January 1980-September 2005 for English-language articles on the pharmacokinetics of IGIV. This search was supplemented by a bibliographic review of all relevant articles. RESULTS: Data elements extracted from these articles included study design, number of study subjects, indication for IGIV therapy, IGIV treatment regimen (formulation, dosage, and duration), pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, volume of distribution, elimination rate constant, and half-life), analytic methodology, pharmacokinetic model, and blood sampling times. The United States Preventive Services Task Force rating scale was used to categorize the 50 pertinent citations identified in our literature search. According to the rating scale, 12 studies were level I (prospective, randomized, controlled studies), 3 were level II-1 (prospective, nonrandomized, controlled studies), 30 were level II-2 (prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled [cohort] studies), and 5 were level III (case reports or descriptive studies). CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of IGIV shows considerable intra- and interpopulation variability among patients with normal immunoglobulin levels, patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases, bone marrow transplant recipients, patients with immune deficiency due to chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma, very low birth weight neonates, neonates with suspected sepsis, high-risk infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, high-risk infants with cardiopulmonary disease, children with cryptogenic West or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, women and infants with fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and women with recurrent spontaneous abortions. Despite the large number of studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of IGIV, major literature gaps include lack of information on IGIV clearance or area under the curve parameters and target serum immunoglobulin G concentrations. Further study is needed to rigorously characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of IGIV in a range of patient populations.","['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding sites for factors of the Sp family (Sp1 and Sp3) have previously been identified within the U3 region of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). Although previous studies have demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 can interact with the Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1) repeat III, the sequences required for Sp1/Sp3 binding have not been mapped in detail. Herein, we demonstrate that the GC-rich regions flanking the viral cAMP-responsive element (CRE) within TRE-1 repeat III exhibit substantial affinity for both Sp1 and Sp3. We demonstrate that purified Sp1 competes with purified CREB for binding to TRE-1 repeat III due to the physical proximity of the Sp1/Sp3 and ATF/CREB binding sites, while purified Sp1 forms a multiprotein complex with purified CREB in the presence of Tax as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses. Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the U3 region of the HTLV-1 LTR in the presence of Tax in vivo was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation using HTLV-1-infected T cells (SLB-1 and C8166). Overexpression of Sp1 was modestly enhanced, while overexpression of Sp3 inhibited basal and Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR in U-937 cells (which express relatively low levels of endogenous Sp1 and Sp3). Furthermore, the modest upregulation of LTR activation caused by overexpression of Sp1 could be blocked by site-directed mutagenesis of the GC-rich Sp1/Sp3 binding sites within TRE-1 repeat III. These results suggest that both Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factor binding to TRE-1 repeat III participate in regulation of HTLV-1 viral gene expression.","['0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '148710-94-5 (Sp3 Transcription Factor)']",,,,"['CA099926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term period and cohort-based estimates are also compared. DATA SOURCES: Data are from the Canadian Cancer Registry, the Canadian Mortality Data Base, and Statistics Canada life tables. ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Relative survival analyses were conducted using the life-table method; expected survival proportions were derived using the Ederer II approach. Period analysis estimates were based on the survival experience of cancer cases followed up in 2002. The cohort analyses involved people diagnosed in 1997 (5-year survival) or 1992 (10-year survival). National estimates exclude Quebec. MAIN RESULTS: Relative survival ratios were highest for thyroid (5-year, 97.7%) and prostate (95.2%) cancer and lowest for pancreatic cancer. Survival for many forms of cancer is higher than previously estimated by cohort-based analysis. The largest increases in 10-year relative survival were predicted for cancers of the prostate (13.0%) and rectum (9.7%). The largest predicted increases for 5-year survival were for cancers of the cervix uteri (5.4%) and rectum (4.5%), and for leukemia (3.7%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Medications primarily relevant to these complications were methotrexate in 5 patients, L-asparaginase in 2, cytosin arabinoside in 1. The patients were diagnosed as having leukoencephalopathy (8), cerebrovascular injury (4), and Wernicke's encephalopathy (1).

The median age of patients was 63 years (range, 26-85). Karyotype analyses were done in 85 patients (96%). Median OS was 3 years; 67 patients (75%) have died, and 28 (31%) had progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Major independent prognostic variables for both OS and LFS (multivariate analysis) were percentage of bone marrow (BM) blasts (P < 0.0001), and in patients with cytogenetic data available, cytogenetic risk groups by Lille-score (OS, P = 0.031/LFS, P = 0.002) and IPSS (OS, P = 0.024). All five prognostic scoring systems successfully discriminated risk groups as regards OS and LFS, but in patients with cytogenetic data available, the major independent prognostic score for OS (P < 0.0001) and LFS (P = 0.006) was the IPSS. The FAB and WHO classifications also successfully discriminated between risk groups. The new WHO subgroups [refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), with (RCMD-RS) or without ringed sideroblasts] showed a significantly (P = 0.0454) different prognosis for OS, but not for LFS (P = 0.0839), in comparison to the subgroups having erythroid dysplasia only (RA/RARS). Risk stratification into refractory anemia with excess blast-I (RAEB-I) and RAEB-II tended to yield different prognoses for OS and LFS. The 5q-minus syndrome strongly predicted for a good prognosis. In patients treated with the demethylating agent decitabine (n = 24), IPSS ""poor risk"" cytogenetics were unable to predict for the expected worse prognosis when compared to ""intermediate-risk"" cytogenetics. In conclusion, we confirm in a single-center patient cohort that the use of the WHO classification improves the predictive value of the FAB classification and that, in patients with cytogenetic data available, the IPSS can be used for clinical decision-making.",,,,20060520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, CD4 marker expression decreases after incubation with 1-2 mmol/l VA, but during apoptosis induction by 4 mmol/l VA, most of the apoptotic Annexin V positive cells were also CD4 positive. Using a clonogenic survival assay EC(50) for 3-day-long incubation with VA was determined. For HL-60 cells, the established EC(50) was 1.84 mmol/l, for MOLT-4 cells it was 1.76 mmol/l. Ability of VA to induce differentiation in HL-60 cells thus does not affect final cell killing. However, the elimination of the cells was considerably affected by presence of hematopoietic growth factors. 14-day-long incubation of HL-60 cells with VA in conditioned medium (source of IL-3, SCF, G-CSF) caused increase in EC(50) to 4 mmol/l, while in MOLT-4 cells (cultivation without conditioned medium), the EC(50) decreased to 0.63 mmol/l.","['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 7.,"Myc/Max/Mad often play pivotal roles in the proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and cell cycle progress of leukemia cells. Myc and Mad are known to be unstable proteins and their expression is tightly regulated throughout cell cycle progression and differentiation. Usually, c-Myc expression is implicated in cell growth and proliferation, and the deregulated expression of c-Myc in both myeloid leukemia cells and normal myeloid cells not only blocks terminal differentiation but also its associated growth arrest. HL60 cells could be induced to differentiate into mature granulocytes by DMSO in vitro, but the mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated clearly. We proposed the hypothesis that down-regulation of c-Myc expression by DMSO contributed to the differentiation of HL60 cells by way of activating target genes hTert and CAD. The results showed that c-Myc expression was down-regulated in differentiated HL60 cells but not in exponentially-growing HL60 cells, without or with the target gene activation of hTert and CAD, respectively. Further study indicated that hTert activation is TRRAP-dependent while CAD activation is TRRAP-independent. On the other hand, up-regulation of P(21) and P(27) and down-regulation of cyclinA and cyclinE also play important roles in induction of the terminal differentiation of HL60 cells. Our results support the hypothesis that c-Myc expression and activation of target genes for hTert and CAD play critical roles in the proliferation of HL60 cells, while down-regulation of c-Myc expression and activation of target genes for hTert and CAD contributed to the terminal differentiation of HL60 cells after exposure to DMSO in vitro.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CAD trifunctional enzyme)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAD1L1 protein, human)', '0 (MNT protein, human)', '0 (MYCBP protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transformation-transcription domain-associated protein)', 'EC 2.1.3.2 (Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.5.2.3 (Dihydroorotase)', 'EC 6.3.5.5 (Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing))', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,20060407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also identified MLV integration hot spots that contained three or more integrations within a 100kb region. RT-PCR revealed that mRNA-levels of T-cell clones that contained MLV integrations near transcription start sites or introns were dysregulated compared to the uninfected cells.

Although MLL(+/-) CD4 T cells differentiate normally into antigen-specific effector Th1/Th2 cells in vitro, the ability of memory Th2 cells to produce Th2 cytokines was selectively reduced. Furthermore, histone modifications at the Th2 cytokine gene loci were not properly maintained in MLL(+/-) memory Th2 cells. The reduced expression of MLL in memory Th2 cells resulted in decreased GATA3 expression accompanied with impaired GATA3 locus histone modifications. The direct association of MLL with the GATA3 locus and the Th2 cytokine gene loci was demonstrated.

Epub 2006 May 18.,"Lymphomas are among the most common tumors in many strains and stocks of mice, especially those used in safety assessment. CD-1, C57BL/6, B6C3F1 and B6;129 mice develop 10-50% incidences of lymphomas in aging mice. Most of the tumors are B-cell lymphomas of the follicular type, arising in spleen, mesenteric lymph node and/or Peyer's patches. Lymphomas and leukemias may be induced by chemicals, retroviruses and irradiation. Genetics also play a major role in mouse lymphomagenesis and leukemogenesis. The most potent chemical carcinogens require only a single injection in young mice to induce a high incidence of lymphomas, often thymic T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas. Several genetically engineered mouse lines have high incidences of these tumors. In 2-year carcinogenesis bioassays, increases of incidences of B-cell lymphomas (which occur naturally in controls) are indicative of less potent carcinogens. Classifications of the lymphomas and leukemias have evolved over the years. The practical WHO toxicologic pathology lymphoma and leukemia classification was developed by collaboration between the US STP, RITA, BSTP and JSTP. A more recent mouse lymphoma and leukemia classification was published by a committee of the US NCI Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium. This classification follows closely the more detailed human WHO classification and can be used for mouse models of lymphoma and leukemia.",,,,20060518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML protein expression was reduced or abolished in gastric carcinomas (31.7 and 10.6%, respectively) by immunohistochemistry. PML protein loss was associated with more lymphatic invasion, higher pTNM stage, and worse patient survival. Only one gastric carcinoma cell line showed loss of PML, and the PML protein re-appeared after the treatment of proteasome inhibitor in this cell line.

Epub 2006 Apr 7.,"OBJECTIVES: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal hematologic disorder, which combine ineffective hematopoiesis and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the disease pathogenesis, diagnostics and classification. Promising new agents and innovative therapeutic strategies are currently used. In this article we will review these achievements and their impact on the treatment of MDS. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: The pathogenesis of MDS involves abnormalities of the MDS clone itself such as abnormal apoptosis, signalling or epigenetic regulation and abnormalities of the microenvironment such as immune deregulation or increased angiogenesis, which represent potential therapeutic targets. There is currently no standard treatment for MDS and allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative strategy. However, besides conventional chemotherapy and growth factors, new agents including hypomethylating agents, antiangiogenic drugs, immune modulatory agents have proved effective. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: The interesting results achieved with these new agents show that it is necessary to continue investigation in order to improve therapeutic strategies in MDS.","['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",57,Avancees dans la prise en charge des syndromes myelodysplasiques.,20060407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of a novel allele was initially suspected because conflicting results were obtained by serological and DNA typing techniques. The HLA typing using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) at the two-digit level indicated an allele belonging to the HLA-B*44 group, whereas serological typing indicated HLA-B21. Typing with PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotides (PCR-SSO) resulted in a unique reaction pattern that could not be assigned to a known allele, PCR-SSP typing at the four-digit level did not match any known B*44 allele, either. The sequencing-based typing of the HLA-B locus then revealed the novel B*4442 allele that is identical with B*4405 except a single C-->G nucleotide exchange at position 572. This exchange results in an amino acid substitution from serine to tryptophan at position 167 of the expressed HLA-B protein. The B21 serological reactivity of the novel B*4442 allele product was confirmed by employing an additional serological panel of typing sera. Our findings support previous reports claiming that serine at the position 167 in the alpha-2 domain of the HLA-B protein is a major determinant of the HLA-B44(12) serological epitope.","['0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B*44:42 antigen)', '0 (HLA-B21 antigen)', '0 (HLA-B44 Antigen)']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AJ937958'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Activated fusion proteins such as Pml-Raralpha have been shown to inhibit cellular differentiation by recruitment of nuclear corepressor complexes, which maintain local histone deacetylase (HDAC) in a variety of hematologic lineage-specific gene promoters. This HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression appears as a common pathway in the development of leukemia and could constitute an important target for new therapeutic agents. Alternatively, the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein shows high tyrosine kinase activity and deregulates signal transduction pathways normally involved in both apoptosis and proliferation. This aberrant activity is affected by signal transduction inhibitors (STIs), which block or prevent the oncogenic pathway. In this review, we shed some light on our understanding of both the reversible transcriptional repression controlled by HDAC and the deregulated Bcr-Abl signal transduction pathway. In addition, the administration of low molecular weight drugs for human leukemia treatment based on this knowledge brings about a significant long-term clinical remission and an acceptable risk of toxic effects that should increase the cure rate.",['EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)'],56,La hemato-oncologia molecular y las nuevas estrategias terapeuticas especificas en leucemia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significantly higher frequency of HLA-B67 in the male relapse group of patients [OR, 23.08; 95% CI, 5.31-100.36; p = 0.0042; for statistical significance after Bonferroni correction (Bc) p (Bc) < 0.0083] was identified after Bonferroni correction. Although not surviving the Bonferroni correction, gender effects on the association were also observed with HLA-A11, HLA-A32, HLA-A33, and HLA-B22, which were however more prevalent in the female patients and particularly those developing relapse. Two patients with HLA-A29 and HLA-B7 revealed significantly shortened survivals, suggestive of their potential prognostic impacts. Notably, for the first time, we found a significant correlation of leukocyte count with HLA types, where HLA-A33 (p = 0.006) or HLA-B17 (p < 0.001) signifies higher leukocytosis at presentation.

Here we investigated the accuracy for a simplified assessment of the residence times for a (188)Re-labelled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody. PATIENTS, METHODS: For 49 patients with high risk leukaemia (24 men, 25 women, age: 44 +/- 12 years) the residence times were determined for the injected (188)Re-labelled anti-CD66 antibodies (1.3 +/- 0.4 GBq, 5-7 GBq/mg protein, >95% (188)Re bound to the antibody) based on 5 measurements (1.5, 3, 20, 26, and 44 h p.i.) using planar conjugate view gamma camera images (complete method). In a simplified method the residence times were calculated based on a single measurement 3 h p.i. RESULTS: The residence times for kidneys, liver, red bone marrow, spleen and remainder of body for the complete method were 0.4 +/- 0.2 h, 1.9 +/- 0.8 h, 7.8 +/- 2.1 h, 0.6 +/- 0.3 h and 8.6 +/- 2.1 h, respectively. For all organs a linear correlation exists between the residence times of the complete method and the simplified method with the slopes (correlation coefficients R > 0.89) of 0.89, 0.99, 1.23, 1.13 and 1.09 for kidneys, liver, red bone marrow, spleen and remainder of body, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach allows reliable prediction of biokinetics of (188)Re-labelled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody biodistribution with a single study. Efficient pretherapeutic estimation of organ absorbed dose may be possible, provided that a more stable anti-CD66 antibody preparation is available.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '7440-15-5 (Rhenium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 18.,"Polycomb group proteins Ring1b and Bmi1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1) are critical components of the chromatin modulating PRC1 complex. Histone H2A ubiquitination by the PRC1 complex strongly depends on the Ring1b protein. Here we show that the E3-ligase activity of Ring1b on histone H2A is enhanced by Bmi1 in vitro. The N-terminal Ring-domains are sufficient for this activity and Ring1a can replace Ring1b. E2 enzymes UbcH5a, b, c or UbcH6 support this activity with varying processivity and selectivity. All four E2s promote autoubiquitination of Ring1b without affecting E3-ligase activity. We solved the crystal structure of the Ring-Ring heterodimeric complex of Ring1b and Bmi1. In the structure the arrangement of the Ring-domains is similar to another H2A E3 ligase, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, but complex formation depends on an N-terminal arm of Ring1b that embraces the Bmi1 Ring-domain. Mutation of a critical residue in the E2/E3 interface shows that catalytic activity resides in Ring1b and not in Bmi1.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An electronic database search of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who presented at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) between January 1975 and June 2005 was performed, and patient medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 3,986 patients with CLL/SLL, 204 patients (5.1%) had possible RS, and 148 patients (3.7%) had biopsy- or fine-needle aspiration-proven RS. Treatment included chemotherapy alone and chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab. The overall response rate for the 130 assessable patients was 39% (chemotherapy, 34%; chemoimmunotherapy, 47%; P = .2). In multivariate analysis, factors predicting prolonged survival were Zubrod performance status 0-1 (P = .006), lactate dehydrogenase < or = 1.5x the upper limit of normal (P = .003), platelet count > or = 100,000 (P = .01), tumor size < or = 5 cm (P = .02), and fewer than two prior therapies (P = .02). The five adverse factors predicting shorter survival were used to design a model to predict an individual patient's risk of death: the RS score. A total of 20 patients underwent stem-cell transplantation (SCT). Patients who underwent allogeneic SCT as postremission therapy had longer survival than patients who achieved remission and received no additional therapy or patients who underwent allogeneic or autologous SCT as salvage therapy (P = .019). CONCLUSION: A score to predict an individual patient's risk of death is proposed. Chemotherapy and rituximab combinations are effective in RS. Patients with available donors may be considered for allogeneic SCT as postremission therapy.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied a cohort of 526 patients treated in accordance with the virtually identical Dutch protocols ALL-7 and ALL-8. Patients were classified into five groups: CNS1, no blasts in the CSF cytospin; CNS2, blasts present in the cytospin, but leukocytes less than 5/microL; CNS3, blasts present and leukocytes more than 5/microL. Patients with a traumatic lumbar puncture (TLP; > 10 erythrocytes/mL) were classified as TLP+ (blasts present in the cytospin) or TLP- (no blasts). RESULTS: Median duration of follow-up was 13.2 years (range, 6.9 to 15.5 years). Event-free survival (EFS) was 72.6% (SE, 2.5%) for CNS1 patients (n = 304), 70.3% (SE, 4.7%) for CNS2 patients (n = 111), and 66.7% (SE, 19%) for CNS3 patients (n = 10; no significant difference in EFS between the groups). EFS was 58% (SE, 7.6%) for TLP+ patients (n = 62) and 82% (SE, 5.2%) for TLP- patients (n = 39; P < .01). Cox regression analysis identified TLP+ status as an independent prognostic factor (risk ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 8.8; P = .007). Cumulative incidence of CNS relapses was 0.05 and 0.07 in CNS1 and CNS2 patients, respectively (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: In our experience, the presence of a low number of blasts in the CSF without pleiocytosis has no prognostic significance. In contrast, a traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts in the CSF specimen is associated with an inferior outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,['Dutch Childhood Oncology Group'],,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 18.,"A survival benefit for imatinib mesylate versus interferon-alpha therapy could not be demonstrated in the randomized study in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) due to the high rate of crossover (90%) from interferon-alpha to imatinib mesylate within a year of study entry. We compared survival in 279 patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with imatinib mesylate at our institution (2000-2004) to 650 patients treated with interferon-alpha (1982-1997). The complete cytogenetic response rates were 87% with imatinib mesylate and 28% with interferon-alpha (P < .001). The estimated 3-year survival rates were 96% with imatinib mesylate and 81% with interferon-alpha (P < .01). Survival rates with imatinib mesylate were significantly better than with interferon-alpha within each of the CML prognostic risks groups. By multivariate analysis, imatinib mesylate therapy was identified as an independent favorable prognostic factor, after accounting for the impact of pretreatment factors (hazard ratio, 0.44; P < .01). By landmark analysis at 12 months, survival within each cytogenetic response category was similar with imatinib mesylate or interferon-alpha, suggesting that the survival benefit of imatinib mesylate (versus interferon-alpha in newly diagnosed CML) is through improving cytogenetic response.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,20060518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 18.,"The introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM) has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although experience is too limited to permit evidence-based evaluation of survival, the available data fully justify critical reassessment of CML management. The panel therefore reviewed treatment of CML since 1998. It confirmed the value of IM (400 mg/day) and of conventional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). It recommended that the preferred initial treatment for most patients newly diagnosed in chronic phase should now be 400 mg IM daily. A dose increase of IM, alloHSCT, or investigational treatments were recommended in case of failure, and could be considered in case of suboptimal response. Failure was defined at 3 months (no hematologic response [HR]), 6 months (incomplete HR or no cytogenetic response [CgR]), 12 months (less than partial CgR [Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) > 35%]), 18 months (less than complete CgR), and in case of HR or CgR loss, or appearance of highly IM-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. Suboptimal response was defined at 3 months (incomplete HR), 6 months (less than partial CgR), 12 months (less than complete CgR), 18 months (less than major molecular response [MMolR]), and, in case of MMolR loss, other mutations or other chromosomal abnormalities.

Recently, high expression of a gene named OPAL1 (outcome predictor in acute leukemia) was reported to be associated with favorable prognosis in ALL. Therefore, we investigated whether OPAL1 expression was of prognostic importance in 2 independent cohorts of children with ALL treated on Cooperative Study Group for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (COALL)-92/97 (n = 180) and St Jude Total 13 protocols (n = 257). We observed a consistently higher (2.8-fold) expression of OPAL1 in TEL-AML1-positive ALL compared with TEL-AML1-negative ALL in both cohorts, but higher OPAL1 expression was not consistently associated with other favorable prognostic indicators such as age and white blood cell count, or ALL genetic subtype. Lower OPAL1 expression was also not associated with increased in vitro drug resistance. Multivariate analyses including known risk factors showed that OPAL1 expression was not independently related to prognosis in either the COALL or St Jude cohorts. In conclusion, OPAL1 expression may not be an independent prognostic feature in childhood ALL, and its previously reported prognostic impact appears to be treatment dependent.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,20060518,,PMC1895531,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that in a murine model of RA, deletion of the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of VEGFR-1 decreased the incidence and clinical symptoms of RA. Pathological symptoms, such as synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltrates, pannus formation, and cartilage/bone destruction, became milder in Vegfr-1 tk(-/-) mice compared with wild-type (Wt) mice in the human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) pX-induced chronic models. VEGFR-1 TK-deficient bone marrow cells showed a suppression of multilineage colony formation. Furthermore, macrophages induced to differentiate in vitro showed a decrease in immunologic reactions such as phagocytosis and the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and VEGF-A. Treatment of this RA model with a small molecule inhibitor for VEGFR TK, KRN951, also attenuated the arthritis. These results indicate that the VEGFR-1 TK signaling modulates the proliferation of bone marrow hematopoietic cells and immunity of monocytes/macrophages and promotes chronic inflammation, which may be a new target in the treatment of RA.","['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",,,20060518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While packed with peptide, circulating cells contain no defensin-1 (def1) transcripts, except in some leukemia patients and in derivative promyelocytic leukemia cell lines. Expression is modulated by serum factors, mediators of inflammation, and kinase activators and inhibitors, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. A minimal def1 promoter drives transcription in HL-60 cells under control of PU.1 and a def1-binding protein (""D1BP""), acting through, respectively, proximal (-22/-19) and distal (-62/-59) GGAA elements. In this study, we identify D1BP, biochemically and functionally, as GA-binding protein (GABP)alpha/GABPbeta. Whereas GABP operates as an essential upstream activator, PU.1 assists the flanking ""TTTAAA"" element (-32/-27), a ""weak"" but essential TATA box, to bring TBP/TFIID to the transcription start site. PU.1 thus imparts a degree of cell specificity to the minimal promoter and provides a potential link between a number of signaling pathways and TFIID. However, a ""strong"" TATA box (""TATAAA"") eliminates the need for the PU.1 binding site and for PU.1, but not for GABP. As GABP is widely expressed, a strong TATA box thus alleviates promyelocytic cell specificity of the def1 promoter. These findings suggest how the myeloid def1 promoter may have evolutionarily acquired its current properties.","['0 (Defensins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,,['P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The v-Abl oncogene promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits pre-B cell differentiation. The temperature-sensitive form of Abelson murine leukemia virus offers a reversible model to study the role of v-Abl in regulating growth and differentiation. Inactivation of v-Abl elevates p27 and Foxo3a levels and activates NF-kappaB/Rel, which leads to G1 arrest and induction of Ig L chain gene rearrangement, respectively. In turn, v-Abl reactivation reduces p27 and Foxo3a levels, thus permitting G1-arrested cells to reenter the cell cycle. However, the cell lines derived from SCID mice that are defective in the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase retain elevated levels of p27 and Foxo3a proteins despite reactivation of v-Abl. Consequently, these cells are locked in the G1 phase for an extended period of time. The few cells that manage to bypass the G1 arrest become tumorigenic and fail to undergo pre-B cell differentiation induced by v-Abl inactivation. Deregulation of p27, Foxo3a, c-myc, and NF-kappaB/Rel was found to be associated with the malignant transformation of SCID temperature-sensitive form of Abelson murine leukemia virus pre-B cells.","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)']",,,,['CA73857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all patients at the time of relapse bone marrow showed complete remission with complete donor hematopoiesis. They all received total body irradiation with partial shielding of the kidneys as part of their conditioning therapy, such that renal shielding could be an explanation for the observed accumulation of renal relapses. Moreover, during the past few years so called immune privilege has been postulated for frequent relapse sites such as the CNS, the testicles and the anterior chamber of the eye. Impaired accessability of these organs by cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) with a reduced graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect after alloHSCT is based on a number of different molecular and cellular mechanisms.

We evaluated childhood acute leukemia and lymphoma in relation to duration of breast-feeding. METHODS: We investigated this issue in a case-control study comprising 137 patients, aged 1 to 16 years, with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in addition to 146 controls matched for age and sex. RESULTS: The median duration of breast-feeding among patients was shorter than that of controls (10 vs 12 months). Patients with ALL and AML had shorter mean breast-feeding duration compared with healthy children (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The shortest mean breast-feeding duration was noted in the children with AML. Breast-feeding for a duration of 0 to 6 months, when compared with feeding of longer than 6 months, was associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) for ALL [OR = 2.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-5.10], AML (OR = 6.67, 95% CI = 1.32-33.69), Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 0.60-18.54), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 0.68-5.34) and overall (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.51-4.26).

Recent reports suggested that treatment of ALL with 6-thioguanine can lead to chronic hepatotoxicity and portal hypertension. We describe our experience from 2 UK centres of chronic hepatotoxicity in children receiving maintenance 6-thioguanine for ALL in the national leukaemia protocol ALL 97/99. METHODS: Retrospective review of children who were referred with liver disease secondary to 6-thioguanine treatment of ALL was performed. A paediatric pathologist blinded to the clinical features reviewed liver histology slides. RESULTS: Ten of 75 children (13%) treated with 6-thioguanine in both centres were referred at a median of 6 months (range, 2-29) after discontinuation of chemotherapy. In 8 cases, referral was due to persistent thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. Two children presented with acute variceal bleeding. All had thrombocytopenia at referral, and ultrasonography showed coarse hepatic echo texture and splenomegaly in all. Endoscopy showed oesophageal varices in 7 and gastric varices in 1. Nine underwent liver biopsy that showed features compatible with nodular regenerative hyperplasia in 5 cases. After a median follow-up of 36 months, a further child has had a variceal haemorrhage and all but 2 children remain thrombocytopenic. CONCLUSIONS: 6-Thioguanine-induced chronic hepatotoxicity is a significant complication in children treated with this agent for ALL. Children may present several months to years after discontinuation of 6-thioguanine. All children given maintenance treatment of ALL with this agent should be screened, and affected children require long-term surveillance.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, due to its role in oncogenic transformation, PRAME-negative tumor cells are not expected to easily arise and escape from T-cell immunity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of PRAME as target for anticancer T-cell therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HLA-A*0201-subtyped healthy individuals and advanced melanoma patients were screened for CD8+ T cells directed against previously identified HLA-A*0201-binding PRAME peptides by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays and tetramer staining. PRAME-specific T-cell clones were isolated and tested for recognition of melanoma and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) cell lines. PRAME mRNA expression was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: In 30% to 40% of healthy individuals and patients, PRA(100-108)-specific CD8+ T cells were detected both after in vitro stimulation and directly ex vivo after isolation by magnetic microbeads. Although CD45RA- memory PRA(100-108)-specific T cells were found in some individuals, the majority of PRA(100-108)-tetramer+ T cells expressed CD45RA, suggesting a naive phenotype. PRA(100-108)-tetramer+ T-cell clones were shown to recognize and lyse HLA-A*0201+ and PRAME+ melanoma but not ALL cell lines. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed significantly lower PRAME mRNA levels in ALL than in melanoma cell lines, suggesting that PRAME expression in ALL is below the recognition threshold of our PRA(100-108)-tetramer+ T cells.

To gain insight into its clinical significance, NOTCH1 mutation was investigated in 77 patients with T-ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Detection of NOTCH1 mutation was done using reverse transcription-PCR amplification and direct sequencing, and thereby compared according to the clinical/biological data of the patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two mutations were identified in 29 patients (with dual mutations in 3 cases), involving not only the heterodimerization and proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine domains as previously reported but also the transcription activation and ankyrin repeat domains revealed for the first time. These mutations were significantly associated with elevated WBC count at diagnosis and independently linked to short survival time. Interestingly, the statistically significant difference of survival according to NOTCH1 mutations was only observed in adult patients (>18 years) but not in pediatric patients (< or = 18 years), possibly due to the relatively good overall response of childhood T-ALL to the current chemotherapy. NOTCH1 mutations could coexist with HOX11, HOX11L2, or SIL-TAL1 expression. The negative effect of NOTCH1 mutation on prognosis was potentiated by HOX11L2 but was attenuated by HOX11.

CCgR is durable in the majority of patients but relapse occurs in a subset. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To determine the potential of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of BCR-ABL to predict cytogenetic relapse, we serially monitored residual disease in 97 CML patients with an imatinib-induced CCgR. Patients with late chronic phase CML after IFN-alpha failure were treated with imatinib (400 mg daily). RESULTS: During the imatinib median follow-up time of 36 months (range, 12-54 months), disease monitoring occurred by cytogenetics and quantitative PCR. Twenty percent of patients experienced cytogenetic relapse at a median of 18 months after CCgR and a median of 24 months after starting imatinib. None of the possible prognostic factors studied in univariate and multivariate analyses seemed to predict for loss of cytogenetic response but the reduction of BCR-ABL transcript levels at the time of CCgR is an important prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we showed not only that achieving a major molecular remission at 12 months is predictive of a durable cytogenetic remission but also that patients who achieved a major molecular remission (expressed both as the BCR-ABL/beta2 microglobulin ratio % <0.0005 and as a 3-log reduction from median baseline value) already at the time of first achieving a CCgR have significantly longer cytogenetic remission durations than those without this magnitude of molecular response (P < 0.05).","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,['GIMEMA Working Party on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia'],,,,,,,

However, the incidence and type of MLL rearrangements have not been determined in common ALL (cALL) and CD10+ or CD10- pre-B ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To address this question, we analyzed 29 patients with pro-B ALL, 11 patients with CD10- pre-B ALL, 23 pre-B, and 26 cALL patients with CD10 on 20% to 80%, as well as 136 pre-B and 143 cALL patients with CD10 > or = 80% of blasts. They were all enrolled in four Austrian ALL multicenter trials. Conventional cytogenetics were done to detect 11q23 abnormalities and in parallel the potential involvement of the MLL gene was evaluated with a split apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe set. RESULTS: We found that 15 of 29 pro-B ALL, 7 of 11 CD10- pre-B ALL, and 1 of 2 French-American-British classification L1 mature B-cell leukemia cases had a MLL rearrangement. However, no 11q23/MLL translocation was identified among the CD10+ pre-B and cALL patients. MLL-rearranged pro-B and CD10- pre-B ALL cases had similar clinical and immunophenotypic (coexpression of CDw65 and CD15) features at initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The striking similarities between the two CD10- ALL subsets imply that CD10- pre-B ALL variants may represent pro-B ALL cases that maintained the propensity to rearrange and express their immunoglobulin heavy chain rather than actual pre-B ALL forms transformed at this later stage of B-cell differentiation. However, direct experimental data are needed to confirm this observation.","['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study this, we examined DNA methylation in patients with leukemia treated with decitabine. Five days after the treatment, total genomic 5-methylcytosine/cytosine decreased on average by 14% (from 4.3% to 3.7%), whereas methylation of repetitive DNA elements showed a mean decrease of 9% and 16% for Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements, respectively. Methylation decreased linearly with increasing doses between 5 and 20 mg/m(2)/d (r = 0.88; P = 0.05) but showed a plateau above that. Hypomethylation correlated with response in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia treated with low doses (5-20 mg/m(2)/d), but patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with high doses (100-180 mg/m(2)/d) showed no such correlation. Aberrant methylation of p15 (>10%) was found in 27% of patients, and 80% of these showed a decrease by at least one third, but this did not correlate with response. The imprinted gene H19 showed little change in methylation after decitabine. In conclusion, we show dose-dependent hypomethylation after decitabine at low doses. Increasing the dose, which has been shown previously to result in a reduced response rate, was not accompanied by further hypomethylation.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (H19 long non-coding RNA)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For minor histocompatibility antigens HA-1 and HA-2, normal cell expression is restricted to hemopoietic cells, and boosting the immune response to these antigens may potentiate graft-versus-leukemia effect without accompanying graft-versus-host disease. To increase efficacy, expansion of HA-1- or HA-2-specific CTL before transplantation is desirable. However, primary HA-1- or HA-2-specific CTL expanded in vitro are often of low avidity. An alternative approach is to prime specific CTL responses in vivo by vaccination. Clearly, donor vaccination must be safe and specific. We have developed DNA fusion vaccines able to induce high levels of epitope-specific CTL using linked CD4(+) T-cell help. The vaccines incorporate a domain of tetanus toxin (DOM) fused to a sequence encoding a candidate MHC class I binding peptide. This design generates antitumor CD8(+) T-cell responses and protective immunity in preclinical models. For clinical application, we constructed vaccines encoding HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides from human HA-1 and HA-2, which were fused to DOM, and tested their performance in HLA-A*0201-transgenic mice. Priming induced epitope-specific, IFNgamma-producing CD8(+) T cells with cytotoxic function boosted to high levels with electroporation. Strikingly, these mouse T cells efficiently killed human lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing endogenous HA-1 or HA-2. High avidity is indicated by the independence of cytolysis from CD8/MHC class I interaction. These safe epitope-specific vaccines offer a potential strategy to prime HA-1- or HA-2-specific CTL in transplant donors before adoptive transfer.","['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tetanus Toxin)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib is currently standard for chronic myelogenous leukemia, which is also caused by Bcr/Abl. However, Imatinib has shown limited efficacy for treating Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In our study, we have investigated the effect of Imatinib therapy on murine P190 Bcr/Abl lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Three of four cultures were very sensitive to treatment with 5 mumol/L Imatinib. Significant cell death also initially occurred when the same cultures were treated in the presence of stromal support. However, after 6 days, remaining cells started to proliferate vigorously. The Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase present in the cells that were now able to multiply in the presence of 5 mumol/L Imatinib was still inhibited by the drug. In concordance with this, the Abl ATP-binding pocket domain of Bcr/Abl in the resistant cells did not contain point mutations which would make the protein Imatinib resistant. The effect of stroma in selecting Imatinib-resistant lymphoblasts did not require direct cell-cell contact. SDF-1alpha could substitute for the presence of stromal cells. Our results show that stroma selects Imatinib-resistant Bcr/Abl P190 lymphoblasts that are less dependent on Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Therefore, therapy for Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, aimed at interfering with the protective effect of stroma in combination with Imatinib, could be of benefit for the eradication of the leukemic cells.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,['CA 90321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a screen for hypermethylated CpG islands in cancer, bidirectional promoters constituted 25.2% of all identified promoters, which matches with the genomic representation of bidirectional promoters. From the screen, we selected three bidirectional gene pairs for detailed analysis, WNT9A/CD558500, CTDSPL/BC040563, and KCNK15/BF195580. Levels of mRNA of all three pairs of genes were inversely correlated with the degree of promoter methylation in multiple cancer cell lines. Hypomethylation of these promoters induced by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment reactivated or enhanced gene expression bidirectionally. The bidirectional nature of the WNT9A/CD558500 promoter was confirmed by luciferase assays, and hypermethylation down-regulated expression of both genes in the pair. Methylation of WNT9A/CD558500 and CTDSPL/BC040563 promoters occurs frequently in primary colon cancers and acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL), respectively, and methylation was correlated with decreased gene expression in ALL patient samples.

Trifluoperazine (TFP), a phenothiazine derivative antipsychotics, is known to reverse MDR of tumor cell lines by blocking P-gp efflux function. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of TFP on the expression of P-gp in multidrug-resistant L1210/Adr mouse leukemic cell lines, which are characterized by overexpession of P-gp. We found that TFP induced the downregulation of P-gp protein and mdr1b mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner in L1210/Adr cells. TFP reduction of mdr1b mRNA was paralleled by transcriptional suppression of the mdr1b promoter. Moreover, TFP restored the adriamycin-induced apoptosis in L1210/Adr cells. These results suggest that TFP may have utility as an adjuvant in the therapy of leukemia for the reversal of P-gp-dependent MDR as well as for the management of psychological symptoms in the cancer patients.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antipsychotic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (P-glycoprotein 2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Parp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",,,20060317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DOI for the various products is determined by antibody titers for all dogs and, by challenge studies in selected groups of dogs. Recently, all major companies that make canine vaccines for the U.S. market have completed their own studies; published data show a 3 years or longer minimum DOI for the canine core products, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), and canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2). Studies with feline core vaccines - feline parvovirus (FPV), calicivirus (FCV) and herpes virus type I (FHV-1) have shown a minimum DOI of greater than 3 years. Based on these results, the current canine and feline guidelines (which recommend that the last dose of core vaccines be given to puppies and kittens > or =12 weeks of age or older, then revaccination again at 1 year, then not more often than every 3 years) should provide a level of protection equal to that achieved by annual revaccination. In contrast, the non-core canine and feline vaccines, perhaps with the exception of feline leukaemia vaccines, provide immunity for < or =1 year. In general the effectiveness of the non-core products is less than the core products.

Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can be maintained and self-renew on mouse feeder cell layers or in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, the effects of wnts on ES cells self-renewal and differentiation are not clearly understood. In the present study, we found that conditioned medium prepared from L cells expressing wnt3a can replace feeder cell layers and medium containing LIF in maintaining ES cells in the proliferation without differentiation (self-renewal) state. By contrast, conditioned medium from NIH3T3 cells expressing wnt11 did not. Alkaline phosphatase staining and compact colony formation were used as criteria of cells being in the undifferentiated state. ES cells maintained in medium conditioned by Wnt3a expressing cells underwent freezing and thawing while maintaining properties seen with LIF maintained ES cells. Purified wnt3a did not maintain self-renewal of ES cells for prolonged intervals. Thus, other factors in the medium conditioned by wnt3a expressing cells may have contributed to maintenance of ES cells in a self-renewal state. Pluripotency of ES cells was determined with the use of embryoid bodies in vitro. PD98059, a MEK specific inhibitor, promoted the growth of undifferentiated ES cells maintained in conditioned medium from wnt3a expressing cells. By contrast, the P38 MAPK inhibitor SB230580 did not, suggesting a role for the MEK pathway in self-renewal and differentiation of ES cells maintained in the wnt3a cell conditioned medium. Thus, our results show that conditioned medium from wnt3a but not wnt11 expressing cells can maintain ES cells in self-renewal and in a pluripotent state.","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (Wnt3a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",,,20060502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigated the molecular regulatory mechanisms directing FPGS gene expression in Bp-ALL and T-ALL cells. METHODS: To determine FPGS transcription rate in Bp-ALL and T-ALL we used nuclear run-on assays. 5'-RACE was used to uncover potential regulatory regions involved in the lineage differences. We developed a luciferase reporter gene assay to investigate FPGS promoter/enhancer activity. To further characterize the FPGS proximal promoter, we determined the role of the putative transcription binding sites NFY and E-box on FPGS expression using luciferase reporter gene assays with substitution mutants and EMSA. RESULTS: FPGS transcription initiation rate was 1.6-fold higher in NALM6 vs. CCRF-CEM cells indicating that differences in transcription rate led to the observed lineage differences in FPGS expression between Bp-ALL and T-ALL blasts. Two major transcripts encoding the mitochondrial/cytosolic and cytosolic isoforms were detected in Bp-ALL (NALM6 and REH) whereas in T-ALL (CCRF-CEM) cells only the mitochondrial/cytosolic transcript was detected. In all DNA fragments examined for promoter/enhancer activity, we measured significantly lower luciferase activity in NALM6 vs. CCRF-CEM cells, suggesting the need for additional yet unidentified regulatory elements in Bp-ALL. Finally, we determined that the putative transcription factor binding site NFY, but not E-box, plays a role in FPGS transcription in both Bp- and T-lineage. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the minimal FPGS promoter region previously described in CCRF-CEM is not sufficient to effectively drive FPGS transcription in NALM6 cells, suggesting that different regulatory elements are required for FPGS gene expression in Bp-cells. Our data indicate that the control of FPGS expression in human hematopoietic cells is complex and involves lineage-specific differences in regulatory elements, transcription initiation rates, and mRNA processing.

However, the interaction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) plays an important role in the adhesion and migration of normal leukocytes and AML cells. Therefore, effects of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 were studied in hyperleukocytic AML. The adhesion of hyperleukocytic AML blasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was significantly increased compared with that of blasts from non-hyperleukocytic AML (WBC < 100 x 10(9)/l). The adhesion of normal neutrophils and HUVECs treated with hyperleukocytic AML blast supernatant was increased significantly. Finally, we determined the ICAM-1 on the surface of HUVECs treated with the supernatant of hyperleukocytic AML blasts and LFA-1 on hyperleukocytic AML blasts by flow cytometry. It showed that the ICAM-1 expression on the surface of the HUVECs treated with hyperleukocytic AML blast supernatant for 24 h could be increased, and the expression of LFA-1 on hyperleukocytic AML was also increased significantly. Our data show that hyperleukocytic AML blasts stimulate the endothelium to secrete more ICAM-1 and promote their own adhesion to vascular endothelium, suggesting that ICAM-1 and LFA-1 may have a role in hyperleukocytic AML.","['0 (CD11a Antigen)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the developing world where there are significant resource constraints, how does the physician manage leukemia? Government health budgets need to put their money into areas where a small investment is likely to benefit a large proportion of its people and these would include immunization, sanitation, family planning and treatment of communicable diseases and the cost of expensive treatments would have to be borne by the patient and family. However, in many of the emerging economies in the developing world, society is three-tiered in terms of resources with a small proportion being able to afford the best treatment, the middle class with the ability to meet a significant proportion of the healthcare costs on their own and the poor who depend wholly on what the Government health budget can afford. Providing an accurate diagnosis is possible even with limited resources and this must be made available to all. Sometimes a precise diagnosis even at the molecular level is more important in the developing world so that resources are not wasted on inappropriate treatments. Choosing a protocol for management based on resources available for the individual patient would appear ethically unacceptable, but is probably the only solution when wealth is unevenly distributed in society.

However, the genetic and epigenetic events of hepatocarcinogenesis are relatively poorly understood. HCC display gross genomic alterations, including chromosomal instability (CIN), CpG island methylation, DNA rearrangements associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integration, DNA hypomethylation and, to a lesser degree, microsatellite instability. Various studies have reported CIN at chromosomal regions, 1p, 4q, 5q, 6q, 8p, 10q, 11p, 16p, 16q, 17p and 22q. Frequent promoter hypermethylation and subsequent loss of protein expression has also been demonstrated in HCC at tumor suppressor gene (TSG), p16, p14, p15, SOCS1, RIZ1, E-cadherin and 14-3-3 sigma. An interesting observation emerging from these studies is the presence of a methylator phenotype in hepatocarcinogenesis, although it does not seem advantageous to have high levels of microsatellite instability. Methylation also appears to be an early event, suggesting that this may precede cirrhosis. However, these genes have been studied in isolation and global studies of methylator phenotype are required to assess the significance of epigenetic silencing in hepatocarcinogenesis. Based on previous data there are obvious fundamental differences in the mechanisms of hepatic carcinogenesis, with at least two distinct mechanisms of malignant transformation in the liver, related to CIN and CpG island methylation. The reason for these differences and the relative importance of these mechanisms are not clear but likely relate to the etiopathogenesis of HCC. Defining these broad mechanisms is a necessary prelude to determine the timing of events in malignant transformation of the liver and to investigate the role of known risk factors for HCC.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Likewise, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), rituximab in combination with chemotherapy appeared more effective than chemotherapy alone as either first- or second-line treatment. In addition, rituximab maintenance therapy was shown to significantly prolong tumour remission and patient survival in patients with indolent B-cell NHL or CLL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have performed a retrospective analysis of the patients who were examined in the University Eye Clinic in Mainz complaining of visual loss associated with systemic interferon therapy in the time span between January 2001 and December 2003. RESULTS: 12 patients (age 35 - 67 years), undergoing treatment with interferon alpha for hepatitis C, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma of the skin, complained of blurred vision 2 - 10 weeks after the start of interferon therapy. Fundus examination revealed retinal haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots in all eyes. Additionally in some eyes macular edema, retinal arteriolar occlusion or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was seen. As underlying risk factors we found diabetes mellitus (6 x) and systemic hypertension (3 x). After interruption (10 x) or dose reduction (2 x) of interferon therapy in all eyes the ischemic changes disappeared rapidly. Permanent visual loss or visual field defects remained in 3 out of 24 eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients under interferon therapy should be monitored closely by an ophthalmologist, especially those with systemic vascular risk factors.

Epub 2006 Apr 26.,"Selenium at a low concentration has a chemopreventive role against cancer, while at a high concentration, it exerts a direct antitumor effect. However, the mechanisms remain elusive. In this article, we discovered that Na(2)SeO(3) at 20 micromol/l concentration could significantly inhibit the proliferation of NB4 cells, affect the cell cycle distribution of cell population, and induce cellular changes characteristic of apoptotic cells, while this same compound at 2 micromol/l concentration had no such effects. The mechanisms underlying these overt differences caused by treatment of different concentrations of selenium were further investigated. cDNA microarray analysis showed that after treatment by 20 micromol/l Na(2)SeO(3), 34 genes were changed in expression, while treatment by 2 micromol/l Na(2)SeO(3) resulted in the changes of 29 genes. Nine genes were regulated in both groups, among which three showed opposite changes caused by 2 and 20 micromol/l Na(2)SeO(3). The majority of regulated genes did not coincide between the two experiment groups. In conclusion, 2 and 20 micromol/l Na(2)SeO(3) could have different effects on NB4 cells, and some genes might be involved in the underlying mechanisms. Our findings could provide basis for further uncovering the molecular mechanisms of the chemopreventive and antitumor effects of selenium and, in turn, for probing the rationality of treating leukemia with selenium.","['0 (DNA Primers)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",,,20060426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors therefore set out to analyse previous diagnosis of epilepsy as a risk factor for certain cancer forms in a case control study. METHODS: Incident cases of leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and pancreatic cancer were identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry 1987-99, a total of 52 861 cases. Controls (n = 137 485) were randomly selected from the Swedish Population Registry stratified on age, sex, and year of cancer diagnosis. Cases and controls were linked to the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry for 1969-99 to identify individuals with first time hospital discharge for epilepsy. RESULTS: While an epilepsy diagnosis the same year as a cancer diagnosis carried an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.41), Hodgkin's disease (OR = 4.77, 95% CI 1.77 to 13.30), leukaemia (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.50 to 4.32), acute myeloid leukaemia (OR = 3.65, 95% CI 1.68 to 7.93), and pancreatic cancer (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.45), the authors found no support for an association between discharge with a diagnosis of epilepsy two years or more before the diagnosis of cancer and an increased risk of any of the types of cancer included in this analysis. The lack of association was also evident for individuals with an epilepsy diagnosis preceding malignancy/reference year by >10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical examinations prompted by seizure onset probably mainly explain the observed association between epilepsy diagnoses the year before a cancer diagnosis. However, these results lend no support to the suggestion that epilepsy, and presumably long term exposure to antiepileptic drugs, is associated with an increased risk of the types of cancer included in the present study.",['0 (Anticonvulsants)'],,,,,PMC2077448,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the expression of Ad4BP/SF-1 is specific for those tissues, the mechanisms underlying this tissue-specific expression remain unknown. In this study, we used transgenic mouse assays to examine the regulation of the tissue-specific expression of Ad4BP/SF-1. An investigation of the entire Ad4BP/SF-1 gene locus revealed a fetal adrenal enhancer (FAdE) in intron 4 containing highly conserved binding sites for Pbx-Prep, Pbx-Hox, and Ad4BP/SF-1. Transgenic assays revealed that the Ad4 sites, together with Ad4BP/SF-1, develop an autoregulatory loop and thereby maintain transcription, while the Pbx/Prep and Pbx/Hox sites initiate transcription prior to the establishment of the autoregulatory loop. Indeed, a limited number of Hox family members were found to be expressed in the adrenal primordia. Whether a true fetal-type adrenal cortex is present in mice remained controversial, and this argument was complicated by the postnatal development of the so-called X zone. Using transgenic mice with lacZ driven by the FAdE, we clearly identified a fetal adrenal cortex in mice, and the X zone is the fetal adrenal cells accumulated at the juxtamedullary region after birth.","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Steroidogenic Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,PMC1489093,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The in vivo expression of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines in the periimplantation endometrium of infertile patients was compared between natural and stimulated cycles. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uterine flushings and endometrial biopsies were collected 7 d after the LH surge in natural cycles or after human chorionic gonadotropin injection in stimulated cycles. Th2 cytokines were determined by immunolocalization and by ELISA. Natural cycles were in group A, whereas stimulated cycles with peak serum E2 of no more than 20,000 pmol/liter (moderate responders) and more than 20,000 pmol/liter (excessive responders) were classified as group B and group C, respectively. RESULTS: Higher E2 had a negative effect on IL-11 and IL-6 expression in the endometrium and IL-11 concentration in the uterine flushing. In endometrial biopsies, a significantly lower immunostaining of stromal IL-11 (P < 0.001) and glandular IL-6 (P < 0.05) was detected in group C compared with that of groups A and B. IL-11 concentration by ELISA was significantly lower in group C (P < 0.05). Endometrial leukemia inhibitory factor and IL-4 expression was similar in the three groups. In uterine flushings, a significantly higher percentage of women in group C had undetectable IL-11 and a lower IL-11 concentration (P < 0.01) compared with group A, whereas no difference in IL-6 concentration was noted in the three groups. CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of IL-11 and IL-6 in periimplantation endometrium may account for lower implantation in excessive responders.","['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",,,20060516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCRP over-expression did not influence the achievement of remission, but significantly affected the duration of complete remissions.

Epub 2006 May 15.,"BACKGROUND: Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a distinct histopathologic lesion that occurs in a variety of clinical contexts. There have been occasional reports of OP occurring in patients with hematologic malignancies. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of OP with hematologic malignancies and to assess the clinical course of affected patients. DESIGN: A retrospective review of our institutional experience of unexplained OP developing in patients with hematologic malignancies. SETTING: Tertiary care, referral medical center. PATIENTS: We identified 6 patients with a verified histopathologic diagnosis of OP and antecedent or concomitant diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy from the Mayo Clinic database (1995-2003). Clinical, radiologic, and outcome data were abstracted from records. RESULTS: Underlying hematologic disorders included lymphoma (2), acute leukemia (2), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (1), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1). OP was diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy in 4 and bronchoscopic biopsy in 2. Four of the 6 patients had previously been exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, two had not. Three of the 6 patients had bone marrow transplantation prior to development of OP. Five patients were treated with prednisone and all experienced symptomatic improvement with documented radiologic resolution in 4. One patient experienced symptomatic and radiologic resolution with observation alone. Three patients ultimately died from complications of their underlying hematologic disorder and 1 patient died of unknown causes. Two patients were alive without respiratory complaints more than 1 year after lung biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: OP occurs in patients with underlying hematologic malignancies who may or may not have been treated with chemotherapy and responds favorably to corticosteroid therapy.","['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,20060515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, optimal postremission therapy is a matter of vital concern. In particular, the clinical efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be clarified. METHODS: Rigorous criteria were used to select 7 studies of adult ALL that prospectively assessed overall survival (OS) using natural randomization based on donor availability combined with intention-to-treat analyses. The authors then performed a metaanalysis to evaluate the role of allogeneic HSCT. RESULTS: Seven studies that included 1274 patients were selected. A metaanalysis demonstrated that patients in the donor groups had significantly better survival than patients in the no-donor groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02-1.63 [P = .037]). When only high-risk patients were included in the analysis, the superiority of the survival advantage was even greater (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06-1.90 [P = .019]). A meta-regression analysis revealed that compliance with allogeneic HSCT showed a significant and positive correlation with survival (coefficient, 0.022; P < .01), suggesting that the greater the proportion of patients who actually received allogeneic HSCT, the better the survival of the donor group. No beneficial effects of autologous HSCT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrated that allogeneic HSCT improves the outcome of adult patients with high-risk ALL. Although these analyses were based on abstracted data, the results indicated that allogeneic HSCT should be considered for such patients if a suitable donor is available.",,,,,,,,,,['Cancer. 2007 Jan 15;109(2):343; author reply 344.

However, genomic panhandle PCR approaches are impeded when the restriction fragment that contains the breakpoint junction is too large to amplify. We devised new panhandle PCR approaches for MLL genomic breakpoint junctions that create the template from BglII restriction fragments by attaching MLL sequence to a BglII site in the partner gene. This leads to the annealing of MLL and its complement in the handle and creates an intrastrand loop containing the breakpoint junction sequence for amplification with primers all from MLL. BglII panhandle PCR for der(11) breakpoint junctions was accomplished by ligating a phosphorylated oligonucleotide containing a BglII overhang and sequence complementary to MLL exon 7 to the 3' ends of BglII digested DNA, and forming the template from the sense strand of DNA. In BglII reverse panhandle PCR for der(other) breakpoint junctions, a phosphorylated oligonucleotide containing a BglII overhang and the complement of antisense sequence in MLL exon 10 was ligated to the 3' ends of BglII digested DNA, and the template was formed from the antisense strand of DNA. These approaches amplified 5'-MLL-MLLT4-3' and 5'-AFF1-MLL-3' breakpoint junctions. The former is significant because few t(6;11) genomic breakpoint junctions have been sequenced.

Thus, incubation at room temperature (RT) has been shown to induce apoptosis in hematopoietic cells, including Jurkat T leukemia cells. To further understand the apoptotic events that can be activated at RT, we compared the induction of apoptosis by several apoptotic insults in Jurkat cells stimulated at 37 degrees C or RT. Retinoid-related molecules, which induce apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway, failed to induce apoptosis when cells were treated at RT, as determined by various apoptotic parameters including cytochrome c release and activation of caspase 3. In contrast, most apoptotic events were enhanced by lower temperatures when cells were stimulated with anti-Fas antibody via the extrinsic pathway. Ultraviolet radiation produced partial effects at RT, correlating with its capacity to activate both pathways. Our results indicate that the core caspase machinery is operational under mild hypothermia conditions. Experiments using purified recombinant caspases and cell-free assays confirmed that caspases are fully functional at RT. Other hallmark events of apoptosis, such as phosphatidylserine externalization and formation of apoptotic bodies were variably affected by RT in a stimulus-dependent manner, suggesting the existence of critical steps that are sensitive to temperature. Thus, analysis of apoptosis at RT might be useful to (i) discriminate between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in Jurkat cells treated with prospective stimuli, and (ii) to unravel temperature-sensitive steps of apoptotic signaling cascades.","['0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,"['CA 55681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 75033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 15.,"Indirubin, an isomer of indigo, is a reported inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as well as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Indirubin is the active ingredient of a traditional Chinese medicinal recipe used against chronic myelocytic leukemia. Numerous indirubin analogs have been synthesized to optimize this promising kinase inhibitor scaffold. We report here on the cellular effects of 7-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (7BIO). In contrast to its 5-bromo- and 6-bromo- isomers, and to indirubin-3'-oxime, 7BIO has only a marginal inhibitory activity towards CDKs and GSK-3. Unexpectedly, 7BIO triggers a rapid cell death process distinct from apoptosis. 7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime induces the appearance of large pycnotic nuclei, without classical features of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. 7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime-induced cell death is not accompanied by cytochrome c release neither by any measurable effector caspase activation. Furthermore, the death process is not altered either by the presence of Q-VD-OPh, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, or the overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. Neither AhR nor p53 is required during 7BIO-induced cell death. Thus, in contrast to previously described indirubins, 7BIO triggers the activation of non-apoptotic cell death, possibly through necroptosis or autophagy. Although their molecular targets remain to be identified, 7-substituted indirubins may constitute a new class of potential antitumor compounds that would retain their activity in cells refractory to apoptosis.","[""0 (7-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime)"", '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (quinoline-val-asp(OMe)-CH2-OPH)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,20060515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 15.,"Current therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is suboptimal with a high incidence of relapse. There is strong evidence that constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of AML. PI3K products are derived from the activity of a number of PI3K catalytic isoforms (class I, II and III) but the relative contribution of these enzymes in AML remains unknown. As non-isoform-selective inhibitors of PI3K such as LY294002 may produce unwanted toxicity to normal tissues, we have investigated the role of the leukocyte-restricted p110delta PI3K isoform in 14 cases of AML. p110delta was detected in all cases whereas the expression levels of the other class I PI3Ks varied more widely, and were often undetectable. The p110delta-selective compound IC87114 inhibited constitutive phosphorylation of the PI3K target Akt/PKB and reduced cell number to a mean of 66+/-5% (range 14-88%). In eight cases, the combination of IC87114 and VP16 (a topoisomerase II inhibitor) was synergistic in reducing viable cell number, and was associated with a reduction in constitutive NF-kappaB activity. IC87114 did not have direct adverse effects or enhance the activity of VP16 on the proliferation and survival of normal haemopoietic progenitors. Overall, our results identify the p110delta isoform as a potential therapeutic target in AML and support a clinical approach to use isoform-selective over broad-spectrum PI3K inhibitors.","['0 (IC 87114)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,20060515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 15.,"Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated protein which is localized in either the cell membrane or nucleus depending on its palmitoylated state. The increasing evidence showed the biological roles of PLSCR1 in cell signaling, maturation and apoptosis. To investigate the functions of PLSCR1 in leukemic cells, we generated an inducible PLSCR1-expressing cell line using myeloid leukemic U937 cells. In this cell line, PLSCR1 was tightly regulated and induced upon tetracycline withdrawal. Our results showed that inducible PLSCR1 expression arrested the proliferation of U937 cells at G1 phase. Meanwhile, PLSCR1-overexpressing U937 cells also underwent granulocyte-like differentiation with increased sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we also found that PLSCR1 induction increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1) proteins, together with downregulation of S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), an F-box subunit of the ubiquitin-ligase complex that targets proteins for degradation. Additionally, PLSCR1 induction significantly decreased c-Myc protein and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Although the exact mechanism by which PLSCR1 regulates these cellular events and gene expression remains unresolved, our results suggest that PLSCR1 plays the antagonistic role regarding leukemia development. These data will shed new insights into understanding the biochemical and biological functions of PLSCR1 protein.","['0 (PLSCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,,20060515,"['HL036946/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL076215/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Oncogene. 2006 Nov 16;25(54):7224.

METHODS: Retrospective review of medical history and behavioral risk assessment questionnaire and microbiology data for potential corneal donors seropositive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-cell leukemia virus and syphilis as compared to controls. RESULTS: Tobacco use, cigarette smoking, chest pain and heart disease are each associated with corneal donor seropositivity (P < 0.05). Vaccination in the last twelve months is inversely associated with infectious disease (P < 0.05). Statistically significant factors associated with hepatitis C positive donors include: cigarette use, illicit drug use, chest pain, cardiac medications, kidney stones and lung disease (P < 0.05). Factors most often associated with transmission of this disease panel (such as intravenous drug use, sexual contact with prostitutes and history of blood transfusion) are often not identified by the next of kin in the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: While there are questionnaire identified risk factors associated with seropositivity in this study, their clinical usefulness is unclear. Many factors crucial to the elimination of potentially infectious donor tissues are not identified in the posthumous history typically completed by next of kin. These questionnaires alone do not provide exclusion criteria for elimination of potentially infectious tissues from the donor pool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lactamization of the D-steroidal ring afforded potent compounds, regardless of the configuration of the B-ring. The best among all derivatives contains both chemical modifications and is intended as a promising key molecule that must be further studied. We speculate that in leukemic cells a tumor-specific protein is overexpressed, the steroid has the ability to bind and block this protein from carrying out its normal function, and the drug-protein complex prevents the repair of the adducts.

Epub 2006 May 15.,"We have previously identified a unique subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with a poor outcome and characterized by intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 including the RUNX1 gene (iAMP21). In this study, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) (n = 10) detected a common region of amplification (CRA) between 33.192 and 39.796 Mb and a common region of deletion (CRD) between 43.7 and 47 Mb in 100% and 70% of iAMP21 patients, respectively. High-resolution genotypic analysis (n = 3) identified allelic imbalances in the CRA. Supervised gene expression analysis showed a distinct signature for eight patients with iAMP21, with 10% of overexpressed genes located within the CRA. The mean expression of these genes was significantly higher in iAMP21 when compared to other ALL samples (n = 45). Although genomic copy number correlated with overall gene expression levels within areas of loss or gain, there was considerable individual variation. A unique subset of differentially expressed genes, outside the CRA and CRD, were identified when gene expression signatures of iAMP21 were compared to ALL samples with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (n = 21) or high hyperdiploidy with additional chromosomes 21 (n = 23). From this analysis, LGMN was shown to be overexpressed in patients with iAMP21 (P = 0.0012). Genomic and expression data has further characterized this ALL subtype, demonstrating high levels of 21q instability in these patients leading to proposals for mechanisms underlying this clinical phenotype and plausible alternative treatments.",,,,20060515,"['14840/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A6438/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A6789/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC1472447,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MOZ acts as a transcriptional coactivator for AML1, which is essential for establishment of definitive hematopoiesis. To investigate the roles of MOZ in normal hematopoiesis, we generated MOZ-null mice. MOZ-/- mice died around embryonic day 15 (E15). In MOZ-/- E14.5 embryos, hematopoietic stem cells, lineage-committed progenitors, and B lineage cells were severely reduced. On the other hand, arrest of erythroid maturation and elevated myeloid lineage populations were observed. MOZ-deficient fetal liver cells could not reconstitute hematopoiesis of recipients after transplantation. Analysis using microarray and flow cytometry revealed that expression of thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl), HoxA9, and c-Kit was down-regulated. These results show that MOZ is required for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, and that it plays a role in differentiation of erythroid and myeloid cells. Some aspects of the MOZ-/- phenotype are similar to that observed in PU.1-deficient mice. MOZ was able to interact with PU.1 and activate PU.1-dependent transcription, thus suggesting a physical and functional link between PU.1 and MOZ.","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (MOZ protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,PMC1472906,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the most widely used and well-established modalities for treating malignant diseases. Surgery is used to excise solid tumours and radiotherapy/chemotherapy are used for the treatment of liquid tumours and for solid tumours where there is a risk of micrometastases. A major drawback for both radiotherapy and chemotherapy is their lack of specificity for tumour cells. Both these treatments can destroy normal bone marrow cells and result in severe side-effects. 2. The impairment of haemapoiesis due to bone marrow destruction combined with the use of toxins in chemotherapy that inhibit the proliferation of immune cells leaves many patients immunocompromised. This complicates the development of prophylactic (vaccine) strategies for tumours where patients are undergoing conventional therapy. 3. An alternative approach is to expand and activate tumour-specific immune cells in vitro that can then be adoptively transferred back in large numbers. This is defined as adoptive immunotherapy and has the advantage of potentially bypassing the immuno-inhibitory effects of conventional therapies. 4. Transferred immune cells have been shown to mediate tumour regression in patients by both direct and indirect mechanisms. The immune cells used include tumour reactive T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, which elicit tumour specific responses. 5. Many novel cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies developed in murine tumour models are now being applied in human clinical trials. The malignancies targeted include melanoma, chronic myelogenous leukaemia and breast, ovarian, colon and kidney cancers. In the present review, we discuss these novel cell-based strategies and the implications they have for the future treatment of human malignancies.",,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA interference (RNAi) is a robust method of post-transcriptional silencing of genes using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with sequence homology driven specificity. The dsRNA can be between 21 and 23 nucleotides long: this is converted to small interfering RNA (siRNA), which then mediates gene silencing by degradation/blocking of translation of the target mRNA. 2. RNA interference provides a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to existing gene targeting approaches both in vitro and in vivo. The discovery of siRNAs that cause RNAi in mammalian cells opened the door to the therapeutic use of siRNAs. Highly intense research efforts are now aimed at developing siRNAs for therapeutic purposes. 3. Recent advances in the design and delivery of targeting molecules now allow efficient and highly specific gene silencing in mammalian systems. Synthetic siRNA libraries targeting thousands of mammalian genes are publicly available for high-throughput genetic screens for target discovery and validation. Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical potential of aptly designed siRNAs in various types of viral infections, cancer and renal and neurodegenerative disorders. 4. The present review provides insight into the novel therapeutic strategies of siRNA technology, which is the latest development in nucleic acid-based tools for knocking down gene expression, and its potential for silencing genes associated with various human diseases.","['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SOD1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",84,,,['G0700794/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,"['Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2013 Apr;40(4):305.

We examined the database of the Indiana University Cancer Center to determine whether there is an association between malignant melanoma and noncutaneous malignancies. OBJECTIVE: We searched for evidence of noncutaneous malignancies in a cohort of melanoma patients. METHODS: Patients with microscopically confirmed malignant melanoma diagnosed between January 1987 and March 2001 were analyzed. This cohort was investigated for noncutaneous malignancies occurring either before or after the diagnosis of melanoma. The standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated as the ratio of the observed to the expected number of patients with second malignancies, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) around the SIR were estimated from the cumulative Poisson distribution. RESULTS: A total of 955 patients with melanoma (498 males and 457 females) were documented over the 14-year period. Sixty-nine noncutaneous malignancies were identified in 59 (6.2%) melanoma patients (39 males and 20 females). There was a higher risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 1.91; 95% CI, 0.88-3.62) in men and renal cell carcinoma (SIR = 2.41, 95% CI, 0.97-4.97) in men. In female patients, however, there was no higher risk of noncutaneous malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show a higher risk of prostate cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, leukemia, endometrial cancer, or cancer of the nerve and neuroendocrine systems in melanoma patients. No female patients incurred a higher risk of noncutaneous cancers. The increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma in men might be attributed to a mutual carcinogenic exposure, an aberration of cell-mediated immunity, a shared genetic susceptibility, increased medical surveillance among cancer patients, a post-therapy effect after cancer management, or factors not as yet clear. Close monitoring of melanoma patients for signs of second malignancy is warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, finding matched donors is challenging and recipients may suffer from the severe complications of systemic immune suppression. Sertoli cells, when cotransplanted with both allo- and xenograft tissues, promote graft acceptance in the absence of systemic immunosuppression. How Sertoli cells do this is not, as yet, clearly defined. We have examined the ability of Sertoli cells to produce systemic immune tolerance. For this purpose, Sertoli cells were injected into an otherwise normal C57/BL6 mouse host via the lateral tail vein. No other immunosuppressive protocols were applied. Six to 8 weeks posttransplantation, blood was collected for analysis of cytokine levels. Tolerance to donor cells was determined by mixed lymphocytic culture, and production of T-cell-dependent antibody was determined by an in vitro anti-sheep red blood cell plaque-forming assay. Results showed a marked modulation of immune cytokines in the transplanted mouse host and donor-specific transplantation tolerance was achieved. Tolerant mouse lymphocytes maintained a competent humoral antibody response. Additionally, C57/BL6 mice transplanted with rat Sertoli cells tolerated rat skin grafts significantly longer than control non-Sertoli cell transplanted mice. We conclude that systemic administration of rat Sertoli cells across xenogenic barrier induces transplantation tolerance without altering systemic immune competence. These data suggest that Sertoli cells may be used as a novel and potentially powerful tool in cell transplantation therapy.",['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further studied the effects of hIFN-gamma produced by transduced BMSCs on the proliferation of the human leukemia cell line K562 cells in vitro, proliferation of K562 cells was markedly inhibited in the experimental groups as compared with the other two control groups after 5 days of coculture. We also found that the percentage of K562 cells in the G(1) phase of cell cycle can be increased by treatment of hIFN-gamma produced by Ad/hIFN-gamma transduced BMSCs, but the percentage of K562 cells in the S phase of cell cycle can be decreased in the same time. Apoptosis rate of K562 cells in the experimental groups was 30.8 +/- 8.5%, as compared with the other two control groups (5.6 +/- 1.3% and 5.5 +/- 0.8%, respectively) (p < 0.01). Our results indicate that hIFN-gamma gene engineered BMSCs of CML donors could be successfully established and that local production of hIFN-gamma is sufficiently to inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and induce apoptosis of K562 cells in vitro, suggesting an important potential use in the clinical gene therapy of CML.","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Longitudinal analysis of the growth of 129 children, from a total of 351 cases diagnosed between 1987 and 1994 in Brazil, was determined. Height data were converted into standard deviation Z scores. Only girls younger than 10 and boys younger than 12 years old at diagnosis were included. Patients were treated according to a German BFM-83 based protocol. Fifty-eight children received 18 Gy cranial irradiation, four 12 Gy, and two 24 Gy. Patients were aggregated into five non-excluding groups according to availability of height data at diagnosis, during the treatment, at the end of it, and several years after; 35 children reached their final height. RESULTS: Height deficit at the end of the therapeutic treatment was evident (P < 0.0001). Catch-up occurred 1 year after stopping treatment (P = 0.016). At the last follow-up, over 5 years after the end of treatment (n = 83) or at final height (n = 35), impressive height deficits were recorded (P < 0.0001 for both end points). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that growth impairment was more severe in children younger than 4 years at diagnosis and in those who received cranial irradiation. No significant effect of gender was observed. Children who were treated solely with chemotherapy also had significant height loss. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ALL in children is associated with growth deficit during the treatment and several years after it, affecting the final height negatively, particularly in patients younger than 4 and in those who received cranial irradiation.",,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

For the current study, the authors analyzed the frequency, predictive factors, and prognosis of CNS involvement and recurrence in adult patients with ALL who did not receive cranial irradiation for CNS prophylaxis. Four hundred sixty-seven adult patients (age > or = 15 years) with ALL were treated on 4 protocols: ALL-89 (standard-risk and high-risk ALL; n = 108 patients), ALL-93 (high-risk ALL; n = 222 patients), ALL-96 (standard-risk ALL; n = 84 patients), and ALL3-97 (Burkitt leukemia; n = 53 patients). CNS prophylaxis consisted of intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone together with high-dose systemic methotrexate and cytarabine. The mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 33 years (+/- 16 years), and 272 patients were males. ALL subtypes included an early pre-B phenotype (15%), a common phenotype (45%), a pre-B phenotype (5%), a mature B phenotype (11%), and a T phenotype (24%). CNS involvement at diagnosis was observed in 18 patients (3.9%). Of 159 recurrences, 22 occurred (5.8%) in the CNS (14 isolated and 8 combined). A lactate dehydrogenase level > 1000 U/L was the only factor associated with the risk of CNS recurrence. A complete remission was attained in 7 of 22 patients (32%). The median overall survival after recurrence was 0.7 years for patients with isolated CNS recurrence, 0.13 years for patients with combined recurrence, and 0.41 years for patients with bone marrow recurrence (P = .11). The only 2 survivors underwent stem cell transplantation. The frequency of CNS recurrence in adult patients with ALL who do not receive radiotherapy for CNS prophylaxis was similar to the frequency observed in protocols that included cranial irradiation. A lactate dehydrogenase value >1000 U/L was the only factor found to be associated with CNS recurrence. The prognosis for patients who develop CNS recurrence is poor, identical to that for patients who develop bone marrow recurrence.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.1.- (Lactate Dehydrogenases)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],['Programa para el Estudio y Tratamiento de Hemopatias Malignas Group'],,,,,,,

The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the outcomes of patients with SMZL who received treatment with rituximab, rituximab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. METHODS: The Leukemia Service database was searched for patients with splenic lymphoma who were registered between May 1995 and October 2004. The indications for treatment were the same as those used for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. RESULTS: SMZL was confirmed in 70 patients. The median age was 64 years. The median number of CD20 molecules per cell was 69 x 10(3). Forty-three patients required systemic therapy; rituximab in 26 patients, chemotherapy plus rituximab in 6 patients, and chemotherapy alone in 11 patients. Ten additional patients underwent splenectomy, and 17 patients were in the observation group. The overall response rates were 88% with rituximab, 83% with rituximab plus chemotherapy, and 55% with chemotherapy alone; the 3-year survival rates were 95%, 100%, and 55%, respectively. The 3-year failure-free survival (FFS) rates were 86%, 100%, and 45% in the rituximab, rituximab plus chemotherapy, and chemotherapy alone groups, respectively. Rituximab treatments resulted in longer survival and FFS compared with chemotherapy. Rituximab alone resulted in disappearance of splenomegaly in 92% of patients and normalization of absolute lymphocyte counts. In univariate analysis, younger age and rituximab-based therapy were predictive of longer FFS. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab with or without chemotherapy was found to have major activity in patients with SMZL. These results may be associated with high levels of cellular CD20 antigen sites. Rituximab should be the treatment of choice, at least in older patients with SMZL who have comorbid diseases.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

Association of Fas domains is determinant to signal transmission following Fas ligand binding to a specific domain. The domains involved in Fas aggregation are located in its extracellular region and contain three potential protein kinase C-binding motifs. We therefore studied the possibility that phosphorylation of the extracellular region of Fas might be implicated in the regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition experiments of extracellular phosphorylation were performed in human Jurkat T leukemia cells with K252b, an impermeant protein-kinase inhibitor. Extracellular phosphorylation of Fas receptor was related to ecto-kinase, as assessed by the [gamma-(32)P] ATP labelling of Fas-116 kDa aggregates, suppressed by K252b inhibitor which significantly increased the sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Ecto-PKC involvement was demonstrated by bisindolylmaleimide VIII, a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C which significantly increased both Fas aggregation in the membrane and Fas-mediated apoptosis and by the addition of the PKC pseudo-substrate 19-36 which inhibited the phosphorylation of 116 kDa Fas aggregates. These data support a role for Fas phosphorylation in the decreased sensitivity to apoptosis in the Jurkat T leukemia cell line.","['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ectoprotein kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'Y6197FQK8I (Ro 31-7549)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These inhibitors cause the accumulation of many proteins in the cell with the induction of apoptosis including TRAIL death receptors DR4 and DR5, but the role of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway in proteasome inhibitor cytotoxicity is unknown. Herein, we have demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis by the proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and PS-341 (bortezomib, Velcade), in primary CLL cells and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, is associated with up-regulation of TRAIL and its death receptors, DR4 and DR5. In addition, FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) protein is decreased. MG-132 treatment increases binding of DR5 to the adaptor protein FADD, and causes caspase-8 activation and cleavage of pro-apoptotic BID. Moreover, DR4:Fc or blockage of DR4 and DR5 expression using RNA interference, which prevents TRAIL apoptotic signaling, blocks proteasome inhibitor induced apoptosis. MG-132 also increases apoptosis and DR5 expression in normal B-cells. However, when the proteasome inhibitors are combined with TRAIL or TRAIL receptor activating antibodies the amount of apoptosis is increased in CLL cells but not in normal B cells. Thus, activation of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway contributes to proteasome inhibitor induced apoptosis in CLL cells.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '967Q0SJD77 (lexatumumab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 12.,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1 viral protein U (Vpu) protein enhances the release of diverse retroviruses from human, but not monkey, cells and is thought to do so by ablating a dominant restriction to particle release. Here, we determined how Vpu expression affects the subcellular distribution of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag proteins in human cells where Vpu is, or is not, required for efficient particle release. In HeLa cells, where Vpu enhances HIV-1 and MLV release approximately 10-fold, concentrations of HIV-1 Gag and MLV Gag fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) were initially detected at the plasma membrane, but then accumulated over time in early and late endosomes. Endosomal accumulation of Gag-CFP was prevented by Vpu expression and, importantly, inhibition of plasma membrane to early endosome transport by dominant negative mutants of Rab5a, dynamin, and EPS-15. Additionally, accumulation of both HIV and MLV Gag in endosomes required a functional late-budding domain. In human HOS cells, where HIV-1 and MLV release was efficient even in the absence of Vpu, Gag proteins were localized predominantly at the plasma membrane, irrespective of Vpu expression or manipulation of endocytic transport. While these data indicated that Vpu inhibits nascent virion endocytosis, Vpu did not affect transferrin endocytosis. Moreover, inhibition of endocytosis did not restore Vpu-defective HIV-1 release in HeLa cells, but instead resulted in accumulation of mature virions that could be released from the cell surface by protease treatment. Thus, these findings suggest that a specific activity that is present in HeLa cells, but not in HOS cells, and is counteracted by Vpu, traps assembled retrovirus particles at the cell surface. This entrapment leads to subsequent endocytosis by a Rab5a- and clathrin-dependent mechanism and intracellular sequestration of virions in endosomes.","['0 (Cyan Fluorescent Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (vpu protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.62 (Subtilisin)']",,,20060512,"['R0150111/PHS HHS/United States', 'R0152774/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC1458960,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 8.,"Although autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has gained some popularity as a treatment option in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), limited multicentre data are available on the feasibility and efficacy of this approach. Between January 1995 and June 2005, 72 patients with CLL received ASCT in five Finnish centres. There were 45 men and 27 women with a median age of 57 years (38-69). The median time from diagnosis to ASCT was 32 months (6-181) and the median number of prior regimens 1 (1-4). All patients received blood stem cell grafts and CD34+ selection had been performed in 44 patients (61%). The most common high-dose regimen was a total body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide (38 patients, 53%). No early treatment-related deaths were observed. With a median follow-up of 28 months from ASCT, a relapse or progression has been observed in 27 patients (37%). The projected progression-free survival is 48 months (confidence interval (CI) 30-66). The projected median overall survival is 95 months (CI 74-101) from ASCT and is not influenced by graft selection or conditioning regimen used. Autologous stem cell transplantation is a feasible treatment option for CLL. Randomized trials against alternative treatments are needed to assess the impact of ASCT on the clinical course of CLL.","['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,20060508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 69 allogeneic recipients were included with following diagnoses: acute myeloid leukemia 42, acute lymphoblastic leukemia 5, chronic myeloid leukemia 15, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 5 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome 2. The peripheral lymphocyte subset counts (CD3+ T cells, CD3+4+ helper T cells, CD3+8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ natural killer cells) were measured at 3, 6 and 12 months. The CD4+ helper T-cell reconstitution at 3 months was strongly correlated with OS (P<0.0001), NRM (P=0.0007), and opportunistic infections (P=0.0108) at the cutoff value of 200 x 10(6)/l CD4(+) helper T cells. Rapid CD4+ helper T-cell recovery was also associated with a higher CD4+ helper T-cell transplant dose (P=0.006) and donor type (P<0.001). An early CD4+ helper T-cell recovery at 3 months correlated with a subsequent faster helper T-cell recovery until 12 months, yet not with B-cell recovery. In a multivariate analysis, rapid recovery of CD4+ helper T cells at 3 months was a favorable prognostic factor together with higher CD34+ cell transplant dose in terms of OS (P=0.001) and NRM (P=0.005).","['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,20060508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intersubunit disulfide bond is in SU linked to a disulfide bond isomerization motif, CXXC, with which the virus controls its fusion reaction (M. Wallin, M. Ekstrom, and H. Garoff, EMBO J. 23:54-65, 2004). Upon receptor binding the isomerase rearranges the intersubunit disulfide bond into a disulfide bond isomer within the motif. This facilitates SU dissociation and fusion activation in the TM subunit. In the present study we have asked whether furin cleavage of the Env precursor potentiates the isomerase to be triggered. To this end we accumulated the late form of the precursor, gp90, in the cell by incubation in the presence of a furin-inhibiting peptide. The isomerization was done by NP-40 incubation or by a heat pulse under alkylation-free conditions. The cells were lysed in the presence of alkylator, and the precursor was immunoprecipitated, gel isolated, deglycosylated, and subjected to complete trypsin digestion. Disulfide-linked peptide complexes were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-tricine-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. This assay revealed the size of the characteristic major disulfide-linked peptide complex that differentiates the two isomers of the disulfide bond between Cys336 (or Cys339) and Cys563, i.e., the bond corresponding to the intersubunit disulfide bond. The analyses showed that the isomerase was five- to eightfold more resistant to triggering in the precursor than in the mature, cleaved form. This suggests that the isomerase becomes potentiated for triggering by a structural change in Env that is induced by furin cleavage in the cell.","['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.75 (Furin)']",,,,,PMC1472177,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 12.,"BACKGROUND: The use of tissue microarrays (TMAs) is now a generally accepted method for the investigation of solid tumours. However, little is known about the applicability of the TMA technique for analysis of patients with acute leukaemia. A bone marrow (BM)-TMA analysis with 15 different immunohistochemical markers was performed. The TMA was validated by comparison with the corresponding full tissue sections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A BM-TMA comprising 148 cases of acute leukaemia, including 115 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 33 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases, was constructed. Expression of CD3, CD10, CD15, CD20, CD34, CD61, CD68, CD79a, CD99, CD117, CD138, myeloperoxidase, haemoglobin A1, glycophorin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was immunohistochemically analysed. 50 cases of the TMA were directly compared with the corresponding full tissue section to validate the results. RESULTS: Morphologically and immunohistochemically, 6 (4%) of 148 cases and 765 (11%) cores of 6912 individual analyses were not evaluable. A direct comparison of TMA cases with conventional full sections showed a concordance of the results of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The small size of bone-marrow biopsies and the presence of bony trabeculae do not preclude construction and analysis of acute leukaemia TMAs. Acute leukaemia cases on TMA displayed the characteristic phenotypic profiles expected in different AML and ALL subtypes. Therefore, the TMA technique is also a promising method for high-throughput analysis of combined marker expression and clinicopathological correlations in patients with leukaemia.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,20060512,,PMC1860588,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Employees of Australian Institute of Petroleum member companies were enrolled in the cohort in four industry-wide surveys between 1981 and 1999. Mortality of 16,547 males and 1356 females was determined up to 31 December 2001 and cancer incidence to 31 December 2000. Cause specific mortality and cancer incidence were compared with those of the Australian population by means of standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs). Associations between increased incidence of specific cancers and employment in the petroleum industry were tested by trends according to period of first employment, duration of employment, latency, and hydrocarbon exposure, adjusting for personal smoking history where appropriate. RESULTS: There was a significant elevation of the incidence of mesothelioma (SIR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.79), melanoma (SIR 1.37, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.58), and prostate cancer (SIR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.34). The SIRs of all leukaemias and of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) were not significantly different from unity, but all 11 ANLL cases were clustered in the middle to high hydrocarbon exposure categories. Tanker drivers had a significantly elevated incidence of kidney cancer (12 cases v 5.84 expected, SIR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.59). Lung cancer incidence was significantly reduced (SIR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of mesothelioma are probably related to past exposure to asbestos in refineries. No occupational cause has been identified for the excess of melanoma, or prostatic or bladder cancer. The possibility of a causal relationship between cancer of the kidney and hydrocarbon exposure warrants further study. It is uncertain whether benzene exposures, particularly past levels of exposure, have been high enough to cause ANLL.",['0 (Petroleum)'],,,20060512,,PMC2092518,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 12.,"WT1 was originally identified as an inactivated gene in Wilms tumor, a childhood kidney cancer. Alternative splicing of the WT1 transcript generates four major protein isoforms, each having different functional properties. Here we characterized a short transcript originating from a second promoter located within intron 1 of WT1. This 2.3-kb sWT1 transcript encodes a protein of approximately 35-37 kDa that retains intact DNA-binding and transactivation domains but lacks the 147 amino acids at the N terminus required for transcriptional repression. We found sWT1 to be a more potent transcriptional activator than WT1 for cyclin E and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor promoters, which are normally repressed by WT1. The expression patterns of the sWT1 and WT1 transcripts differed slightly in various organs; we found sWT1 protein in tissue samples from adult testis and fetal kidney, with low-level expression in adult kidney as well. The sWT1 transcript, but not the full-length transcript, was over-expressed in the leukemia samples tested. sWT1-specific small interfering RNA retarded the proliferation of leukemia cell line K562 in vitro. Finally, sWT1 cooperated with Ras in transforming primary fibroblasts in vitro. Further studies are needed to clarify the oncogenic behavior of this isoform and to determine the mechanism underlying its up-regulation in leukemia and other forms of cancer.","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,20060512,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['GENBANK/DQ537939'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Gammadelta T cells were expanded from normal PBMC by culturing with zoledronate and a low concentration of IL-2 for 2 weeks. For the activation of gammadelta T cells, gammadelta T cells were cultured with type I IFN (HLBI, IFN-alpha2b and IFN-beta) for 1-3 days. The cytotoxicity of HLBI-activated gammadelta T cells against leukemia cell lines and fresh leukemia cells was evaluated by 51Cr-release assay. RESULTS: Gammadelta T cells, which were expanded and purified with magnetic beads using an anti-gammadelta TCR MAb, were demonstrated to be cytotoxic against leukemia cell lines of both lymphoid and myeloid origin and fresh myeloid leukemia cells. By culturing expanded gammadelta T cells with type I IFN, the expression of the activation marker CD69 was increased and the cytometric bead array showed an elevated production of IFN-gamma by gammadelta T cells. In addition, the cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells against leukemia cells was definitely enhanced by culturing gammadelta T cells with HLBI. DISCUSSION: The present study has demonstrated that type I IFN could enhance the anti-leukemic cytotoxicity of expanded gammadelta T cells, which implies that in vitro bisphosphonate (such as zoledronate)-expanded and type I IFN-activated gammadelta T cells could be applied to immunotherapy for hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,['Cytotherapy. 2006;8(2):93-4.

An obstacle to widespread use of this strategy is that it has not been possible to generate leukemic DC from all patients, and an alternative approach is needed if the majority of leukemia patients are to receive therapeutic vaccination in conjunction with other treatment protocols. METHODS: In the present study, we generated DC from CD14-selected monocytes isolated from healthy donor PBPC and loaded them with a total cell lysate from AML patient blasts. RESULTS: Immature in vitro-derived DC exhibited robust phagocytic activity, and mature DC demonstrated high expression of CD80, CD83, CD86 and the chemokine receptor CCR7, important for DC migration to local lymph nodes. Mature, Ag-loaded DC were used as APC for leukemia-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) induction and demonstrated cytotoxic activity against leukemic targets. CTL lysis was Ag-specific, with killing of both allogeneic leukemic blasts and autologous DC loaded with allogeneic AML lysate. HLA-matched controls were not lysed in our system.

Today most knowledge about the pathogenesis of chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease is based on mice models. In this report we describe the development of an allogeneic in vitro model that allows studying the pathogenesis of chronic sclerodermifomic Graft-versus-Host Disease in the human setting. We report that priming of mononuclear cells in the presence of allogeneic fibroblasts and Interleukin (IL)-4 induces fibroblast collagen synthesis, whereas priming in the presence of IL-12 suppresses collagen synthesis during subsequent coculture of primed mononuclear cells with allogeneic fibroblasts. Since IL-12 is also known to mediate anti-tumor effects by stimulation of Natural Killer cell and Lymphokine Activated Killer cell activity, these findings indicate that treatment of patients with IL-12 or pretreatment of donor lymphocytes with IL-12 might strengthen a graft versus leukemia effect and at the same time decrease the risk of chronic sclerodermifomic Graft-versus-Host Disease development.","['0 (Collagen Type I)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 15.,"Flow cytometry is useful to study lymphoid malignancies since it allows both immunophenotyping of neoplastic cells and quantification of antigen expression. CD18 and CD45 are commonly exposed membrane antigens with different levels of expression on blood leukocyte and neoplastic cells. The aim of this retrospective study was to semi-quantitatively evaluate the expression of CD18 and CD45 in dogs with different lymphoid malignancies with blood involvement and to compare results with those from healthy dogs and dogs with reactive diseases. Blood samples from 13 dogs with precursor lymphoid malignancies, 20 with mature neoplasms (either chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphoma), of different immunophenotypes, were compared with 24 healthy dogs and 12 dogs with different reactive diseases. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for CD18 and CD45 was recorded on lymphoid and granulocytic populations using dual colour flow cytometry, and the ratio between MFI for lymphoid and granulocytic populations (L/N ratio) was calculated to compare the results obtained in different sessions using an internal control (granulocyte fluorescence intensity). Significant decreases in the L/N ratio were detected in neoplastic samples for both CD18 (either precursors or mature versus controls) and CD45 (either precursors or mature versus control), while using MFI only slight differences were detectable in CD45 between precursors and controls. Neoplastic cells often exhibited lower expression of the L/N ratio for CD18, and mainly for CD45, most likely due to a less mature pattern than normal cells and/or to an aberrant quantitative expression of surface antigen. Moreover, more than 50% of neoplastic lymphoid cells exhibited L/N ratios that were not within the values observed in controls for at least one antigen. Altered L/N ratios, in particular decreases of CD45, were mainly observed in precursor neoplasms and in T-cell neoplasms. Detection of altered expression of common antigens, and in particular a L/N ratio for CD45 lower than a value of 103% may be useful as a confirmation of pseudo-clonality thus helping in differentiating reactive and neoplastic lymphocyte expansions.","['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,20060515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 12.,"Complexes of zirconium (IV) with some bis-coumarin ligands have been synthesized. The zirconium (IV) complexes with bis-coumarins were characterized by different physicochemical methods-elemental analysis, IR-, and (1)H-NMR-spectroscopies and mass spectral data. The spectral data of zirconium (IV) complexes were interpreted on the basis of comparison with the spectra of the free ligands. The results of the ligands and their complexes, based on spectral data are informative and useful for suggestion of the metal-ligand binding mode. Cytotoxic screening by MTT assay was carried out. In the present study we performed comparative evaluation of the cytotoxic effects of the three newly synthesized zirconium complexes against the acute myeloid leukemia derived HL-60 and the chronic myeloid leukemia LAMA-84. The preliminary cytotoxicity screening program revealed that the investigated zirconium complexes induced 50% inhibition of the cell viability of HL-60 and LAMA-84 cells at micromolar concentrations and thus could be considered as biologically active. Independently of the tumor test system evaluated the complex of bis(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-methane proved superior to the remaining agents with respect to the IC(50) values obtained. The complexes of both the other coumarins evaluated proved to be less potent than the corresponding free ligands, as evidenced by the IC(50) values obtained. Thus the zirconium complexes with coumarin ligands represent a novel class of antiproliferative agents, which deserve further attention in search of anticancer lead compounds.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)', 'C6V6S92N3C (Zirconium)']",,,20060512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report that the acidic domain containing protein DEK interacts with histones and exerts a potent inhibitory effect on both p300 and PCAF-mediated histone acetyltransferase activity and transcription. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have demonstrated that the recruitment of DEK to the appropriate promoter induces the histone H3 and H4 hypoacetylation of chromatin.

The major CNS parenchymal target of these neurovirulent retroviruses (NVs) are the microglia, whose infection is largely coincident with neuropathological changes. Despite this close association, the role of microglial infection in disease induction is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the interaction of the highly virulent MLV, FrCasE, with microglia ex vivo to evaluate whether infection induces specific changes that could account for neurodegeneration. Specifically, we compared microglia infected with FrCasE, a related non-neurovirulent virus (NN) F43/Fr57E, or mock-infected, both at a basic virological level, and at the level of cellular gene expression using quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Afffymetrix 430A mouse gene chips. RESULTS: Basic virological comparison of NN, NV, and mock-infected microglia in culture did not reveal differences in virus expression that provided insight into neuropathogenesis. Therefore, microglial analysis was extended to ER stress gene induction based on previous experiments demonstrating ER stress induction in NV-infected mouse brains and cultured fibroblasts. Analysis of message levels for the ER stress genes BiP (grp78), CHOP (Gadd153), calreticulin, and grp58 in cultured microglia, and BiP and CHOP in microglia enriched fractions from infected mouse brains, indicated that FrCasE infection did not induce these ER stress genes either in vitro or in vivo. To broadly identify physiological changes resulting from NV infection of microglia in vitro, we undertook a gene array screen of more than 14,000 well-characterized murine genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). This analysis revealed only a small set of gene expression changes between infected and uninfected cells (<18). Remarkably, gene array comparison of NN- and NV-infected microglia revealed only 3 apparent gene expression differences. Validation experiments for these genes by Taqman real-time RT-PCR indicated that only single Ig IL-1 receptor related protein (SIGIRR) transcript was consistently altered in culture; however, SIGIRR changes were not observed in enriched microglial fractions from infected brains. CONCLUSION: The results from this study indicate that infection of microglia by the highly neurovirulent virus, FrCasE, does not induce overt physiological changes in this cell type when assessed ex vivo. In particular, NV does not induce microglial ER stress and thus, FrCasE-associated CNS ER stress likely results from NV interactions with another cell type or from neurodegeneration directly. The lack of NV-induced microglial gene expression changes suggests that FrCasE either affects properties unique to microglia in situ, alters the expression of microglial genes not represented in this survey, or affects microglial cellular processes at a post-transcriptional level. Alternatively, NV-infected microglia may simply serve as an unaffected conduit for persistent dissemination of virus to other neural cells where they produce acute neuropathogenic effects.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)']",,,20060512,"['R01 NS037614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS037614-09/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 NS037614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS37614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1475625,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether quantitation of the AgNOR pattern can be used to discriminate between patients with stable and progressive disease.Methods-Peripheral blood smears from 48 patients with CLL, classified as having either stable or progressive disease (Rai stage III or IV; bulky lymph nodes or massive splenomegaly; or peripheral lymphocytes >100 x 10(9)/1), were studied. For each patient, total tumour mass (TTM) and for patients undergoing a period of observation without treatment, the TTM duplication time (DT) and the lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) were calculated.Results-Four cell types could be distinguished according to their AgNOR pattern: (1) cells with a single cluster; (2) cells with a single compact nucleolus; (3) cells with two compact nucleoli; and (4) cells with several scattered dots. The percentage of cells with clusters was the AgNOR parameter which correlated best with TTM and LDT. Correlations were also seen between the proportion of cells with clusters and age and haemoglobin concentration. A significant correlation with DT could be detected only when age was kept constant. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that the percentage of cells with clusters was the most important prognostic factor. This alone classified 94% of the patients correctly (jackknive procedure) as either stable or progressive CLL.Conclusions-The percentage of circulating lymphocytes with clusters of AgNORs can be used as a parameter of tumour kinetics in CLL and helps to discriminate between patients with stable and progressive disease. For practical purposes, a value of more than 13% of cells with clusters is suggestive of progressive disease.",,,,,,PMC408087,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation was done before treatment, by means of a one step silver staining method. In every case 50 to 100 blasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, immature (pronormoblastic and basophilic normoblastic) and mature (polychromatic normoblastic) erythroid elements, and megakaryocytes were evaluated for the mean numbers of nucleoli and for the average number of AgNORs per nucleus. Student's t test was used to compare the patient and control groups. Other statistical analyses were carried out by means of the computer assisted ""HEMA"" system.Results-Compared with controls, activation of NORs was noticed only in CML blasts, while there was a decrease in NORs in the erythroid elements, promyelocytes, and megakaryocytes. The AgNOR score of polychromatic normoblasts and megakaryocytes started to decrease in the benign stage of CML, whereas a similar decrease in pronormoblasts, basophilic normoblasts, and promyelocytes was detected only in patients with CML blast crisis.Conclusions-The loss of AgNOR sites in cell series in CML may be related to intrinsic defects in their proliferation.",,,,,,PMC407981,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kappa genes were visualised with a combination of probes for the Ckappa, Jkappa, Vkappa1, and Vkappa2 segments, the lambda genes with a probe containing the Jlambda2-Clambda2, Jlambda3-Clambda3 segments and the H genes with a probe for Clambda2. Hybridisation sites were visualised using appropriate fluorochrome conjugates and images were analysed by digital microscopy.Results-In both normal and malignant lymphoid cells, the kappa and lambda genes were visualised as a single dot signal, whereas the H lambda genes were resolved as either two or three separate signals per chromatid in metaphase chromosomes or per allele in interphase nuclei. In the malignant PLL cells, double hybridisation experiments with a painting library specific for the chromosome 11 showed that the lambda region was retained in the translocated chromosome, with an in situ resolution pattern similar to that of the normal allele.Conclusions-This study shows that a high resolution in situ analysis of the three Ig loci can be efficiently performed with small size genomic probes on both normal and malignant lymphoid cells. Such an approach offers a flexible tool for the molecular characterisations of these loci on chromosomes and individual neoplastic cells.",,,,,,PMC407950,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of immune enhancement using recombinant interferon gamma1b (rIFN-gamma1b) in patients with cancer who received GTX for refractory, systemic, opportunistic infections. METHODS: Twenty recipients of high-dose donor GTX ( approximately 5.5 x 10(10) neutrophils per transfusion) who had received concurrent rIFN-gamma1b between October 2001 and December 2004 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) was 45 +/- 17 years. Ten patients (50%) were men, 17 patients (85%) had leukemia, and 3 patients (15%) had myelodysplastic syndrome. The median +/- SD Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 15 +/- 4 (range, 7-22). Most patients (n = 18 patients; 90%) had recurrent or refractory cancer. In 6 patients (30%) who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, GTX plus rIFN-gamma1b was given a median +/- SD of 26 +/- 100 days (range, 12-372 days) after transplantation. Seventeen patients (85%) had neutropenia during GTX therapy. Five patients (25%) had possible invasive fungal infection, 3 patients (15%) had probable invasive fungal infection, and 11 patients (55%) had proven invasive fungal infection. One patient (5%) had refractory Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. Eight patients (40%) received corticosteroids during GTX plus rIFN-gamma1b therapy. Patients received a median +/- SD of 8 +/- 7 GTX doses (range, 4-28 doses) and 9 +/- 7 rIFN-gamma1b doses (range, 1-28 doses), for a mean +/- SD cumulative dose (CD) of 400 +/- 2621 microg. Other concomitant cytokines were granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (12 +/- 3 doses; CD, 6720 +/- 4721 microg) in 15 patients (75%) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (12 +/- 9 doses; CD, 4750 +/- 4410 microg) in 14 patients (70%). Four patients (20%) developed fever, and 2 patients (10%) developed skin rashes. Reversible liver dysfunction (n = 3 patients; 15%) and tachycardia (n = 1 patients; 5%) were considered rIFN-gamma1b-associated adverse reactions; whereas, in 1 patient (5%), transient dyspnea was attributed to GTX. Four weeks after therapy started, 9 patients (45%) had complete or partial resolution of infection; and, in another 3 patients (15%), the invasive fungal infection had become stable. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that no serious adverse events were associated with rIFN-gamma1b immune enhancement in patients with systemic opportunistic infections who received donor GTX therapy.","['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

From 1990 to 2001, 5,330 cases of acute leukemia were registered by the French National Registry of Childhood Leukemia and Lymphoma. Exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation was based on measurements, using thermoluminescent dosimeters, at about 1,000 sites covering all the ""Departements."" In addition, 8,737 indoor terrestrial gamma dose rate measurements covering 62% of the ""Departements"" and 13,240 indoor radon concentration measurements covering all the ""Departements"" were made during a national campaign.

There was no evidence of an ecological association between terrestrial gamma dose (range: 0.22-0.90 mSv y) or total gamma dose (range: 0.49-1.28 mSv y) and childhood acute leukemia incidence, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in univariate or multivariate regression analyses including indoor radon. A significant positive association between indoor radon (range: 22-262 Bq m) and AML incidence among children was observed and remained significant in multivariate regression analyses including either terrestrial gamma dose [SIR per 100 Bq m = 1.29 (1.09-1.53)] or total gamma dose [SIR per 100 Bq m = 1.29 (1.09-1.53)]. The study showed no ecological association between terrestrial gamma radiation and childhood leukemia for the range of variation in gamma dose rates observed in France.

Epub 2006 May 11.,"When the fungus Stachybotrys chartarum is inhaled, its mycotoxins may cause lung injury and inflammation. The severity of human responses to S. chartarum in both occupational and home settings varies widely. To explore these differences, we intratracheally instilled C3H/HeJ, BALB/c, and C57BL/6J mice with S. chartarum spores suspended in saline. One day later, the mice were humanely killed, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and biochemical and cellular indicators of lung injury and inflammation were measured. BALB/c mice showed the highest myeloperoxidase activity, albumin and hemoglobin levels, and neutrophil numbers in their BAL among the three strains. BALB/c was the only strain to show significant increases in keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, MCP-3, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1gamma, MIP-2, RANTES, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-3, IL-6, IL-18, leukemia inhibitory factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and TNF-alpha. A model of allergen-induced airway inflammation was examined to assess whether underlying allergic inflammation might contribute to increased susceptibility to S. chartarum-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury. Surprisingly, in BALB/c mice, ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation produced a protective effect against some S. chartarum-induced pulmonary responses. This is the first report of mammalian strain differences affecting responses to S. chartarum. These responses differ from those reported for LPS and other fungi. Analogous underlying genetic differences may contribute to the wide range of sensitivity to Stachybotrys among humans.","['0 (Albulin)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Insulin, Long-Acting)', '0 (Insulin, Regular, Human)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', 'ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)']",,,20060511,"['ES-000002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2643262,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loci across a minimal 50-Mb region of primarily the long arm of chromosome 17 showed LOH in 8 cases, whereas a less than 9-Mb region of loci flanking NF1 had LOH in the remaining 2 cases. Two complementary techniques, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), were used to determine whether the copy number at loci that showed LOH was 1 or 2 (ie, deleted or isodisomic). The 2 cases with LOH limited to less than 9 Mb were intrachromosomal deletions. Among the 8 leukemias with 50-Mb LOH segments, 4 had partial uniparental isodisomy and 4 had interstitial uniparental isodisomy. These isodisomic cases showed clustering of the centromeric and telomeric LOH breakpoints. This suggests that the cases with interstitial uniparental isodisomy arose in a leukemia-initiating cell by double-homologous recombination events at intervals of preferred mitotic recombination. Homozygous inactivation of NF1 favored outgrowth of the leukemia-initiating cell. Our studies demonstrate that LOH analyses of loci distributed along the chromosomal length along with copy-number analysis can reveal novel mechanisms of LOH that may potentially identify regions harboring ""cryptic"" tumor suppressor or modifier genes whose inactivation contributes to tumorigenesis.",['0 (Neurofibromin 1)'],,,20060511,"['K24 CA80916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895516,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 11.,"Genetic abnormalities that result in expression of chimeric tyrosine kinase proteins such as BCR-ABL1 and ETV6-PDGFRbeta are common causes of hematopoietic malignancies. The paradigm for constitutive activation of these fusion tyrosine kinases is enforced homodimerization by self-association domains present in the fusion partner proteins. The unique interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 that leads to expression of the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion tyrosine kinase was recently identified as a cause of chronic eosinophilic leukemia. In this report, we demonstrate that FIP1L1 is completely dispensable for PDGFRalpha activation in vitro and in vivo. Instead, truncation of PDGFRalpha between two conserved tryptophan residues in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain is required for kinase activation and transforming potential of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. The presence of a complete JM domain in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha is inhibitory, but this autoinhibition can be overcome by enforced homodimerization. Similar effects of the JM domain in the context of PDGFRbeta were observed. These results suggest that disruption of the autoinhibitory JM domain is an alternative, dimerization-independent mechanism by which chimeric tyrosine kinases are constitutively activated and induce leukemogenesis.","['0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",,,20060511,,PMC1472432,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering that leukemias in childhood and in adults are different diseases, we describe three pediatric cases to help compare the biological characteristics, immunophenotype, clinical features, treatment response and incidence of this disease in both age groups. From a total 1363 new patients with acute leukemia (AL), we report three cases with blasts of French - American - British L2 morphology, an absence of the most specific markers for myeloid, T or B lineage and lacking CD34, which led us to evaluate the blasts with an extensive panel of antibodies, including those related to the other putative pathways of lymphoid differentation: natural killer and DC. The cells expressed CD4, CD56, HLA-DR, BDCA-2 and BDCA-4. None of our cases presented with skin involvement. All three children showed good response to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) protocols, achieving complete remission even when one of the patients relapsed and received an allogeneic transplant. These findings, in spite of the small number of patients, suggest that the clinical course in children might be less aggressive, and that regular ALL protocols would be effective. We emphasize the importance of including antibodies for DC lineage in cases of CD34(-) unclassifiable AL to further characterize these rare cases (0.22%), considering that the tumor cell affiliation to DC lineage relies exclusively on immunophenotypic criteria.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multi-centre open-label phase II study, 140 patients up to age 80 were given induction with IDAC. Patients were entered between March 1993 and August 1995. If patients had persistent blasts at day 14 or on recovery, they were given NOVE. As consolidation, patients achieving complete remission (CR) with IDAC were given 1 further cycle of IDAC and 1 cycle of NOVE. Patients achieving CR after NOVE were given 2 further cycles of NOVE. RESULTS: 76% of all patients achieved remission after IDAC +/- NOVE, 81% in patients aged < or =60 years and 67% in patients aged >60. Overall, induction mortality was 11% and toxicity was similar to other cooperative group studies. Median follow-up was 104.0 months with 95% CI: (100.0, 105.2). Median overall survival (OS) in responding patients < or =60 was not reached: of the 79 responders < or =60, 35 died. The median disease free survival (DFS) in these responding patients was 22.7 (14.9, na) months. Median OS and DFS in responding patients >60 was 10.0 (7.3, 15.2) months and 7.5 (6.2, 15.2) months, respectively.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) published a set of standardized diagnostic and response criteria for acute myeloid leukemia in 1990, which was revised in 2003. The aim of the present study was to establish the best criteria for therapeutic response assessment in the newly classified AEL and evaluate patient outcomes. Fifty-two patients with AEL as defined by the new WHO criteria were evaluated in this study. The following seven indices for therapeutic response assessment were evaluated: (i) NCI criteria (myeloblast percentage among total nucleated cells (TNC) and cellularity); (ii) myeloblast percentage among non-erythroid cells (NEC) and cellularity; (iii) erythroid series percentage among TNC; (iv) pronormoblast percentage among erythroid cells; (v) ratio of pronormoblasts and blasts; (vi) maturation arrest index; and (vii) disappearance of erythroid dysplasia. Complete remission (CR) patients with <5% of myeloblast/NEC (NEC-CR) showed significantly longer overall survival periods (mean 55.8 months) compared to CR patients with >5% myeloblast/NEC (mean 11.7 months, P = 0.006). NEC-CR patients also had longer event-free survival (median 16.4 months) compared to patients with >5% and <20% of myeloblast/NEC (median 6.2 months) (P = 0.044). The other indices for therapeutic response assessment are not significant for predictability of relapse and outcomes. Therefore, we recommend that the myeloblast percentage among NEC be used instead of myeloblast percentage among TNC for therapeutic response assessment in AEL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, umbilical cord blood from unrelated donors have been used as an alternative stem cell source for adult patients with MDS. Here, we updated the results of unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) after myeloablative conditioning for 22 adult patients with MDS. Diagnosis at transplantation included refractory anemia (RA) (n = 3), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n = 2), RAEB-t (n = 2), and MDS-related secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 15). All patients were treated with total body irradiation (12 Gy), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and cyclophosphamide followed by unrelated HLA-mismatched CBT. The median age was 40 years (range, 19 - 51 years), the median weight was 54.5 kg (range, 43 - 75 kg), and the median number of cryopreserved nucleated cells was 2.43 x 10(7)/kg (range, 1.82 - 4.10 x 10(7)/kg).

Potential environmental risk factors identified for childhood leukemia include exposure to magnetic fields of more than 0.4 micro Tessla, exposure to pesticides, solvents, benzene and other hydrocarbons, maternal alcohol consumption (but only for certain genotypes), contaminated drinking water, infections, and high birth weight. The finding of space-time clustering and seasonal variation also supports a role for infections. There is little evidence linking childhood leukemia with lifetime exposure to ionizing radiation although fetal exposures to X-rays are associated with increased risk. Breast-feeding, consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and having allergies all appear to be protective. Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is confined to areas of the world where malaria is endemic, with the additional involvement of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a co-factor. Environmental risk factors suggested for other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) include exposure to ionizing radiation (both lifetime and antenatal), pesticides, and, in utero exposure to cigarette smoke, benzene and nitrogen dioxide (via the mother). Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is especially associated with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation, but breast-feeding seems to confer lower risk. This is consistent with an infection or immune-response mediated etiology for HL.",,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The different biologic actions of IFN are believed to be mediated by the products of specifically IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in the target cells. The IFN response is the first line of defense against viral infections. Viruses, which require the cellular machinery for their replication, have evolved different ways to counteract the action of IFN by inhibiting IFN production or Jak-Stat signaling or by altering ISG products. This review focuses on the role of viral proteins from the RNA virus family, particularly rabies P protein. P protein mediates inhibition of the IFN system by different pathways: it inhibits IFN production by impairing IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) phosphorylation and IFN signaling by blocking nuclear transport of Stat1 and alters promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies by retaining PML in the cytoplasm.","['0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion gene is called BCR-ABL. After transcription and translation the constitutively activated p210 BCR-ABL oncoprotein is formed. This leads to uncontrolled activation of the ABL tyrosin kinase. Deregulated cellular proliferation and diminished apoptosis of BCR-ABL transformed cells is the result. Expression of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein is sufficient and necessary for the development of a CML phenotype. Imatinib mesylate (Glivec) is a small molecule that binds to the ATP pocket of ABL and blocks downstream signalling events. Imatinib is very effective in the treatment of CML in all stages of the disease. Patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML were randomized to imatinib or to interferon plus cytarabine in the IRIS trial. Imatinib showed significantly superior tolerability, hematologic and cytogenetic resposes and increased time to progression. In patients with advanced phase CML, imatinib is less effective and response duration is short. Median overall survival of blast crisis patients is 6.9 months only. Additional BCR-ABL independent chromosomal abnormalities are common in advanced phase CML and result in resistance to imatinib. BCR-ABL kinase-domaine mutations are frequently found in imatinib resistant patients and confer diminished sensitivity to imatinib.

Now similar studies are being performed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While the sensitivity using flow cytometry is less in AML than in ALL (able to detect 1 leukemic cell among 1000 normal cells in AML), persistent or minimal residual AML provides the clinician guidance with future treatment recommendations. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is now considered an important indicator response of disease response to treatment.

In order to identify the sites where SUMOylation takes place in the cell, we developed an in situ SUMOylation assay using a semi-intact cell system and subsequently combined it with siRNA-based knockdown of nucleoporin RanBP2, also known as Nup358, which is one of the known SUMO E3 proteins. With the in situ SUMOylation assay, we found that both nuclear rim and PML bodies, besides mitotic apparatuses, are major targets for active SUMOylation. The ability to analyze possible SUMO conjugation sites would be a valuable tool to investigate where SUMO E3-like activities and/or SUMO substrates exist in the cell. Specific knockdown of RanBP2 completely abolished SUMOylation along the nuclear rim and dislocated RanGAP1 from the nuclear pore complexes. Interestingly, the loss of RanBP2 markedly reduced the number of PML bodies, in contrast to other, normal-appearing nuclear compartments including the nuclear lamina, nucleolus and chromatin, suggesting a novel link between RanBP2 and PML bodies. SUMOylation facilitated by RanBP2 at the nuclear rim may be a key step for the formation of a particular subnuclear organization. Our data imply that SUMO E3 proteins like RanBP2 facilitate spatio-temporal SUMOylation for certain nuclear structure and function.","['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RANGAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (ran-binding protein 2)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because CD52 also is expressed on acute leukemic blasts, the authors investigated the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Fifteen patients with CD52-positive (> or = 20%), recurrent or refractory acute leukemia (9 patients with AML and 6 patients with ALL) received alemtuzumab at a dose of 30 mg intravenously given 3 times a week (dose escalation during Week 1) for a total of 4 to 12 weeks. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 39 years (range, 18-71 years). Patients had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-5 prior therapies). Two patients (13%) achieved a bone marrow complete response and 1 patient achieved a substantial reduction in bone marrow blasts. No complete remissions were observed. Ten patients developed disease progression while on study. Alemtuzumab was myelosuppressive in nearly all patients. Infusion-related toxicities were common, but usually did not exceed Grade 2 (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria). Infectious episodes occurred in 13 patients (87%) and included pneumonia (6 patients), bacteremia (11 patients), fungemia (2 patients), and cytomegalovirus reactivation (2 patients).

The former is considered to possibly arise in utero via transplacental chemical exposure. A striking feature of these leukemias is their malignancy and remarkably brief latencies implying the rapid acquisition of any necessary additional mutations. We have suggested that these coupled features might be explained if MLL fusion gene encoded proteins rendered cells more vulnerable to further DNA damage and mutation in the presence of chronic exposure to the agent(s) that induced the MLL fusion itself. We have tested this idea by exploiting a hormone regulated MLL-ENL (MLLT1) activation system and show that MLL-ENL function in normal murine progenitor cells substantially increases the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in proliferating cells that survive exposure to etoposide VP-16.

Leflunomide, an immunosuppressive agent used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, also has activity against CMV by impairing viral assembly. Here we report the control of refractory CMV disease by the combined use of foscarnet and leflunomide. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: A 1S-year-old boy with juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia (JMML) received an allogeneic HSCT with bone marrow stem cells from a mismatched, unrelated donor (MMUD, recipient and donor CMV-positive). CMV-reactivation two months post transplantation (Tx) could only be controlled by the use of cidofovir. Because of secondary graft failure, the boy received a second HSCT with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) of the same donor after overall 6 months. CMV-infection was noticed three weeks later, associated with a considerable rise of both CMV-copy number and pp65-antigen. Since reinduction with cidofovir was ineffective and ganciclovir not warranted due to the history of graft failure, the child then received a combination of foscarnet/leflunomide, leading to a rapid decline of his CMV-copy number and to an afebrile state. Hematological, hepatic or renal toxicities were not observed. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that leflunomide may be of use in the management of transplant recipients with CMV-infection refractory or intolerant to conventional antiviral therapy.","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '364P9RVW4X (Foscarnet)', 'G162GK9U4W (Leflunomide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine whether beta-catenin was correlated to clonogenic capacity also in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) setting. Eighty-two patients were retrospectively evaluated for beta-catenin expression by Western blot. beta-Catenin was expressed (although at various protein levels) in 61% of patients, and was undetectable in the remaining cases. In our cohort, beta-catenin expression was correlated with the clonogenic proliferation of AML-colony forming cells (AML-CFC or CFU-L) in methylcellulose in the presence of 5637-conditioned medium, and more strikingly with self-renewing of leukemic cells, as assessed in vitro by a re-plating assay. In survival analyses, beta-catenin appeared as a new independent prognostic factor predicting poor event-free survival and shortened overall survival (both with P<0.05). Furthermore, variations in beta-catenin protein levels were dependent on post-transcriptional mechanisms involving the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway only in leukemic cells. Indeed, beta-catenin negative leukemic cells were found to increase beta-catenin in response to Wnt3a agonist in contrast to normal counterparts. Altogether, our data pave the way to the evaluation of Wnt pathway inhibition as a new rationale for eradicating the clonogenic pool of AML cells.","['0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",,,20060511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are the Notch and Wnt-signaling routes, which both are deregulated in several types of leukemias.

Here, we report a new human T-cell lymphoma line CUTLL1, which expresses high levels of activated NOTCH1 and is extremely sensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors treatment. CUTLL1 cells harbor a t(7;9)(q34;q34) translocation which induces the expression of a TCRB-NOTCH1 fusion transcript encoding a membrane-bound truncated form of the NOTCH1 receptor. GSI treatment of CUTLL1 cells blocked NOTCH1 processing and caused rapid clearance of activated intracellular NOTCH1. Loss of NOTCH1 activity induced a gene expression signature characterized by the downregulation of NOTCH1 target genes such as HES1 and NOTCH3. In contrast with most human T-ALL cell lines with activating mutations in NOTCH1, CUTLL1 cells showed a robust cellular phenotype upon GSI treatment characterized by G1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. These results show that the CUTLL1 cell line has a strong dependence on NOTCH1 signaling for proliferation and survival and supports that T-ALL patients whose tumors harbor t(7;9) should be included in clinical trials testing the therapeutic efficacy NOTCH1 inhibition with GSIs.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",,,20060511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we attempt to integrate recent studies by others and us, which provide a novel insight to this apoptotic process. In the last few years it was made clear that there is a tight cooperation between genomic and non-genomic effects exerted by GC receptors (GRs). GC invokes major alterations in the gene expression profile through GR-mediated transactivation and transrepression, which ultimately tip the balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins. Although essential in shaping the cell's proteome, these genomic effects are insufficient to elicit apoptotic death and additional signals are required for activating the pro-apoptotic proteins. Several non-genomic effects have been described that occur immediately following exposure to GC, which are imperative for the induction of apoptosis. We have recently observed that GC induces instant GR translocation to the mitochondria in GC-sensitive, but not in GC-resistant, T lymphoid cells. This response contrasts the nuclear translocation of GR occurring in both cell types. We propose that the sustained elevation of GR in the mitochondria following GC exposure is crucial for triggering apoptosis.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",,,20060515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, leukemia cells could repair these lesions more efficiently than normal cells and eventually survive genotoxic treatment. Elevated levels of drug-induced DSBs in leukemia cells were associated with higher activity of ATR kinase, and enhanced phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 (gamma-H2AX). gamma-H2AX eventually started to disappear in BCR/ABL cells, while continued to increase in parental cells. In addition, the expression and ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 kinase on serine 345 were often more abundant in BCR/ABL-positive leukemia cells than normal counterparts after genotoxic treatment. Inhibition of ATR kinase by caffeine but not Chk1 kinase by indolocarbazole inhibitor, SB218078 sensitized BCR/ABL leukemia cells to MMC in a short-term survival assay. Nevertheless, both caffeine and SB218078 enhanced the genotoxic effect of MMC in a long-term clonogenic assay. This effect was associated with the abrogation of transient accumulation of leukemia cells in S and G2/M cell cycle phases after drug treatment. In conclusion, ATR-Chk1 axis was strongly activated in BCR/ABL-positive cells and contributed to the resistance to DNA cross-linking agents causing numerous replication-dependent DSBs.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,20060501,"['CA87015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Patients in the low-phosphate group (median serum phosphate level, 2.0 mg per deciliter [0.6 mmol per liter]; normal level, >2.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 mmol per liter]) had elevated parathyroid hormone levels and low-to-normal serum calcium levels, were younger, and were receiving a higher dose of imatinib than patients in the normal-phosphate group (median level, 3.2 mg per deciliter [1.0 mmol per liter]). Both groups had high levels of phosphate excreted in the urine and markedly decreased serum levels of osteocalcin and N-telopeptide of collagen cross-links. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia, with associated changes in bone and mineral metabolism, develops in a proportion of patients taking imatinib for either chronic myelogenous leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The drug may inhibit bone remodeling (formation and resorption), even in patients with normal serum phosphate levels.","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2006 Aug 10;355(6):627; author reply 628-9.

Epub 2006 May 10.,"BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported about the prognostic relevance of antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of older adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 87 intensively treated AML patients (median age 69 years) were analyzed, with the aim of comparing therapeutic results and toxicity between de novo and AML secondary to a previous MDS (s-AML). Rate of CD34+ cells mobilization and feasibility of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were also compared. RESULTS: Complete remission rate, death in induction and primary resistance were not statistically different between the two groups. Median time for neutrophil recovery was similar, while s-AML patients required a longer time for platelet recovery (P = 0.04). There was no difference as to eligibility for consolidation as well as for mobilization and feasibility of ASCT. S-AML had negligible impact on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In the multivariate analysis the only parameter significantly related to either OS or DFS duration was adverse karyotype (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of s-AML does not represent a clinically relevant prognostic factor in elderly AML patients treated with aggressive therapy. Furthermore, s-AML patients can be mobilized and autografted with comparable results as opposed to de novo cases.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,20060510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 9.,"Chronic exposure to peroxisome proliferators (PPs) leads to increased incidence of liver tumors in rodents. Liver tumor induction is thought to require increased hepatocyte proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. Transcript profiling showed increased expression of proapoptotic genes and decreased expression of antiapoptotic genes in the livers of mice exposed to the PP WY-14,643 (WY). We tested the hypothesis that prior exposure to WY would increase susceptibility to apoptosis inducers such as Jo2, an antibody which activates the Fas (Apo-1/CD95) death pathway. When compared to their untreated counterparts, wild-type mice pretreated with WY exhibited increased caspase-3 activation and hepatocyte apoptosis following challenge with Jo2. Livers from WY-treated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha)-null mice were resistant to the effects of Jo2. In the absence of Jo2 and detectable apoptosis, wild-type mice treated with WY exhibited increases in the activated form of caspase-9. As caspase-9 is a component of the apoptosome, we examined the expression of upstream effectors of apoptosome activity including members of the Bcl-2 family. The levels of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 transcript and protein were significantly decreased by PPs. PPARalpha-null mice were also resistant to another treatment (concanavalin A) that induces hepatocyte apoptosis. These results (1) indicate that PPARalpha activation increases sensitivity of the liver to apoptosis and (2) identify a mechanism by which PPARalpha could serve as a pharmacological target in diseases where apoptosis is a contributing feature.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferators)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (anti-Fas monoclonal antibody)', '5V2JDO056X (Trichloroacetic Acid)', '86C4MRT55A (pirinixic acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,20060509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, development, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the first case of AML after orthotopic liver transplantation in the world, a Chinese, male, aged 46, were observed. RT-PCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression of FLT3, Pim-1, and Hsp-70 in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of the patient. Nucleotide sequence analysis was used to detect the mutation of FLT3-ITD. Flow cytometry was used to examine the protein expression of C-kit, a stem cell factor receptor, and platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRalpha). RESULTS: (1) Three months after the orthotopic liver transplantation the patient manifested symptoms and signs of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Laboratory tests found increase of white blood cells and myeloblasts with Auer's rods. Cytogenetic analysis showed a genotype of 46XY/47XY with an extra chromosome 8. Bone marrow examination revealed increased promonocytes. The diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia was made. Five months after the liver transplantation the disease developed to AML. The patient underwent combined chemotherapy (HA or DA regimens) for 5 courses and showed a partial remission both hematologically and in bone marrow examination at first, however, became resistant to all chemotherapeutic agents. RT-PCR showed absence of wild type FLT3 allele. At last the patient died of infection. (2) A FLT3-ITD mutation of ""insertion"" type was identified in the BMMCs. The Pim-1 mRNA was weakly expressed and the expression of Hsp-70 mRNA was upregulated in the BMMCs. (3) The protein expression of C-kit and that of PDGFRalpha were both upregulated in the BMMCs as showed by flow cytometry.

METHODS: A 9-mer WT1 peptide (CMTWNQMNL) containing HLA-A*0201-binding anchor motifs was synthesized. Dendritic cells (DCs) generated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an HLA-A*0201-positive healthy donor were cultured and divided into 2 groups: experimental group to be loaded with Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) peptide so as to elicit CTL's specifically for WT1 peptide, restricted by HLA-A*0201, and control group. Six days later rhTNF-alpha was added for 3 days more to promote the maturation of DCs. Before loading of WT1 peptide and 2 days after the addition of rhTNF-alpha direct immunofluorescence labeling method was used with PE or FITC labeled mono-antibodies to detect the expression of the surface antigens: CD83, CD1alpha, CD80, CD86, CD14, and HLA-DR. DCs suspended and attached to wall were collected and then divided into 2 groups: pure T cell group (group D) to be cultured in culture medium without IL-2, and IL-2 + T cell group (Group C) to be cultured in 1640 culture medium with IL-2. Eight days later the T cells of Group C were co-cultured with the DCs of the experimental group (WTI peptide + DC + IL-2 + T cells, Group A) or the DCs of the control group (DC + IL-2 + T cells, Group B). Five days later the killing activity was detected. The CTLs of Groups A, B, and C at logarithmic growth phase were mixed with leukemic cells of the lines: NB4/WT1D, NB4WT1A, NB4 (all HLA-A*0201 +, WT1 +), U937 (HLA-A*0201 +, WTl -), and K562 (HLA-A*0201 -, WTI +), and mononuclear cells of the bone marrow of leukemic patients at different effector cell-target cell of 20:1 and 10:1. MTT method was used to examine the killing rate of CTL to the target cells. RESULTS: (1) The killing rates of Group A cells to NB4/WT1 D, NB4WTA, and NB4, leukemic cells were 60.4% +/- 3.1%, 56.4% +/- 5.7%, and 55.0% +/- 3.7%, all significantly higher than those of the Group B cells (10.9% +/- 1.6%, 11.1% +/- 2.7%, and 11.9% +/- 2.5%), and those of Group C cells (9.1% +/- 1.0%, 9.2% +/- 1.7%, and 9.4% +/- 1.8%) (all P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the killing rates to U937 and K562 leukemic cells among the 3 groups. (2) When the effect-target ratio was 20: 2, the killing activity of the CTLs of Group A to the HLA-A*0201 +, WT1 + NB4/WT1 D, NB4/WT1A and NB4 leukemic cells was significantly higher than those to the HLA-A*0201 +, WT1 - U937 cells and the HLA-A*0201 -, WT1 + K562 cells (both P < 0.001), however, not significantly different from that to the U937 and K562 cells. (3) There were no significant differences in the killing activity of Group A cells to NB4/WT1D, NB4/WT1A, and NB4 cells (P = 0. 065, P = 0.621). (4) When the effect-target ratio was 10:2, the killing rates of Group A cells to the NB4/ WT1D, NB4/WT1A, and NB4 cells were 45.9% +/- 3.9%, 43.9% +/- 3.7%, and 44.1% +/- 3.2% respectively, all significantly lower than those when the effect-target ratio was 20:1 (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: CTLs specific for WT1 and restricted by HLA-A*0201 exert specific lysis upon leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells, but not upon normal hematopoietic cells, which provides a rationale for developing a strategy of WT1 peptide-based adoptive T-cell therapy and vaccination for human leukemia and solid tumors.","['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A hammerhead ribozyme gene targeting the Fas mRNA was synthesized and its expression vector pEGFP-RZ596 was constructed and transfected into the mouse spleen T cells via electroporation. The Fas expression on T cells was detected by RT-PCR and Western bloting. In the meantime the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA/CD80-IgG was constructed by gene recombinant technique and transfected into ovarian cells of hamster of the line CHO. The CD80-IgG fusion protein was purified from the supernatant of G418-selected CHO cells by Protein G affinity chromatography method. Then allogeneic mixed lymphocytes culture between the mouse spleen T cells transfected with pEGFP-RZ596 and WEHI-3 cells (mouse acute myelomonocyte leukemia cell line) incubated with CD80-IgG fusion protein was performed. The apoptosis rate of the T cells was detected with annexin V-FITC. The proliferation and killing ability in vitro against WEHI-3 cells of the T cells were detected by MTT colorimetry. RESULTS: The luminance of Fas Western bloting results from the mouse spleen T cells negative control, transfected with pEGFPC1 and transfected with pEGFP-RZ596 were separately 1, 0.98 and 0.45 (P < 0.01). After being cocultured with WEHI-3 cells, which has higher expression of Fas ligand (64% +/- 3%), the apoptosis rate and the killing ability against WEHI-3 cells of the mouse spleen T cells transfected with pEGFP-RZ596 were separately 37% and 67%. Whereas that of the mouse spleen T cells negative control and transfected with pEGFPC1 were separately 88%, 84% (P < 0.01) and 32%, 31% (P <0.01). The CD80 positive expression rate of WEHI-3 cells was upregulated from 5.1% +/- 0.4% to 27.4% +/- 2.2% after these cells were preincubated with CD80-IgG fusion protein (P < 0.01). The killing ability of the mouse spleen T cells against WEHI-3 cells preincubated and not preincubated with CD80-IgG fusion protein were separately 64% and 49% (P <0.01), but that of the mouse spleen T cells, which were transfected with pEGFP-RZ596, was further promoted to 82% (P < 0.01) CONCLUSION: The apoptosis of mouse CTL inducing by FasL-Fas pathway could be avoided and the killing ability of mouse CTL against WEHI-3 cells can be significantly promoted at the same time by combining anti-Fas ribozyme and CD80-IgG fusion protein.","['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also serve as a model for a variety of diseases and possess exemplary relevance for basic research and patient care. Leukemia research and therapy have achieved high standards and even a leading position in Germany with regard to clinical trials, standardization of diagnostics and molecular studies of prognostic factors, signal transduction and gene expression. Progress is hampered, however, by fragmentation of leukemia trial groups, diagnostic approaches and treatment research activities. GOALS: A network was therefore created to integrate the leading leukemia trial groups on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) and their interdisciplinary partners (diagnostics, treatment research, biometry) in cooperation with basic research and pharmaceutical industry to foster advancements in leukemiarelated research and health care through clinical trials, promotion of translational research, introduction of standards for diagnostics and therapy, and development of evidence-based guidelines. ACHIEVEMENTS: Achievements include establishment of central information, communication and management structures, creation of an AML intergroup comprising five study groups, formation of an MDS study group and establishment of platforms for diagnostics, genomics and proteomics, and medical informatics. Exchange of scientific progress is mediated by intra- and internet, biannual newsletters, regular project group meetings, and annual network symposia. PERSPECTIVES: On the basis of experience with the Competence Network ""Acute and chronic leukemias"" with its management, communication and information structures, the ""European LeukemiaNet"" (ELN) has been established within the 6th Framework Program of the European Union. The ELN integrates 78 leading leukemia trial groups (AML, ALL, CML, CLL, MDS, and CMPD), their 83 interdisciplinary partner groups (diagnostics, treatment research, registry, guidelines), industry and SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises) across Europe to form a cooperative network for advancements in leukemia-related research and health care.",,,"Klinische Forschung im Kompetenznetz ""Akute und chronische Leukamien"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This novel germ line mutation has not previously been reported. Of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1 has been shown to play an important role in hematologic malignancies. The novel mutation was also revealed to be a somatic aberration occurring prior to the initiation of the blast phase in a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient. Among the possible MLH1 partners involved in signaling MMR or apoptosis is the proto-oncogene c-MYC, which is closely related to cellular proliferation. We further revealed a concomitant c-MYC dramatic amplification in the CML-MLH1-mutation carrier patient, also occurring at the pre-blast phase. Our data contribute further to characterizing the mutational spectrum of the MLH1 gene. Furthermore, given the role of c-MYC and its interaction with MLH1, taken together with the mutational status of both genes revealed at the pre-blast phase in the CML patient, a plausible increased genetic instability might be expected to take place, possibly contributing to blast triggering.

The mechanism of action of these compounds is thought to involve inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II. A structure-activity study was carried out to determine the in vitro cytotoxic activity of nine novel anthrapyrazoles against human breast carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and leukemia cells, and against Chinese hamster ovary cells. The activity of these anthrapyrazole analogues was compared with that of two clinically tested anthrapyrazoles, losoxantrone and piroxantrone. Inhibition of topoisomerase II as a mechanism of action for the analogues was also investigated. The cytotoxic activity of the analogues was determined in vitro by MTT cell growth inhibition assay and inhibition of catalytic topoisomerase II activity by each compound was measured using a fluorometric DNA decatenation assay. All of the anthrapyrazole analogues inhibited the growth of the four cell lines with IC50 values that ranged from 0.1 to 45.2 microM. Losoxantrone was the most potent of the anthrapyrazole analogues studied. A tertiary amine in the basic side chain at N-2 increased the cytotoxic activity compared with a secondary amine in this side chain for many of the analogues, but not if there was a basic side chain at the C-5 position. A chlorine substituent on the basic side chain at N-2 did not have a consistent effect on activity. Moving the position of a chlorine substituent from C-5 to C-7 or introducing a basic side chain at C-5 did not have a consistent effect on cytotoxic activity. Anthrapyrazole analogues showed a broad range of activity for inhibiting topoisomerase II decatenation activity. Losoxantrone and piroxantrone were the most potent inhibitors of topoisomerase II activity. There was no significant correlation between the cytotoxic activity of the anthrapyrazole analogues and their ability to inhibit decatenation by topoisomerase II.","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '91440-30-1 (anthrapyrazole)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was treated with a combination of lamivudine and chemotherapy and consequently had longer-term survival than those reported previously. A 64-year-old(corrected 65-year-old) man was referred to our hospital in January 2002 because of ascites and abdominal tumor. He was positive for anti-HTLV-1 antibody and HBV surface antigen. Generalized computed tomography demonstrated bilateral pleural effusion, abdominal mass, and massive ascites. Cytological examination of ascitis revealed numerous atypical lymphoid cells,which were positive for CD 2, CD 5, CD 8, and CD 25. Monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus was detected by Southern blot analysis on DNA extracted from lymphoid cells. A diagnosis of acute type, CD 8 positive ATL was made. Lamivudine was administered for prevention of chemotherapy induced HBV reactivation. Subsequently, he was treated with 6 cycles of CHOP and went into remission. He maintained clinical remission during a follow-up of 13 months and then relapsed. Further salvage therapies were provided with a transient effect. He died of sepsis in February 2004.

Its profibrotic properties suggest a role in lung wound repair. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), produced by fibroblasts, is involved in pulmonary epithelial repair. We investigated the role of OSM in HGF synthesis by human lung fibroblasts. We showed that OSM upregulated HGF mRNA in MRC5 cells and in human lung fibroblasts, whereas IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor did not. OSM induced HGF secretion to a similar extent as IL-1beta in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. HGF was released in its cleaved mature form, and its secretion was completely inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating a de novo protein synthesis. OSM in combination with prostaglandin E(2), a powerful HGF inductor, led to an additive effect. OSM and indomethacin in combination further increased HGF secretion. This could be explained, at least in part, by a moderate upregulation of specific OSM receptor beta mRNA expression through cyclooxygenase inhibition. These results demonstrate that OSM-induced HGF synthesis did not involve a PGE(2) pathway. OSM-induced HGF secretion was inhibited by PD-98059 (a specific pharmacological inhibitor of ERK1/2), SB-203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor), and SP-600125 (a JNK inhibitor) by 70, 82, and 100%, respectively, whereas basal HGF secretion was only inhibited by SP-600125 by 30%. Our results demonstrate a specific upregulation of HGF synthesis by OSM, most likely through a MAPK pathway, and support the suggestion that OSM may participate in lung repair through HGF production.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 9.,"Genomic material from chromosome band 13q14.3 distal to the retinoblastoma locus is recurrently lost in a variety of human neoplasms, indicating an as-yet-unidentified tumor-suppressor mechanism. No pathogenic mutations have been found in the minimally deleted region until now. However, in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumors with loss of one copy of the critical region, respective candidate tumor-suppressor genes are down-regulated by a factor >2, which would be expected by a normal gene-dosage effect. This finding points to an epigenetic pathomechanism. We find that the two copies of the critical region replicate asynchronously, suggesting differential chromatin packaging of the two copies of 13q14.3. Although we also detect monoallelic silencing of genes localized in the critical region, monoallelic expression originates from either the maternal or paternal copy, excluding an imprinting mechanism. DNA methylation analyses revealed one CpG island of the region to be methylated. DNA demethylation of this CpG island and global histone hyperacetylation induced biallelic expression, whereas replication timing was not affected. We propose that differential replication timing represents an early epigenetic mark that distinguishes the two copies of 13q14.3, resulting in differential chromatin packaging and monoallelic expression. Accordingly, deletion of the single active copy of 13q14.3 results in significant down-regulation of the candidate genes and loss of function, providing a model for the interaction of genetic lesions and epigenetic silencing at 13q14.3 in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",,,,20060509,,PMC1472515,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 8.,"Mononuclear cell leukemia (MNCL) is an extremely common spontaneous disease of ageing F344 rats accompanied by splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukemic infiltration (initially of the spleen, liver, and lung). Rare in other rat strains, incidence in F344 rats is variable, has been increasing, and can exceed 70% in controls. MNCL cells possess natural killer (NK) cell characteristics and apparently, the neoplastic cells derive from large granular lymphocytes (LGL), hence the alternative name of LGL leukemia. LGL leukemia is uncommon in man and occurs in two forms: T-LGL leukemia which has a chronic course, and the much rarer NK-LGL leukemia. In addition to cell type, the latter resembles F344 LGL leukemia being acute in course and involving more pronounced splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Chemically related increases in MNCL in F344 rats have not been associated with induction of human LGL leukemia. Carcinogenicity studies of perchloroethylene (PERC) in several rat strains have shown moderate, not clearly dose-related, increases in MNCL only in F344 rats (two studies). There was no consistent decrease in latency and the incidence in the PERC treated groups is within the overall control range. As a response in a rat strain highly predisposed to developing MNCL, these results are not considered predictive for human cancer risk.","['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', 'TJ904HH8SN (Tetrachloroethylene)']",53,,20060508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We combined topotecan and amlodipine together into the stealthy liposomes, in which amlodipine was applied as a MDR reversing agent to overcome the resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity, apoptosis and the signalling pathway assays were performed on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562, promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 and MDR HL-60 cells, respectively. Pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity studies were performed on normal Kunming mice and female BALB/c nude mice with MDR HL-60 xenografts, respectively. RESULTS: Topotecan alone was effective in inhibiting the growth of non-resistant leukaemia cells, K562 and HL-60 cells but not the growth of MDR HL-60 cells. The resistance of topotecan in MDR HL-60 cells was potently reversed by the addition of amlodipine. Moreover, amlodipine enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of topotecan synergistically. Apoptosis was through activating caspases in a cascade: first, the initiator caspase 8 and then effectors caspase 3/7 (total activity of caspases 3 and 7) were activated. Being encapsulated into the stealthy liposomes with an acidic internal medium, topotecan existed dominantly in an active lactone species, which was reversibly changed from an inactive carboxylate form via a pH-dependent reaction. After administration of stealthy liposomes to mice, the blood exposure of the lactone form was evidently increased and extended. The antitumour effects in the MDR HL-60 xenografted tumour were stealthy liposomal topotecan (SLT) plus amlodipine > SLT > un-encapsulated topotecan > blank control. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced antitumour activity in the MDR HL-60 cells by the SLT plus amlodipine could be owing to multiple reasons: (a) synergistic apoptosis inducing effect, (b) reversing MDR by amlodipine and (c) increasing the availability of active lactone of topotecan by the stealthy liposomes. The apoptosis induced by amlodipine is through caspase 8 and then the 3/7 signalling pathway.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '1J444QC288 (Amlodipine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although originally regarded as nontoxic for normal haematopoiesis, mild to moderate myelosuppression is a commonly observed side-effect of this treatment. Recently, this molecule has been shown to suppress normal haematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. This is the first study that has investigated the effect of imatinib on haematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the number of circulating haematopoietic progenitor cells in 79 patients with CML and five patients with solid tumours who were treated with imatinib for at least 3 months. Bone marrow progenitor cells were assessed in a subgroup of 18 patients with CML after 12 months of imatinib treatment. Results were compared with haematopoietic progenitor cell numbers of normal controls. RESULTS: Circulating progenitors of all classes were significantly decreased in CML up to 24 months of imatinib therapy compared with healthy controls (median progenitor cells in CML after 12 months: CFU-GM 62, range 0-2543; BFU-E 216, range 0-3259; CFU-GEMM 0, range 0-139; versus controls: CFU-GM 208, range 50-936; BFU-E 690, range 120-1862; CFU-GEMM 20, range 4-77; P < 0.001). Similar reductions in the number of progenitor cells derived from bone marrow were found in a subgroup of 18 patients with CML. In patients with solid tumours the number of circulating progenitor cells was significantly lower under treatment with imatinib when compared with the controls.

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Review of selected studies obtained from a MEDLINE search encompassing the years 1950 to 2004. DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS: Relevant information from the selected studies was abstracted and summarized. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the Philadelphia chromosome and the subsequent discovery that it represents a translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 producing an aberrant tyrosine kinase, known as BCR-ABL1, has catalyzed our understanding and treatment of this hematologic malignancy. An extensive search for molecules to block the aberrant BCR-ABL1 protein resulted in the development of IM as an orally bioavailable agent with remarkable efficacy in producing hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remissions. However, follow-up of patients treated with IM has demonstrated that some patients can develop resistance to IM with progression of their leukemia. Multiple mechanisms of resistance have been identified. The dominant mechanism appears to be mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1, which result in altered affinity of IM for the BCR-ABL1 protein. Recently, small-molecule, combined SRC and ABL1 inhibitors have been developed and entered into clinical trials. These inhibitors appear effective in inhibiting most of the mutant BCR-ABL1 molecules that are resistant to IM. The rapid development of new therapies for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia brings the promise that this disorder can be cured or controlled in many patients with oral drugs that have a low toxicity profile.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve competency, vigilance is required. OBJECTIVE: To review the advances in clinically useful molecular biologic techniques and to identify their applications in clinical practice, as presented at the 13th Annual William Beaumont Hospital DNA Symposium. DATA SOURCES: The 4 manuscripts submitted were reviewed and their major findings were compared with the literature on the same or related topics. STUDY SELECTION: Manuscripts address the use of molecular or immunophenotyping by flow cytometry to evaluate the origin or presence of sepsis, respectively; the use of imatinib mesylate to treat chronic myeloid leukemia and the nature of resistance to imatinib; and the use of 9 and 10 fluorochromes during clinical flow cytometric studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: The epidemiologic evaluation of a septic outbreak may be monitored using molecular techniques that track the relatedness of isolates. A potential biomarker for the presence of early sepsis is CD64. Intracellular signal transduction pathways are altered in malignancy. Imatinib mesylate inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase created by translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 in chronic myeloid leukemia. Resistance to imatinib may be secondary to mutation in the BCR-ABL kinase domain or residual leukemic stem cells that imatinib does not kill. The use of 9 or 10 fluorochromes simultaneously during flow cytometry has many clinical advantages; however, software for data analysis is needed. CONCLUSION: The current postgenomic era will continue to emphasize the use of microarrays and database software for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, nutrigenomic, and pharmacogenomics screening to search for a useful clinical assay. The number of molecular pathologic techniques will expand as additional disease-associated mutations are defined.",['EC 2.3.1.85 (Fatty Acid Synthases)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to carry out the analysis of the presence of the amplification of the c-myc oncogene, as well as the analysis of the changes in the expression of Bcl-2 in the patients with CML. METHODS: Our study included 25 patients with CML (18 in chronic phase, 7 in blast transformation). Using an immunohistochemical alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method, we analyzed the expression of cell death protein in the mononuclear bone marrow cells of 25 CML patients. By a differential PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method, we followed the presence of amplified c-myc gene in mononuclear peripheral blood cells. RESULTS: The level of the expression of Bcl-2 protein was considerably higher in the bone marrow samples of the patients undergoing blast transformation of the disease. The amplification of c-myc gene was detected in 30% of the patients in blast transformation of the disease. CONCLUSION: The expression of Bcl-2 protein and the amplification of c-myc gene are in correlation with the disease progression.",['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated a rearrangement of the MLL gene and molecular genetic analyses identified a septin family gene, SEPT2, located on chromosome 2q37, as the fusion partner of MLL. RNA and DNA analyses showed the existence of an in-frame fusion of MLL exon 7 with SEPT2 exon 3, with the genomic breakpoints located in intron 7 and 2 of MLL and SEPT2, respectively. Search for DNA sequence motifs revealed the existence of two sequences with 94.4% homology with the topoisomerase II consensus cleavage site in MLL intron 7 and SEPT2 intron 2. SEPT2 is the fifth septin family gene fused with MLL, making this gene family the most frequently involved in MLL-related AML (about 10% of all known fusion partners). The protein encoded by SEPT2 is highly homologous to septins 1, 4 and 5 and is involved in the coordination of several key steps of mitosis. Further studies are warranted to understand why the septin protein family is particularly involved in the pathogenesis of MLL-associated leukemia.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",,,20060508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 8.,"PURPOSE: To update the 2000 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on the use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSF). UPDATE METHODOLOGY: The Update Committee completed a review and analysis of pertinent data published from 1999 through September 2005. Guided by the 1996 ASCO clinical outcomes criteria, the Update Committee formulated recommendations based on improvements in survival, quality of life, toxicity reduction and cost-effectiveness. RECOMMENDATIONS: The 2005 Update Committee agreed unanimously that reduction in febrile neutropenia (FN) is an important clinical outcome that justifies the use of CSFs, regardless of impact on other factors, when the risk of FN is approximately 20% and no other equally effective regimen that does not require CSFs is available. Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of FN in patients who are at high risk based on age, medical history, disease characteristics, and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen. CSF use allows a modest to moderate increase in dose-density and/or dose-intensity of chemotherapy regimens.

Epub 2006 May 8.,"Enhancement of oligodendrocyte survival through activation of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) signaling is a candidate therapeutic strategy for demyelinating disease. However, in other cell types, LIFR signaling is under tight negative regulation by the intracellular protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). We, therefore, postulated that deletion of the SOCS3 gene in oligodendrocytes would promote the beneficial effects of LIFR signaling in limiting demyelination. By studying wild-type and LIF-knockout mice, we established that SOCS3 expression by oligodendrocytes was induced by the demyelinative insult, that this induction depended on LIF, and that endogenously produced LIF was likely to be a key determinant of the CNS response to oligodendrocyte loss. Compared with wild-type controls, oligodendrocyte-specific SOCS3 conditional-knockout mice displayed enhanced c-fos activation and exogenous LIF-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Moreover, these SOCS3-deficient mice were protected against cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte loss relative to wild-type animals. These results indicate that modulation of SOCS3 expression could facilitate the endogenous response to CNS injury.","['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '5N16U7E0AO (Cuprizone)']",,,20060508,,PMC1472535,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further pinpoint these deletions, we have performed a detailed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) analysis with precisely mapped BAC probes. Eleven MDS and two AML patients with a sole cytogenetically visible del(5q) were studied. The proximal deletion endpoints were localized between 75 and 86 megabases (Mb) (5q13, five times), 86 and 96 Mb (5q14 approximately q15, four times), and at various sites in the other four. The distal breakpoints mapped between 153 and 155 Mb (5q33.2, five times), 156 and 158 Mb (5q33.3, three times), 158 and 164 Mb (5q34, two times), and 164 and 181 Mb (telomere) in three. The largest deletion was approximately 70 Mb and the smallest was 43 Mb. These studies show that cytogenetically similar appearing deletions in 5q are highly variable in molecular terms. We also found that in MDS cases with a blast count between 0 and 13%, cells with a del(5q) were present in 24-90% of interphase (nondividing) cells and in 30-100% of metaphase (dividing) cells. In the two AML patients with a blast count of 30 and 80%, del(5q) was found in 35 and 95% interphase cells and 95 and 100% of metaphase cells, respectively.

Epub 2006 May 8.,"Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by tissue involvement and organ dysfunction due to abnormal eosinophil proliferation. In a subset of patients, this is caused by the FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha fusion tyrosine kinase. Cumulative evidence indicates that the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is active for the treatment of patients with HES, particularly those expressing the FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha oncoprotein. The novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor AMN107 was initially developed as a potent Bcr-Abl inhibitor based on the molecular structure of imatinib. We tested the in vitro efficacy of imatinib and AMN107 in the EOL-1 cell line and in cells from a patient with HES harboring the FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha fusion kinase. AMN107 was as potent as imatinib in inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of EOL-1 cells, with IC(50) values of 0.54 and 0.20 nM, respectively. In addition, both drugs inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGFR-alpha tyrosine kinase with equivalent efficacy. We conclude that AMN107 and imatinib are active and equipotent against cells expressing the FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha fusion gene.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",,,20060508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from a Chinese man with M5 type AML, aged 39, and his healthy wife and daughter, all of Han nationality. HLA class I (-A, -B, and -Cw) and II (-DRB1 and -DQB1) alleles were typed by both low and high resolution PCR with sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) and sequence-based typing (SBT). Then the recombination sites were analyzed by family study. RESULTS: The 2 haplotypes of the patient, his daughter, and his wife were A*2402101-Cw*030401/0402-B*1301-DRB1*0406-DQR1*030302/0303 and A*02011-Cw*150201/0202-B*4002-DRB1*1405-DQB1*05031, A*02011-Cw*150201/0202-B*1301-DRB1*0406-DQB1*030302/0303 and A*2406-Cw*0602-B*1302_DRB1*070101/0102-DQB1*0202, and A*330301/0302-Cw*030201/0202-B*58-1-DRB1*17-DQB1*0202 and A*2406-Cw*0602-B*1302-DRB1*070101/0102-B*5801-DRB1*0202 respectively. Family study demonstrated that A*02011-Cw*150201/0202 recombination and B*1301-DRB1*030302/0303 recombination carried by the daughter came from the 2 isolated chromosomes of her father, indicating that the recombination event occurred between HLA-B and -Cw loci during meiosis of the father and resulted in a new HLA haplotype that was inherited by the daughter. CONCLUSION: An unusual HLA-B/Cw recombination event occurring between HLA-B and -Cw loci has been found in a Han family, which helps further study the mechanisms of HLA recombination.","['0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, both gene usage and mutation frequency are very similar to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type marginal zone lymphoma.

The membrane form is highly expressed on the surface of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells from patients. This study aimed to develop immunoassays for soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 proteins in human serum. METHODS: Two sandwich ELISAs for soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 were designed using two pairs of monoclonal antibodies specific to four different epitopes on IRTA2/FcRH5. RESULTS: In both ELISAs, the lower limit of quantitation for soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 in human serum was 30 ng/mL. The analytical recovery of 0.3-2.1 ng/mL of IRTA2/FcRH5-Fc used as the standard, from a 100-fold dilution of IRTA2/FcRH5-free sera, was 94-106% for ELISA #1 and 89-97% for ELISA #2. Between-assay coefficients of variance were 7.7-17.6% for ELISA #1 and 7.7-32.7% for ELISA #2. Both ELISAs detected soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 protein in sera from normal donors (median 169 ng/mL in ELISA #1 and 146 ng/mL in ELISA #2, n=123) without correlations to gender or age. A marked increase in soluble IRTA2/FcRH5 levels was observed in samples from patients with HCL (medians 719 ng/mL in ELISA #1 and 754 ng/mL in ELISA #2, n=44).

In these cases, the quantification of PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma) transcripts could be useful. METHODS: PRAME transcripts were quantified by real-time RT-PCR in normal and leukaemic samples, and the results were compared with those of conventional RT-PCR. Basal expression of PRAME was determined in 25 blood samples and 25 bone marrow samples from healthy donors, as well as in 12 haematological cell lines (Jurkat, K562, HL60, DOHH2, IM9, Daudi, CEM, KG1, DG75, 8226, U937, Raji). RESULTS: In paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n=22) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=17), and in adult AML (n=20), abnormal PRAME expression was found in 41%, 35% and 40% of cases, respectively. To assess the sensitivity of PRAME for monitoring MRD, PRAME-positive t(8;21) AML samples with detectable AML1/ETO expression by conventional RT-PCR (n=17) were assessed for quantitative expression of AML1/ETO and PRAME. The expression of these genes was closely correlated. To confirm that PRAME expression was correlated with clinical data, the expression of PRAME was also sequentially followed in patients (n=13) from onset to cytological remission or relapse. The cytological and molecular data were highly correlated in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that PRAME quantification by real-time RT-PCR appears suitable for monitoring MRD in PRAME-positive leukaemia.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its ability to induce bronchoconstriction is well documented. It is highly soluble, initially forming sulfite ions in solution. Sulfur oxides are important constituents of other pollutants, such as diesel exhaust and fine particulates. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cellular responses of sulfite on cultured mast cells (rat basophilic leukemia [RBL-2H3] cells) and human peripheral blood basophils. METHODS: Sulfite-induced mast cell degranulation and intracellular production of reactive oxygen species were evaluated in the presence and absence of antioxidants and inhibitors of redox metabolism. Degranulation was determined using beta-hexosaminidase, serotonin, and histamine release assays. Induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species generation was determined using the redox-sensitive dye 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. RESULTS: Sodium sulfite induced degranulation and the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species in RBL-2H3 cells. These responses were inhibited by the free radical scavenger tetramethylthiourea and the flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenyliodinium but not by depletion of extracellular calcium. Peripheral blood basophils also showed histamine release after exposure to sodium sulfite CONCLUSIONS: Sulfite, the aqueous ion of sulfur dioxide, induces cellular activation, leading to degranulation in mast cells through a non-IgE-dependent pathway. The response also differs from IgE-mediated degranulation in that it is insensitive to the influx of extracellular calcium. The putative pathway seems to rely on activation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex, leading to intracellular oxidative stress.","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfites)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'VTK01UQK3G (sodium sulfite)']",,,,['T32-07524/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 7.,"The proto-oncogene AKT (also known as PKB) is activated in many human cancers, mostly owing to loss of the PTEN tumour suppressor. In such tumours, AKT becomes enriched at cell membranes where it is activated by phosphorylation. Yet many targets inhibited by phosphorylated AKT (for example, the FOXO transcription factors) are nuclear; it has remained unclear how relevant nuclear phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) function is for tumorigenesis. Here we show that the PMLtumour suppressor prevents cancer by inactivating pAKT inside the nucleus. We find in a mouse model that Pml loss markedly accelerates tumour onset, incidence and progression in Pten-heterozygous mutants, and leads to female sterility with features that recapitulate the phenotype of Foxo3a knockout mice. We show that Pml deficiency on its own leads to tumorigenesis in the prostate, a tissue that is exquisitely sensitive to pAkt levels, and demonstrate that Pml specifically recruits the Akt phosphatase PP2a as well as pAkt into Pml nuclear bodies. Notably, we find that Pml-null cells are impaired in PP2a phosphatase activity towards Akt, and thus accumulate nuclear pAkt. As a consequence, the progressive reduction in Pml dose leads to inactivation of Foxo3a-mediated transcription of proapoptotic Bim and the cell cycle inhibitor p27(kip1). Our results demonstrate that Pml orchestrates a nuclear tumour suppressor network for inactivation of nuclear pAkt, and thus highlight the importance of AKT compartmentalization in human cancer pathogenesis and treatment.","['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",,,20060507,"['P50 CA092629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA092629-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137050/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1976603,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS26758'],,,,

Because these patients may be stratified to a low-intensity treatment, we have investigated the sensitivity of flow cytometry (FCM), G-band karyotyping (GBK), and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH) in detecting high hyperdiploid leukemic clones. Twenty-six girls and 34 boys with acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed in 1998 to 1999 were analyzed by FCM, GBK, and HR-CGH. The correlations between DNA indices obtained by FCM, GBK, and HR-CGH were significant (rs=0.61 to 0.77; P<0.001 for all comparisons). However, in 4 of 18 patients, high hyperdiploidy was overlooked by GBK or HR-CGH, and even when FCM was applied, 2 of 18 patients with high hyperdiploidy by GBK and/or HR-CGH were classified as nonhigh hyperdiploid. If high hyperdiploid subclones were included, FCM could detect all high hyperdiploid patients found by either GBK or HR-CGH, but would then in addition classify 15% to 20% of the remaining patients as high hyperdiploid. Thus, both GBK and HR-CGH overlook patients with high hyperdiploidy, and FCM only detects all high hyperdiploid patients if small high hyperdiploid clones are included. In addition, FCM detects patients with high hyperdiploid subclones, not detected by either GBK or HR-CGH, and the challenge remains to determine the prognosis of patients with such high hyperdiploid subclones.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best therapy for these patients is not known. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of enrolling children with recurrent ALL in a standardized treatment protocol that included receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). PROCEDURE: Eligible patients with a bone marrow relapse of non-T, non-B ALL underwent a common induction and consolidation followed by receipt of either an allogeneic HSCT from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or an autologous HSCT purged with B-4 blocked ricin. A common conditioning regimen was used for all patients. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients from eight institutions were enrolled. Fourteen patients did not receive a transplant during the study, because of toxicity (4), relapse (1), inadequate purging (1), and parental or physician preference for an alternative donor transplant (8). Six patients received allogeneic HSCTs. Five of them have remained in remission for a median of 78 months. Eight patients received autologous HSCTs purged with B4-blocked ricin. Four have remained in remission for a median of 94 months. Of the nine patients who received alternative donor transplants, only two remain in remission. CONCLUSION: We conclude that well designed and controlled prospective studies are necessary to define the role of HSCTs in children with recurrent ALL.

Here, we used CGI-55 as a ""bait"" in a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified eight interacting proteins: Daxx, Topoisomerase I binding RS (Topors), HPC2, UBA2, TDG, and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) (PIAS)-1, -3, and -y. These proteins are either structurally or functionally associated with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), protein sumoylation, or the regulation of transcription. The interactions of CGI-55 with Daxx, Topors, PIASy, and UBA2 were confirmed by in vivo colocalization experiments in HeLa cells, by using green (GFP) and red fluorescence fusion proteins. A mapping study of the CGI-55 binding site for these proteins revealed three distinct patterns of interaction. The fact that CGI-55-GFP has been localized in cytoplasm and nucleus in a dotted manner, and its interaction with proteins associated with PML-NBs, suggested that CGI-55 might be associated with nuclear bodies. Although Daxx and Topors co-localized with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), CGI-55 itself as well as PIASy and UBA2 showed only little co-localization with PML. However, we observed that CGI-55 localizes to the nucleolus and co-localizes with p80-coilin positive nuclear-coiled bodies.","['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SERBP1 protein, human)', '136882-81-0 (p80-coilin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current evidence suggesting a role for topo II in the repair of DNA damage has been obtained by using in vitro model systems or inferred from correlative data in drug resistant cell lines. In this study we directly examined the role of topo IIalpha and beta in mediating the repair of melphalan-induced crosslinks in cellular DNA. To accomplish this, we used siRNA technology to knock down either topo IIalpha or beta in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 and histiocytic lymphoma U937 cell line. Our data demonstrate that topo IIbeta levels, (but not alpha), are a determinant of melphalan-induced crosslinks and sensitivity to melphalan. Furthermore, we show that knocking down topo IIbeta inhibits the repair of melphalan-induced crosslinks in K562 cells. These studies represent the first direct evidence that topo IIbeta participates in the repair of DNA damage induced by an alkylating agent in cellular DNA. Finally, these results suggest non-redundant roles for these two isoforms in mediating repair of DNA crosslinks.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,20060328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives, outcomes, and quality of the 16 included studies were extracted by two reviewers. Weighted summary estimates of relative risks (RR) were calculated for FN and documented infection (DI). Mean differences in hospitalization, antibiotic use, and duration of neutropenia were calculated. RESULTS: FN occurred in 68% of 400 controls and 59% of 404 CSF patients. The estimated RR was 0.88 [0.81-0.97; (P=0.01)] favoring the CSFs for leukemia and high grade lymphoma studies and 0.71 [0.51-0.97; (P=0.03)] for solid tumor studies. DI occurred in 25% of controls and 20% of CSF patients for an estimated RR of 0.80 [0.61-1.06; (P=0.12)]. The mean decrease in duration of neutropenia was 3.5 days [2.2-4.7; (P<0.0001)]. Mean decreases favoring CSF use were also observed for hospital stay of 1.7 days [0.9-2.5 (P<0.01)] and antibiotic use of 2.0 days [0.4-3.6; P=0.02]. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic CSFs significantly decrease the incidence of FN and the durations of severe neutropenia, hospitalization, and antibiotic use in pediatric cancer patients, but they do not significantly decrease documented infections.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",128,,20060505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 5.,"We previously found that 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (oh(8)dG) kills KG-1, a human myelocytic leukemic cell line with mutational loss of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) activity in vitro. This observation prompted us to investigate the cytotoxicity of oh(8)dG on KG-1 in vivo. This cytotoxicity was observed by administrating oh(8)dG (3.3-330mg/kgb.w./day) for 14 days into nude mice bearing a KG-1 myelosarcoma. The results were as follows; oh(8)dG inhibited the growth of KG-1 myelosarcoma dose-dependently in terms of tumor size and weight, but had no effect on the growth of myelosarcoma of U937, a human monocytic leukemic cell line possessing wild-type OGG1. 6-Thioguanine (6-TG), an anticancer drug inhibited the growths of KG-1 and U937 tumors. 2'-Deoxyguanosine (dG) had a statistically insignificant anti-growth effect on both tumors. The oh(8)dG-treated KG-1 tumor showed the increased expression of apoptosis-processing caspases 8, 9 and 3 together with DNA fragmentation, the increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors, p16 and p27, and the decreased expression of cell cycle accelerator, cyclins and cdks, indicating the nature of cytotoxicity is cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The genomic DNA of oh(8)dG-treated KG-1 tumors showed an increase in OGG1 sensitive sites, which is consistent with an increase in the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (oh(8)Gua) level in the DNA of KG-1 treated with oh(8)dG in vitro. Presumably an increased level of oh(8)Gua in DNA may trigger the cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that oh(8)dG is selectively cytotoxic to KG-1 or tumors that are OGG1-deficient.","[""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",,,20060505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Mar 6.,"Our previous works have shown that bone marrow stromal cells secrete thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) and AcSDKP. Tbeta4 and AcSDKP are existed in the conditioned medium of bone marrow endothelial cells. They exerted inhibitory effects on hematopoietic cells and then had protective effect on the early hematopoietic cells, which were cultured in the presence of hematopoietic stimulators. Thymosin beta4 consists of 43 peptides with a molecular weight of 4963. It contains at its N-terminal end the sequence of the acetylated tetrapeptide Ac-N-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP). This study was performed to evaluate the effect of Tbeta4 and AcSDKP on the growth of HL-60 cells. It was showed that Tbeta4 (10(-11)-10(-7)mol/L) and AcSDKP (10(-11)-10(-7)mol/L) had the dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HL-60 cells. Based on cell morphology and NBT reduction, Tbeta4 and AcSDKP induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Morphologic and DNA fragment analysis proved that Tbeta4 and AcSDKP induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. In order to analyze the mechanism of the effects of Tbeta4 and AcSDKP, intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) of HL-60 leukemic cells was tested and Atlas cDNA Expression Array was performed. The results showed that Tbeta4 and AcSDKP could increased [Ca(2+)](i) by stimulating the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular Ca(2+) pool. Moreover, AcSDKP could also elicit a potent extracelluar calcium influx in HL-60 cells. Tbeta4 could also change apoptotic-related gene expression in leukemic cells, and resulted in the inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic cells.","['0 (Oligopeptides)', '549LM7U24W (thymosin beta(4))', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,20060306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-six adults with chronic liver diseases (chronic hepatitis C, n = 48; chronic hepatitis B, n = 10; alcohol chronic liver disease, n = 8) treated at the Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology from 1999 to 2001, composed the study group. Liver biopsy specimens were used for immunohistochemical assessment of expression of Ki-67, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and B-cell lymphoma-leukemia-2 (Bcl-2). Grade of liver inflammation and stage of fibrosis were evaluated according to the Scheuer scale. RESULTS: Expression of Ki-67 in hepatocytes was most intensive in patients with grade 2 and 3 inflammation. The expression in patients with grade 4 inflammation was low. The expression of Ki-67 in lymphocytes was most intensive in patients with grade 2 inflammation. Expression of TGF-beta1 in hepatocytes reached a maximum in patients with grade 2 or 3 inflammation and dropped in patients with grade 4 inflammation. There was a statistically significant correlation between stage of fibrosis and expression of TGF-beta1 in liver stromal cells. A very strong correlation was found between the expression of Bcl-2 in bile ductules epithelium and the grade of inflammation (P = 0.006). The expression of Bcl-2 in hepatocytes was observed only in patients with very intense liver inflammation (grade 3) and in patients with stage 3 or 4 fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Processes of proliferation, fibrosis and apoptosis are not directly correlated to progression of liver disease. Expression of studied markers can be used for analysis of dynamics of these processes.","['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",,,,,,,,"['J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2007 Sep;22(9):1556.

The null genotypes among GSTT1 (GSTT1 -/-) in ALL, ANLL and control group were 50.9%, 55.0% and 49.0% but their differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The incidences of GSTM1 -/- and GSTT1 -/- combined genotype in ALL, ANLL and control group were 33.0%, 40.0% and 27.5%, of which the difference between ANLL group and control group was statistically significant (P < 0.05) and CYP1A1 gene heterozygous mutation type or homozygous mutation type combined with GSTM1 -/- and GSTT1 -/- increased the risk of ANLL (OR value 1.890, 95% CI: 1.084-3.295). CONCLUSION: These results indicated that both the variation of CYP1A1 gene or GSTT1 -/- genotype alone might not be associated with the susceptibility of acute leukemia while GSTM1 -/- genotype alone or combined with GSTT1 -/- or the 3801 T-C variation of CYP1A1 gene were correlated with ANLL. These findings suggest that GSTM1 - / - genotype alone or in combination with other defective genotypes might serve as risk factors to the etiology of ANLL.","['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, a 45-kDa isoform of PLZF without a BTB domain was identified via yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal region of ATP7B as bait in our determination of the biological roles of the Wilson disease protein outside of its copper-binding domain. Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the hepatocytic isoform of PLZF could specifically interact with the C-terminal region of ATP7B. The immunostaining of HepG2 cells revealed that the ATP7B and PLZF proteins were apparently colocalized into the trans-Golgi complexes. It was also determined that disruption of PLZF expression in the HepG2 cells affected an attenuation of ERK activity in a dose-dependent manner. The hepatocytic activities of ERK kinase were found to be enhanced as the result of PLZF or ATP7B expression, but this enhancement was abrogated by the deletion of the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Furthermore, a transgenic Drosophila strain that ectopically expressed the hepatocytic deltaBTB-PLZF exhibited phenotypic changes in eye and wing development, and these alterations were fully recovered as the result of ATP7B expression, indicating the obvious in vivo interaction between the two proteins. Those PLZF-induced abnormalities were attributed to the enhancement of ERK signaling, as was shown by phenotypic reversions with loss-of-function mutations in ERK signal transduction in Drosophila. These data suggest the existence of a mechanism that regulates ERK signaling via the C-terminus of ATP7B and the ATP7B-interacting hepatocytic PLZF.","['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 7.2.2.8 (ATP7B protein, human)', 'EC 7.2.2.8 (Copper-Transporting ATPases)']",,,,,,,,,,"['2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 5.,"Tumor-associated peptides isolated by acid elution are frequently used for therapeutic immunization against various tumors both in mice and in humans. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the frequent accessibility of a large tumor burden allows for extraction of peptides from leukemia cells by using either citrate-phosphate (CP) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) buffer. To develop an optimal immunotherapeutic protocol for AML patients, we evaluated both in mice and in humans, the immunogenicity of peptides eluted from leukemia cells with the two acids (TFA or CP). Although ex vivo studies in mice showed that both prophylactic immunizations with mature dendritic cells (DC) loaded with TFA-peptides (DC/TFA), or CP-peptides (DC/CP), were able to stimulate specific antileukemia immune responses, only vaccination with DC/TFA was able to prevent leukemia outgrowth. Moreover, in humans, only DC/TFA generated significant antileukemia CD4(+) and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell responses in vitro. In summary, these data demonstrate that the choice of the acid elution procedure to isolate immunogenic peptides strongly influences the efficacy of the antileukemia immune responses. These finding raise essential considerations for the development of immunotherapeutic protocols for cancer patients. In our model, our results argue for the use of the TFA elution method to extract immunogenic AML-associated peptides.","['0 (Acids)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Citrates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphates)', 'E5R8Z4G708 (Trifluoroacetic Acid)']",,,20060505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective and descriptive. SETTING: Children's homes in Oregon and southwestern Washington. SAMPLE: 9 children with ALL (aged 8-16 years), 6 fathers, and 7 mothers. The children received vincristine during the maintenance phase of their outpatient chemotherapy treatments. METHODS: With age-appropriate, paper-and-pencil diaries and wrist actigraphy, data were collected for three days in the families' homes. Families were reminded by telephone to complete their sleep and activity diaries. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue in school-age children and their fathers and mothers. FINDINGS: Most of the families who were approached indicated willingness to participate in the study. After receiving outpatient chemotherapy, the children reported pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue data over three days. Fathers and mothers also reported symptoms. Actigraphy showed children waking more often during the night than mothers or fathers. CONCLUSIONS: Children's pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue suggest that the symptoms are influencing families' quality of life. Larger studies are needed to examine the symptom patterns and health outcomes of children, fathers, and mothers over the course of chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Improving sleep and managing pain and fatigue after chemotherapy treatment for children with ALL may improve health outcomes for children and parents.",,,,20060503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 4.,"Human mast cells have been shown to release histamine in response to the neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), but it is unknown whether these cells express proopiomelanocortin (POMC) or POMC-derived peptides. We therefore examined highly purified human skin mast cells and a leukemic mast cell line-1 (HMC-1) for their ability to express POMC and members of the prohormone convertase (PC) family known to process POMC. Furthermore, we investigated whether these cells store and secrete alpha-MSH. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that both skin mast cells and HMC-1 cells express POMC mRNA and protein. Expression of the POMC gene at the RNA level in HMC-1 cells could be confirmed by Northern blotting. Transcripts for both PC1 and furin convertase were detectable in skin-derived mast cells and HMC-1 cells, as shown by RT-PCR. In contrast, PC2 transcripts were detected only in skin mast cells, whereas transcripts for paired basic amino acid converting enzyme 4 (PACE4) were present only in HMC-1 cells. Radioimmunoassays performed on cell lysates and cell culture supernatants from human skin-derived mast cells disclosed immunoreactive amounts of alpha-MSH in both fractions. Stimulation with an anti-IgE antibody significantly reduced intracellular alpha-MSH and increased extracellular levels, indicating IgE-mediated secretion of this neuropeptide. Our findings show that human mast cells are active players in the cutaneous POMC system. Mast cell-derived alpha-MSH may contribute to cutaneous hyperpigmentation as seen in patients with urticaria pigmentosa. Moreover, IgE-dependent release of alpha-MSH suggests an immunomodulatory role of this neurohormone during inflammatory and allergic reactions of the skin.","['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '581-05-5 (alpha-MSH)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,20060504,,,,,,['J Invest Dermatol. 2006 Sep;126(9):1934-6.

In 28 patients, gray scale transformed pseudo-3D images of 100 nuclei (May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained bone marrow smears) were analyzed. FD was determined by the Minkowski-Bouligand method extended to three dimensions. Goodness-of-fit of FD was estimated by the R2 values in the log-log plots. Whereas FD presented no prognostic relevance, patients with higher R2 values showed a prolonged survival. White blood cell count (WBC), age and mean fluorescence intensity of CD45 (MFICD45) were all unfavorable prognostic factors in univariate analyses. In a multivariate Cox-regression, R2, WBC, and MFICD45, entered the final model, which showed to be stable in a bootstrap resampling study. Blasts with lower R2 values, equivalent to accentuated ""coarseness"" of the chromatin pattern, which may reflect profound changes of the DNA methylation, indicated a poor prognosis.

Epub 2006 May 4.,"We studied the cellular and molecular effects of the combination of an anthracycline with 2 different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs): vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) and valproic acid (VPA). The 10% inhibitory concentration (IC(10)) of idarubicin was 0.5 nM in MOLT4 and 1.5 nM in HL60 cells. Concentrations above 0.675 microM of vorinostat resulted in at least 80% loss of cell viability in both cell lines. Concentrations of 1.5 to 3 mM of VPA induced 50% to 60% loss in viability in HL60 and 80% in MOLT4 cells. The combination of idarubicin with vorinostat at 0.075 microM or VPA at 0.25 mM resulted in at least an additive loss of cell viability in both lines. Vorinostat (0.35 microM) and VPA (0.25 mM) in combination with idarubicin (0.5 nM) resulted in a significant increase in apoptotic cells in MOLT4 cells. The combination resulted in an increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation at 24 hours, phosphorylated H2AX, as well as in the induction of p21(CIP1) mRNA. No effect on cell cycle transition was observed. Of importance, the cellular and molecular effects observed were independent of the sequence used. In summary, the combination of an anthracycline with an HDACI should have significant clinical activity in patients with leukemia.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,20060504,"['CA100067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895868,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 4.,"The stem cell leukemia gene SCL, also known as TAL-1, encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed in erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytic, and hematopoietic stem cells. To be able to make use of the unique tissue-restricted and spatio-temporal expression pattern of the SCL gene, we have generated a knock-in mouse line containing the tTA-2S tetracycline transactivator under the control of SCL regulatory elements. Analysis of this mouse using different tetracycline-dependent reporter strains demonstrated that switchable transgene expression was restricted to erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, granulocytes, and, importantly, to the c-kit-expressing and lineage-negative cell fraction of the bone marrow. In addition, conditional transgene activation also was detected in a very minor population of endothelial cells and in the kidney. However, no activation of the reporter transgene was found in the brain of adult mice. These findings suggested that the expression of tetracycline-responsive reporter genes recapitulated the known endogenous expression pattern of SCL. Our data therefore demonstrate that exogenously inducible and reversible expression of selected transgenes in myeloid, megakaryocytic, erythroid, and c-kit-expressing lineage-negative bone marrow cells can be directed through SCL regulatory elements. The SCL knock-in mouse presented here represents a powerful tool for studying normal and malignant hematopoiesis in vivo.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",,,20060504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 4.,"Most patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) express PML-RAR alpha, the fusion product of t(15;17)(q22;q11.2). Transgenic mice expressing PML-RAR alpha develop APL with long latency, low penetrance, and acquired cytogenetic abnormalities. Based on observations that 4% to 10% of APL patients harbor oncogenic ras mutations, we coexpressed oncogenic K-ras from its endogenous promoter with PML-RAR alpha to generate a short-latency, highly penetrant mouse model of APL. The APL disease was characterized by splenomegaly, leukocytosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) in spleen and liver with an increased proportion of immature myeloperoxidase-expressing myeloid forms; transplantability to secondary recipients; and lack of cytogenetic abnormalities. Bone marrow cells showed enhanced self-renewal in vitro. This model establishes a role for oncogenic ras in leukemia pathogenesis and thus validates the oncogenic RAS signaling pathway as a potential target for therapeutic inhibition in leukemia patients. This mouse model should be useful for investigating signaling pathways that promote self-renewal in APL and for testing the in vivo efficacy of RAS signaling pathway inhibitors in conjunction with other targeted therapies such as ATRA (all trans retinoic acid) and arsenic trioxide.","['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,20060504,"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK51564/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA109117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895511,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this method, we were able to detect one Bonna 12 HCL cell in either 10(6) Jurkat cells or in 10(6) normal mononuclear cells. We studied 84 samples from 10 patients, taken before or after treatment with BL22 and other agents.

RQ-PCR was positive in 62 of 62 (100%) flow-positive samples in 10 patients and in 20 of 22 (91%) flow-negative samples in six patients. The relative level of MRD as quantified by RQ-PCR correlated with disease status and remission. Thus, patient-specific RQ-PCR is the most sensitive test for MRD in HCL patients and could be used to determine maximal response in patients obtaining multiple cycles of nonmyelotoxic biological treatment for this disease.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if Mer expression is ectopic in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and potentially important in leukemogenesis, we analyzed Mer expression in normal human thymocytes and lymphocytes and in pediatric ALL patient samples. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Reverse transcription-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry were used to determine expression of Mer in sorted human thymocyte populations, lymphocytes, and lymphocytes activated by phytohemagglutinin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionophore. Mer expression in 34 T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patient samples was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR, and Mer protein expression in a separate cohort of 16 patient samples was assayed by flow cytometry and Western blot. RESULTS: Mer expression was absent in normal thymocytes or lymphocytes, and in T cells activated with phytohemagglutinin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionophore. In contrast, Jurkat cells and T-ALL patient samples expressed unique 180 to 185 kDa Mer protein glycoforms. Substantial Mer RNA levels were principally observed in a subset of T-ALL patient samples that expressed B220 (P = 0.004) but lacked surface expression of CD3 (P = 0.02) and CD4 (P = 0.006), a phenotypic profile consistent with immature lymphoblasts. In addition, 8 of 16 T-ALL patient samples had Mer protein detected by flow cytometry and Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: Transforming Mer signals may contribute to T-cell leukemogenesis, and abnormal Mer expression may be a novel therapeutic target in pediatric ALL therapy.","['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MERTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)']",,,,"['T32 CA082086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA8608604/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also previously showed that RLI-mediated tumor rejection involved IFN-gamma-producing RLI-derived CD8+ cells and non-RLI, recipient-derived CD4 T cells, leading to the generation of anti-tumor cytotoxic cells. However, the mechanisms of such paradoxical anti-tumor responses remained to be clarified. In the present study, we further explored the cellular mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects of RLI in fully MHC-mismatched and haploidentical strain combinations. In both cases, we show that RLI breaks the tolerance of chimeric T cells toward donor antigens, in association with the in vivo expansion of recipient splenic T, B and CD4-CD8- cells and the production of IFN-gamma. RLI leads to the development of two types of tumor-specific responses. The first is mediated by indirect presentation of donor antigens and occurs independently of tumor injection. The second is observed only in recipients of RLI and tumor and may involve responses to self antigens. Anti-tumor cytotoxicity was mediated by CD8+ or CD4-CD8- effector cells. Thus, anti-tumor cytotoxic responses are generated following complex interactions between recipient APCs presenting donor and recipient antigens and host-type CD4+, CD8+ and CD4-CD8- cells.",,,,20060503,['R01 CA79989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By culturing NALM-6 with repeated and increasing concentrations of SNAP, we obtained a variant (NALM-6R) that retains >95% viability and does not enter into apoptosis during 24 h culture in the presence of up to 500 microM SNAP or 750 microM DETA-NO. A power blot screen performed with 277 antibodies on cell lysates from NALM-6 and NALM-6R cultured without NO donors served to determine the altered constitutive expression of 19 proteins in NALM-6R. Proteins affected in the less sensitive cell line NALM6-R are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell interactions, signal transduction, cell morphology, and cell motility. This model shows that repeated exposure of tumor cells to NO may either select NO-resistant cells or contribute to NO-sensitive conversion into NO-resistant cells.

Several reports have shown that RUNX1 participates in megakaryopoiesis, which is a process that leads to formation of platelets. However, to date, the mechanisms by which this occurs have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether siRNA-mediated depletion of RUNX1 affected megakaryopoiesis of UT-7/GM cells. The depletion of RUNX1 in UT-7/GM cells resulted in up-regulation of the expression of megakaryocytic markers and polyploidization, while cell proliferation was down-regulated. Furthermore, the overexpression of RUNX1 decreased the activity of megakaryocytic gene promoters. These results suggest that RUNX1 down-regulates terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes and promotes proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitors.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,20060425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anagrelide is the latest addition to the therapeutic arsenal, and the basis for its use is reviewed. The platelet-lowering efficacy is 70 to 80% in essential thrombocythemia, and the response is rapid; most of the patients reach the treatment goal within a few weeks. Side effects are common, mainly caused by the vascular effects, and include palpitation, headache, loose stools/diarrhea, and edema. Some side effects are time-limited, but late dropout from therapy is not uncommon. The total dropout rate in prospective studies is 30 to 50%. Pharmacologic treatment of side effects is often helpful. Cardiac insufficiency may be worsened in patients with previous heart failure, and special caution is warranted in such patients. Anagrelide has recently been registered in Europe as a second-line therapy in ET but is often used as first-line therapy in the United States, especially in younger patients, due to the concern about increased leukemia risk with cytostatic treatment. The first randomized anagrelide study, with its limitations, gives support for the second-line registration.

For diagnosis of MPD-T, the classification according to the World Health Organization or to the Rotterdam criteria is preferred because they distinguish true essential thrombocythemia from prefibrotic or early fibrotic idiopathic myelofibrosis and prepolycythemic polycythemia vera. The histopathology-based nosological distinction provided by these classifications yields valuable information on prognosis (including the risks of transition into secondary acute myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis). Another serious complication in MPD-T is thrombosis (arterial or venous), the main risk factors of which are age, previous thrombosis, platelet counts 350 to 2,200 x 10 (9)/L (peak at approximately 900 x 10 (9)/L) and the presence of additional thrombophilic risk factors (hereditary thrombophilia, any hypercoagulable state, cardiovascular disease). The hemorrhagic risk starts increasing progressively at platelet counts > 1,000 x 10 (9)/L. Treatment should be stratified with respect to the thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks. In high-risk patients, thromboreductive therapy is warranted. All of the cytostatic drugs, including hydroxyurea, may be leukemogenic and should be given only to patients > 60 years old, whereas anagrelide or interferon alpha are preferred in younger individuals. In low-risk patients, antiaggregation therapy is sufficient, unless the platelet count exceeds 1,000 x 10 (9)/L, which is another indication for thromboreduction. Thrombopheresis is indicated in thrombocythemia > 2,000 x 10 (9)/L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, it may be assumed that most series of patients with so-called ET include a considerable fraction of patients with the latter entities. The diagnostic impact of bone marrow (BM) histopathology was recognized by the World Health Organization classification, which emphasizes for the first time positive criteria for ET. The need of a more accurate ET diagnosis is obvious, in particular regarding therapeutic strategies and outcome (i.e., progression into myelofibrosis and blastic crisis). Conversely, early CIMF with accompanying thrombocythemia mimicking (true) ET is characterized by a higher rate of evolution into myelofibrosis and fatal complications. A scrutinized discrimination of thrombocythemias resulting in a clear-cut diagnosis of true versus false ET is warranted by a professional evaluation of BM biopsies in ongoing and prospective clinical trials.",,148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) screening for the detection of chromosomal aberrations involving the TCR loci, TCRalphadelta (14q11), TCRbeta (7q34) and TCRgamma (7p14), has not been conducted so far. Therefore, we initiated a screening of 126 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma cases and 19 T-ALL cell lines using FISH break-apart assays for the different TCR loci. Genomic rearrangements of the TCRbeta locus were detected in 24/126 cases (19%), most of which (58.3%) were not detected upon banding analysis. Breakpoints in the TCRalphadelta locus were detected in 22/126 cases (17.4%), whereas standard cytogenetics only detected 14 of these 22 cases. Cryptic TCRalphadelta/TCRbeta chromosome aberrations were thus observed in 22 of 126 cases (17.4%). Some of these chromosome aberrations target new putative T-cell oncogenes at chromosome 11q24, 20p12 and 6q22. Five patients and one cell line carried chromosomal rearrangements affecting both TCRbeta and TCRalphadelta loci. In conclusion, this study presents the first inventory of chromosomal rearrangements of TCR loci in T-ALL, revealing an unexpected high number of cryptic chromosomal rearrangements of the TCRbeta locus and further broadening the spectrum of genes putatively implicated in T-cell oncogenesis.",,,,20060504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used array-comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH) and identified a novel recurrent 9q34 amplification in 33% (12/36) of pediatric T-ALL samples, which is therefore one of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities observed in T-ALL thus far. The exact size of the amplified region differed among patients, but the critical region encloses approximately 4 Mb and includes NOTCH1. The 9q34 amplification may lead to elevated expression of various genes, and MRLP41, SSNA1 and PHPT1 were found significantly expressed at higher levels. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that this 9q34 amplification was in fact a 9q34 duplication on one chromosome and could be identified in 17-39 percent of leukemic cells at diagnosis. Although this leukemic subclone did not predict for poor outcome, leukemic cells carrying this duplication were still present at relapse, indicating that these cells survived chemotherapeutic treatment. Episomal NUP214-ABL1 amplification and activating mutations in NOTCH1, two other recently identified 9q34 abnormalities in T-ALL, were also detected in our patient cohort. We showed that both of these genetic abnormalities occur independently from this newly identified 9q34 duplication.","['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NUP214-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",,,20060504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 4.,"Telomerase is a complex ribonucleoprotein enzyme that exhibits elevated activity in the majority of cases of human leukemia. We have previously shown that retroviral expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), in human cord blood CD34+ cells leads to an enhanced survival of mature hematopoietic cells. The mechanism for this pro-survival effect is not known. Here, we show that telomerase may play a role in leukemogenesis as a survival factor, independent of its role in maintaining telomere length. Retroviral expression of hTERT in the cytokine-dependent, human hematopoietic progenitor cell line, TF-1, resulted in the survival of cells following the withdrawal of cytokine, with protection from apoptosis, but did not promote unlimited replicative potential. This hTERT-mediated effect on cell survival does not involve Bcl-2 family members, results in accumulation of cells in G1 and appears to operate via autocrine expression of IL-3 and activation of the p53/p21 pathway. Survival in the absence of cytokine stimulation was also observed following retroviral expression of hTERT in normal cord blood CD34+ cells. This study demonstrates a novel pro-survival role for hTERT and may have important implications for the role of hTERT in the pathogenesis of leukemia and drug resistance.","['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,20060504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 4.,"Chromosome condensation is essential for proper segregation of duplicated sister chromatids in mitosis. Mammalian erythroid maturation is also associated with gradual nuclear condensation. However, few proteins that are directly involved in chromosome condensation during erythropoiesis have been identified. In this report, we show that MTB (more than blood), which was initially isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein stem cell leukemia (SCL), and later identified as the murine homolog of the condensin II subunit CAP-G2, participates in erythroid cell development. MTB interacts with SCL and another hematopoietic bHLH protein, E12, and is recruited to the nucleus by SCL and E12. In addition, MTB can repress SCL/E12-mediated transcriptional activation. Consistent with the model that MTB may function together with SCL/E12 heterodimer during erythroid cell development, MTB is highly expressed in the erythroid lineage and is upregulated upon erythroid differentiation. Moreover, overexpression of MTB promotes the terminal differentiation of the murine erythroleukemia erythroid cell line. Together, these findings demonstrate that the condensin II subunit MTB/mCAP-G2 plays a novel function during erythropoiesis and suggest that key hematopoietic transcription factors such as SCL and E12 may regulate the terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells through the interaction with condensin complexes.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luzp5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (condensin complexes)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",,,20060504,"['R01 DK061464/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061464-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK-61464/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of U937 and other leukemia cells to SU9516 concentrations > or =5 microM rapidly (i.e., within 4 h) induced cytochrome c release, Bax mitochondrial translocation, and apoptosis in association with pronounced down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. These effects were associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase (Pol) II on serine 2 but not serine 5. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed pronounced down-regulation of Mcl-1 mRNA levels in SU9516-treated cells. Similar results were obtained in Jurkat and HL-60 leukemia cells. Furthermore, cotreatment with the proteasome inhibitor N-benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132) blocked SU9516-mediated Mcl-1 down-regulation, implicating proteasomal degradation in diminished expression of this protein. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 largely blocked SU9516-induced cytochrome c release, Bax translocation, and apoptosis, whereas knockdown of Mcl-1 by small interfering RNA potentiated SU9516 lethality, confirming the functional contribution of Mcl-1 down-regulation to SU9516-induced cell death. It is noteworthy that SU9516 treatment resulted in a marked increase in reactive oxygen species production, which was diminished, along with cell death, by the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). We were surprised to find that NAC blocked SU9516-mediated inhibition of RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation on serine 2, reductions in Mcl-1 mRNA levels, and Mcl-1 down-regulation. Together, these findings suggest that SU9516 kills leukemic cells through inhibition of RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation in association with oxidative damage and down-regulation of Mcl-1 at the transcriptional level, culminating in mitochondrial injury and cell death.","['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SU 9516)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,20060503,"['CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753, CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The means to ensure that offspring are born without such damage are unknown. Unexpectedly, we found that undifferentiated mouse ES cells contain high levels of both carbonyls and AGEs. The damaged proteins, identified as chaperones and proteins of the cytoskeleton, are the main targets for protein oxidation in aged tissues. However, the mouse ES cells rid themselves of such damage upon differentiation in vitro. This elimination of damaged proteins coincides with a considerably elevated activity of the 20S proteasome. Moreover, damaged proteins were primarily observed in the inner cell mass of blastocysts, whereas the cells that had embarked on differentiation into the trophectoderm displayed drastically reduced levels of protein damage. Thus, the elimination of protein damage occurs also during normal embryonic development in vivo. This clear-out of damaged proteins may be a part of a previously unknown rejuvenation process at the protein level that occurs at a distinct stage during early embryonic development.","['0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,20060503,,PMC1472508,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 3.,"Vertebrate limb development occurs along three cardinal axes-proximodistal, anteroposterior and dorsoventral-that are established via the organization of signaling centers, such as the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). Distal limb development, in turn, requires a molecular feedback loop between the ZPA expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the apical ectodermal ridge. The TALE homeoprotein Pbx1 has been shown to be essential for proximal limb development. In this study, we first uncover that Pbx1 and Pbx2 are co-expressed in the lateral plate and early limb field mesoderm. Later, Pbx2 is expressed throughout the limb, unlike Pbx1, which is expressed only in the proximal bud. By exploiting a Pbx1/Pbx2 loss-of-function mouse model, we demonstrate that, despite the lack of limb abnormalities in Pbx2-deficient (Pbx2(-/-)) embryos, compound Pbx1(-/-); Pbx2(+/-) mutants, in addition to their exacerbated proximal limb defects, exhibit novel and severe distal abnormalities. Additionally, we reveal that Pbx1(-/-); Pbx2(-/-) embryos lack limbs altogether. Furthermore, we establish that, unlike in flies, where the leg develops independently of Hox and where the Pbx ortholog Exd is required for specification of proximal (but not distal) limbs, in vertebrates, distal limb patterning is Pbx1/Pbx2 dependent. Indeed, we demonstrate that Pbx genetic requirement is mediated, at least in part, through their hierarchical control of Hox spatial distribution and Shh expression. Overall, we establish that, by controlling the spatial expression of Hox genes in the posterior limb and regulating ZPA function, Pbx1/Pbx2 exert a primary hierarchical function on Hox genes, rather than behaving merely as Hox ancillary factors.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hand2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Shh protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,20060503,"['6-FY03-071/PHS HHS/United States', 'HD43997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas p16Ink4a is an inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinases, p19Arf (p14ARF in humans) antagonizes the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity of Mdm2 to activate p53. We now recognize that Arf functions in both p53-dependent and -independent modes to counteract hyper-proliferative signals originating from proto-oncogene activation, but its p53-independent activities remain poorly understood. Arf proteins are highly basic (> 20% arginine content, pl > 12) and predominantly localize within nucleoli in physical association with an abundant acidic protein, nucleophosmin (NPM/B23). When bound to NPM, Arf proteins are relatively stable with half-lives of 6-8 hours. Although mouse p19Arf contains only a single lysine residue and human p14ARF has none, both proteins are N-terminally ubiquitinated and degraded in proteasomes. Through as yet uncharacterized mechanisms, p19Arf induces p53-independent sumoylation of a variety of cellular target proteins with which it interacts, including both Mdm2 and NPM. A naturally occurring NPM mutant (NPMc) expressed in myeloid leukemia cells redirects both wild-type NPM and p19Arf to the cytoplasm, inhibits Arf-induced sumoylation, and attenuates p53 activity. Thus, ubiquitination and sumoylation can each influence Arf tumor suppressor activity.","['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the diagnostic laboratory setting, the cytologic archival material consists of stained slides, and only rarely is material saved for molecular testing. The authors proposed FISH for FL using Papanicolaou-stained archival cytology material as a practical ancillary technique for diagnosing FL. METHODS: Cases included 35 FL, 6 small lymphocytic lymphomas/chronic lymphocytic leukemias (SLL/CLL), 4 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 4 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL), 1 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), and 10 reactive lymphoid tissues (RLT). FISH was performed on Papanicolaou-stained archival cytology slides using probes for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) on chromosome 14 and BCL2 on chromosome 18. RESULTS: In all, 25 of 32 (81%) FL cases exhibited the t(14;18) translocation, whereas 7 of 32 (19%) lacked the translocation. No cases of non-FL were positive for t(14;18). This series shows a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 100% for detecting the t(14;18) translocation as a diagnostic tool in FL. CONCLUSIONS: When performed on Papanicolaou-stained cytology slides, FISH for t(14;18) is relatively sensitive and quite specific for FL. These findings are similar to those reported on other specimens, such as paraffin-embedded tissue and unstained cytology slides. The authors proposed that their technique would allow the pathologist and clinician the flexibility to utilize previously stained fine-needle aspiration slides for FISH evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 2.,"The t(16:16) and inv(16) are associated with FAB M4Eo myeloid leukemias and result in fusion of the CBFB gene to the MYH11 gene (encoding smooth muscle myosin heavy chain [SMMHC]). Knockout of CBFbeta causes embryonic lethality due to lack of definitive hematopoiesis. Although knock-in of CBFB-MYH11 is not sufficient to cause disease, expression increases the incidence of leukemia when combined with cooperating events. Although mouse models are valuable tools in the study of leukemogenesis, little is known about the contribution of CBFbeta-SMMHC to human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell self-renewal. We introduced the CBFbeta-MYH11 cDNA into human CD34+ cells via retroviral transduction. Transduced cells displayed an initial repression of progenitor activity but eventually dominated the culture, resulting in the proliferation of clonal populations for up to 7 months. Long-term cultures displayed a myelomonocytic morphology while retaining multilineage progenitor activity and engraftment in NOD/SCID-B2M-/- mice. Progenitor cells from long-term cultures showed altered expression of genes defining inv(16) identified in microarray studies of human patient samples. This system will be useful in examining the effects of CBFbeta-SMMHC on gene expression in the human preleukemic cell, in characterizing the effect of this oncogene on human stem cell biology, and in defining its contribution to the development of leukemia.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,20060502,"['K01 CA090370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118319-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1586104,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent complementary DNA microarray study identified a gene-expression signature that--when used to cluster normal karyotype patients--separated them into 2 prognostically relevant subgroups. We sought the first independent validation of the prognostic value of this signature. Using oligonucleotide microarrays to measure gene expression in samples from uniformly treated adults with karyotypically normal AML, we performed cluster analysis based on the previously identified signature. We also developed a well-defined classification rule using the signature to predict outcome for individual patients. Cluster analysis confirmed the prognostic utility of the signature: patient clusters differed in overall (P = .001) and disease-free (P = .001) survival. The signature-based classifier identified groups with differences in overall (P = .02) and disease-free (P = .05) survival. A strong association of the outcome classifier with the prognostically adverse FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 ITD) potentially explained the prognostic significance of the signature. However, in the subgroup of patients without FLT3 ITD there was a moderate difference in survival for the classifier-derived groups.

Using a multipotent hemopoietic cell line, FDCP-Mix, expressing BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, we investigated the initial effects of this kinase in primitive hematopoietic stem cells. We identified down-regulation of a novel gene, CCN3, as a direct consequence of BCR-ABL kinase activity. CCN3 has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor gene in solid tumors. Northern and Western blotting plus immunocytochemical analysis confirmed CCN3 expression is decreased and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in BCR-ABL kinase active FDCP-Mix cells. Decreased cellular CCN3 correlated with increased CCN3 secretion in BCR-ABL kinase active cells. In vitro treatment of human CML cell lines with imatinib or siRNA directed against BCR-ABL significantly reduced BCR-ABL while increasing CCN3 expression. Cells from patients responding to imatinib showed a similar decrease in BCR-ABL and increase in CCN3. CML CD34+ cells treated with imatinib in vitro demonstrated increased CCN3 protein. Transfecting CCN3 into BCR-ABL+ cells inhibited proliferation and decreased clonogenic potential. CCN3 plays an important role in internal and external cell-signaling pathways. Thus, BCR-ABL can regulate protein levels by governing secretion, a novel mechanism for this tyrosine kinase.","['0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (CCN3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nephroblastoma Overexpressed Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,20060502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recently described TCL-1 transgenic mouse develops a chronic B-cell CD5(+) leukemia that might be useful for such studies. Following confirmation of the natural history of this leukemia in the transgenic mice, we demonstrated that the transformed murine lymphocytes express relevant therapeutic targets (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, AKT, PDK1, and DNMT1), wild-type p53 status, and in vitro sensitivity to therapeutic agents relevant to the treatment of human CLL. We then demonstrated the in vivo clinical activity of low-dose fludarabine in transgenic TCL-1 mice with active leukemia. These studies demonstrated both early reduction in blood-lymphocyte count and spleen size and prolongation of survival (P = .046) compared with control mice.

Epub 2006 May 2.,"Chronic phase-to-blast crisis transition in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is associated with differentiation arrest and down-regulation of C/EBPalpha, a transcription factor essential for granulocyte differentiation. Patients with CML in blast crisis (CML-BC) became rapidly resistant to therapy with the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (BCR/ABL) kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI571) because of mutations in the kinase domain that interfere with drug binding. We show here that the restoration of C/EBPalpha activity in STI571-sensitive or -resistant 32D-BCR/ABL cells induced granulocyte differentiation, inhibited proliferation in vitro and in mice, and suppressed leukemogenesis. Moreover, activation of C/EBPalpha eradicated leukemia in 4 of 10 and in 6 of 7 mice injected with STI571-sensitive or -resistant 32D-BCR/ABL cells, respectively. Differentiation induction and proliferation inhibition were required for optimal suppression of leukemogenesis, as indicated by the effects of p42 C/EBPalpha, which were more potent than those of K298E C/EBPalpha, a mutant defective in DNA binding and transcription activation that failed to induce granulocyte differentiation. Activation of C/EBPalpha in blast cells from 4 patients with CML-BC, including one resistant to STI571 and BMS-354825 and carrying the T315I Abl kinase domain mutation, also induced granulocyte differentiation. Thus, these data indicate that C/EBPalpha has potent antileukemia effects even in cells resistant to ATP-binding competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and they portend the development of anti-leukemia therapies that rely on C/EBPalpha activation.","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,20060502,"['CA 95111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 78890/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC1895881,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, both lymphomas share a similar cytological and immunohistochemical tumor cell phenotype with little resemblance to their cells of origin. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, the transcriptional profiles of ALCL cell lines, primary ALCL tumor cells from peripheral blood and HL cell lines were compared to each other and to normal B-cell subsets, B non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and B NHL- and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell lines in order to establish their relationship at the transcriptional level and to identify genes with possible pathobiological impact. Expression of some of the genes identified was confirmed in microdissected primary tumor cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: HL samples clustered separately from ALCL samples, but HL and ALCL were found to be more closely related to each other than to any normal or malignant B-cell sample in the dataset. Their relationship was determined to a large extent, but not exclusively, by lack of expression of B-cell antigens and by the over-expression of mRNA encoding activation markers and structural proteins. Apart from established differences between HL and ALCL, further genes of interest could be identified that distinguish both entities from each other and from the other samples. The differential expression of PRAME, DDR2, SOCS3 and CEBPD in HL and ALCL was confirmed in primary tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry and/or RT-PCR. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: At a transcriptional level HL is more closely related to Alk+ ALCL than to the B-NHL or B-cell samples investigated, although it is a B-cell derived lymphoma. The newly identified genes discriminating HL and ALCL may be pathobiologically important and may serve as possible therapeutic targets.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA-2) have previously been identified in patients with sporadic or autosomal dominant SCN. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 14 individuals (four patients with SCN and ten close relatives) belonging to the original Kostmann family in northern Sweden for mutations in the ELA-2 and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor genes. RESULTS: One patient belonging to the original Kostmann family harbored a novel heterozygous ELA-2 mutation (g.2310T-->A;Leu92His) that was not inherited from her parents. The mutation was identified in DNA isolated from both whole blood and skin fibroblasts, suggesting a sporadic de novo mutation. As a young adult this patient sequentially acquired two mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) and therefore recently received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, due to the risk of evolution to leukemia. Moreover, another patient developed acute leukemia and was treated with transplantation. No pathogenic ELA-2 or G-CSFR gene mutations were found in this patient or the other two patients, nor in any healthy relative. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data are the first to document leukemia evolution and G-CSFR gene mutations in the original Kostmann kindred. In addition, our findings indicate that ELA-2 mutations are not the primary cause of SCN in the Swedish Kostmann family.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present new paradigms of data Separation based on construction of transcriptional regulatory networks for normal and abnormal cells using sequence predictions, literature based data and gene expression studies. We analyzed expression datasets from a number of diseased and normal cells, including different types of acute leukemia, and breast cancer with variable clinical outcome. RESULTS: We constructed sample-specific regulatory networks to identify links between transcription factors (TFs) and regulated genes that differentiate between healthy and diseased states. This approach carries the advantage of identifying key transcription factor-gene pairs with differential activity between healthy and diseased states rather than merely using gene expression profiles, thus alluding to processes that may be involved in gene deregulation. We then generalized this approach by studying simultaneous changes in functionality of multiple regulatory links pointing to a regulated gene or emanating from one TF (or changes in gene centrality defined by its in-degree or out-degree measures, respectively). We found that samples can often be separated based on these measures of gene centrality more robustly than using individual links. We examined distributions of distances (the number of links needed to traverse the path between each pair of genes) in the transcriptional networks for gene subsets whose collective expression profiles could best separate each dataset into predefined groups. We found that genes that optimally classify samples are concentrated in neighborhoods in the gene regulatory networks. This suggests that genes that are deregulated in diseased states exhibit a remarkable degree of connectivity. CONCLUSION: Transcription factor-regulated gene links and centrality of genes on transcriptional networks can be used to differentiate between cell types. Transcriptional network blueprints can be used as a basis for further research into gene deregulation in diseased states.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,20060502,"['R01 CA115756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA115756-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1482723,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This observation has paved the way for the development of small-molecule inhibitors specifically targeting the kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein. Indeed, the amazing success of imatinib has revolutionized the whole area of targeted cancer therapeutics. However, enthusiasm for the striking efficacy of imatinib has been tempered by the development of clinical resistance. In essentially all cases, resistance results from kinase domain mutations and/or overexpression of the BCR-ABL gene. To overcome resistance, several novel BCR-ABL inhibitors have been developed and are in clinical trials, though it is inevitable that resistance to second-generation inhibitors will occur as well. Nonetheless, kinases represent an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in several diseases and, at present, some 50 different kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials. We anticipate that resistance to these compounds will follow mechanisms similar to those observed with imatinib. Resistance mutations cause their effect either by direct steric hindrance to drug binding or by allosterically modulating kinase dynamics. This review highlights the principal mechanisms underlying point mutations from these two different classes to confer drug resistance.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligible patients identified one caregiver, and a one-page survey addressing the necessary time commitment and out-of-pocket expenses was completed by the caregiver at each visit. The caregivers of 40 patients participated (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [n = 19], multiple myeloma [n = 18], Hodgkin's lymphoma [n = 2], or acute myelogenous leukemia [n = 1]). Caregivers included spouses (n = 35), partners/friends (n = 2), or family members (n = 3). Results were summarized for the patient's total length of stay. Each caregiver traveled a median of 829 miles over 17.8 hours. Out-of-pocket expenses varied greatly depending on whether a caregiver stayed in local accommodations (cohort 1; n = 11) or in the patient's hospital room (cohort 2; n = 29). Total expenses (median) for each caregiver in cohort 1 were dollar 849.35, including accommodations (dollar 560), gasoline (dollar 87.35), and food (dollar 202). Total expenses (median) for each caregiver in cohort 2 were dollar 181.15, including gasoline (dollar 70) and food (dollar 111.15). Each caregiver in cohort 1 lost a median of 43.5 hours of work compared with 8 hours for each caregiver in cohort 2. The results from this prospective study demonstrate that there is a significant financial and time requirement on the part of the caregiver when a family member or significant other is hospitalized for an autologous stem cell transplant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A cohort of 357 subjects that are resident in an area of about 100 meters on the two sides of a 60 kV power line was studied. Exposure to 50 Hz magnetic fields was evaluated by spot and long-term measurements and by adopting a model based on current load, characteristics of the line and distance of dwellings from conductors. The mortality experience of the cohort was observed from January 1st, 1980 through December 31st, 2003. Analysis took into account duration of residence and latency. Separate analyses were performed for three subcohorts characterized by different distances from the line and different estimated and measured field levels. MAIN OUTCOMES: Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed comparing the observed number of deaths with the corresponding expected figures derived from the Latium Region mortality rates. This was done both in the overall cohort and in the subcohorts. RESULTS: All-causes mortality of the cohort did not differ from expected values (SMR 0.99; 95% CI 0.73-1.35; 40 observed). All cancers mortality showed a non-significant increase (SMR 1.34; 95% CI 0.82-2.18; 16 observed), that reached statistical significance in the analyses limited to subjects with more than 30 years of residence (SMR 2.09; 95% CI 1.05-4.19; 8 observed). Mortality from lymphohaematopoietic malignancies was increased, based on two cases of leukemia. All cancers mortality was highest in the subcohort closest to the power line and exposed to highest levels of magnetic fields. An increased risk for digestive tract neoplasms (SMR 3.57; 95% CI 1.49-8.58; 5 observed) was observed, which was mainly caused by pancreatic cancer. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Some increase in mortality of the overall cohort and especially of the highly exposed sub cohort was detected, notwithstanding the low power of the study. Other studies are currently on-going in the same area: a cross-sectional investigation on health status, an analysis of hospital discharge cards, a project for estimating individual exposure levels and a research in veterinary epidemiology. It is recommended to replicate the present study in areas presenting similar exposure patterns, in order to be able to pool data with the aim of estimating risk associated with the exposure levels of interest.",,,"Studio preliminare di mortalita per causa di una popolazione con esposizione residenziale a campi magnetici a 50 Hz, in un quartiere del comune di Roma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 2.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is known to cure various hematological disorders; however, its widespread use is limited due to a lack of histocompatible donors. Reciprocal cell traffic between the mother and fetus during pregnancy gives rise to postpartum fetal-maternal lymphohematopoietic microchimerism, which is frequently detected in the blood or tissue of healthy individuals. Studies in clinical and experimental transplantation provide evidence that exposure to non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMAs) during pregnancy may result in long-lasting fetomaternal microchimerism and tolerance induction. Studies of HLA-mismatched HSCT have suggested a relatively lower incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after transplantation from a NIMA-mismatched donor. Studies using a mouse model have also demonstrated a ""child-to-mother"" bone marrow transplantation from an NIMA-exposed donor to reduce the morbidity and mortality of GVHD in an antigen-specific manner while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effects and favoring the immune reconstitution, thus resulting in a marked improvement in outcome after HSCT. Prospective clinical studies are therefore warranted to confirm these beneficial effects of fetal-maternal tolerance in allogeneic HSCT.",['0 (HLA Antigens)'],88,,20060502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atypical cell morphology according to the FAB criteria is known to herald disease progression. Several years ago, it was proposed that FAB morphology at diagnosis had a considerable prognostic impact. However, this proposal has not been widely adopted in practice. Thus we questioned the prognostic value of the morphological examination, which was performed retrospectively in 88 patients out of our 110 institutional registry patients (70 males and 40 females, median age 57 yrs) with CLL at diagnosis. We related the results to the more modern prognostic markers. Atypical FAB morphology was shown to correlate with IgVH gene mutation status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and deletion of 17p detected either by conventional G-banding or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The correlation of FAB morphology with CD38 antigen expression or with the histopathological pattern of bone marrow infiltration was not significant. Overall survival (OS) data were available for 84 morphologically examined patients. The patients with atypical morphology (64 patients) had a significantly shorter OS (103 months) than the 20 patients presenting with typical CLL morphology (237 months; p=0.03). Only the mutation status of IgVH genes correlated more closely with OS (p=0.002). Of note, there was no leukemia-related death within ""unmutated"" cases who had typical FAB morphology (p=0.14), and vice versa, the mutation status had a significant prognostic impact within the morphologically atypical cases (p=0.01). Thus FAB morphology and the mutation status may yield complementary prognostic information. OS was affected both by the presence of cytogenetic aberrations (p=0.03) - most adversely by deletions of 17p and 11q, and by CD38 expression (p=0.003). We conclude that careful examination of peripheral blood smears according to FAB is a simple, cheap and valuable tool in the first-line assessment of prognosis of CLL patients and should not be overlooked even in 3rd millennium when more sophisticated prognostic markers are at hand. This ought to be confirmed in larger prospective studies with multivariate analysis of data.","['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is ubiquitous during embryonic development but is not expressed in normal post-natal tissues, except the thymus, colonic epithelial cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. However, its expression is upregulated during neoplastic transformation in both solid organ and hematological malignancies, including leukemia and lymphoma. In this study, we used RNA interference with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technique to inhibit survivin expression in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji and validated its effects on apoptosis and cell proliferation. A survivin-shRNA expression vector were constructed and introduced into Raji cells. Expression of survivin mRNA and protein was assessed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Apoptosis index of transfected cells was quantified by flow cytometry and cell proliferation was enumerated by trypan blue exclusion. In Raji cells treated with survivin-shRNA expression vector, survivin mRNA levels were significantly reduced by 67.14% (transient transfection) and 64.28% (stable transfection) respectively, compared with control-shRNA treated group and PBS treated group (p<0.05). The levels of survivin protein were significantly reduced by 62.50% (transient transfection) and 60.93% (stable transfection), compared with the two control groups (p<0.05). Apoptosis index was significantly increased during transient transfection and stable transfection, respectively 31.20+/-2.45% and 29.40+/-1.72% (p<0.05). Survivin-shRNA inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells of stable transfection. In conclusion, the vector-based survivin-shRNA can effectively reduce the expression of survivin gene and induce apoptosis and growth inhibition of transfected Raji cells.

Epub 2006 May 1.,"The telomerase complex is responsible for telomere maintenance and represents a promising neoplasia therapeutic target. Recently, we have demonstrated that treatment with a G-quadruplex-interactive agent, telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in the BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cell lines. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by telomerase inhibition in acute leukemia. We have found the activation of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase in telomestatin-treated U937 cells (PD20) and dominant-negative DN-hTERT-expressing U937 cells (PD25). Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and MKK3/6 was also found in telomestatin-treated U937 cells (PD20) and dominant-negative DN-hTERT-expressing U937 cells (PD25); however, activation of JNK and ASK1 was not detected in these cells. To examine the effect of p38 MAP kinase inhibition on growth properties and apoptosis in telomerase-inhibited cells, we cultured DN-hTERT-expressing U937 cells with or without SB203580. Dominant-negative-hTERT-expressing U937 cells stopped proliferation on PD25; however, a significant increase in growth rate was observed in the presence of SB203580. Treatment of SB203580 also reduced the induction of apoptosis in DN-hTERT-expressing U937 cells (PD25). These results suggest that p38 MAP kinase has a critical role for the induction of apoptosis in telomerase-inhibited leukemia cells. Further, we evaluated the effect of telomestatin on the growth of U937 cells in xenograft mouse model. Systemic intraperitoneal administration of telomestatin in U937 xenografts decreased tumor telomerase levels and reduced tumor volumes. Tumor tissue from telomestatin-treated animals exhibited marked apoptosis. None of the mice treated with telomestatin displayed any signs of toxicity. Taken together, these results lay the foundations for a program of drug development to achieve the dual aims of efficacy and selectivity in vivo.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (telomestatin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,20060501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular signaling pathways that direct this cell movement are not well delineated. The monomeric GTPase RhoA is required for migration in several cell types including neutrophils, monocytes and fibroblasts. We demonstrate that bombesin-stimulated PC cell migration occurs via the heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors (G-protein) G alpha 13 subunit leading to activation of RhoA, and Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK). Using siRNA to suppress expression of the three known G-protein alpha-subunit-associated RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), we also show that two of these RhoA GEFs, PDZ-RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), link bombesin receptors to RhoA in a non-redundant manner in PC cells. We next show that focal adhesion kinase, which activates PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG, is required for bombesin-stimulated RhoA activation. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is expressed on normal prostate epithelium whereas loss of NEP expression contributes to PC progression. We also demonstrate that NEP inhibits neuropeptide activation of RhoA. Together, these results establish a contiguous signaling pathway from the bombesin receptor to ROCK in PC cells, and they implicate NEP as a major regulator of neuropeptide-stimulated RhoA in these cells. This work also identifies members of this signaling pathway as potential targets for rational pharmacologic manipulation of neuropeptide-stimulated migration of PC cells.","['0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'PX9AZU7QPK (Bombesin)']",,,20060501,"['CA80240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK60908/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL04080/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 1.,"RUNX1 (AML1) is a gene that is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia. Like its Drosophila homolog Runt, RUNX1 both activates and represses transcription. Both Runt and RUNX1 are required for gene silencing during development and a central domain of RUNX1, termed repression domain 2 (RD2), was defined as being required for transcriptional repression and for the silencing of CD4 during T-cell maturation in thymic organ cultures. Although transcriptional co-repressors are known to contact other repression domains in RUNX1, the factors that bind to RD2 had not been defined. Therefore, we tested whether RD2 contacts histone-modifying enzymes that may mediate both repression and gene silencing. We found that RD2 contacts SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase, via two motifs and that endogenous Suv39h1 associates with a Runx1-regulated repression element in murine erythroleukemia cells. In addition, one of these SUV39H1-binding motifs is also sufficient for binding to histone deacetylases 1 and 3, and both of these domains are required for full RUNX1-mediated transcriptional repression. The association between RUNX1, histone deacetylases and SUV39H1 provides a molecular mechanism for repression and possibly gene silencing mediated by RUNX1.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.

Mer is not normally expressed in thymocytes or lymphocytes; however, ectopic Mer RNA transcript and protein expression is found in a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and patient samples, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis. To investigate the oncogenic potential of Mer in vivo, we created a transgenic mouse line (Mer(Tg)) that expresses Mer in the hematopoietic lineage under control of the Vav promoter. Ectopic expression and activation of the transgenic Mer protein was demonstrated in lymphocytes and thymocytes of the Mer(Tg) mice. At 12-24 months of age, greater than 55% of the Mer(Tg) mice, compared to 12% of the wild type, developed adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and circulating lymphoblasts. Histopathological analysis and flow cytometry were consistent with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Mer may contribute to leukemogenesis by activation of Akt and ERK1/2 anti-apoptotic signals, which were upregulated in Mer(Tg) mice. Additionally, a significant survival advantage was noted in Mer(Tg) lymphocytes compared to wild-type lymphocytes after dexamethasone treatment. These data suggest that Mer plays a cooperative role in leukemogenesis and may be an effective target for biologically based leukemia/lymphoma therapy.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (growth arrest-specific protein 6)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Mertk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)']",,,20060501,"['T32 CA082086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA86068604/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 1.,"The chromosomal translocation t(8;21) is associated with 10-15% of all cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The resultant fusion protein AML1/MTG8 interferes with haematopoietic gene expression and is an important regulator of leukaemogenesis. We studied the effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated AML1/MTG8 depletion on global gene expression in t(8;21)-positive leukaemic cell lines and in primary AML blasts using cDNA arrays, oligonucleotide arrays and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Suppression of AML1/MTG8 results in the increased expression of genes associated with myeloid differentiation, such as AZU1, BPI, CTSG, LYZ and RNASE2 as well as of antiproliferative genes such as IGFBP7, MS4A3 and SLA both in blasts and in cell lines. Furthermore, expression levels of several genes affiliated with drug resistance or indicative of poor prognosis AML (BAALC, CD34, PRG2, TSPAN7) are affected by AML1/MTG8 depletion. In conclusion, siRNA-mediated suppression of AML1/MTG8 cause very similar changes in gene expression pattern in t(8;21)-positive cell lines and in primary AML blasts. Furthermore, the results suggest that the specific targeting of AML1/MTG8 function may be a promising approach for complementing existing treatment strategies.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,20060501,"['A6438/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A6789/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemic clam hemocytes, wild-type p53 and mortalin proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm. A similar phenotype, characterized by cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p53 protein, has been observed in several human cancers (undifferentiated neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, and glioblastoma). In some of these cancers p53 is tethered in the cytoplasm by mortalin when the latter protein is overexpressed. Using co-immunoprecipitation we have demonstrated that mortalin and p53 proteins are complexed in the cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes (and not in normal hemocytes). In addition, treatment of leukemic clam hemocytes with MKT-077, a cationic inhibitor of mortalin, disrupts the interaction of mortalin and p53 proteins, resulting in translocation of some p53 to the nucleus.

Epub 2006 May 1.,"Targeted cancer therapies exploit the continued dependence of cancer cells on oncogenic mutations. Such agents can have remarkable activity against some cancers, although antitumor responses are often heterogeneous, and resistance remains a clinical problem. To gain insight into factors that influence the action of a prototypical targeted drug, we studied the action of imatinib (STI-571, Gleevec) against murine cells and leukemias expressing BCR-ABL, an imatinib target and the initiating oncogene for human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We show that the tumor suppressor p53 is selectively activated by imatinib in BCR-ABL-expressing cells as a result of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. Inactivation of p53, which can accompany disease progression in human CML, impedes the response to imatinib in vitro and in vivo without preventing BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. Concordantly, p53 mutations are associated with progression to imatinib resistance in some human CMLs. Our results identify p53 as a determinant of the response to oncogene inhibition and suggest one way in which resistance to targeted therapy can emerge during the course of tumor evolution.","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,20060501,"['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA087497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1455409,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokine interleukin (IL)-12 promotes CD8(+) T-cell cytotoxicity and, with IL-18, synergistically up-regulates IFN-gamma release. We have shown that culturing CD8(+) T cells ex vivo with IL-12 and IL-18 enhanced antitumor responses in vivo and in vitro using a model of C1498/ovalbumin, a murine acute myeloid leukemia cell line expressing the antigen ovalbumin. Activated ovalbumin-specific CD8(+) T cells cultured with IL-12, IL-18, both, or neither were assayed for antigen-specific cytokine production and cytolytic activity and adoptively transferred to C57BL/6 mice with established tumors. Maximal IFN-gamma release occurred after T-cell culture with IL-12 and IL-18. Tumor-specific in vitro cytotoxicity was enhanced by IL-12, unaffected by addition of IL-18, and abrogated in perforin-deficient T cells irrespective of cytokine exposure. T cells cultured with IL-12 more effectively eliminated tumors, and addition of IL-18 did not further augment responses. IFN-gamma-deficient CD8(+) T cells showed effective antitumor activity that was enhanced by IL-12 with or without IL-18. Perforin-deficient CD8(+) T cells were poor mediators of antitumor activity, though, and showed no improvement after culture with IL-12 and/or IL-18. Thus, ex vivo culture with IL-12 was sufficient to augment antigen-specific in vitro cytotoxicity and antitumor activity in vivo in an IFN-gamma-independent but perforin-dependent manner. Ex vivo culture with IL-12 may improve CD8(+) T-cell immunotherapy of cancer in the absence of donor cell-derived IFN-gamma via perforin-mediated cytolysis.","['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,"['F32 CA097907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA92488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it is expressed at extremely high levels in ALL patients with mixed lineage leukemia rearrangements or hyperdiploidy and is sometimes mutated in these same patients. In this report, we investigate the effects of treating ALL cell lines and primary samples with human anti-FLT3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) capable of preventing binding of FLT3 ligand. In vitro studies, examining the ability of two anti-FLT3 mAbs (IMC-EB10 and IMC-NC7) to affect FLT3 activation and downstream signaling in ALL cell lines and primary blasts, yielded variable results. FLT3 phosphorylation was consistently inhibited by IMC-NC7 treatment, but in some cell lines, IMC-EB10 actually stimulated FLT3 activation, possibly as a result of antibody-mediated receptor dimerization. Through antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, such an antibody could still prove efficacious against leukemia cells in vivo. In fact, IMC-EB10 treatment significantly prolonged survival and/or reduced engraftment of several ALL cell lines and primary ALL samples in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. This occurred even when IMC-EB10 treatment resulted in FLT3 activation in vitro. Moreover, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and PCR analysis of IMC-EB10-treated NOD/SCID mice surviving 150 days post-leukemic cell injection revealed that FLT3 immunotherapy reduced leukemic engraftment below the level of detection in these assays (<0.001%). Furthermore, in vivo IMC-EB10 treatment did not select for resistant cells, because cells surviving IMC-EB10 treatment remain sensitive to IMC-EB10 cytotoxicity upon retransplantation. In vivo studies involving either partial depletion or activation of natural killer (NK) cells show that most of the cytotoxic effect of IMC-EB10 is mediated through NK cells. Therefore, such an antibody, either naked or conjugated to radioactive isotopes or cytotoxic agents, may prove useful in the therapy of infant ALL as well as childhood and adult ALL patients whose blasts typically express FLT3.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,"['CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00171/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase I/II clinical trial using a version of this virus expressing granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor has shown promising results. The work reported here aimed to develop a version of this virus in which local tumor control was further increased through the combined expression of a highly potent prodrug activating gene [yeast cytosine deaminase/uracil phospho-ribosyltransferase fusion (Fcy::Fur)] and the fusogenic glycoprotein from gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), which it was hoped would aid the spread of the activated prodrug through the tumor. Viruses expressing the two genes individually or in combination were constructed and tested, showing (a) GALV and/or Fcy::Fur expression did not affect virus growth; (b) GALV expression causes cell fusion and increases the tumor cell killing at least 30-fold in vitro and tumor shrinkage 5- to 10-fold in vivo; (c) additional expression of Fcy::Fur combined with 5-fluorocytosine administration improves tumor shrinkage further. These results indicate, therefore, that the combined expression of the GALV protein and Fcy::Fur provides a highly potent oncolytic virus with improved capabilities for local tumor control. It is intended to enter the GALV/Fcy::Fur expressing virus into clinical development for the treatment of tumor types, such as pancreatic or lung cancer, where local control would be anticipated to be clinically advantageous.","['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.9 (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies suggest the potential use of proteasome inhibitors as novel anticancer drugs. Celastrol, an active compound extracted from the root bark of the Chinese medicine ""Thunder of God Vine"" (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.), was used for years as a natural remedy for inflammatory conditions. Although Celastrol has been shown to induce leukemia cell apoptosis, the molecular target involved has not been identified. Furthermore, whether Celastrol has antitumor activity in vivo has never been conclusively shown. Here, we report, for the first time, that Celastrol potently and preferentially inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of a purified 20S proteasome (IC(50) = 2.5 micromol/L) and human prostate cancer cellular 26S proteasome (at 1-5 micromol/L). Inhibition of the proteasome activity by Celastrol in PC-3 (androgen receptor- or AR-negative) or LNCaP (AR-positive) cells results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and three natural proteasome substrates (IkappaB-alpha, Bax, and p27), accompanied by suppression of AR protein expression (in LNCaP cells) and induction of apoptosis. Treatment of PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice with Celastrol (1-3 mg/kg/d, i.p., 1-31 days) resulted in significant inhibition (65-93%) of the tumor growth. Multiple assays using the animal tumor tissue samples from both early and end time points showed in vivo inhibition of the proteasomal activity and induction of apoptosis after Celastrol treatment.

However, the mechanism is not clearly understood. Here, we show that cells expressing intracellular domain of human Notch1 (NIC-1) are chemoresistant in a wild-type p53-dependent manner. NIC-1 inhibited p53 by inhibiting its activating phosphorylations at Ser(15), Ser(20), and Ser(392) as well as nuclear localization. In addition, we found that inhibition of p53 by NIC-1 mainly occurs through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) using phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway as the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin treatment abrogated NIC-1 inhibition of p53 and reversed the chemoresistance. Consistent with this, rapamycin failed to reverse NIC-1-induced chemoresistance in cells expressing rapamycin-resistant mTOR. Further, ectopic expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a translational regulator that acts downstream of mTOR, inhibited p53-induced apoptosis and conferred protection against p53-mediated cytotoxicity to similar extent as that of NIC-1 overexpression but was not reversed by rapamycin, which indicates that eIF4E is the major target of mTOR in Notch1-mediated survival signaling. Finally, we show that MCF7 (breast cancer) and MOLT4 (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cells having aberrant Notch1 signaling are chemoresistant, which can be reversed by both PI3K and mTOR inhibitors. These results establish that Notch1 signaling confers chemoresistance by inhibiting p53 pathway through mTOR-dependent PI3K-Akt/PKB pathway and imply that p53 status perhaps is an important determinant in combination therapeutic strategies, which use mTOR inhibitors and chemotherapy.","['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to many interesting features, we have found that the NUP98-PMX1 fusion protein exerts a repressive effect on PMX1 or serum response factor-mediated c-FOS activation, probably through the recruitment of a common corepressor histone deacetylase 1 by FG domains of the NUP98-PMX1 fusion protein. Moreover, we have provided evidence that the FG domains of NUP98-PMX1 and two other NUP98-containing fusion proteins, i.e., NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-HOXC11, all exhibit dual binding ability to both CREB binding protein, a coactivator, and histone deacetylase 1, a corepressor. Accordingly, we have hypothesized that this dual binding activity is shared by most, if not all, NUP98-HOX-involved fusion proteins, enabling these fusion proteins to act as both trans-activators and trans-repressors, and contributing to the genesis of acute leukemia or acute transformation of CML.","['0 (NUP98-PMX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such presentation may lead to misdiagnosis of a child with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). This study was designed to identify the predictive factors for leukemia using basic clinical and laboratory information. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed using a simple questionnaire to compare the clinical and laboratory findings present during the initial visit to a pediatric rheumatology clinic for 277 children who were ultimately diagnosed with either JRA (n = 206) or ALL (n = 71). Sensitivity and specificity analysis of a variety of parameters, both singly and in combination, was performed to identify predictive value for ALL. RESULTS: The majority (75%) of children with ALL did not have blasts in the peripheral blood at the time of evaluation by pediatric rheumatologists. In children presenting with unexplained musculoskeletal complaints, the 3 most important factors that predicted a diagnosis of ALL were low white blood cell count (< 4 x 10(9)/L), low-normal platelet count (150-250 x 10(9)/L), and history of nighttime pain. In the presence of all 3, the sensitivity and specificity for a diagnosis of ALL were 100% and 85%, respectively. Other findings, including antinuclear antibody, rash, and objective signs of arthritis, were not helpful in differentiating between these diagnoses because they occurred at similar rates in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: When a child develops new-onset bone-joint complaints, the presence of subtle complete blood count changes combined with nighttime pain should lead to consideration of leukemia as the underlying cause.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypopigmentation of the skin in patients receiving this drug has been recently reported. We report a 17-year-old Caucasian patient affected by chronic myeloid leukemia in therapy with imatinib mesylate who developed hypopigmented vitiligo-like patches and generalized lightening of the skin. In order to evaluate the lightening observed clinically, we measured the progressive skin color hypopigmentation by using a colorimeter over several months. The colorimetric evaluation confirmed the generalized and gradual lightening of patient's skin over treatment with imatinib mesylate.

Immunosuppression has been associated with the development of porokeratosis in numerous case reports and series. To our knowledge, however, only five cases of porokeratosis have been reported following bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: We report five cases of porokeratosis of Mibelli following bone marrow transplantation. The diagnosis of porokeratosis was made between 1 and 13 years post-transplantation. The underlying malignancy in four of the five cases was leukemia, while the fifth patient had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Porokeratosis developed during remission in the four leukemia patients, whereas, in the fifth patient, it occurred during a relapse of lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Porokeratosis may develop following bone marrow transplantation. Our five cases double the number reported in the medical literature, and the incidence of porokeratosis following bone marrow transplantation may be significantly higher than previously recognized. As cutaneous carcinomas have been reported in association with porokeratosis, careful surveillance for porokeratosis in bone marrow transplant recipients is warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The association of MC with acute GVHD, disease recurrence, survival, and relapse-free survival was investigated in 91 patients who underwent either bone (n = 12) or peripheral blood (n = 79) HLA-identical marrow transplantation. Chimerism was assessed using multiplex amplification of short tandem repeats (STR). Patients had thalassemia (n = 19), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (n = 29), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n = 20), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (n = 18), and other diseases (n = 5). The median age was 21 (range: 3 - 50) years. There were 38 (42%) female and 53 (58%) male participants. Conditioning was made through busulfan plus cyclophosphamide in 34 patients; busulfan plus fludarabin in 51 patients; and busulfan plus fludarabin plus antithymocyte globulin in 6 patients. The median follow-up was 13 months. RESULTS: On day +30, complete chimerism (CC) was observed in 72 (79%) patients, MC in 15 (17%), and no chimerism in 4 patients. The incidence of acute GVHD was significantly (P = 0.01) lower in mixed chimeras than in complete chimeras. There was no significant difference in acute GVHD grade (I, II vs. III, IV) between the two groups. The incidence of relapse was 18%. There was no difference in relapse rate between MC and CC groups. Overall survival was 89%. There was no significant difference in the overall survival between MC and CC group (96% vs. 85%, respectively). Relapse-free survival was 80% that was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite some previous reports, we found no significant difference in the survival and relapse rates between MC and CC groups.",['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of thimerosal to act as a sulfhydryl group is related to the presence of mercury. Due to its antibacterial effect, thimerosal is widely used as preservatives and has been reported to cause chemically mediated side effects. In the present study, we showed that the molecular mechanism of thimerosal induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Thimerosal was shown to be responsible for the inhibition of U937 cells growth by inducing apoptosis. Treatment with 2.5-5 microM thimerosal but not thiosalicylic acid (structural analog of thimerosal devoid of mercury) for 12 h produced apoptosis, G(2)/M phase arrest, and DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with caspase inhibitor significantly reduced thimerosal-induced caspase 3 activation. In addition, thimerosal-induced apoptosis was attenuated by antioxidant Mn (III) meso-tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (Mn-TBAP). These data indicate that the cytotoxic effect of thimerosal on U937 cells is attributable to the induced apoptosis and that thimerosal-induced apoptosis is mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and caspase-3 activation.","['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '2225PI3MOV (Thimerosal)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between January 2000 and July 2004, 32 patients with known lymphoma or leukemia and an initial diagnosis of ""atypical"" or ""suspicious"" using morphologic criteria were identified. Subsequent flow cytometry (FC) and cytologic data from these patients were evaluated.

In this study we evaluated whether TCSCs respond to other motomorphogens, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We again employed chemotactic isolation combined with real-time RT-PCR analysis to assess whether murine and human BM contain TCSCs that respond to HGF and LIF gradients. We also evaluated expressions of HGF and LIF in damaged organs. RESULTS: We noted that the number of TCSCs is highest in BM from young (1- to 2-month-old) mice and decreases in 1-year-old animals. Murine and human TCSCs 1) respond to HGF and LIF gradients in addition to an SDF-1 gradient, 2) reside in populations of BM-derived non-hematopoietic CD45-cells, and 3) are released (mobilized) from BM into the peripheral blood (PB) during tissue injury (e.g. after partial body irradiation). CONCLUSIONS: These findings further support our theory of the BM as a ""hideout"" for TCSCs and we suggest that their presence in BM tissue should be considered before experimental evidence is interpreted simply as transdifferentiation/plasticity of hematopoietic stem cells. Since we demonstrated that not only SDF-1, but also HGF and LIF are upregulated in damaged tissues, we postulate that CXCR4+ c-Met+ LIF-R+ TCSC could be mobilized from the BM into the PB, from which they are subsequently chemoattracted to damaged organs, where they play a role in tissue repair/regeneration.","['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,20060328,['R01 CA106281-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 20.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the expansion of blasts that resemble morphologically promyelocytes and harbor a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) genes on chromosomes 17 and 15, respectively. The expression of the PML/RARalpha fusion gene is essential for APL genesis. In fact, transgenic mice (TM) expressing PML/RARalpha develop a form of leukemia that mimics the hematological findings of human APL. Leukemia is diagnosed after a long latency (approximately 12 months) during which no hematological abnormality is detected in peripheral blood (pre-leukemic phase). In humans, immunophenotypic analysis of APL blasts revealed distinct features; however, the precise immunophenotype of leukemic cells in the TM model has not been established. Our aim was to characterize the expression of myeloid antigens by leukemic cells from hCG-PML/RARalpha TM. In this study, TM (N = 12) developed leukemia at the mean age of 13.1 months. Morphological analysis of bone marrow revealed an increase of the percentage of immature myeloid cells in leukemic TM compared to pre-leukemic TM and wild-type controls (48.63 +/- 16.68, 10.83 +/- 8.11, 7.4 +/- 5.46%, respectively; P < 0.05). Flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow and spleen from leukemic TM identified the asynchronous co-expression of CD34, CD117, and CD11b. This abnormal phenotype was rarely detected prior to the diagnosis of leukemia and was present at similar frequencies in hematologically normal TM and wild-type controls of different ages. The present results demonstrate that, similarly to human APL, leukemic cells from hCG-PML/RARalpha TM present a specific immunophenotype.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",,,20060420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition profile of ABT-869 is evident in cellular assays of RTK phosphorylation (IC50 = 2, 4, and 7 nmol/L for PDGFR-beta, KDR, and CSF-1R, respectively) and VEGF-stimulated proliferation (IC50 = 0.2 nmol/L for human endothelial cells). ABT-869 is not a general antiproliferative agent because, in most cancer cells, >1,000-fold higher concentrations of ABT-869 are required for inhibition of proliferation. However, ABT-869 exhibits potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on cancer cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FLT3. In vivo ABT-869 is effective orally in the mechanism-based murine models of VEGF-induced uterine edema (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg) and corneal angiogenesis (>50% inhibition, 15 mg/kg). In tumor growth studies, ABT-869 exhibits efficacy in human fibrosarcoma and breast, colon, and small cell lung carcinoma xenograft models (ED50 = 1.5-5 mg/kg, twice daily) and is also effective (>50% inhibition) in orthotopic breast and glioma models. Reduction in tumor size and tumor regression was observed in epidermoid carcinoma and leukemia xenograft models, respectively. In combination, ABT-869 produced at least additive effects when given with cytotoxic therapies. Based on pharmacokinetic analysis from tumor growth studies, efficacy correlated more strongly with time over a threshold value (cellular KDR IC50 corrected for plasma protein binding = 0.08 microg/mL, >or=7 hours) than with plasma area under the curve or Cmax. These results support clinical assessment of ABT-869 as a therapeutic agent for cancer.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (N-(4-(3-amino-1H-indazol-4-yl)phenyl)-N1-(2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)urea)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic potency of these species was analyzed in L1210 leukemia cells using analogues with chloroethylating or carbamoylating function only. Clonogenic assays showed that the chloroethylating-only agent 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine (90CE) produced marked differential cytotoxicity against wild-type and O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase-transfected L1210 cells (LC10, 1.4 versus 31 micromol/L), indicating that a large portion of the cytotoxicity was due to alkylation of DNA at the O-6 position of guanine. Consistent with the concept that O-6 chloroethylation of DNA guanine progresses to interstrand cross-links, the comet assay, in which DNA cross-links were measured by a reduction in DNA migration induced by strand breaks, showed that cloretazine and 90CE, but not the carbamoylating-only agent 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-[(methylamino)carbonyl]hydrazine (101MDCE), produced DNA cross-links and that cloretazine caused more DNA cross-links than 90CE at equimolar concentrations. Cell cycle analyses showed that 90CE and 101MDCE at concentrations of 5 and 80 micromol/L, respectively, produced similar degrees of G2-M arrest. 90CE produced selective inhibition of DNA synthesis after overnight incubation, whereas 101MDCE caused rapid and nonselective inhibition of RNA, DNA, and protein syntheses. Both 90CE and 101MDCE induced phosphorylation of histone H2AX, albeit with distinct kinetics. These results indicate that (a) differential expression of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase in tumor and host cells seems to be responsible for tumor selectivity exerted by cloretazine; (b) 101MDCE enhances DNA cross-linking activity; and (c) 90CE induces cell death at concentrations lower than those causing alterations in the cell cycle and macromolecular syntheses.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",,,,"['R01 CA090671-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-90671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090671-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090671-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090671-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090671-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090671-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090671-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2680221,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS105547'],,,,

In experimental models, Ras inhibits myeloid differentiation, which is characteristic of leukemia; however, the mechanism through which it disrupts hematopoiesis is poorly understood. In multipotent FDCP-mix cells, Ras inhibits terminal neutrophil differentiation, thereby indefinitely extending their proliferative potential. Ras also strongly promotes the sensitivity of these cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Using this model, we have dissected the signaling elements downstream of Ras to determine their relative contribution to the dysregulation of hematopoiesis. Cells expressing Ras mutants selectively activating Raf (Ras*T35S) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Ras*Y40C) did not significantly affect differentiation or proliferative capacity, whereas Ras*E37G (which selectively activates RalGEFs) perpetuated proliferation and blocked neutrophil development in a manner similar to that of Ras. Correspondingly, expression of constitutively active versions of these effectors confirmed the overriding importance of Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Cells expressing Ras demonstrated hyperactivation of Ral, which itself was able to exactly mimic the phenotype of Ras, including hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. Conversely, dominant negative Ral promoted spontaneous neutrophil development. Ral, in turn, appears to influence differentiation through multiple effectors. These data show, for the first time, the importance of Ral in regulating differentiation and self-renewal in hematopoietic cells.","['0 (ral Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,PMC1489015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Hoxa9 alone blocks the differentiation of nonleukemogenic myeloid cell-committed progenitors, coexpression with Meis1 is required for the production of AML-initiating progenitors, which also transcribe a group of hematopoietic stem cell genes, including Cd34 and Flt3 (defined as Meis1-related leukemic signature genes). Here, we use dominant trans-activating (Vp16 fusion) or trans-repressing (engrailed fusion) forms of Meis1 to define its biochemical functions that contribute to leukemogenesis. Surprisingly, Vp16-Meis1 (but not engrailed-Meis1) functioned as an autonomous oncoprotein that mimicked combined activities of Meis1 plus Hoxa9, immortalizing early progenitors, inducing low-level expression of Meis1-related signature genes, and causing leukemia without coexpression of exogenous or endogenous Hox genes. Vp16-Meis1-mediated transformation required the Meis1 function of binding to Pbx and DNA but not its C-terminal domain (CTD). The absence of endogenous Hox gene expression in Vp16-Meis1-immortalized progenitors allowed us to investigate how Hox alters gene expression and cell biology in early hematopoietic progenitors. Strikingly, expression of Hoxa9 or Hoxa7 stimulated both leukemic aggressiveness and transcription of Meis1-related signature genes in Vp16-Meis1 progenitors. Interestingly, while the Hoxa9 N-terminal domain (NTD) is essential for cooperative transformation with wild-type Meis1, it was dispensable in Vp16-Meis1 progenitors. The fact that a dominant transactivation domain fused to Meis1 replaces the essential functions of both the Meis1 CTD and Hoxa9 NTD suggests that Meis-Pbx and Hox-Pbx (or Hox-Pbx-Meis) complexes co-occupy cellular promoters that drive leukemogenesis and that Meis1 CTD and Hox NTD cooperate in gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed co-occupancy of Hoxa9 and Meis1 on the Flt3 promoter.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hcfc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",,,,"['R01 CA056876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1488994,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, TRIM5 is located in a paralogous cluster that includes TRIM6, TRIM34, and TRIM22. Although TRIM6 and TRIM34 orthologs are found in other mammals, TRIM5 has to date been identified only in primates. Cow cells exhibit early blocks to infection by several retroviruses. We identify a cytoplasmic TRIM protein encoded by LOC505265 that is responsible for the restriction of infection by several lentiviruses and N-tropic murine leukemia virus in cow cells. Susceptibility of N-tropic murine leukemia virus to 505265-mediated restriction is determined primarily by residue 110 of the viral capsid protein. Phylogenetically, cow LOC505265 segregates with the TRIM5/TRIM6/TRIM34 group, but is not an ortholog of known TRIM genes. The B30.2/SPRY domain of 505265 exhibits long variable regions, a characteristic of the proteins encoded by this paralogous group, and shows evidence of positive selection. Apparently, cows have independently evolved a retroviral restriction factor from the same TRIM family that spawned TRIM5 in primates. Particular features of this subset of cytoplasmic TRIM proteins may be conducive to the convergent evolution of virus-restricting factors.",['0 (Membrane Proteins)'],,,20060428,"['AI52014/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI060354/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI63987/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063987/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI60354/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052014/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1464360,"['GENBANK/DQ381150', 'GENBANK/DQ381151']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevation of the cerebrospinal fluid level of tau protein, associated with neuronal axons, is a neurodegenerative marker. The aim of the study was to assess the level of cerebrospinal fluid tau protein in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The study included 26 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 19 patients with clinical symptoms of cerebrospinal meningitis (reference group). Tau protein levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cerebrospinal fluid total protein level was not elevated in any of the samples. The examination was performed at diagnosis, after induction treatment, during consolidation, and after reinduction, i.e. before maintenance therapy. Neither age nor sex had an effect on tau protein levels in both groups. The mean tau protein value at diagnosis was 244.84 +/- 98.96 pg/mL in the study group (norm 300 pg/mL) and produced no correlation with initial leukocytosis, lactate dehydrogenase activity, or organomegaly at this point. Dynamic analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in tau protein after induction treatment (431.25 +/- 232.50) as compared with its level at diagnosis (244.84 +/- 98.96, P < 0.008) and later during treatment. The levels of tau protein at various points of treatment did not differ statistically significantly between the groups, except for the values obtained after termination of remission induction. The observed metabolic changes in tau protein, which is a known marker of neuronal damage, indicate that some patients are at a greater risk of central nervous system disorders. This finding requires further studies, also in reference to other central nervous system proteins, and confirms the necessity of long-term follow-up of leukemia patients.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (tau Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 May 2.,"Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a ubiquitin-like modifier that forms conjugates with target protein substrates. As its name suggests, its expression and conjugation to other proteins are highly regulated by interferon (IFN). It was recently demonstrated that ISG15 expression, ISG15 conjugation, and several enzymes involved in ISG15 modification are upregulated in an acute promyelocytic cell line following treatment with retinoic acid, suggesting a possible retinoic acid induced IFN-independent ISG15 modification pathway. In this study, we examined a possible link between IFN signaling and retinoic acid-induced ISG15 conjugation. We observed that ISGylation can be induced by retinoic acid in two myeloid leukemia cell lines. By sandwich ELISA, we detected increased IFN secretion into cell culture media following retinoic acid treatment. Blockade of the type I IFN receptor with a neutralizing antibody blocked retinoic acid induced ISG15 expression and ISG15 conjugation. Taken together, these data suggested that retinoic acid-induced secretion of IFN plays a fundamental role in retinoic acid promoted ISGylation.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '60267-61-0 (ISG15 protein, human)']",,,20060502,"['F32M071191/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01CA079849/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM066955/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['OMIM/230800'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 5.,"The US Environmental Protection Agency recently released its new guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment together with supplemental guidance for assessing susceptibility from early-life exposure to carcinogens. In particular, these guidelines encourage the use of mechanistic data in support of dose-response characterization at doses below those at which an increase in tumor frequency over background levels might be detected. In this context of the utility of mechanistic data for human cancer risk assessment, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) has developed a human relevance framework (HRF) that can be used to assess the plausibility of a mode of action (MoA) described for animal models operating in humans. The MoA is described as a sequence of key events and processes that result in an adverse outcome. A key event is a measurable precursor step that is in itself a necessary element of the MoA or is a bioindicator for such an element. A number of cellular and molecular perturbations have been identified as key events whereby DNA-reactive chemicals can produce tumors. These include DNA adducts in target tissues, gene mutations and/or chromosomal alterations in target tissues and enhanced cell proliferation in target tissues. This type of data integration approach to quantitative cancer risk assessment can be applied to 1,3-butadiene, for example, using data on biomarkers in exposed Czech workers [1]. For this study, an extensive range of biomarkers of exposure and response was assessed, including: polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes; urinary concentrations of several metabolites of 1,3-butadiene; hemoglobin adducts; HPRT mutations in T-lymphocytes; chromosomal aberrations by FISH and conventional staining procedures; sister chromatid exchanges. Exposure levels were monitored in a comprehensive fashion. For risk assessment purposes, these data need to be considered in the context of how they inform the MoA for leukemia, the tumor type reported to be increased in synthetic rubber workers exposed to 1,3-butadiene. Also, for the HRF it is necessary to establish key events for a MoA in rodents for the induction of tumors by 1,3-butadiene. There is clearly a species difference in sensitivity to tumor induction, with mice being much more sensitive than rats; key events need to explain this difference. For butadiene, the MoA is DNA-reactivity and subsequent mutagenicity and so following the EPA's cancer guidelines, a linear extrapolation is used from the point of departure (POD), unless additional data support a non-linear extrapolation. For the present case, the human bioindicator data are not informative as far as dose-response characterization is concerned. Mouse chromosome aberration data for in vivo exposures might be used for establishing a POD, with linear extrapolation from this POD. The available cytogenetic data from rodent studies appear to be sufficiently extensive and consistent for this to be a viable approach. This approach of using MoA and key events to establish the human relevance can lead to the development of specific informative bioindicators of response that can be used as surrogates to predict the shape of the tumor dose response curve at low doses. Truly informative predictors of tumor responses should be able to provide estimates of human tumor frequencies at low, environmental exposures to 1,3-butadiene.","['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",,,20060405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have attempted to investigate genetic mechanisms causing resistance to Ara-C [1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (cytarabine)], one mainstay in AML chemotherapy for decades. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Highly Ara-C-resistant murine BXH-2 strain AML cell lines were generated, and their molecular changes were compared to their sensitive parental lines. The causative changes were confirmed using a genetic approach. RESULTS: We derived nine highly Ara-C-resistant murine BXH-2 strain AML sublines via in vitro selection. p21Cip1 was dramatically downregulated and p53 protein accumulation induced by Ara-C treatment was impaired in one resistant line. In this line, repeated Ara-C exposure had selected for cells that harbor a genomic deletion affecting the splicing of Trp53 mRNA. This deletion produces an aberrant Trp53 mRNA, in which exon 4 is skipped, producing a protein lacking parts of both the transactivation and DNA-binding domains. Retroviral transduction of the sensitive parental cells with a dominant-negative Trp53 cDNA caused changes in the protein levels of p21Cip1, BAX, and cleaved caspase-3, but not bcl-XL, and rendered the cells more resistant to Ara-C. Unexpectedly, we found that pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha), a compound that has been proposed to regulate p53 protein activity, induced apoptosis in both Ara-C-sensitive and -resistant lines, and decreased Ara-C resistance in cells with either normal or mutant Trp53 genes. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that Trp53 loss-of-function could partly explain the acquisition of AML chemoresistance, and suggest that PFTalpha could be useful in treatment of relapsed AML.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous expression pattern was found consisting of a considerably higher expression of particularly LXR-alpha in CD34+ cells and a reverse expression pattern in a subset of AML CD34+CD38+ cells. CONCLUSION: These data suggest an active cholesterol metabolism and efflux in normal CD34+CD38- cells, although a subgroup of AMLs potentially demonstrate a hyperactive cholesterol metabolism.","['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not known whether ALL cells induce this phenotype and whether they receive critical signals from the tumor-associated BM endothelium. Here, we show that leukemia cells actively stimulate BM endothelium, promote de novo angiogenesis, and induce neovascularization in the leukemic BM. Soluble factors, present in the leukemic BM microenvironment, promote the proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis of BM endothelial cells, which are critical processes in tumor angiogenesis. We also show in vitro that leukemia cells display directional motion towards assembled BM endothelium and following adherence exhibit cell polarization, pseudopodia, and ultrastructural features that suggest the existence of leukemia-endothelium cross-talk. Finally, we show that BM endothelium promotes leukemia cell survival through a mechanism mediated through the anti-apoptotic molecule bcl-2. These studies indicate that ALL cells actively recruit BM endothelium and mediate the leukemia-associated neovascularization observed in ALL.

Due to the broad tropism and the ability for concentration by ultracentrifugation, most lentiviral vector preparations are produced using the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-g) protein as envelope. Recently, Hanawa and colleagues have demonstrated that the ecotropic envelope protein of murine leukemia viruses allows efficient pseudotyping of HIV-1-derived vector particles. However, this method has found little acceptance, despite potential advantages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We produced lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with murine ecotropic envelope using a four-plasmid transient transfection system and evaluated their performance in murine fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: Titers of lentiviral ""ecotropic"" supernatants were only slightly lower than those produced with VSV-g, could be concentrated by overnight centrifugation (13,000g), and efficiently transduced murine fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells but not human cells. Our Institutional Biosafety Committee agreed on the production and use of replication-defective lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with murine ecotropic envelope under biosafety level 1 (BL1) conditions with additional BL2 practices. We also obtained useful guidelines for the work with human infectious lentiviral vectors. CONCLUSIONS: For the researcher, ""ecotropic"" lentiviral vectors significantly improve the convenience of daily work, compared to the conditions required for lentiviral pseudotypes that are capable of infecting human cells. High efficiency and superior biosafety in combination with convenient handling will certainly boost the potential applicability of this important vector system.",['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,,['R01CA107492-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Mar 20.,"The effect of WIN55212-2, a cannabinoid receptor agonist, on acute inflammation of mouse ear was investigated. We found that topical application of WIN55212-2 suppressed ear swelling induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Similar inhibition was observed with CP55940, another cannabinoid receptor agonist, and HU-308, a cannabinoid CB(2) receptor-selective agonist. WIN55212-2 also suppressed the infiltration of leukocytes induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. On the other hand, WIN55212-3, an inactive enantiomer of WIN55212-2, exerted only small effects on inflammation. Notably, SR144528, a cannabinoid CB(2) receptor antagonist, also suppressed inflammatory reactions in mouse ear. Thus, both the cannabinoid CB(2) receptor agonist and antagonist are capable of reducing inflammatory reactions. We then investigated the mechanism underlying WIN55212-2-induced suppression of inflammation using cultured cells. We found that the addition of WIN55212-2 together with 2-arachidonoylglycerol blocked 2-arachidonoylglycerol-induced migration of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that had been differentiated into macrophage-like cells. The restoration of 2-arachidonoylglycerol-desensitized cells and WIN55212-2-desensitized cells from an anergic condition was examined next. We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol-treated cells rapidly recovered the capacity to respond to 2-arachidonoylglycerol. On the other hand, the anergic condition toward 2-arachidonoylglycerol continued for a longer period after pretreatment with WIN55212-2. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of WIN55212-2 is attributable, at least in part, to interference with the actions of the endogenous ligand, 2-arachidonoylglycerol.","['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Benzoxazines)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Cyclohexanols)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '5H31GI9502', '((3R)-((2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-((4-morpholinyl)methyl)pyrrolo-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benz', 'oxazin-6-yl)(1-naphthalenyl))methanone)', '83003-12-7', '(3-(2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl)-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', '8I5L034D55 (HU 308)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,20060320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The magnitude of differential expression does not necessarily indicate biological significance and other criteria are needed to supplement the information on differential expression. Three large sets of microarray data on childhood leukemia were analyzed by an original method introduced in this paper. A new type of stochastic dependence between expression levels in gene pairs was deciphered by our analysis. This modulation-like unidirectional dependence between expression signals arises when the expression of a ""gene-modulator'' is stochastically proportional to that of a ""gene-driver''. A total of more than 35% of all pairs formed from 12550 genes were conservatively estimated to belong to this type. There are genes that tend to form Type A relationships with the overwhelming majority of genes. However, this picture is not static: the composition of Type A gene pairs may undergo dramatic changes when comparing two phenotypes.

The procedures are intended to provide a sensible and statistically driven algorithm, which we argue provides a list of proteins that have a significant difference in expression.

Further, good visualisation techniques are useful for outlier detection in microarray data and for aiding biological interpretation of results, as well as for presentation of overall summaries of the data. The biplot is particularly useful for the display of microarray data as both the genes and the chips can be simultaneously plotted. In this paper we describe several ordination techniques suitable for exploring microarray data, and we call these the GE-biplot, the Chip-plot and the Gene-plot. The general method is first evaluated on synthetic data simulated in accord with current biological interpretation of microarray data. Then it is applied to two well-known data sets, namely the colon data of Alon et al. (1999) and the leukaemia data of Golub et al. (1999).

A fusion transcript between HLXB9 and ETV6 in AML with t(7;12) is occasionally found. To study the incidence of t(7;12) in infant and childhood acute leukemia, we screened 320 cases <36 months using FISH. Additionally, 28 pediatric cases >36 months with cytogenetic breakpoints at 12p and 7q were investigated. We studied the presence of an HXLB9-ETV6 fusion transcript and quantified the expression of various genes located in the 7q36 breakpoint region. In total, six AML patients carried the t(7;12) of which five were infants and one child of 18 months. Only one out of 99 infant ALL patients harbored the t(7;12). No t(7;12) was found in older children with AML or ALL. AML patients carrying a t(7;12) had a poor outcome with a 3-year EFS of 0%. A fusion of HLXB9 to ETV6 was found in four AML cases with t(7;12). The 7q36 genes NOM1, LMBR1, RNF32, and SHH were equally expressed among t(7;12)-positive AML versus t(7;12)-negative AML, t(7;12)-negative ALL, or normal bone marrow. However, the HLXB9 expression was highly increased in t(7;12)-positive cases, including those with an HLXB9-ETV6 fusion. We conclude that the t(7;12) is almost exclusively present in infant AML and covers 30% of infant AML, while it is extremely rare in infant ALL and older children. The t(7;12) is associated with a poor outcome and an ectopic expression of HLXB9 is commonly involved in this genetic subtype of leukemia.","['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this disease is initiated by infection with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), many HTLV-1 carriers survive for a long period without aggressive illness, suggesting that other factors may play roles in the progression of ATLL to an aggressive state. However, the mechanism involved in this progression still remains unclear. Previously, we have reported that ASY/Nogo mRNA was markedly down-regulated in human small-cell lung carcinomas, whereas it was expressed in normal tissues and other lung carcinomas, such as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. To understand whether or not ASY/Nogo gene is involved in the progression of ATLL, we examined the expression of ASY/Nogo mRNA in smoldering, chronic and aggressive ATLL, and found that the expression level of ASY/Nogo mRNA was markedly reduced in clinically aggressive ATLL. HTLV-1 Tax expression was not affected by the down-regulation of ASY/Nogo mRNA. These results indicate that the ASY/Nogo gene may act as a suppressor against ATLL progression, independent of Tax expression.","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myelin Proteins)', '0 (Nogo Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RTN4 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

With automation, several drawbacks of manual analysis may be circumvented. In this article, the capabilities of a commercially available automated image acquisition and analysis system were determined by detecting t(9;22)(q34;q11) in interphase nuclei of peripheral leukocytes. METHODS: Three peripheral blood samples of normal adults, 21 samples of CML patients, and one sample of a t(9;22)(q34;q11) positive cell-line were used. RESULTS: Single nuclei with correctly detected signals amounted to 99.6% of nuclei analyzed after exclusion of overlapping nuclei and nuclei with incorrect signal detection. A cut-off value of 0.84 mum was defined to discriminate between translocation positive and negative nuclei based on the shortest distance between signals. Using this value, the false positive rate of the automated analysis for negative samples was 7.0%, whereas that of the manual analysis was 5.8%. Automated and manual results showed strong correlation (R(2) = 0.985), the mean difference of results was only 3.7%.

Epub 2006 Jan 28.,"We are developing two fusion proteins consisting of a diphtheria toxin (DT) linked to either granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (DT388-GMCSF) or interleukin-3 (DT388-IL3). In trials, patients with anti-DT IgG concentrations >2.5 microg/ml had significantly lower concentrations of either fusion protein. DT389-IL2 is currently FDA approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. We noted increased concentrations of anti-DT IgG after administration of platelet concentrates (PC). Because many of these patients require transfusions, we measured the anti-DT IgG content of FFP and PC. We assayed 14 bags of FFP and 12 bags of single-donor PCs for anti-DT IgG by an enzymoimmunoassay against DT389-IL2, DT388-IL3, DT388-GMCSF. The median (percent of samples positive) of anti-DT IgG concentrations in PC against DT388-GMCSF, DT388-IL3, DT389-IL2 was 0.8 microg/ml (83%), 0.7 microg/ml (83%), and 0.3 microg/ml (58%), respectively. The median (percent of samples positive) anti-DT IgG concentration in FFP against DT388-GMCSF, DT388-IL3, and DT389-IL2 was 2.1 microg/ml (86%), 1.9 microg/ml (93%), and 1.4 microg/ml (86%), respectively. There was a strong association between anti-DT389IL2 IgG, anti-DT388IL3 IgG, and anti-DT388GMCSF IgG concentrations in both the FFP (95.6%) and PC (76.3%). Assuming a plasma volume of 3 l in a 70 kg patient, a single FFP unit would increase the plasma anti-DT389IL2 IgG, anti-DT388IL3 IgG, and anti-DT388GMCSF IgG by 0.13 microg/ml, 0.17 microg/ml, and 0.19 microg/ml, respectively. For PC, a single unit would increase plasma anti-DT389-IL2 IgG, anti-DT388-IL3 IgG, and anti-DT388-GMCSF IgG by 0.03 microg/ml, 0.06 microg/ml, and 0.07 microg/ml, respectively.

Dysregulation of the toll-like receptor-interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase system, and in particular interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M up-regulation, are associated with a number of pathologies. This review highlights recent findings on interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M reported in biomedical literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M plays a critical role in generating a refractory state of the immune system following monocytes/macrophages encounter with bacteria or tumor cells. This state has been demonstrated so far in patients who suffer from sepsis, leukemia, and acute coronary syndrome, and seems to be associated with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M overexpression in their circulating monocytes. In addition, the pseudo-kinase represents a central regulator of osteoclast differentiation and activation, and might thus be related to the onset of osteoporosis. SUMMARY: Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M is involved in the control of endotoxin tolerance in monocytes, in osteoporosis, as well as in the deactivation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Additionally, patients who suffer from several pathologies related to inflammatory responses express high levels of this molecule in their circulating monocytes.

It can readily be distinguished from other T-cell leukemias on the basis of the distinctive morphology, immunophenotype, and cytogenetics. Consistent chromosomal translocations involving the T-cell receptor gene and one of two protooncogenes (TCL-1 and MTCP-1) are seen in the majority of cases and are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. The CD52 antigen is expressed at high density on the malignant T-cells and therapy with alemtuzumab, a humanized IgG1 antibody that targets this antigen, has produced promising results. In relapsed/refractory patients overall and complete response rates have been seen in up to 76% and 60%, respectively. In previously untreated patients, complete remission rates of 100% have been reported. These responses are durable and translate into improved survival for responders. However, relapse is inevitable and strategies using both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are currently being explored. Additional clinical trials are investigating the use of alemtuzumabin combinations with chemotherapy, either concurrent or sequential.

We describe an unusual pattern of STRs in a transplanted patient with a prior history of refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. DNA chimerism studies showed a lack of engraftment at 1 and 2 months after transplantation. Atypical minor peaks occurred at each of three STR loci in the pre-transplant and 2-month post-transplant recipient samples. However, these peaks were of equal amplitude as the major corresponding allele in the 1-month post-transplant sample. A history of myelodysplasia with specific chromosomal deletions before the patient's acute myelogenous leukemia diagnosis appears to explain the spurious peaks. STR analysis of blood and archival paraffin-embedded tissues collected from the patient at various time points before transplantation reflected the evolution, progression, and response to therapy of the myelodysplasia. The case illustrates the need for comprehensive evaluation of pertinent clinical and laboratory data during engraftment monitoring to identify potential sources for error in interpretation of STR analysis.",,,,,,PMC1867594,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using direct sequencing we previously identified six different heterozygous mutants within exon 12 encoding the nucleophosmin C-terminus. Because of these mutations the shuttling protein nucleophosmin is aberrantly delocalized in the cytoplasm of leukemic cells (NPMc+). Here, we designed and tested a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) assay to detect NPM1 mutated variants. To assess specificity, sensitivity, reliability, and reproducibility, we analyzed DNA from 120 primary adult AMLs and compared DHPLC results with immunohistochemistry and sequencing. All electropherogram profiles in the 26 NPMc+ leukemias were different from the wild type, indicating 100% sensitivity. Sequencing categorized mutations A, B, and D, and all mutation A cases gave identical elution profiles. The other mutations showed typical chromatograms, with mutations B and D differing for one nucleotide. Elution profiles and sequencing also identified four new variants.

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is the method of choice for this purpose because of its high analytical sensitivity and reproducibility. Given the variation of RNA quality and quantity in clinical specimens, accurate quantitative assessment of BCR-ABL depends on normalization of the BCR-ABL signal to an appropriate internal reference. However, the controls used by different laboratories vary, and there is no clear consensus on an ideal reference due to limited investigations. In this study, we compared nine commonly used control genes for three criteria: mRNA abundance, levels in CML and non-CML cells, and their degradation kinetics in comparison with BCR-ABL. We found that beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) is the most suitable among the nine genes tested. Although ABL is most widely used, our data suggest that the amount of ABL is different in CML and non-CML cells. Moreover, ABL levels are regulated by cellular stress. These findings have a direct impact on current clinical laboratory practice and patient care because the use of a proper control gene affects the reported levels of BCR-ABL transcripts used for patient management decisions.","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,PMC1867593,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 27.,"IL-2 plays a critical role in the maintenance of CD4+CD25+ FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo. We examined the effects of IL-2 signaling in human Tregs. In vitro, IL-2 selectively up-regulated the expression of FOXP3 in purified CD4+CD25+ T cells but not in CD4+CD25- cells. This regulation involved the binding of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins to a highly conserved STAT-binding site located in the first intron of the FOXP3 gene. We also examined the effects of low-dose IL-2 treatment in 12 patients with metastatic cancer and 9 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Overall, IL-2 treatment resulted in a 1.9 median fold increase in the frequency of CD4+CD25+ cells in peripheral blood as well as a 9.7 median fold increase in FOXP3 expression in CD3+ T cells. CD56+CD3- natural killer (NK) cells also expanded during IL-2 therapy but did not express FOXP3. In vitro treatment of NK cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored the IL-2 signaling pathway leading to FOXP3 expression, suggesting that this gene was constitutively repressed by DNA methylation in these cells. Our findings support the clinical evaluation of low-dose IL-2 to selectively modulate CD4+CD25+ Tregs and increase expression of FOXP3 in vivo.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)']",,,20060427,"['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL70149/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895505,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the identification of sorafenib as a potent inhibitor of the FIP1 like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha) (T674I) mutant. Sorafenib inhibited the proliferation of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha(T674I)-transformed Ba/F3 cells and induced apoptosis of the EOL-1 cell line at a low nanomolar concentration. Western blot analysis confirmed that these effects were due to a direct effect on FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha(T674I). Sorafenib was recently approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

Epub 2006 Apr 27.,"BACKGROUND: Gene signatures (Indicator genes) in bone marrow that provide more precise prognostication in haematological malignancy have been identified by microarray expression studies. It would be beneficial to measure these diagnostic signatures in peripheral blood. AIMS: To determine the degree of correspondence of gene expression for a set of Indicator genes between bone marrow and peripheral blood in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: Parallel bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood samples were obtained from 19 patients diagnosed with AML and mononuclear cells isolated from both sample types. mRNA was globally amplified by polyadenylated real-time polymerase chain reaction (polyA RT-PCR); the expression of 15 AML Indicator genes, identified from previous microarray studies, was measured by RT-PCR. All values were normalised to the mean expression of three housekeeping genes (IF2-beta, GAP and RbS9) and were statistically compared using SPSS software. RESULTS: No significant difference in expression between bone marrow and peripheral blood was observed for 10 of the genes (leptin receptor, CD33, adipsin, proteoglycan 1, MB-1, cyclin D3, hSNF2b, proteasome iota, HkrT-1 and E2A), indicating its possible use in monitoring disease activity in peripheral blood samples, whereas c-myb, HOXA9, LYN, cystatin c and LTC4s showed significantly different expression between bone marrow and peripheral blood samples. CONCLUSION: These results indicate a possible use for the method in monitoring AML in peripheral blood by RT-PCR measurement of Indicator genes. In addition, the initial use of polyA PCR facilitates translation to very small clinical samples, including fractionated cell populations, of particular importance for monitoring haematological malignancy.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,20060427,,PMC1861748,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HuM195 was derivatized with sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) to introduce maleimide groups for reaction with NLS-peptides and then conjugated with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for labeling with (111)In. The immunoreactivity of NLS-HuM195 was evaluated by its ability to displace the binding of (111)In-HuM195 to HL-60 leukemia cells. Nuclear localization was measured in HL-60 cells by subcellular fractionation. The antiproliferative effects of (111)In-NLS-HuM195 and (111)In-HuM195 on HL-60, U937, or K562 cells with high, intermediate, or minimal CD33 expression, respectively, were studied. The survival of HL-60 cells or patient AML specimens treated with (111)In-NLS-HuM195 or (111)In-HuM195 was studied. Normal tissue toxicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice injected intravenously with of 3.7 MBq (22 microg) of (111)In-NLS-HuM195 or (111)In-HuM195. RESULTS: NLS-HuM195 exhibited relatively preserved CD33 binding affinity (dissociation constant [K(d)] = 4.3 +/- 1.7 x 10(-9) mol/L to 6.9 +/- 1.3 x 10(-9) mol/L). Nuclear uptake increased from 10.5% +/- 0.5% for (111)In-HuM195 to 28.5% +/- 4.1% or 65.9% +/- 1.5% for (111)In-HuM195 substituted with 4 or 8 NLS-peptides, respectively. The inhibitory concentrations of 50% (IC(50)) and 90% (IC(90)) for HL-60 cells treated with (111)In-NLS-HuM195 were 37 kBq per 10(3) cells and 77-81 kBq per 10(3) cells, respectively. The IC(50) and IC(90) values for (111)In-HuM195 were 92 kBq per 10(3) cells and 203 kBq per 10(3) cells. Growth inhibition was correlated with the level of CD33 expression. The survival of HL-60 cells was reduced from 232 +/- 22 colonies (control) to 7 +/- 1 colonies with 1.48 mBq per cell of (111)In-NLS-HuM195; no colonies were found at 3.33 mBq per cell. The surviving fraction decreased >2-fold in 7 of 9 AML specimens treated with an excess of (111)In-NLS-HuM195 and >10-fold in 2 of these specimens. There were no decreases in body weight or hematologic parameters or increases in alanine aminotransferase or creatinine in mice administered 3.7 MBq (22 microg) of (111)In-NLS-HuM195 or (111)In-HuM195. There was no morphologic damage to the liver or kidneys. CONCLUSION: We conclude that NLS-peptides routed (111)In-HuM195 to the nucleus of AML cells, where the emitted Auger electrons were lethal.

Epub 2006 Apr 27.,"Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is expressed in B-lymphocytes. Mutations in Btk cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans. However, the mechanism of activation and signaling of this enzyme has not been fully investigated. We have here shown that the peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) Pin1 is a negative regulator of Btk, controlling its expression level by reducing its half-life, whereas the catalytic activity of Btk was unaffected. The negative regulatory effect of Pin1 was observed both in cell lines and in Pin(-/-) mice and was found to be dependent on a functionally intact Btk. This may constitute a feedback loop for the regulation of Btk. The target region in Btk was localized to the pleckstrin homology domain suggesting that interphase phosphorylation of serine 115 (Ser-115) in Btk is required, whereas mitosis phosphorylation of serine 21 (Ser-21) is critical. Accordingly, Pin 1 was shown to associate with Btk through binding to Ser-21 and -115, respectively, both of which lie in a classical Pin1-binding pocket. Using a phosphomitotic antibody, it was found that Btk harbors a bona fide MPM2 epitope corresponding to a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue followed by a proline. Our results indicate that the peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1 interacts with Btk in a cell cycle-dependent manner, regulating the Btk expression level.","['0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Pin1 protein, mouse)']",,,20060427,['GM 58556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of insulin action, resulting in reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake, is mediated in part through stimulation of RhoA activity. One regulator of RhoA activity is leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG). The LARG gene maps to a region on chromosome 11q23-24 that shows genetic linkage to BMI and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians. Because of its role in RhoA activation, the LARG gene was analyzed as a positional candidate gene for this linkage. Sequencing of the LARG gene and genotyping of variants identified several polymorphisms that were associated with in vivo rates of insulin-mediated glucose uptake, at both physiological and maximally stimulating insulin concentrations, among 322 nondiabetic Pima Indians who had undergone a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The strongest association with rate of glucose uptake was found with a Tyr1306Cys polymorphism (P < 0.0001, adjusted for age, sex, percent body fat, and nuclear family membership). In transient transfection studies in NIH3T3 cells, the LARG(Cys1306) protein had reduced activity compared with LARG(Tyr1306) protein (P < 0.05). We propose that the Tyr1306Cys substitution in LARG, through its differential activation of RhoA, increases insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Pima Indians.","['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)']",,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 12 patients received gentamicin as the sole antibiotic; 10 patients required an additional antimicrobial for urine samples that grew more than 1 organism and contained bacteria resistant to gentamicin; 26 patients needed antibiotics other than gentamicin for gentamicin-resistant uropathogens. Three patients with organisms sensitive to gentamicin as well as another antibiotic received an agent considered less nephrotoxic than gentamicin. After the procedure, sepsis occurred in only 1 patient, a man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Three control group patients developed a fever in excess of 39 degrees C. One of these patients did not require a change of antibiotic, another patient recovered after 3 changes of antibiotic, and the third patient recovered from septicemia after receiving ventilatory support. Antibiotics should be prescribed on the basis of recent urine microbiologic test results, and empiric therapy with gentamicin should be avoided in patients with spinal cord injury who are scheduled to undergo urologic procedures.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Gentamicins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 27.,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is now recognized as a key regulator of phosphate metabolism. Numerous reports have found elevated serum FGF23 concentrations in oncogenic osteomalacia associated with mesenchymal tumors. Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia more rarely occurs in non-mesenchymal tumors. We identified elevated serum FGF23 levels in one patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and hypophosphatemia, prompting us to examine FGF23 concentrations in other patients with B-cell neoplasms. FGF23 levels were elevated in several patients with myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and were significantly associated with serum paraprotein and beta-2 microglobulin concentrations in these patients. Hypophosphatemia was not observed even in those patients with elevated FGF23, and a weak positive correlation was noted between serum FGF23 and phosphate concentrations. Malignant plasma cells in bone marrow trephines from patients with myeloma showed cytoplasmic expression of FGF23, similar to the cytoplasmic localization of FGF23 already described in mesenchymal tumors associated with oncogenic osteomalacia. Our findings contribute to an expanding literature regarding abnormal FGF/FGF receptor-signaling in myeloma. The absence of hypophosphatemia in these cases suggests either that FGF23 produced by clonal B-cells lacks systemic bioactivity or that other factors contribute to maintain serum phosphate. We suggest that the relationship between FGF23 and skeletal disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasias deserves further study.","['0 (FGF23 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '7Q7P4S7RRE (Fibroblast Growth Factor-23)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,20060427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data suggesting cancers arise from rare self-renewing stem cells that are biologically distinct from their more numerous differentiated progeny may explain this paradox. Current anticancer therapies have been developed to decrease the bulk of the tumour mass (i.e. the differentiated cancer cells). Although treatments directed against the bulk of the cancer may produce dramatic responses, they are unlikely to result in long-term remissions if the rare cancer stem cells are also not targeted. Conversely, treatments that selectively attack cancer stem cells will not immediately eliminate the differentiated cancer cells, and might therefore be prematurely abandoned if clinical activity is judged solely by traditional response criteria that reflect changes in the bulk of the tumour. Re-examining both our pre-clinical and clinical drug development paradigms to include the cancer stem cell concept has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many cancers.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",56,,20060427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present investigation, the effects of Talpha1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of human leukemia cell lines (HL-60, K562 and K562/ADM) were studied. The proliferation was significantly depressed after 96 h of treatment with Talpha1, and obvious signs of apoptosis, i.e., cell morphology, nuclei condensation and Annexin V binding, were observed thereafter. Moreover, the up-regulation of Fas/Apol (CD95) and decrease in bcl-2 anti-apoptotic gene expression were observed in apoptotic cells. The expression and the function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can be slightly inhibited by Talpha1. It is noteworthy that K562 and K562/ADM were more sensitive than HL-60 cells when subjected to Talpha1. Furthermore, HepG-2, the human hepatoma cell line, displayed significant less sensitivity to Talpha1 than all the human leukemia cell lines. D-Tubocurarine (TUB), a nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) antagonist, significantly antagonized the inhibition effects induced by Talpha1, whereas atropine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, did not exhibit such effects. All the results indicate that Talpha1 was able to significantly suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Cholinergic)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'W0B22ISQ1C (Thymalfasin)', 'W9YXS298BM (Tubocurarine)']",,,20060427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were stained with activated caspase-3 and apoptotic cells counted. Proliferation was measured by counting cell numbers, and cell cycle stage was determined using propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis. LIF injected either IP or IV had no effect on body weight or total retina area, but significantly increased the peripheral retinal avascular area. In both IP and IV injected groups there was no difference in the number of apoptotic cells between PBS- or LIF-injected groups; although in the p7/9 retinas, both injected groups had significantly more apoptotic cells than the non-injected group. In vitro, there was no effect of LIF on RMVEC apoptosis; however, cell counts were significantly lower in the LIF-treated group. Antibody to LIF restored the cell counts to untreated levels.

It is, however, unclear whether MRD is homogeneously distributed within the bone marrow (BM) and whether this affects MRD diagnostics. We, therefore, analysed MRD levels in 141 paired BM samples (two independent punctures at different locations) from 26 ALL patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. MRD levels were comparable in 112 paired samples (79%), whereas two samples (both taken at day 15) had MRD levels that differed more than threefold. In the remaining 27 paired samples, MRD could be quantified or detected in one sample only. In four patients, MRD-based risk group classification was dependent on the site of BM puncture. Repetition of MRD analyses using 10-fold replicates instead of triplicates resolved most differences. In conclusion, MRD levels in paired BM samples were highly comparable, indicating that it is sufficient to analyse MRD in a single sample only. Nevertheless, MRD-based risk group classification can differ between paired BM samples, mainly because of variation below the quantitative range of the PCR assay rather than to a different distribution of leukaemic cells within the BM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key second messenger in SDF-1 signal/response coupling is phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. SDF-1 elevated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels markedly in the multipotent FDCP-mix stem cell line. Similarly, transfection with BCR/ABL or TEL/PDGFRbeta leukaemogenic tyrosine kinases chronically elevated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels. However, whilst an SDF-1 chemotactic response was observed in TEL/PDGFRbeta-transfected cells, in BCR/ABL cells this was markedly decreased, which was not due to Ras-pathway activation. Thus, multipotent cells can respond to SDF-1, despite chronic increases in this second messenger indicating that a discrete pool of SDF-1-stimulated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production drives the chemotactic response. To discern the mechanism for the differential effects of these oncogenes we considered subcellular localisation. As TEL/PDGFRbeta has a cytosolic location whilst BCR/ABL associates with actin, we removed the actin-binding domain from BCR/ABL. We observed relocation of BCR/ABL to the cytosol and increased SDF-1 responses. We conclude that the localisation of BCR/ABL to the cytoskeleton is essential for effects on motility and moderating SDF-1 responses is not essential in tyrosine kinase-mediated leukaemic transformation.","['0 (Actins)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, these leukaemic stem cells should be the target cells for therapy and for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. Because of its presence on blasts of 11q23-rearranged high-risk leukaemic patients, neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) is thought to be a valuable marker for detecting leukaemic stem cells. Six acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)/abn(11q23) and three acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)/t(4;11) samples were analysed by four-colour flow cytometry for NG2 expression on primitive cell populations. Candidate leukaemic cell populations were defined by the antigen profiles CD34+CD38- in AML and CD34+CD19-CD117+ in ALL. Surprisingly, in all patients these candidate stem cell populations were shown to lack expression of NG2. Instead, a correlation between the expression of the myeloid differentiation marker CD33 and increasing levels of NG2 on maturing cells could be demonstrated. Similarly, in ALL patients CD34+CD19+ cells showed a higher expression of NG2 mRNA compared with CD34+CD19-. Thus, NG2 appears to be upregulated with differentiation and not to be expressed on primitive disease-maintaining cells. This hampers the clinical use of NG2 as a therapeutic target and as a sensitive marker for MRD detection.","['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children with Fanconi anaemia (FA), however, have a very high risk of developing AML. FA is a rare inherited disease caused by mutations in at least 12 genes, of which Fanconi anaemia group G gene (FANCG) is one of the commonest. To address to what extent FANCG variants contribute to sporadic childhood AML, we determined the spectrum of FANCG sequence variants in 107 children diagnosed with sporadic AML, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescent single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing methodologies. The significance of variants was determined by frequency analysis and assessment of evolutionary conservation. Seven children (6.5%) carried variants in FANCG. Two of these carried two variants, including the known IVS2 + 1G>A mutation with the novel missense mutation S588F, and R513Q with the intronic deletion IVS12-38 (-28)_del11, implying that these patients might have been undiagnosed FA patients. R513Q, which affects a semi-conserved amino acid, was carried in two additional children with AML. Although not significant, the frequency of R513Q was higher in children with AML than unselected cord bloods. While FANCG mutation carrier status does not predispose to sporadic AML, the identification of unrecognised FA patients implies that FA presenting with primary AML in childhood is more common than suspected.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While RARbeta2 was unmethylated in 10/10 bone marrow and 7/7 blood samples from healthy individuals, the gene was hypermethylated in 43% of the AML patients. The RARbeta2 degree of promoter methylation differed between and within individuals, and the mRNA transcription levels of the gene varied inter-individually by a factor of 4000. A significant inverse correlation between promoter hypermethylation and gene expression could be established (t-test, P = 0.019). Comparison of methylation data with a series of other molecular alterations in the same patient materials revealed a correlation between hypermethylation of the RARbeta2 promoter and the presence of CBF-MYH11 fusion transcripts (P < 0.01). Our data suggest that RARbeta2 promoter methylation is frequent in AML and may co-operate with the expression of CBF-MYH11 fusion transcripts in leukaemogenesis.","['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These fusions result in either chimeric proteins or activation of the partner gene. However, there are a few examples of abnormalities resulting in truncated and, most likely, unproductive ETV6 proteins, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of ETV6 and/or the partner is leukaemogenic. We present a novel ETV6 rearrangement, identified in a paediatric pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and molecular genetic analyses revealed a fusion of ETV6 and BAZ2A (at 12q13), generated through a cryptic rearrangement between 12p13 and 12q13, consisting of exons 1 and 2 of ETV6 and a sequence from intron 1 of BAZ2A. This transcript is not expected to produce any chimeric protein, but may encode a truncated form of ETV6, containing the first 54 amino acids (aa), followed by 16 aa from the 3' fusion sequence, reminiscent of ETV6 fusions with MDS2, LOC115548, PER1, and STL. The rearrangement might also modify the regulation of BAZ2A by either activating a cryptic promoter or by coming under the control of the ETV6 promoter. The present case emphasises that 'unproductive' ETV6 rearrangements may play an important pathogenetic role in leukaemia.","['0 (BAZ2A protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been several reports of strain-dependent anesthetic actions in rodents, indicating that significant genetic differences exist in the hypnotic and antinociceptive effects of various anesthetics. METHODS: Loss of righting reflex was used to compare the hypnotic action of pentobarbital, ketamine, nitrous oxide and isoflurane between two genetically different populations of mice, C57BL/6 with black hair and Friends virus B (FVB) with white hair. RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice were more susceptible than FVB mice to the hypnotic effects of ketamine, pentobarbital and nitrous oxide. However, the sensitivity to isoflurane did not differ between C57BL/6 and FVB mice. CONCLUSION: Genetic background affects the hypnotic susceptibility to some anesthetic agents in mice. Our results indicate that there may be a different genetic basis for the operation of hypnosis between isoflurane and other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, ketamine and nitrous oxide.","['0 (Anesthetics, Dissociative)', '0 (Anesthetics, Inhalation)', '0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)', '690G0D6V8H (Ketamine)', 'CYS9AKD70P (Isoflurane)', 'I4744080IR (Pentobarbital)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of an aleukaemic leukaemia cutis, which had a history of exposure to atomic bomb radiation. A 57-year-old Japanese woman initially presented with a 20-week history of multiple red papules and plaques mainly over the trunk. Histological examination revealed the infiltration of atypical monocytic cells in the dermis, but no leukaemic cells were detected in the peripheral blood. Twenty-three weeks after the appearance of the eruption, leukaemic cells were detected in the peripheral blood for the first time. The results of immunohistochemistry of the skin biopsy specimen and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood indicated the rare phenotype of myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukaemia. This is the first case report of myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukaemia presenting as aleukaemic leukaemia cutis in the English literature, and awareness of this clinical presentation may be important to reach the correct diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We compared the clinical characteristics, biological features, and outcomes between white and black children with AML who were treated on five consecutive clinical protocols (1980-2002) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We used proportional hazards modeling to investigate the relation between race and outcome. RESULTS: We observed no statistically significant differences between the 229 white and 58 black patients in clinical characteristics, FAB subtype, cytogenetic features, or outcome. There were no significant differences in event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS) between the two race groups in individual clinical trials or in all studies combined. For the study group as a whole, the 5-year survival estimate was 39.2% +/- 3.6% for white patients and 33.8% +/- 6.5% for black patients. However, on our most recent trial (AML-97), there was a trend towards inferior outcome among black patients: the 5-year survival estimates were 55.6% +/- 12.3% and 27.3% +/- 13.5% for whites and blacks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although we detected no differences in treatment outcome between white and black children with AML over the entire study period, black children appear to have worse outcomes than white children during more recent studies.

Epub 2006 Apr 26.,"The transcriptional regulatory factor PU.1 is important for the regulation of a diverse group of hematopoietic and myeloid genes. Posttranslational phosphorylation of PU.1 has been demonstrated in the regulation of a variety of promoters in normal cells. In leukemia cells, differing patterns of PU.1 phosphorylation have been described among acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) subtypes. Therefore, we hypothesized that modulation of PU.1-dependent gene expression might be a molecular mediator of alterations in myeloid cell growth and differentiation that have been demonstrated to be early events in benzene-induced leukemogenesis. We found that freshly isolated human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) exhibit multiple PU.1-DNA binding species that represent PU.1 proteins in varying degrees of phosphorylation states as determined by phosphatase treatment in combination with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Maturation of granulocyte and monocyte lineages is also accompanied by distinct changes in PU.1-DNA binding patterns. Experiments reveal that increasing doses of the benzene metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ) induce a time-and dose-dependent alteration in the pattern of PU.1-DNA binding in cultured human CD34(+) cells, corresponding to hyperphosphorylation of the PU.1 protein. HQ-induced alterations in PU.1-DNA binding are concomitant with a sustained immature CD34(+) phenotype and cytokine-dependent enhanced clonogenic activity in cultured human HPC. These results suggest that HQ induces a dysregulation in the external signals modulating PU.1 protein phosphorylation and this dysregulation may be an early event in the generation of benzene-induced AML.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,,20060426,['ES06258/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, IGF-1R and its downstream signaling effectors are good candidates for molecular-based targeted antitumor therapies. Indeed, protein inhibitors of IGF-1R signaling and IGF-1R blocking antibodies are undergoing clinical trials. Herein, the molecular basis for antibody-mediated IGF-1R signal inhibition has been investigated in a hematopoietic cell line model, FDC-P1, that has been rendered interleukin-3 independent in a ligand-dependent manner through retroviral-mediated expression of IGF-1R (FD/IGF-1R). Furthermore, the ability of an anti-IGF-1R antibody to synergize with signal-transduction pathway inhibitors and induce apoptosis was determined. The alphaIGF-1R antibody, A12, was capable of arresting IGF-1 or insulin-induced FD/IGF-1R cell proliferation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and resulted in apoptotic induction. A12 effectiveness could be potentiated through combination treatment with small molecule inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. These results validate the use of the FD/IGF-1R cells to evaluate the effectiveness and mechanisms of targeted IGF-1R therapeutic strategies.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,20060427,['R01 CA098195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterize the biological features of this disease, we analyzed immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH) mutations, ZAP-70 and CD38 in 19 cases with de novo B-PLL. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes analysis showed an unmutated pattern (>98% homology to germ line) in 9/17 cases (53%), with 100% homology in eight. In the remaining, it ranged from 90 to 97.4%, with three cases slightly mutated (98-95%) and five heavily mutated (<95%). All B-PLL utilized members of VH3 (11/17) and VH4 (6/17) families, with V3-23, V4-59 and V4-34 gene accounting for more than half of them, regardless of mutational status. ZAP-70, assessed by flow cytometry, ranged from 1 to 91% cells, being > or =20% in 57% of cases. CD38 ranged from 1 to 99% (median 21%). There was no correlation between IgVH status and ZAP-70 or CD38 expression, but male gender and del(17p) were more common in the unmutated group. Neither IgVH mutations, CD38 expression nor del(17p) influenced patients' outcome. Unexpectedly, ZAP-70+ B-PLL patients survived longer (40 months) than ZAP-70- B-PLL (8 months). B-PLL appears biologically heterogeneous regarding IgVH mutations, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression, showing a pattern distinct from that of other lymphoproliferative disorders.","['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,20060427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, this pathway is an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer strategies. Recent studies showed that PI3K/Akt signaling is frequently activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient blasts and strongly contributes to proliferation, survival and drug resistance of these cells. Upregulation of the PI3K/Akt network in AML may be due to several reasons, including FLT3, Ras or c-Kit mutations. Small molecules designed to selectively target key components of this signal transduction cascade induce apoptosis and/or markedly increase conventional drug sensitivity of AML blasts in vitro. Thus, inhibitory molecules are currently being developed for clinical use either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies. However, the PI3K/Akt pathway is important for many physiological cellular functions and, in particular, for insulin signaling, so that its blockade in vivo might cause severe systemic side effects. In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge about PI3K/Akt signaling in AML cells and we examine the rationale for targeting this fundamental signal transduction network by means of selective pharmacological inhibitors.","['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 27.,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), activating mutations in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene predict poor prognosis. We determined FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3/ITD) and D835 point mutations in paired initial and relapse samples from 80 pediatric and adult AML patients. One D835 point mutation was found in an initial pediatric AML sample. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3/ITDs were present in 21 initial and 22 relapse samples (26.3 and 27.5%, respectively). Interestingly, FLT3/ITD positivity was related to a significantly shorter time to relapse, most pronounced when the ITD-positive status was found at relapse (P<0.001). However, FLT3/ITD status changed between diagnosis and relapse in 14 cases. In four patients, the FLT3/ITD became undetectable at relapse in five patients FLT3/ITDs were only detected at relapse, and in five patients the length or number of FLT3/ITDs changed. Gain of FLT3/ITDs may suggest oligoclonality with selective outgrowth of the FLT3/ITD-positive clone, whereas losses may reflect ITDs in the more mature leukemic cells rather than in the leukemic stem cell, or, alternatively, that other genetic aberrations provided a greater selective advantage. Studying FLT3/ITD kinetics in minimal residual disease setting may provide some answers for the changes we observed. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3/ITD is a relevant marker for prognosis, and remains an important target for therapeutic inhibition.","['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,20060427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor relapse originating from a minimal residual leukemia poses another threat. Although a combination of risk factors was supposed to enhance the incidence and severity of transplantation-associated disease, a murine model of a liver-adapted B-cell lymphoma has previously shown a survival benefit and tumor growth inhibition by nonlethal subcutaneous infection with murine CMV. Here we have investigated the underlying antitumoral mechanism. Virus replication proved to be required, since inactivated virions or the highly attenuated enhancerless mutant mCMV-DeltaMIEenh did not impact the lymphoma in the liver. Surprisingly, the dissemination-deficient mutant mCMV-DeltaM36 inhibited tumor growth, even though this virus fails to infect the liver. On the other hand, various strains of herpes simplex viruses consistently failed to control the lymphoma, even though they infect the liver. A quantitative analysis of the tumor growth kinetics identified a transient tumor remission by apoptosis as the antitumoral effector mechanism. Tumor cell colonies with cells surviving the CMV-induced ""apoptotic crisis"" lead to tumor relapse even in the presence of full-blown tissue infection. Serial transfer of surviving tumor cells did not indicate a selection of apoptosis-resistant genetic variants. NK cell activity of CD49b-expressing cells failed to control the lymphoma upon adoptive transfer. We propose the existence of an innate antitumoral mechanism that is triggered by CMV infection and involves an apoptotic signal effective at a distant site of tumor growth.",,,,,,PMC1472044,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that monocyte-derived DCs form syncytia and are infected upon coculture with HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes. We examined the role of DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin expressed in DCs, in HTLV-1-induced syncytium formation. DC-SIGN is known to bind with high affinity to various viral envelope glycoproteins, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus, as well as to the cellular receptors ICAM-2 and ICAM-3. After cocultivating DCs and HTLV-1-infected cells, we found that anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were able to decrease the number and size of HTLV-1-induced syncytia. Moreover, expression of the lectin in epithelial-cell lines dramatically enhanced the ability to fuse with HTLV-1-positive cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the envelope (Env) glycoproteins of HIV and other viruses, that of HTLV-1 does not bind directly to DC-SIGN.

Interactions of retroviruses in mixed infections and their effects on disease induction are poorly understood. Upon infection of mice, ecotropic retroviruses recombine with endogenous proviruses to generate polytropic viruses that utilize different cellular receptors. Interactions among the retroviruses of this mixed infection facilitate disease induction. Using mice infected with defined mixtures of the ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) and different polytropic viruses, we demonstrate several dramatic effects of mixed infections. Remarkably, inoculation of F-MuLV with polytropic MuLVs completely suppressed the generation of new recombinant viruses and dramatically altered disease induction. Co-inoculation of F-MuLV with one polytropic virus significantly lengthened survival times, while inoculation with another polytropic MuLV induced a rapid and severe neurological disease. In both instances, the level of the polytropic MuLV was increased 100- to 1,000-fold, whereas the ecotropic MuLV level remained unchanged. Surprisingly, nearly all of the polytropic MuLV genomes were packaged within F-MuLV virions (pseudotyped) very soon after infection. At this time, only a fractional percentage of cells in the mouse were infected by either virus, indicating that the co-inoculated viruses had infected the same small subpopulation of susceptible cells. The profound amplification of polytropic MuLVs in coinfected mice may be facilitated by pseudotyping or, alternatively, by transactivation of the polytropic virus in the coinfected cells. This study illustrates the complexity of the interactions between components of mixed retrovirus infections and the dramatic effects of these interactions on disease processes.",,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1472087,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigate the role of the peptidyl prolyl isomerase enzyme cyclophilin A in TRIM5alpha antiviral activity. Cyclophilin A is recruited into nascent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions as well as incoming HIV-1 capsids, where it isomerizes an exposed proline residue. Here we show that cyclophilin A renders HIV-1 sensitive to restriction by TRIM5alpha in cells from Old World monkeys, African green monkey and rhesus macaque. Inhibition of cyclophilin A activity with cyclosporine A, or reducing cyclophilin A expression with small interfering RNA, rescues TRIM5alpha-restricted HIV-1 infectivity. The effect of cyclosporine A on HIV-1 infectivity is dependent on TRIM5alpha expression, and expression of simian TRIM5alpha in permissive feline cells renders them able to restrict HIV-1 in a cyclosporine A-sensitive way. We use an HIV-1 cyclophilin A binding mutant (CA G89V) to show that cyclophilin A has different roles in restriction by Old World monkey TRIM5alpha and owl monkey TRIM-Cyp. TRIM-Cyp, but not TRIM5alpha, recruits its tripartite motif to HIV-1 capsid via cyclophilin A and, therefore, HIV-1 G89V is insensitive to TRIM-Cyp but sensitive to TRIM5alpha. We propose that cyclophilin A isomerization of a proline residue in the TRIM5alpha sensitivity determinant of the HIV-1 capsid sensitizes it to restriction by Old World monkey TRIM5alpha. In humans, where HIV-1 has adapted to bypass TRIM5alpha activity, the effects of cyclosporine A are independent of TRIM5alpha. We speculate that cyclophilin A alters HIV-1 sensitivity to a TRIM5alpha-independent innate immune pathway in human cells.","['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",,,,['076608/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],PMC1472055,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent progress in understanding G-CSF signaling events, the mechanisms that underlie the distinct spectrum of biological functions attributed to G-CSF-mediated gene expression remain unclear. Previous studies have identified a number of genes, which are up-regulated in G-CSF-stimulated myeloid precursor cells. In this study, we sought to identify additional target genes of G-CSF-mediated proliferation and/or differentiation. cDNA representational difference analysis was used with the 32Dcl3 cell line as a model system to isolate genes, which are up-regulated in an immediate-early manner upon G-CSF stimualtion. We isolated p120 nucleolar-proliferation antigen (NOL1), a highly conserved, nucleolar-specific, RNA-binding protein of unknown function, and confirmed its expression by Northern blot analysis in 4-h, G-CSF-induced 32Dcl3 cells. Isolation of a mouse p120 genomic clone revealed the presence of a signal tranducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-binding site in the first intron of the gene. We demonstrate the importance of STAT3 and STAT5 in mediating the G-CSF response with respect to p120 expression by transient transfection analysis, oligonucleotide pull-down assays, and the loss of p120 expression in the bone marrow of mice lacking normal STAT3 signaling. In addition, overexpression of p120 in G-CSF-induced 32D cells revealed normal, morphologic maturation and growth characteristics but loss of lactoferrin expression, a marker of normal neutrophil maturation, suggesting that inappropriate expression of the p120 gene can result in aberrant neutrophil maturation.","['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (NOP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Nop2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (tRNA Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",,,,"['P01-HL63357/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK53471/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, recent studies suggest the involvement of miRNAs in the initiation and progression of cancer. miR155 and BIC, its host gene, have been reported to accumulate in human B cell lymphomas, especially in diffuse large B cell lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphomas, and certain types of Burkitt lymphomas. Here, we show that E(mu)-mmu-miR155 transgenic mice exhibit initially a preleukemic pre-B cell proliferation evident in spleen and bone marrow, followed by frank B cell malignancy.

METHODS: Expression of LIF in chorionic villi was examined using Western blot. Serum progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels were determined using radioimmunoassay. A streptavidin peroxidase conjugated semi-quantitative immunohistochemical assay was used to exam LIF protein expression. RESULTS: The levels of progesterone and hCG in the normal early pregnancy and threatened abortion groups were (95 +/- 26) nmol/L and (75 +/- 14) kU/L, and (90 +/- 26) nmol/L and (68 +/- 13) kU/L, respectively. The differences were not significant (P > 0.05). The levels of progesterone and hCG in the inevitable group were significantly decreased to (36 +/- 17) nmol/L and (13 +/- 3) kU/L, respectively. The differences when compared to the other groups were statistically significant (P < 0.01). LIF protein expression was observed in all cases and located mainly in the cytoplasm of trophoblast cells. The expression of LIF in inevitable abortion group 0.30 +/- 0.02 was lower than that in other groups (P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the expression of LIF between the normal early pregnancy group and threatened abortion group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: LIF may play a role in the maintenance of normal pregnancy. Reduction of LIF expression in chorionic villi may induce the decrease of serum progesterone and hCG levels and, ultimately, cause inevitable abortion.","['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine the risk factors and outcome of CMV-A and CMV-D among patients with lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with such patients identified between 1997 and 2003 at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Seventy-one patients with 82 episodes of CMV-A and/or CMV-D (CMV-A in 38 episodes and CMV-D in 44 episodes) were studied. RESULTS: Cytomegalovirus antigenemia and/or CMV-D were more common among patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma than among those with Hodgkin's disease (P = 0.01). Most CMV infectious episodes occurred in patients who had active (88%) and stage III/IV lymphoma (84%). Eleven of 65 patients (17%) with outcome data died with CMV-A and/or CMV-D. Death with CMV infection was more common among patients with CMV-D than among those with CMV-A (29% vs. 3%, respectively, P = 0.005). Predictors of death by univariate analysis included intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, high antigenemia burden, relapse of CMV-A and/or CMV-D, and antiviral-associated toxicity (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified antiviral toxicity as the only independent predictor of death (P = 0.01).

The recognition of an inactive conformation of Abl, in which a catalytically important Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif is flipped by approximately 180 degrees with respect to the active conformation, underlies the specificity of the cancer drug imatinib, which is used to treat CML. The DFG motif is not flipped in crystal structures of inactive forms of the closely related Src kinases, and imatinib does not inhibit c-Src. We present a structure of the kinase domain of Abl, determined in complex with an ATP-peptide conjugate, in which the protein adopts an inactive conformation that resembles closely that of the Src kinases. An interesting aspect of the Src-like inactive structure, suggested by molecular dynamics simulations and additional crystal structures, is the presence of features that might facilitate the flip of the DFG motif by providing room for the phenylalanine to move and by coordinating the aspartate side chain as it leaves the active site. One class of mutations in BCR-Abl that confers resistance to imatinib appears more likely to destabilize the inactive Src-like conformation than the active or imatinib-bound conformations.

A chance for cure or a longer life expectancy with earlier diagnosis of an asymptomatic recurrence exists in only a few diseases. For far more diseases, a symptom oriented follow-up with an emphasis on quality of life, treatment associated complications, evaluation of symptoms, and psychological support is recommended. In patients with a dislike of regular visits or in diseases without options for further treatment it will be sufficient if the patient returns in the case of complaints.

Allogeneic bone marrow grafts from 19 donors (18 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors and 1 one antigen-mismatched related donor) were transplanted into patients aged 3-17 years (16 with leukemia and 3 with non-malignant disease). The patients received a cell dose, with median total nucleated cell dose of 3.9 x 10(8)/kg (range, 0.7 - 8.7 x 10(8)) and median CD 34+ cell dose of 3.0 x 10(6)/g (range, 0.3 - 9.8 x 10(6)). Seventeen patients (89.4%) engrafted after a median of 19 days (range 14-20 days). Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) grade II to IV developed in 8 patients (42. 1%), and limited chronic GVHD developed in 2 evaluable patients (10.5%). Twelve of the 19 patients were alive at a median follow-up of 1460 days (range, 270-2260 days). Full chimeric hematopoiesis was maintained in 11 of these 12 patients. Six patients (31.6%) had relapse of their underlying malignant disease, and one of them is still alive. Seven patients died (5 because of relapse and/or disease progression and 2 because of infectious complication). The underlying diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 4 cases: 3 CR2, 1 Ph+), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 2 cases: 1 CR2, 1 refractory), and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML; 1 case). Relapsed leukemia at an extramedullary site occurred in 2 patients with ALL after BMT.

Deep sedation, mandatory for these procedures in young children, can reduce patient anxiety and get their compliance during procedures. This study assessed clinical experience of employing methohexital or thiamylal with midazolam as sedative for elective invasive procedures in children with ALL. Between November 1997 and March 2004, 20 out of 33 ALL children received deep sedation after evaluation, mainly because of relatively young age (mean age 4.60 +/- 2.03 years). A total of 176 procedures were done, with 139 being intrathecal therapy. There were 98 and 78 procedures for the methohexital and thiamylal groups, respectively. The average dosages to complete the procedures were 2.2 +/- 1.2 mg/kg for methohexital and 3.4 +/- 2.1 mg/kg for thiamylal. One out of the 176 procedures was failed due to bradycardia, hypotension and cyanosis, in the methohexital group. Otherwise, no significant adverse events were found. Increased heart rate (HR) during stable blood pressure (BP) was observed in both groups. In conclusion, under careful monitoring and performed by experienced practitioners, the application of methohexital or thiamylal combined with midazolam to achieve deep sedation for invasive procedures in young children with ALL is safe.","['0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)', '01T23W89FR (Thiamylal)', 'E5B8ND5IPE (Methohexital)', 'R60L0SM5BC (Midazolam)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors reviewed the outcome of 424 patients who were <or=21 years of age at the time of diagnosis of AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) between 1983 and 2002 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (n=288) or the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (n=136). Two treatment eras (1983-1989 and 1990-2002) were examined because of the greater intensity of treatment during the recent era. RESULTS: After controlling for the effects of cytogenetics, white blood cell (WBC) count, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, and treatment era, they observed that age and treatment era interacted significantly in relation to event-free survival (EFS) (P=.033). Patients 10 years of age or older were at greater risk of an adverse event than younger patients in the recent era (hazard ratio=1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.6; P=.005) but not in the early era. The rate of adverse events (death or recurrence) increased significantly with each year of age in the recent era (4.3%/year; 95% CI: 1.9-6.8%; P=.001) but not in the early era. The rate of death increased significantly with each year of age in both eras (4.4%/year; 95% CI: 2.3-6.5%; P<.001). EFS and survival showed no association with study site, and the effects of age were similar at the 2 sites. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that age is an independent prognostic factor in childhood AML and that children younger than 10 years benefit more than older children from newer intensive therapies.",,,,,['P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

It has been used as an alternative therapy in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) setting in patients who can't tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The Sulfone syndrome is not a well-known sequela of dapsone therapy and occurs at various doses, ranging from 50-300 mg/d. In all cases the syndrome occurs within 2 months of initiating therapy. Its clinical manifestations include: fever, methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, exfoliative dermatitis and transaminits. A 51-year old female underwent a matched unrelated hematopoiectic stem cell transplant for acute mylogenous leukemia. Dapsone therapy was initiated on day +28 at a dose of 100 mg/day for PCP prophylaxis secondary to the patient's history of a sulfonamide allergy. On day +59, one month after initiation of therapy she developed hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, fever and methemoglobinemia of 8%. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and subsequently developed an exfoliative dermatitis.

We enrolled 92 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in a prospective, multicenter study to investigate sequentially 2 treatment schedules with imatinib administered concurrent to or alternating with a uniform induction and consolidation regimen. Coadministration of imatinib and induction cycle 2 (INDII) resulted in a complete remission (CR) rate of 95% and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity for BCR-ABL in 52% of patients, compared with 19% in patients in the alternating treatment cohort (P = .01). Remarkably, patients with and without a CR after induction cycle 1 (INDI) had similar hematologic and molecular responses after concurrent imatinib and INDII. In the concurrent cohort, grades III and IV cytopenias and transient hepatotoxicity necessitated interruption of induction in 87% and 53% of patients, respectively; however, duration of induction was not prolonged when compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone. No imatinib-related severe hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities were noted with the alternating schedule.

HGS-ETR1 and HGS-ETR2 mAbs killed 15 and 9 human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs; n = 22), respectively. IL-6, the major survival and growth factor for these HMCLs, did not prevent their killing. Killing induced by either HGS-ETR1 or HGS-ETR2 was correlated with the cleavage of Mcl-1L, a major molecule for myeloma survival. Mcl-1L cleavage and anti-TRAILR HMCL killing were dependent on caspase activation. Kinetic studies showed that Mcl-1L cleavage occurred very early (less than 1 hour) and became drastic once caspase 3 was activated. Our data showed that both the extrinsic (caspase 8, Bid) and the intrinsic (caspase 9) pathways are activated by anti-TRAIL mAb. Finally, we showed that the HGS-ETR1 and, to a lesser extent, the HGS-ETR2 mAbs were able to induce the killing of primary myeloma cells. Of note, HGS-ETR1 mAb was able to induce the death of medullary and extramedullary myeloma cells collected from patients at relapse. Taken together, our data clearly encourage clinical trials of anti-TRAILR1 mAb in multiple myeloma, especially for patients whose disease is in relapse, at the time of drug resistance.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)']",,,20060425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These preparation-associated errors occur despite routine safety procedures. As of April 5, 2006, the clinical impact of these errors had not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To measure the occurrence and associated clinical outcomes of variations in intravenous methotrexate dosing. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed on 47 methotrexate infusions of 800 mg/m2 that were administered to 19 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Serum methotrexate concentrations were measured at the end of the infusions, which were administered over 24 hours. The total methotrexate dose was determined by direct measurement of the concentration and the volume of each infusion. RESULTS: Dosing errors greater than or equal to 10% occurred in 11 (23%) infusions and ranged from -61% to 55% of the ideal dose. Repeated measures regression analysis found the measured total methotrexate dose was not significantly associated with the serum methotrexate concentration (p = 0.58) or with clinical toxicities. The methotrexate dose administered over the last hours of infusion (p = 0.006) and the serum creatinine level at diagnosis (p = 0.05) were the most significant predictors of the methotrexate concentration. High methotrexate concentrations were significantly associated with increased hepatic aminotransferase levels; however, the degree of elevation was of limited clinical relevance. CONCLUSIONS: While unexpected errors in drug dosing are more common than is suggested by other methods, the clinical impact observed in this model of methotrexate infusion was not demonstrably greater than medication errors described by other methods. Subsequent studies in this model of dosing error will require larger sample sizes, and other drugs should be evaluated.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,20060425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is used for risk-adapted therapy and for the recognition of pending relapses. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), there is still a need for more suitable MRD markers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A stepwise approach which combined genome-wide expression profiling, TaqMan low density arrays, and a TaqMan real-time PCR-based screening was used to identify new markers for the monitoring of MRD in AML. Leukemic cells from 52 children with AML and 145 follow-up samples from 25 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven genes were identified which are vastly overexpressed in many patients with AML compared with healthy bone marrow: CCL23, GAGED2, MSLN, SPAG6, and ST18 as well as the previously described markers WT1 and PRAME. The expression of all genes decreased to normal levels in patients who achieved a continuous complete remission. Elevated levels of at least one gene were found prior to relapse in 7 out of 10 patients who relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: This set of genes should allow a sensitive and specific monitoring of MRD in AML. Notably, some of these markers could also serve as therapeutic targets or might be involved in leukemogenesis. MSLN is already used as a target for immunotherapy in clinical trials in other malignancies.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL23 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (MSLN protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SPAG6 protein, human)', '0 (ST18 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (XAGE1A protein, human)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially only identified at the cDNA level it had been tentatively linked to acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) due to its high and regulated expression in APL-derived cells. Here we identify unique properties of the annexin A8 protein. We show that it binds Ca2+-dependently and with high specificity to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and is also capable of interacting with F-actin. In line with these characteristics annexin A8 is recruited to F-actin-associated PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich membrane domains formed in HeLa cells upon infection with non-invading enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. These properties suggest a role of annexin A8 in the organization of certain actin-associated membrane domains.","['0 (Actins)', '0 (Annexins)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,20060407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BM-derived DCs were generated from bone marrow of 615 mice by culturing for 9 - 10 days in culture medium supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4. Irradiated L615 tumor cells were fused with DC by using PEG to form fused cell vaccine, with which 615 mice were immunized. After immunization, the specific proliferation ability and cytotoxicity against L615 leukemia cells in vitro were examined by MTT and LDH methods. Anti-leukemia effect of fused cell vaccine in vivo was studied by observing the immunotherapy effects on L615 tumor-bearing mice. The results showed that fully mature and functional bone marrow-derived DC were obtained. L615/DC fused cell vaccine could elicit potent specific proliferation response of spleen T cells from immunized mice when contacting with the same antigen at the second time, and could also elicit the effective cytotoxic activity against L615 leukemia cells in vitro, which were significantly different from other groups. In vivo the average survival time of the tumor-bearing mice received immunotherapy with L615/DC fused cell vaccine was 25.7 +/- 1 days, and one fourth of treated tumor-bearing mice survived for long time, but the mice of control group died all, their average of survival time was 17.5 +/- 1 days. The immunized mice survived with no evidence of recurrence when exposed to the second attack of lethal dose of living L615 cells 2 months later. It is concluded that L615/DC fused cell vaccine can improve the immunogenecity of L615 and induce effectively the specific anti-leukemia immunity against L615 leukemia cells to eliminate the residual leukemia cells, prolong the survival time and induce the immune memory to avoid the relapse. Thus, the fused cell vaccine may be an attractive strategy for malignance immunotherapy.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, some scholars found that survivin expression is associated with the resistance in chemotherapy. To explore the relationship between survivin and drug-resistance, the alteration of survivin mRNA and protein of HL-60 cells treated with daunomycin (DNR), mitoxantrone (MIT) and arsenic trioxide (As2O3) was investigated, the expressions of survivin mRNA and survivin protein were detected on the first and third day by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The results showed that survivin mRNA levels all decreased after the first day of treatment with drugs. It was decreased by 10% in DNR group, 40% (P < 0.01) in MIT group, and 25% (P < 0.01) in As2O3 group in comparison with control cells. In the third day, the survivin mRNA treated with DNR was up-regulated by 20% (P < 0.05), compared with the first day, and MIT was up-regulated by 65% (P < 0.01), but As2O3 was still down-regulated by 32% (P < 0.01). In Western blot, survivin protein level increased 14% after treated with DNR for three days, compared with the control cells, and 11% in MIT, but decreased by 82% in As2O3. It is concluded that after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, the survivin level descended at first day and then ascended obviously. This phenomenon may be associated with the resistance in chemotherapy for leukemia. On the other hand, As2O3 shows a different mechanism that may play a significant role to reverse resistance.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to investigate the expression of cyclin E2 and survivin gene in bone marrow cells from patients with acute leukemia and their relationship. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used for detection of the expression of cyclin E2 and survivin mRNA in 84 adult patients with acute leukemia which included 16 cases of relapse, 60 cases of de novo acute leukemia, 8 cases of continuously complete remission, and 20 normal persons as controls. The results showed that (1) positive expression of cyclin E2 (70.24%) in acute leukemia patients was significantly higher than that (0%) in controls, positive expression of survivin (72.62%) in acute leukemia patients was higher than that (30%) in control. (2) the expression of cyclin E2 positively correlated with that of survivin in acute leukemia patients. (3) remission rate in cyclin E2-positive patients (55.81%) was lower than that (88.24%) in cyclin E2-negative patients, the rate of cyclin E2 expression in relapse group was the highest among the three groups; while that in continuously complete remission group was the lowest among the three groups. (4) positive rate of cyclin E2 expression (59.32%) in patients with acute myelocytic leukemia was lower than that (96%) in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, no correlation between cyclin E2 expression and white blood cell counts of patients was found.

The conditioning regimen included FBC (fludarabine, busulphan, cyclophosphamide) +/- Ara-C. Peripheral blood was collected before and after transplantation in different periods. Semi-quantitative assessment of hematopoietic chimerism was performed by short tandem repeat-polymerase chain reaction (STR-PCR), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and silver staining, and analyzed by Image Analysis System. The results showed that on day 30 after transplantation, one patient failed to engraft, but 22 cases formed complete chimerism (CC) and 5 cases were of mixed chimerism. On day 7 after transplantation, the average percentage of donor cells was 74.71%. The time of dominance of the donor-specific allelic pattern preceded the recovery time of neutrophils and platelets. The incidence of aGVHD in group CC was significantly higher than that in group MC (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of cGVHD and disease relapse between group CC and group MC (P > 0.05). One patient relapsed in CC status without a transitional stage of MC. One patient with MC rejected grafts in early stage. 3 patients with MC transferred to CC and got complete remission after early implementation of therapy. It is concluded that sequential and quantitative detection of chimerism may be of great value to evaluate engraftment and to predict graft rejection, disease relapse and GVHD. Furthermore, it may provide a basis for early intervention treatment in the related complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other 20 adults were selected as normal controls (NC), K562 and Kg-1alpha cell lines were employed as positive control. The results showed that the expressions of c-IAP2 and Smac in de novo AL patients were higher than those in NC, while they decreased in patients at complete remission (CR).

Conceptual frameworks are needed to support new treatment designs based on such models. METHODS: A modern control perspective is used to formulate two therapeutic gain strategies. RESULTS: Two conceptually distinct therapeutic gain strategies are provided. The first is direct in that its goal is to kill cancer cells more so than normal cells, the second is indirect in that its goal is to achieve implicit therapeutic gains by transferring states of cancer cells of non-curable cases to a target state defined by the cancer cells of curable cases. The direct strategy requires models that connect anti-cancer agents to an endpoint that is modulated by the cause of the cancer and that correlates with cell death. It is an abstraction of a strategy for treating mismatch repair (MMR) deficient cancers with iodinated uridine (IUdR); IU-DNA correlates with radiation induced cell killing and MMR modulates the relationship between IUdR and IU-DNA because loss of MMR decreases the removal of IU from the DNA. The second strategy is indirect. It assumes that non-curable patient outcomes will improve if the states of their malignant cells are first transferred toward a state that is similar to that of a curable patient. This strategy is difficult to employ because it requires a model that relates drugs to determinants of differences in patient survival times. It is an abstraction of a strategy for treating BCR-ABL pro-B cell childhood leukemia patients using curable cases as the guides. CONCLUSION: Cancer therapeutic gain problem formulations define the purpose, and thus the scope, of cancer process modeling. Their abstractions facilitate considerations of alternative treatment strategies and support syntheses of learning experiences across different cancers.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",,,20060425,"['U56 CA112963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K25 CA104791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA112963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1484487,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand these biological processes on surfaces, there is a widespread interest in tailored surface-active materials produced by a combination of surface chemistry coupled to advanced patterning processes. We utilize self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as molecular templates with submicrometer-scale spatial resolution to engage and cluster IgE receptors on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. Bioactive templates consisted of gold arrays on silicon with patterns from 1 mum down to 45 nm. These gold arrays served as molecular tethering sites, enabling covalent binding of functionalized self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols. The free ends of the monolayers were functionalized with 2,4-dinitrophenyl(DNP)-caproate-based ligands which interact specifically with anti-DNP IgE bound to its high affinity cell surface receptor, FcepsilonRI on RBL mast cells. Present results on structures 1 mum down to 600 nm in size indicate that these ligand-immobilized patterned arrays can function as a powerful tool for visualization and systematic characterization of cell membrane involvement in IgE receptor-mediated immune cell signaling.",,,,,['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This category consists of four subclasses, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical CML(aCML), juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia and MDS/MPD-unclassifiable (MDS/MPD-u). In order to clarify the clinical features of these diseases, we analyzed clinical data of tentatively diagnosed MDS/MPD cases in the past ten years accumulated from affiliated hospitals. By reviewing the data of each case according to the criteria, we diagnosed 31 cases of MDS/MPD, including 22 cases of CMML, 5 cases of aCML and 4 cases of MDS/MPD-u. Male predominance and high age were common among these three subclasses. The prognosis of CMML was poor compared to other subclasses because of the high incidence of blast crisis. It is noteworthy that blast crisis in CMML exclusively occurred within one year after diagnosis. Young age, a high percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and clonal cytogenetic abnormality were associated with blast crisis. It is suggested that there are two subgroups in CMML which differ in disease progression. Thus, these indicators may be useful in deciding the therapeutic strategy including hematopoietic cell transplantation for the high risk subgroup. There were four MDS/MPD cases with a history of preceding hematological diseases, such as aplastic anemia, MDS or malignant lymphoma. Among these, three cases with a long-term history of treatment with metenolone acetate developed CMML. It is suggested that the long-term effect of androgen plays a role in the pathophysiology of CMML.","['0 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human STC-1 expression is enhanced by neural cell differentiation, bone formation, and cell proliferation. Recently, quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed high levels of STC-1 mRNA in the blood of patients with cancer as compared with those in the blood of volunteers without cancer. The STC-1 mRNA expression in blood is closely related to tumor size in breast cancer, micrometastases of hepatocellular carcinoma, and minimal residual disease in leukemia.

DU145 cells show androgen-independent growth and lack PLZF gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed PLZF-regulating genes by DNA microarray using DU145 cells infected with LacZ- or PLZF-carrying adenoviruses. RESULTS: DNA microarray revealed that Pbx1 is a prominent suppressed gene in PLZF-overexpressing DU145 cells. Androgen receptor (AR)-expressing DU145 cells recovered androgen-dependent PLZF expression and subsequent repression of Pbx1 expression. Immunoprecipitation of Pbx1 in DU145 cells revealed a Pbx1-HoxC8 heterocomplex. siRNAs for Pbx1 and HoxC8 knocked downexpression of each, and this suppressed androgen-independent cell growth. Double knockdown of both Pbx1 and HoxC8 suppressed cell growth much more significantly.

Epub 2006 Apr 21.,"B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL-10) is expressed in the cytoplasm of normal germinal center and marginal zone B-cells and is involved in lymphocyte development and activation. Aberrant nuclear expression of BCL-10 occurs in a subset of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MALT lymphomas), primarily those with the t(1;14)(p22;q32) or t(11;18)(q21;q21). Little is known about BCL-10 expression in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM). We assessed for BCL-10 in 51 bone marrow (BM) specimens involved by LPL/WM using immunohistochemical methods. All patients had monoclonal IgM in serum. Extent of BM involvement was assessed using PAX-5/BSAP and CD20 immunostains and the pattern and percentage of B-cells positive for BCL-10 was determined. The p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), a molecule downstream of BCL-10, was also assessed immunohistochemically. Nuclear BCL-10 staining was present in 28/51 (55%) specimens. BCL-10 expression correlated with greater extent of BM involvement (P=0.001), but did not correlate with serum IgM paraprotein levels, type of immunoglobulin light chain, or clinical variables. Nuclear expression of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB was detected in 17/50 (34%) specimens, suggesting that NF-kappaB is active in a subset of LPL/WM. p65 NF-kappaB activation did not correlate with nuclear BCL-10 immunostaining.

Epub 2006 Apr 24.,"Perpetual V(D)J recombinase activity involving multiple DNA double-strand break events in B-cell lineage leukemia and lymphoma cells may introduce secondary genetic aberrations leading towards malignant progression. Here, we investigated defective negative feedback signaling through the (pre-) B-cell receptor as a possible reason for deregulated V(D)J recombinase activity in B-cell malignancy. On studying 28 cases of pre-B-lymphoblastic leukemia and 27 B-cell lymphomas, expression of the (pre-) B-cell receptor-related linker molecule SLP65 (SH2 domain-containing lymphocyte protein of 65 kDa) was found to be defective in seven and five cases, respectively. SLP65 deficiency correlates with RAG1/2 expression and unremitting V(H) gene rearrangement activity. Reconstitution of SLP65 expression in SLP65-deficient leukemia and lymphoma cells results in downregulation of RAG1/2 expression and prevents both de novo V(H)-DJ(H) rearrangements and secondary V(H) replacement. We conclude that iterative V(H) gene rearrangement represents a frequent feature in B-lymphoid malignancy, which can be attributed to SLP65 deficiency in many cases.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",,,20060424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined whether low molecular weight-dual specificity phosphatase two (LMW-DSP2) is involved in the regulation of the interleukin 6 (IL-6)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/STAT3-mediated signaling pathway. IL-6/LIF-induced LMW-DSP2 expression in murine testicular or hepatoma cell lines, while LMW-DSP2 overexpression in 293T cells suppressed IL-6-induced phosphorylation and activation of STAT3. Furthermore, LMW-DSP2 suppressed the expression of IL-6-induced endogenous genes. In contrast, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of LMW-DSP2 expression enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. In fact, LMW-DSP2 interacted with STAT3 in vivo and endogenous LMW-DSP2 bound to STAT3 in murine testicular GC-1 cells. These results strongly suggest that LMW-DSP2 acts as a negative regulator of the IL-6/LIF/STAT3-mediated signaling pathway.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dusp22 protein, mouse)']",,,20060424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report, herein, that exposure of human erythroleukemic HEL cells to the anti-CD44 mAb A3D8 resulted in cell growth inhibition followed by caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death. This process was associated with the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m), the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), but not of cytochrome c, and the nuclear translocation of AIF. All these effects including cell death, loss of mitochondrial Delta Psi m and AIF release were blocked by pretreatment with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor isoquinoline. A significant protection against cell death was also observed by using small interfering RNA for AIF. Moreover, we show that calpain protease was activated before the appearance of apoptosis, and that calpain inhibitors or transfection of calpain-siRNA decrease A3D8-induced cell death, and block AIF release. These data suggest that CD44 ligation triggers a novel caspase-independent cell death pathway via calpain-dependent AIF release in erythroleukemic HEL cells.","['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'JGX76Y85M6 (isoquinoline)']",,,20060424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phase I/II study evaluated the addition of weekly oxaliplatin to preoperative continuous infusion fluorouracil (FU) and external-beam radiation therapy (RT) in patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinical T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma and no evidence of metastases were treated with weekly oxaliplatin, continuous infusion FU 200 mg/m2 intravenously, and RT. A total of 6 weekly doses of oxaliplatin were planned. RT dose was 1.8 Gy/fraction to a total dose of 50.4 Gy. In the phase I portion, oxaliplatin was escalated from 30 to 60 mg/m2. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were entered onto the study, 18 on the phase I portion and 26 on the phase II portion. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for oxaliplatin was determined to be 60 mg/m2. At the MTD, 12 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, two patients experienced grade 3 neutropenia, and one patient experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Fifty-six percent of patients entered at the MTD completed all 6 weeks of oxaliplatin. Eight (25%) of 32 patients enrolled at the phase II dose experienced a pathologic complete response. CONCLUSION: In this multicenter study, the addition of oxaliplatin to intravenous continuous infusion FU and RT for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer was associated with a high pathologic complete response rate but more toxicity than when FU is used alone. A regimen of weekly oxaliplatin, continuous infusion FU, and radiation therapy is now being evaluated by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project.","['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,20060424,"['CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 10;25(5):602-3; author reply 603.

Epub 2006 Apr 24.,"Retinoic acid (RA) induces growth arrest, cell death, and differentiation in many human cancer cells in vitro and has entered routine clinical use for the treatment of several human cancer types. One mechanism by which cancer cells evade retinoid-induced effects is through repression of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) gene transcription. The RA response element beta (betaRARE) is the essential DNA sequence required for retinoid-induced RARbeta transcription. Here we show that the estrogen-responsive B box protein (EBBP), a member of the RING-B box-coiled-coil protein family, is a betaRARE-binding protein. EBBP undergoes serine threonine phosphorylation and enhanced protein stability after RA treatment. Following RA treatment, we also observed increased nuclear EBBP levels in aggregates with the promyelocytic leukemia protein at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. EBBP enhanced RA-responsive RARbeta transcription in RA-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells, which were resistant to both a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a demethylating agent. EBBP-specific small interfering RNA reduced basal and RA-induced RARbeta expression. EBBP increased betaRARE-transactivating function through its coiled-coil domain. Taken together, our work suggests that EBBP may have a pivotal role in the retinoid anti-cancer signal.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,20060424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of acute dopaminergic blockade with intravenous metoclopramide on serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations was evaluated. Twenty volunteers, 20 to 52 years of age, seronegative for both hepatitis C virus and the human immunodeficiency virus, were studied: (1) 10 clinically healthy men (group 1), and (2) 9 patients with leukemia, and 1 patient with refractory aplastic anemia who underwent allo-HSCT, 5 of whom (3 men and 2 women) developed chronic GVHD (group 2), and 5 (3 men and 2 women) who did not develop chronic GVHD (group 3). Serum PRL concentrations were measured both fasting and after intravenous administration of metoclopramide (10-mg bolus). The area under the PRL curve was calculated. Patients in group 2 were older than those in groups 1 and 3 (P<.018), but their body mass index was similar. Fasting serum PRL concentrations were similar among the 3 groups; however, group 2 had higher PRL concentrations throughout the test (P<.001) and a greater area under the PRL curve than groups 1 and 3 (P<.001), without differences between the last 2 groups. The differences remained significant after adjustment for age (P<.01). Our results in a small group of patients with chronic GVHD after allo-HSCT suggest the existence of an increased functional level of their hypothalamic dopamine tone, which would favor a tendency toward a diminished endogenous production, release of pituitary PRL, or both. This could represent an adaptive mechanism aiming to maintain circulating PRL concentrations within a physiological range.","['0 (Dopamine Antagonists)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', 'L4YEB44I46 (Metoclopramide)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median follow-up for surviving patients is 5.7 years. At last follow-up, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was scored in 60% of non-ATG and in 37% of ATG patients (P=.05), and extensive chronic GVHD was present in 41% and 15%, respectively (P=.01). Chronic lung dysfunction was diagnosed in 51% versus 19% of patients (P=.005). Forced vital capacity decreased significantly with time in non-ATG patients (P=.005), but not in patients who received ATG (P=.30). The proportion of patients with Karnofsky scores of >or=90% at 4 years was 57% versus 89% in non-ATG versus ATG patients (P=.03). The actuarial 6-year survival for all patients randomized was 31% versus 44% (non-ATG versus ATG; P=.80). The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality was 51% versus 41% (P=.70) and of relapse was 32% versus 40% (P=.90). For patients who survived 1 year, transplant-related mortality was 25% versus 3% (P=.03), and actuarial survival was 58% versus 85% (P=.09).

Three carbazole alkaloids, mahanine (6), pyrayafoline-D (7) and murrafoline-I (9), showed significant cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells. Fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 staining revealed that the percentage of apoptotic cells with fragmented nuclei and condensed chromatin was increased in a time-dependent manner after treatment with each alkaloid. Interestingly, each carbazole alkaloid induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, both caspase-9 and caspase-3 were also time-dependently activated upon treatment with the alkaloids. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibitors suppressed apoptosis induced by these alkaloids. The results suggest that these three alkaloids induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells through activation of the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway, through mitochondrial dysfunction.","['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,20050915,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Mar 22.,"Tiron, 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid, has been known to be a widely used antioxidant to rescue ROS-evoked cell death and a non-toxic chelator to alleviate an acute metal overload. In this study, we showed that Tiron is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and apoptotic cell death in human promyelotic HL-60 leukemia cell. At a low level of concentration (<0.5mM), Tiron caused HL-60 cells to induce differentiation-related alterations such as the increase of CD11b and CD14 expression or chromatin condensation. Hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was also increased at mRNA and protein level, and thus the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, which is a downstream target of HIF-1alpha and acts as a critical factor for granulocytic differentiation was increased. High dose of Tiron (>0.5mM) induced severe DNA damage in HL-60 cells, as measured by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test and the comet assay. Consequently, high dose of Tiron led to apoptotic cell death, which showed the DNA fragmentation, the caspase activation and the unbalance between antiapoptotic (Bcl-2) and proapoptotic proteins (Bax). However, an exogenous supplement of iron (FeCl(3)) reversed all of these effects, the cell differentiation and the apoptotic cell death. Therefore, these results suggest that Tiron-mediated differentiation and cell death result from the disturbance of iron metabolism.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '4X87R5T106 (1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-Disulfonic Acid Disodium Salt)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U38V3ZVV3V (ferric chloride)']",,,20060322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently demonstrated that phosphorylation of the p6(gag) protein containing the L-domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 regulates viral assembly and budding. Here, we investigated whether or not the L-domain-containing protein from another human retrovirus, namely the matrix protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, that contains the canonical PTAP and PPPY L-domain motifs, shares similar functional properties. We found that MA is phosphorylated at several sites. We identified one phosphorylated amino acid in the HTLV-1 MA protein as being S105, located in the close vicinity to the L-domain sequence. S105 phosphorylation was found to be mediated by the cellular kinase ERK-2 that is incorporated within HTLV-1 virus particles in an active form. Mutation of the ERK-2 target S105 residue into an alanine was found to decrease viral release and budding efficiency of the HTLV-1(ACH) molecular clone from transfected cells.

However, transcription-dependent pathways have not been well described. The present study examined whether activation of HL-60-derived neutrophils by C5a modulates the transcription of two members of the Bcl2 family, Bax (pro-apoptotic) and Bcl2 (anti-apoptotic) molecules, and whether the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor mediates these effects through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cell line was differentiated into neutrophils using 1.25% DMSO. Differentiated cells were incubated with recombinant human C5a for 30-120 min with, or without, pretreatment with wortmannin or PD98059. The cells were lysed and quantified for gene-specific Bax and Bcl2 mRNA. In separate experiments, cells were incubated with C5a for 5-30 min with, or without, pretreatment with wortmannin, PD98059, or alkaline phosphatase. Cells were then lysed and immunoblotted using antihuman phospho-CREB (Ser133) antibody. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring active caspase-3 in differentiated HL-60 cells. RESULTS: C5a inhibited caspase-3 activation in HL-60-derived neutrophils (P=0.003). C5a significantly increased the expression of Bcl2 mRNA (P=0.028), which was time-dependent, peaking at 30 min, and was abrogated in the presence of either wortmannin or PD98059 (both P=0.028). The C5a had no impact on Bax mRNA expression. The Bax : Bcl2 mRNA ratio markedly decreased at 30 min (P=0.028). Time-dependent effect of C5a on CREB phosphorylation was demonstrable and rapid, peaking at 5 min, and was abrogated by either wortmannin or PD98059 (both P=0.028). Phosphorylation of CREB, but not of Akt and ERK, was inhibited by alkaline phosphatase (P=0.028). The effect of C5a on Bcl2 mRNA expression was abrogated by alkaline phosphatase (P=0.028). The Bax : Bcl2 mRNA ratio markedly increased in the presence of alkaline phosphatase (P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that C5a induces Bcl2 mRNA transcription in HL-60-derived neutrophils, which is mediated in part by CREB through the convergence of the PI3K/Akt and ERK-signalling pathways.","['0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,"['DK065102/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK61900/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the excessive growth of RA-SFL cells and to seek a novel molecular-targeting therapy for RA, we examined the expression of adapter proteins and the effect of the specific inhibition of PDGF receptor activation by imatinib mesylate. Cultured SFL cells were used in the present study after 2-5 passages. The anchorage-dependent and -independent growth patterns of the SFL cells were evaluated using a tetrazolium-based assay and colony formation in 0.3% agar, respectively. Adapter proteins Gab1 and Gab2 were expressed in RA-SFL cells, and both proteins were rapidly (< 1 min) tyrosine-phosphorylated after the stimulation of RA-SFL cells with 10 ng/ml of PDGF and, to a lesser extent, after stimulation with 100 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF). The inhibition of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activation by 1 microM or less of imatinib mesylate specifically suppressed the PDGF-dependent, but not EGF-dependent, tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins. Moreover, imatinib mesylate abolished both the anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation of RA-SFL cells induced by PDGF stimulation. These results suggest that Gab adapter proteins are expressed and likely to be involved in the growth signalling of rheumatoid synovial cells and that imatinib mesylate, a key drug in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, may also be effective for the treatment of RA.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (GAB1 protein, human)', '0 (GAB2 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",,,,,PMC1809657,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Light and electron microscopic methods and cell separation techniques were applied. RESULTS: Immunoperoxidase and immunogold labelling showed subcapsular and subseptal overexpression of NGF by epithelial cells in leukemic thymus. NGF immunopositive epithelial cells were closely associated with lymphoid cells. The increased immunoreactivity of epithelial cells correlated with LEC complex formation, including thymic nurse cell-like structures and rosettes in the external cortex. CONCLUSION: These results provide new structural and immunocytochemical evidence for intimate contact between NGF-producing epithelial cells and lymphoid cells and suggest that NGF immunoreactive LEC complexes are involved in thymic microenvironmental reorganization during leukemogenesis.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stages of the disease at diagnosis, presenting clinical features and laboratory parameters, as well as the drug history were noted for each patient. Survival of each patient was computed from the date of diagnosis until the date of death. Kaplan-Meier statistical technique was used for analysis of survival. Factors were compared with log rank test. Student's t-test was used for comparing means of presenting clinical and laboratory parameters between groups. P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. SPSS for windows Release 10 (Real Stats, Real Easy, 1989-1999) was used for all calculations.

Philadelphia chromosome was positive in the five patients (12.0%) that underwent cytogenetic analysis. Thirty-three of the patients (78.6%) presented in treatable chronic phase and the other 9 (21.4%) were seen in advanced stages (7 in accelerated & 2 in blastic phase). The median survival of patients that presented in chronic phase was 31.7 months compared to 0.16 months in patients presenting in advanced stages, the difference was statistically significant (log rank=7.8, p-value=0.005). Significant positive correlation was obtained between spleen size and total white cell count at diagnosis (r=0.36, p=0.02). Univariate regression analysis showed negative relationship between survival and ages of patients at diagnosis, haematocrit value, spleen and liver sizes, and blast count. The relationships were statistically significant for only liver and spleen (b=-0.63, p=0.004 and b=-0.51, p=0.026, respectively).

Few prospective, randomized trials have analyzed large enough numbers of patients to allow us to determine the appropriate patient population for autologous transplantation. Although variability in the available studies makes it difficult to draw a definite conclusion, and many issues remain unresolved, available data suggests that there may be a group of patients for whom ASCT in first remission is a reasonable and perhaps superior treatment choice. Factors such as risk features at diagnosis, and minimal residual disease following induction therapy greatly affect outcome following ASCT. The available data as well as the questions that remain to be answered will be discussed and reviewed.",,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 23.,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must achieve a balance between quiescence and activation that fulfils immediate demands for haematopoiesis without compromising long-term stem cell maintenance, yet little is known about the molecular events governing this balance. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) functions as a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-Akt pathway, which has crucial roles in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration. Here we show that inactivation of PTEN in bone marrow HSCs causes their short-term expansion, but long-term decline, primarily owing to an enhanced level of HSC activation. PTEN-deficient HSCs engraft normally in recipient mice, but have an impaired ability to sustain haematopoietic reconstitution, reflecting the dysregulation of their cell cycle and decreased retention in the bone marrow niche. Mice with PTEN-mutant bone marrow also have an increased representation of myeloid and T-lymphoid lineages and develop myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). Notably, the cell populations that expand in PTEN mutants match those that become dominant in the acute myeloid/lymphoid leukaemia that develops in the later stages of MPD. Thus, PTEN has essential roles in restricting the activation of HSCs, in lineage fate determination, and in the prevention of leukaemogenesis.","['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",,,20060423,,,,,,['Nature. 2006 May 25;441(7092):418-9.

Combination treatment with pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha plus ribavirin has been shown to be most effective in treating patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Despite its efficacy, one of the most common side effects of this regimen is depression. Whereas IFN-alpha has been found to induce depression in chronic myelogenous leukemia, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, CHC patients may be especially prone to develop IFN-induced depression. This review includes a summary of differences between IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and addresses whether pegylation of IFN (versus nonpegylated IFN) gives rise to a treatment with reduced potential to induce depressive symptoms. Consideration is also given to evidence showing that treatment with ribavirin may contribute to IFN-induced depression. Thyroid disorders and anemia (as well as other medical conditions) have also been associated with IFN exposure and may account for some incidences of depression in CHC patients. Evidence is reviewed indicating that prior psychiatric and mood disorders (especially previous episodes of major depressive disorder), just prior to IFN treatment, contribute to the propensity to develop depression during treatment. In addition, a brief description is provided of potential biological mechanisms of IFN-induced depression (ie, monoamines, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical [HPA] axis, proinflammatory cytokines, peptidases, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and nitric oxide). Finally, a discussion is provided on the use of antidepressants as a preventative versus restorative treatment, including a commentary on risks of using antidepressants in this patient population.","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '41VRH5220H (Paroxetine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'G8RGG88B68 (peginterferon alfa-2b)', 'Q46947FE7K (peginterferon alfa-2a)']",138,,,,,,,,['J Clin Gastroenterol. 2007 Apr;41(4):433-4.

Viral maturation is accompanied by dramatic morphological changes, which are poorly understood in physical/mechanistic terms. Here, we study the mechanical properties of live mature and immature murine leukemia virus particles by indentation-type experiments conducted with an atomic force microscope tip. We find that both mature and immature particles have an elastic shell. Strikingly, the virus shell is twofold stiffer in the immature (0.68 N/m) than the mature (0.31 N/m) form. However, finite-element simulation shows that the average Young's modulus of the immature form is more than fourfold lower than that of the mature form. This finding suggests that per length unit, the protein-protein interactions in the mature shell are stronger than those in the immature shell. We also show that the mature virus shell is brittle, since it can be broken by application of large loading forces, by firm attachment to a substrate, or by repeated application of force.

In our previous study, we developed a new filtering method, namely, the projective adaptive resonance theory (PART) filtering method. This method was effective in subclass discrimination. In the PART algorithm, the genes with a low variance in gene expression in either class, not both classes, were selected as important genes for modeling. Based on this concept, we developed novel simple filtering methods such as modified signal-to-noise (S2N') in the present study. The discrimination model constructed using these methods showed higher accuracy with higher reproducibility as compared with many conventional filtering methods, including the t-test, S2N, NSC and SAM. The reproducibility of prediction was evaluated based on the correlation between the sets of U-test p-values on randomly divided datasets. With respect to leukemia, lymphoma and breast cancer, the correlation was high; a difference of >0.13 was obtained by the constructed model by using <50 genes selected by S2N'. Improvement was higher in the smaller genes and such higher correlation was observed when t-test, NSC and SAM were used. These results suggest that these modified methods, such as S2N', have high potential to function as new methods for marker gene selection in cancer diagnosis using DNA microarray data.

Epub 2006 Apr 21.,"Hematopoietic stem cells in myeloproliferative diseases mostly retain the potential to differentiate but are characterized by hyper-responsiveness to growth factors, as well as partial factor-independent growth. The V617F activating point mutation in Jak2 has recently been associated with myeloproliferative disorders. Using various cell line models, mechanisms that contribute to Jak2V617-mediated signaling were investigated. Treatment of the Jak2V617F mutant-expressing erythroid leukemia cell line HEL with a small molecule Jak2 inhibitor was associated with a dose-dependent G(1) cell cycle arrest. This inhibition correlated with decreased expression of cyclin D2 and increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip). Inhibition of Jak2V617F with a Jak2-targeted small interfering RNA approach resulted in a similar phenotype. Mechanisms leading to altered p27(Kip) and cyclin D2 likely involve inhibition of STAT5, a major target of Jak2 in hematopoietic cells, because a constitutively active form of STAT5 reduced p27(Kip) and increased cyclin D2 expression. Jak2V617F and constitutively active STAT5 also induced high levels of reactive oxygen species, which are sufficient to promote G(1)/S phase transition. In contrast, treatment of HEL cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine decreased cell growth or expression of cyclin D2 and increased expression of p27(Kip). Similar results were obtained in BaF3 cells transfected with Jak2V617F, but these cells required coexpression of the erythropoietin receptor for optimal signaling. These results suggest that regulation of cyclin D2 and p27(Kip) in combination with redox-dependent processes promotes G(1)/S phase transition downstream of Jak2V617F/STAT5 and therefore hint at potential novel targets for drug development that may aid traditional therapy.","['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,20060421,['DK 66996/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Jan 19.,"As a reducing agent, ascorbate serves as an antioxidant. However, its reducing function can in some settings initiate an oxidation cascade, i.e., seem to be a ""pro-oxidant."" This dichotomy also seems to hold when ascorbate is present during photosensitization. Ascorbate can react with singlet oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide. Thus, if ascorbate is present during photosensitization the formation of highly diffusible hydrogen peroxide could enhance the toxicity of the photodynamic action. On the other hand, ascorbate could decrease toxicity by converting highly reactive singlet oxygen to less reactive hydrogen peroxide, which can be removed via peroxide-removing systems such as glutathione and catalase. To test the influence of ascorbate on photodynamic treatment we incubated leukemia cells (HL-60 and U937) with ascorbate and a photosensitizer (Verteporfin; VP) and examined ascorbic acid monoanion uptake, levels of glutathione, changes in membrane permeability, cell growth, and toxicity. Accumulation of VP was similar in each cell line. Under our experimental conditions, HL-60 cells were found to accumulate less ascorbate and have lower levels of intracellular GSH compared to U937 cells. Without added ascorbate, HL-60 cells were more sensitive to VP and light treatment than U937 cells. When cells were exposed to VP and light, ascorbate acted as an antioxidant in U937 cells, whereas it was a pro-oxidant for HL-60 cells. One possible mechanism to explain these observations is that HL-60 cells express myeloperoxidase activity, whereas in U937 cells it is below the detection limit. Inhibition of myeloperoxidase activity with 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABAH) had minimal influence on the phototoxicity of VP in HL-60 cells in the absence of ascorbate. However, 4-ABAH decreased the toxicity of ascorbate on HL-60 cells during VP photosensitization, but had no affect on ascorbate toxicity in U937 cells. These data demonstrate that ascorbate increases hydrogen peroxide production by VP and light. This hydrogen peroxide activates myeloperoxidase, producing toxic oxidants.

We recently found that, upon activation of the cAMP pathway, expression of the gamma-globin gene is inhibited in K562 cells but induced in adult erythroblasts. Here we show that c-Myb, a proto-oncogene product that plays a role in cell growth and differentiation, is involved in the cAMP-mediated differential regulation of gamma-globin gene expression in K562 cells and primary erythroblasts. Our studies found that c-Myb is expressed at a high level in K562 cells compared to primary erythroblasts, and that c-Myb expression is further increased following the treatment with forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator. The induction of gamma-globin gene expression was also inhibited in K562 cells by raising the levels of c-Myb expression. Importantly, forskolin-induced erythroid differentiation in K562 cells, as determined by the expression of glycophorins and CD71, suggesting that high-level expression of c-Myb may not be sufficient to inhibit the differentiation of erythroid cells. In contrast, c-Myb was not expressed in adult erythroblasts treated with forskolin and primary erythroblasts may lack the c-Myb-mediated inhibitory mechanism for gamma-globin gene expression. Together, these results show that the cAMP pathway blocks gamma-globin gene expression in K562 cells by increasing c-Myb expression and c-Myb plays a role in defining the mode of response of the gamma-globin gene to fetal hemoglobin inducers in erythroid cells.","['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,20060417,"['R01DK61806/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL73452/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paramagnetic dinitrosyl nonheme iron complexes (DNIC) were found in tumor tissue about 40 years ago; however, the role of these NO(+)-bearing species is not completely understood. In the human Jurkat leukemia cell line, the application of the model complex DNIC-thiosulfate (50-200 microM) induced apoptosis (defined by phosphatidylserine externalization) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In Jurkat cells, the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVADfmk (50 microM), and/or stable transfection of antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, was unable to afford protection against DNIC-induced apoptosis. The membrane-impermeable metal chelator, N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD; 200 microM), in the presence of DNIC significantly increased apoptosis, but had no effect on its own. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies showed that MGD led to rapid transformation of the extracellular DNIC into the stable impermeable NO-Fe-MGD complex and to a burst-type release of nitrosonium (NO(+)) equivalents in the extracellular space. These results suggest that in Jurkat cells, DNIC-thiosulfate induces Bcl-2- and caspase-independent apoptosis, which is probably secondary to local nitrosative stress at the cell surface. We hypothesize that the local release of nonheme Fe-NO species by activated macrophages may play a role in the killing of malignant cells that have high Bcl-2 levels.","['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '68586-27-6 (dinitrosyl iron complex)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,20051227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed retrospective samples of DS children with acute myeloid leukemia, transient leukemia (TL), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to test whether the specificity of GATA1 mutations can be helpful in distinguishing these hematopoietic disorders. A total of 49 samples were subjected to GATA1 mutation screening by direct sequencing and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Mutations in exon 2 of GATA1 were detected in six of eight DS-AML M7 samples and in four of six DS-TL; no mutation was detected in 13 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DS-ALL), 6 with DS-AML (M0, M2, and M5), 6 with DS-MDS and in 8 DS infants without hematological disorders and 2 children with AML M7 without DS. Blast cells proportion in the sample represented a critical aspect on the sensitivity of mutation detection in GATA1, and a combination of sequence analysis and PAGE is necessary to detect mutations when blast percentage is low. The absence of detected mutations in any of the DS-MDS cases raises the question whether MDS in DS children is an intermediate stage between TL and AML M7, as previously suggested.",['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most large-animal studies have utilized peripheral blood or marrow-derived cells collected after administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-SCF) and stem cell factor (SCF); however, SCF is unavailable for clinical use in the United States and the European Union. A recent study in a competitive repopulation assay in the rhesus macaque showed very inefficient marking of G-CSF-mobilized (G/only) peripheral blood (G-PBSC) CD34(+) cells relative to G-CSF and SCF-mobilized cells using vectors with an amphotropic pseudotype. Because G-PBSC would be the preferred target cell population for most clinical stem cell gene therapy applications, we asked whether we could achieve efficient transduction and engraftment of G-PBSC using Phoenix-GALV-pseudotyped vectors. We transplanted three baboons with G/only mobilized CD34(+) cells transduced with GALV-pseudotyped retroviral vectors. We observed high-level, persistent engraftment of gene-modified G-PBSC in all animals with gene marking levels in granulocytes up to 60%. We analyzed amphotropic (PIT2) and GALV (PIT1) receptor expression in G/only cells and found preferential expression of PIT1 after G/only, which may explain the inferior results with amphotropic pseudotypes. These findings demonstrate that high stem cell gene transfer levels can be achieved using G-CSF-mobilized PBSC with Phoenix-GALV-pseudotyped vectors.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,20060421,"['DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that human fetal cortical cells grown in epidermal growth factor expressed low levels of telomerase and telomeres in these cultures shortened over time leading to growth arrest after 30 weeks. Following leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) supplementation, growth rates and telomerase expression increased. This was best demonstrated following cell cycle synchronization and staining for telomerase using immunocytochemistry. This increase in activity resulted in the maintenance of telomeres at approximately 7 kb for more than 60 weeks in vitro. However, all cultures displayed a lack of oligodendrotye production, decreases in neurogenesis over time and underwent replicative senescence associated with increased expression of p21 before 70 weeks in vitro. Thus, under our culture conditions, these cells are not stable, multipotent, telomerase expressing self-renewing stem cells. They may be more accurately described as human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) with limited lifespan and bi-potent potential (neurons/astrocytes). Interestingly, hNPC follow a course of proliferation, neuronal production and growth arrest similar to that seen during expansion and development of the human cortex, thus providing a possible model neural system. Furthermore, due to their high expansion potential and lack of tumorogenicity, these cells remain a unique and safe source of tissue for clinical transplantation.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,20060424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aimed to screen Guthrie cards (neonatal blood spots) of non-infant childhood AML and ALL patients for the presence of their respective leukemic markers. METHODS: We analysed Guthrie cards of 12 ALL patients aged 2-6 years using immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements (n = 15) and/or intronic breakpoints of TEL/AML1 fusion gene (n = 3). In AML patients (n = 13, age 1-14 years) PML/RARalpha (n = 4), CBFbeta/MYH11 (n = 3), AML1/ETO (n = 2), MLL/AF6 (n = 1), MLL/AF9 (n = 1) and MLL/AF10 (n = 1) fusion genes and/or internal tandem duplication of FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) (n = 2) were used as clonotypic markers. Assay sensitivity determined using serial dilutions of patient DNA into the DNA of a healthy donor allowed us to detect the pre-leukemic clone in Guthrie card providing 1-3 positive cells were present in the neonatal blood spot. RESULTS: In 3 patients with ALL (25%) we reproducibly detected their leukemic markers (Ig/TCR n = 2; TEL/AML1 n = 1) in the Guthrie card. We did not find patient-specific molecular markers in any patient with AML. CONCLUSION: In the largest cohort examined so far we used identical approach for the backtracking of non-infant childhood ALL and AML. Our data suggest that either the prenatal origin of AML is less frequent or the load of pre-leukemic cells is significantly lower at birth in AML compared to ALL cases.","['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MLL-AF10 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF6 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,20060421,,PMC1463004,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hybrid gene PML-RARalpha, present in 98% of cases, encodes a fusion protein essential to the pathogenesis of the disease. Depending of the PML's gene breakpoint in chromosome 15, the transcript subtypes bcr1, bcr2 and bcr3 may be formed. The correlation between these transcript subtypes and clinical parameters is still controversial. The objective of this study was to determine the frequencies of the PML-RARalpha transcripts and subtypes in a series of 32 APL patients from Northeast Brazil and to evaluate the association of these subtypes to different parameters. The method used was RT-PCR. The frequency of our APL cases is approximately 28% of the acute leukemias. The results showed the presence of PML-RARalpha isoform in all patients and a higher frequency of the bcr1/2 subtype. No significant statistical association was found between molecular subtypes and age, sex, French-American-British (FAB) classification, leukocyte and platelet count, hemoglobin level or coagulation tests.

As Pen a 1 from brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus is the only major allergen of shrimp and binds up to 75% of all shrimp-specific IgE antibodies this molecule may be an excellent model for the usage of allergens with reduced IgE antibody-binding capacity for specific immunotherapy. AIM: The aim was to clone, express and characterize a full-length recombinant Pen a 1 molecule and compare it with natural Pen a 1 in regard to structural and immunological parameters such as IgE antibody capacity and ability to induce IgE-mediated mediator release. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from P. aztecus and a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE) was performed to obtain full-length cDNA coding for Pen a 1. Using a gene-specific primer, PCR was performed and full-length cDNA was cloned and sequenced. Recombinant His-tagged Pen a 1 was isolated from Escherichia coli under native conditions by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Secondary structure of natural and recombinant Pen a 1 was compared by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and the IgE antibody-binding capacity evaluated by RAST. The allergenic potency was tested by the capability of natural and recombinant Pen a 1 to induce mediator release in a murine and human in vitro model of IgE-mediated type I allergy. RESULTS: The deduced amino-acid sequence was 284 residues long and amino-acid sequence identities with allergenic and non-allergenic tropomyosins ranged from 80% to 99% and 51% to 58%, respectively. The analysis of the secondary structure of natural and recombinant Pen a 1 by CD spectroscopic analysis showed that both nPen a 1 and rPen a 1 had alpha-helical conformation that is typical for tropomyosin. The IgE antibody binding capacities of nPen a 1 and r Pen a1 were found to be essentially identical by RAST. The mediator release experiments using both wild-type and humanized rat basophilic leukaemia 30/25 cells showed that rPen a 1 and nPen a 1 induced a similar level of mast cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant Pen a 1 and natural Pen a 1 are structurally and immunologically identical and rPen a 1 may be used as the basis for component-resolved diagnosis and the generation of modified shrimp tropomyosin for allergen-specific immunotherapy. The results of the animal studies indicate that C3H/HeJ mice that were sensitized with shrimp extract in combination with cholera toxin as adjuvant may be a suitable model to study shrimp allergy.","['0 (Allergens)', '0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (Pen a 1 allergen, Penaeus aztecus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tropomyosin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present paper we show that the Akt signaling pathway is constitutively activated in human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T-cell lines and in primary adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells. Curcumin, a natural compound present in turmeric, has been studied vigorously as a potent chemopreventive agent for cancer therapy because of its inhibitory effect on proliferation and induction of apoptosis in several tumor cell lines. We investigated the effect of curcumin on Akt activity in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. Phosphorylated PDK1 is an activator of Akt by phosphorylating Akt. Curcumin reduced phosphorylation of PDK1 and inhibited constitutive activation of Akt. Curcumin activated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta, a downstream target of Akt kinase, by inhibiting phosphorylation of this protein. Curcumin reduced the expression of cell cycle regulators, cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins, which are both degraded by activated GSK-3beta. Our results suggest that activation of the Akt signaling pathway plays an important role in ATL cell survival, and that curcumin may have anti-ATL properties mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting Akt activity. We propose that Akt-targeting agents could be useful for the treatment of ATL. In this regard, curcumin is a potentially promising compound for the treatment of ATL.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,,,,,,,['(Cancer Sci 2006; 97: 322 - 327).'],,,,,,['Nakamura Y.

All of the four WT1 isoforms are expressed in primary cancers and each is considered to have a different function. However, the functions of each of the WT1 isoforms in cancer cells remain unclear. The present study demonstrated that constitutive expression of the WT1 17AA(-)/KTS(-) isoform induces morphological changes characterized by a small-sized cell shape in TYK-nu.CP-r (TYK) ovarian cancer cells. In the WT1 17AA(-)/KTS(-) isoform-transduced TYK cells, cell-substratum adhesion was suppressed, and cell migration and in vitro invasion were enhanced compared to that in mock vector-transduced TYK cells. Constitutive expression of the WT1 17AA(-)/KTS(-) isoform also induced morphological changes in five (one gastric, one esophageal, two breast and one fibrosarcoma) of eight cancer cell lines examined. No WT1 isoforms other than the WT1 17AA(-)/KTS(-) isoform induced the phenotypic changes. A decrease in alpha-actinin 1 and cofilin expression and an increase in gelsolin expression were observed in WT1 17AA(-)/KTS(-) isoform-transduced TYK cells. In contrast, co-expression of alpha-actinin 1 and cofilin or knockdown of gelsolin expression by small interfering RNA restored WT1 17AA(-)/KTS(-) isoform-transduced TYK cells to a phenotype that was comparable to that of the parent TYK cells. These results indicated that the WT1 17AA(-)/KTS(-) isoform exerted its oncogenic functions through modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. The present results may provide a novel insight into the signaling pathway of the WT1 gene for its oncogenic functions.","['0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '11003-00-2 (Actinin)']",,,,,,,,,,['(Cancer Sci 2006; 97: 259-270).'],,,,,,,,

Leukemia is the most common cancer among Thai children in Thailand, including both curable and preventable types, but no assessment of trends has hitherto been performed. OBJECTIVE: To perform a statistical assessment of the incidence trend of childhood leukemia in Khon Kaen, Thailand, between 1985 and 2002. METHODS: Population-based cases of childhood leukemia registered between 1985 and 2002 were retrieved from the KKCR and cases with an ICD-O diagnosis (coding C42) in children under 15 were selected. Incidence trends were calculated using the Generalized Linear Model method (GLM), which generates incidence-rate-based logarithms. RESULTS: Of the 277 cases of leukemia, boys were affected two times more frequently than girls and half of the cases were 0-4 years of age. Most diagnoses were histologically- or cytologically-proven and the most common type (affecting two-thirds, 65.7%) was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The overall, age-standardized rate (ASR) for leukemia was 31.9 per million (95%CI: 28.1 to 35.7); 40.3 per million (95%CI: 34.2 to 46.4) in boys and 27.0 (95%CI: 21.8 to 32.2) in girls. Incidence has been increasing by 2.4% per year in boys (95% CI: -0.5 to 5.3) and 4.1% per year in girls (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.2). CONCLUSIONS: This incidence-rate-based logarithm indicates that childhood leukemia has been increasing, suggesting further epidemiological research on causes and possible prevention is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects were 108 consecutive NSCLC cases who were treated with gefitinib between November 2001 and December 2004 at our single institution. A crude incidence rate ratio was calculated by ratio of crude incidence rate in our subject to population-based incident rate of all leukemia (ICD: C91-95) in the same region. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based upon a Poisson distribution. Three cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) occurred during gefitinib treatment, and these patients' past treatment histories are presented herein. No other malignancy was identified. All of the cases were diagnosed at the stage of mild-to-moderate cytopenia, especially thrombocytopenia, without disseminated intravascular coagulation. All presented a normal karyotype with positive PML-RARalpha in RT-PCR, indicating submicroscopic translocation. They responded well to APL treatments, including all-trans-retinoic acid. The crude incident rate ratio was 639.9 (95% confidence interval: 131.6-1,878.9, P < 0.0001) when the APL incidence in this cohort was compared to all leukemia cases in the general population in the same district in Japan. Thus we had three cases of secondary APL patients within the gefitinib-treated NSCLC cohort. Although we cannot exclude an effect of past exposure of other cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy as a cause of APL, APL inducibility of gefitinib should be clarified in the further study.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",,,,,,,,,,"['2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

However, research findings have been inconsistent regarding the domains affected and the degree to which they are compromised. PROCEDURE: A comprehensive meta-analytic review of the long-term neurocognitive effects of childhood ALL was conducted. Studies were included if they were published in English, reported original quantitative data on the post-treatment neurocognitive functioning of childhood ALL patients in first remission and control groups, and used neurocognitive measures with adequate psychometric properties and published normative data. RESULTS: Data from 28 empirical studies yielding 13 effect sizes across nine domains were extracted and analyzed. All effects were negative (g = -0.34 to -0.71), demonstrating that ALL survivors consistently experienced significant deficits in intellectual functioning, academic achievement, and specific neurocognitive abilities compared to control groups. The role of potential moderators, including treatment with cranial irradiation, age at time of diagnosis, and time since treatment ended, was examined. However, no effects emerged as clearly and consistently moderated by these variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this meta-analysis suggest that declines in both global and specific areas of areas of neurocognitive functioning occur as a result of contemporary ALL treatment. Such deficits have significant implications for survivors' academic achievement and overall quality of life. Neurocognitive assessment plays a critical role in determining what remedial or specialized instruction is needed in childhood ALL survivors and should be included as a standard part of long-term follow-up care.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We assessed HRQL among adolescents utilizing a validated self-report tool, the Minneapolis-Manchester Quality of Life (MMQL) Adolescent Form, consisting of 46 items comprising seven domains: physical, cognitive, psychological and social functioning, body image, intimate relations, and outlook on life, and computed an overall QoL score. The MMQL Adolescent Form was administered to 226 adolescent survivors of childhood cancer a median of 7.8 years from diagnosis (off therapy-median age: 16.2 years), 136 adolescent cancer patients undergoing therapy (on therapy-median age: 16.4 years), and 134 healthy adolescents (controls-median age: 15.5 years). Primary diagnoses included leukemia (46%), lymphoma (26%), brain tumors (5%), and other solid tumors (23%). RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, on-therapy patients were at increased risk for reporting poor overall QoL [Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.3, P = 0.002)] and poor physical functioning (OR = 11.8, P < 0.001). Off-therapy survivors did not differ significantly from healthy controls for overall QoL (OR = 1.6, P = 0.5) or any HRQL domains. Female patients, both on- and off-therapy, were more likely to report poorer overall QoL, physical, psychological and cognitive functioning as well as poorer body image when compared with male patients.

One of the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance is gene amplification. The study of the behavior of genes conferring drug resistance is very important to determine future treatments for cancer patients that will minimize the effect of gene amplification. One of the best methods to investigate this phenomenon is to use chromosome microdissection to directly access the amplified gene or genes. In the present study, chromosome microdissection and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) were applied for the identification of genes residing in a homogeneously staining region (HSR) in drug-resistant cell sublines developed by treatment of the T-cell leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM with increasing levels of the anthracycline, epirubicin. We have demonstrated that the selection by epirubicin actually elevated the level of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) gene. We argue that the breakage fusion bridge (B-F-B) cycle offers a plausible explanation for this amplification. The DNA prepared from the amplified regions by chromosome microdissection provides a resource for future investigations looking for the possible presence of novel genes contributing to drug resistance.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,20060420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 17.,"The glucocorticoid-induced inhibition that occurs after discontinuation of treatment is the most frequent cause of adrenal insufficiency. There are yet some doubts about the best way of evaluating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in those patients. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of basal cortisol in diagnosing adrenal insufficiency. Thirty-five children with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) receiving glucocorticoid therapy (median age of 6.9 years) were evaluated. A stimulus test with corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH-1 mcg/kg) was performed before the introduction of dexamethasone (6 mg/m2/day, for 28 days), in the 8th and the 28th days of glucocorticoid therapy, and 48 hours and one month after discontinuation of therapy. Suppression of the basal secretion as well as the maximum concentration of cortisol (post-CRH) occurred during glucocorticoid therapy, which persisted for 48 hours after the steroid was removed from treatment (p< 0.01 and p< 0.0001, respectively, for the three tests). One month after ceasing the administration of the glucocorticoid, the basal secretion, as well as the maximum concentration of cortisol, were similar to that before glucocorticoid therapy. There was a positive and statistically significant correlation between basal secretion and maximum concentration of cortisol in all tests. We observed 95% of specificity for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency when the inferior limit of basal cortisol was 8.5 mcg/dl. According to these results we concluded that basal secretion of cortisol is a good marker of supra-renal function in evaluating children after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,Avaliacao da recuperacao do eixo hipotalamico-hipofisario-adrenal apos corticoterapia por meio do cortisol basal.,20060417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutational studies defined residues of MA critical for the interaction, and tests of viruses carrying MA mutations revealed a near-perfect correlation between binding and virus replication. The replication-defective mutants showed defects in both early and late stages of the life cycle. Four viable second-site revertant viruses were isolated from three different replication-defective parental mutants, and in all cases the interaction with IQGAP1 was restored by the suppressor mutations. The interaction of MA and IQGAP1 was readily detected in vitro and in vivo. Virus replication was potently inhibited by a C-terminal fragment of IQGAP1, and impaired by RNAi knockdown of IQGAP1 and 2. We suggest that the IQGAPs link the virus to the cytoskeleton for trafficking both into and out of the cell.","['0 (IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)']",,,20060420,"['R37 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1462987,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are at least three transcripts that may result from different splicing of the pre-mRNA, but the differences among them are only involved in 5' non-translation region of HZF1 mRNA. HZF1 gene contains four exons and three introns. The putative protein consists of 670 amino-acid residues including 15 typical C2H2 and 2 C2RH zinc finger motifs. This structure characterization of HZF1 and the nuclear location of the protein suggest that HZF1 may function as a transcription factor. HZF1 mRNA expression was detected in ubiquitous tissues and various hematopoietic cell lines. Increased HZF1 mRNA expression was observed following erythroid differentiation of K562 cells induced by hemin or megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Both of the antisense method and RNA interference assay revealed that repression of the intrinsic expression of HZF1 blocked the hemin-induced erythroid differentiation and reduced the PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, which suggested that HZF1 play important roles in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (ZNF266 protein, human)']",,,,,,['GENBANK/DQ117529'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most GATA1 mutations lead to the expression of GATA1s lacking the N-terminal activation domain, we recently found two novel GATA1 proteins with defects in another N-terminal region. It has been suggested that loss of the N-terminal portion of GATA1 might interfere with physiological interactions with the critical megakaryocytic transcription factor RUNX1, and this would imply that GATA1s is not able to interact properly with RUNX1. However, the interaction domain of GATA1 remains controversial. In this study, we show that GATA1 binds to RUNX1 through its zinc-finger domains, and that the C-finger is indispensable for synergy with RUNX1. All of the patient-specific GATA1 mutants interacted efficiently with RUNX1 and retained their ability to act synergistically with RUNX1 on the megakaryocytic GP1balpha promoter, whereas the levels of transcriptional activities were diverse among the mutants. Thus, our data indicate that physical interaction and synergy between GATA1 and RUNX1 are retained in DS-AMKL, although it is still possible that increased RUNX1 activity plays a role in the development of leukemia in DS.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During infection, human immune cells sense the presence of invading pathogens through the Toll-like receptor family (TLR), which recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). We hypothesized that MM cells also could sense the presence of microorganisms, thus promoting myeloma disease progression. Here, we report that human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) and primary myeloma cells express a broad range of TLR, and are sensitive to the corresponding PAMP. Toll-like receptor 1, 7 and 9 are most frequently expressed by HMCL. The expression pattern of TLR does not correlate with the one of B cells, as TLR2 and 10 are lost while TLR3, 4 and 8 are acquired by some HMCL. Culture with TLR7- and TLR9-ligands saves HMCL from serum-deprivation or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. Similarly, both ligands increase myeloma cell growth. These effects are mediated by an autocrine secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) since the neutralization of IL-6 blocks the growth and survival of HMCL. Thus, TLR expression and function are not restricted to the cells of the immune system and could be of advantage for cancer cells.

Fifteen of these isolates were relatively resistant to the conventional agent chlorambucil but retained sensitivity to PTL. Brief exposures to PTL (1-3 h) were sufficient to induce caspase activation and commitment to cell death. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were more sensitive towards PTL than were normal T lymphocytes or CD34(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells. The mechanism of cell killing was via PTL-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in turn in a proapoptotic Bax conformational change, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and caspase activation. Parthenolide also decreased nuclear levels of the antiapoptotic transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B and diminished phosphorylation of its negative regulator IkappaB. Killing of CLL cells by PTL was apparently independent of p53 induction. This is the first report showing the relative selectivity of PTL towards CLL cells.

To identify genes associated with this response, we analyzed gene expression of diagnostic lymphoblasts from 189 children with ALL and compared the findings with minimal residual disease (MRD) levels on days 19 and 46 of remission induction treatment. After excluding genes associated with genetic subgroups, we identified 17 genes that were significantly associated with MRD. The caspase 8-associated protein 2 (CASP8AP2) gene was studied further because of its reported role in apoptosis and glucocorticoid signaling. In a separate cohort of 99 patients not included in the comparison of gene expression profiles and MRD, low levels of CASP8AP2 expression predicted a lower event-free survival (P = .02) and a higher rate of leukemia relapse (P = .01) and were an independent predictor of outcome. High levels of CASP8AP2 expression were associated with a greater propensity of leukemic lymphoblasts to undergo apoptosis. We conclude that measurement of CASP8AP2 expression at diagnosis offers a means to identify patients whose leukemic cells are highly susceptible to chemotherapy. Therefore, this gene is a strong candidate for inclusion in gene expression arrays specifically designed for leukemia diagnosis.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8AP2 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)']",,,20060420,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895863,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 20.,"Acquired mutations in the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase are common in acute myeloid leukemia and result in constitutive activation. The most frequent mechanism of activation is disruption of the juxtamembrane autoregulatory domain by internal tandem duplications (ITDs). FLT3-ITDs confer factor-independent growth to hematopoietic cells and induce a myeloproliferative syndrome in murine bone marrow transplant models. We and others have observed that FLT3-ITD activates STAT5 and its downstream effectors, whereas ligand-stimulated wild-type FLT3 (FLT3WT) does not. In vitro mapping of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in FLT3-ITD identified 2 candidate STAT5 docking sites within the juxtamembrane domain that are disrupted by the ITD. Tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution of residues 589 and 591 in the context of the FLT3-ITD did not affect tyrosine kinase activity, but abrogated STAT5 activation. Furthermore, FLT3-ITD-Y589/591F was incapable of inducing a myeloproliferative phenotype when transduced into primary murine bone marrow cells, whereas FLT3-ITD induced myeloproliferative disease with a median latency of 50 days. Thus, the conformational change in the FLT3 juxtamembrane domain induced by the ITD activates the kinase through dysregulation of autoinhibition and results in qualitative differences in signal transduction through STAT5 that are essential for the transforming potential of FLT3-ITD in vivo.","['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,20060420,"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA04002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895880,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because of a high early crossover rate to imatinib, survival benefit was not assessable. Here, we report the result of a study comparing long-term outcome of patients included in 2 prospective randomized trials: 551 patients assigned to imatinib in the IRIS trial from 2000 to 2001 and 325 patients who received the combination IFN/Ara-C in the CML91 trial between 1991 and 1996 before imatinib was available. With a follow-up of 42 months for both groups of patients, estimated CCyR, survival free of transformation, and overall survival were significantly higher with imatinib compared with IFN/Ara-C (P < .001, P = .004, and P < .001, respectively). Improved overall survival was also confirmed within different Sokal prognostic risk groups. Of interest, among all patients who achieved major cytogenetic response or CCyR at 12 months, the survival rate was similar irrespective of their treatment.

However, the vast majority of patients, despite major responses, still harbor Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) cells. We have described a population of primitive Ph(+) cells that are insensitive to IM and may be a source of IM resistance. Cell line studies have suggested that the drug transporter ABCG2 may be a mediator of IM resistance, however there is considerable debate about whether IM is an ABCG2 substrate or inhibitor.

To determine whether regulatory T cells in allogeneic stem cell transplants (SCTs) ameliorate GVHD after transplantation, we quantitated the coexpression of FOXP3 on CD4(+) T cells in 32 donor SCTs infused into HLA-matched siblings and examined GVHD incidence in respective recipients. High CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T-cell count in the donor was associated with a reduced risk of GVHD. We monitored T(reg)s during immune reconstitution in 21 patients with leukemia undergoing a T-cell-depleted allogeneic SCT. Early after SCT, there was a significant expansion in the CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T-cell compartment. A low CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T-cell count early after SCT (day 30) was associated with an increased risk of GVHD, and the ratio of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells to CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(-) T cells was significantly reduced in patients with GVHD, suggesting diminished control of effector T cells. Our findings suggest that graft T(reg) content may predict for risk of GVHD after SCT. Determining the T(reg) levels in the donor and manipulating T(reg)s early after transplantation may provide a new approach to controlling GVHD.","['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",,,20060420,,PMC1895877,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such cytokine-treated AML-derived DC (AML-DC) can stimulate autologous T cells. In this study we examined whether an anti-CTLA-4 MAb (MDX-010) could enhance the generation of autologous anti-AML T cells. METHODS: MAb MDX-010 was added to AML PBMC cultures in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4, a previously reported AML-DC culture method of generating anti-AML T cells. T-cell activation and proliferation were examined thereafter. RESULTS: Addition of MDX-010 to GM-CSF/IL-4-conditioned AML-DC cultures induced a mean seven-fold increase in the numbers of autologous T cells compared with cultures without MDX-010 (P < 0.007). T cells stimulated by AML-DC with CTLA-4 blockade were significantly more cytotoxic towards autologous AML cells than those without MDX-010 (42 +/- 23% vs. 26 +/- 15%, E:T ratio of 20). T cells stimulated by AML-DC with CTLA-4 blockade had significantly greater proportions of T cells producing IFN-gamma in response to autologous AML cells than those cultured with AML-DC alone (10.7 +/- 4.7% vs. 4.5 +/- 2.4% for CD4+ IFN-gamma+ CD69+ and 9.8 +/- 4.1% vs. 4 +/- 2.1% for CD8+ IFN-gamma+ CD69+ with or without MDX-010; n = 7; P < 0.007, P < 0.003, respectively). DISCUSSION: CTLA-4 blockade enhances the activity and numbers of AML-reactive T cells that can be stimulated by autologous AML-DC and may enhance the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of AML.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,['R0131888/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,['Cytotherapy. 2006;8(1):1-2.

Epub 2006 Mar 31.,"Human interleukin-6 is involved in the maintenance and progression of several diseases such as multiple myeloma (MM), rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoporosis. Our previous work demonstrated that an interleukin-6 antagonist peptide (named PT) possessed potential bioactivity to antagonize the function of hIL-6 and could efficiently induce the growth arrest and apoptosis of XG-7 and M1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In this study, the theoretical interaction of the peptide PT with its receptor was analyzed further more with molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods. The theoretical studies showed that PT possessed very high affinity to interleukin-6R and offered a practical means of imposing long-term blockade of interleukin-6 activity in vivo. According to the theoretical results, the biological evaluation of PT was researched on two different cells models with more sensitive approaches: (1) The antagonist activity of PT was studied on the interleukin-6 dependent MM cells (XG-7) cultured with interleukin-6. In the other interleukin-6 dependent MM cells (SKO-007), they survived themselves by auto/paracrine without the exogenous interleukin-6, and also could be antagonized by PT. The therapeutic value of PT only limited on the interleukin-6 dependent category in MM. (2) Myeloid leukemia M1 cells were induced for growth arrest and apoptosis in response to interleukin-6. The results supported our previous findings and showed that PT could be evaluated by protecting the cells from interleukin-6 induced apoptosis. In conclusion, PT could induce interleukin-6-dependent XG-7 and SKO-007 cells to apoptosis while inhibit interleukin-6-stimulated apoptosis in M1 cells.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,20060331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal translocations involving the MOZ gene are associated with AML (acute myeloid leukaemia), suggesting that it has a role in haematopoiesis. Recurrent reciprocal translocations fuse the MOZ gene [or the gene encoding MORF (MOZ-related factor); also known as MYST4] to genes encoding the nuclear receptor co-activators CBP [CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein)-binding protein], p300 or the p160 protein TIF2 (transcription intermediary factor 2). The resulting fusion proteins can transform haematopoietic progenitors in vitro, and induce myeloproliferative disease in mice. Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects indicate that MOZ fusion proteins interfere with the activities of transcription factors such as nuclear receptors, p53 and Runx proteins. Our studies suggest that subverting the function of cellular CBP and p300 proteins may play a key role in this process.

Following antigen-driven T-cell accumulation at tumors, viral particles productively infect tumor cells via envelope/receptor dependent interactions ('hand on' of virus from the T cell to the tumor cell). We describe here a second envelope/receptor independent pathway of viral hand on from T cells, dependent on T-cell activation. We show that the endosomolytic property of perforin promotes release of viral particles from endosomes into which they are co-delivered along with cytotoxic granules from the activated T cell. Therefore, hand on of MLV particles lacking any envelope can be used for in vivo delivery of vectors, where targeting is at the extremely specific level of recognition of antigen by the T-cell receptor, thereby dispensing with the need to engineer viral envelopes. These data reveal a novel pathway by which MLV viral particles exploit a functional immunological synapse and present new opportunities both to improve the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer and to target vectors for systemic gene delivery.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",,,20060420,"['1R01CA107082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA94180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of Op18 in malignancy was recently suggested by identification of a somatic Q18-->E mutation of Op18 in an adenocarcinoma. We addressed the functional consequences of aberrant Op18 expression in leukemias by analyzing the cell cycle of K562 cells either depleted of Op18 by expression of interfering hairpin RNA or induced to express wild-type or Q18E substituted Op18. We show here that although Op18 depletion increases microtubule density during interphase, the density of mitotic spindles is essentially unaltered and cells divide normally. This is consistent with phosphorylation-inactivation of Op18 during mitosis. Overexpression of wild-type Op18 results in aneugenic activities, manifest as aberrant mitosis, polyploidization, and chromosome loss. One particularly significant finding was that the aneugenic activity of Op18 was dramatically increased by the Q18-->E mutation.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies demonstrate that two ILF-DNA binding domain molecules cooperatively bind to DNA. In addition to the recognition helix recognizing the core sequences through the major groove, the structure shows that wing 1 interacts with the minor groove of DNA, and the H2-H3 loop region makes ionic bonds to the phosphate group, which permits the recognition of DNA. The structure also reveals that the presence of the C-terminal alpha-helix in place of a typical wing 2 in a member of this family alters the orientation of the C-terminal basic residues (RKRRPR) when binding to DNA outside the core sequence. These results provide a new insight into how the DNA binding specificities of winged helix/forkhead proteins may be regulated by their less conserved regions.","['0 (FOXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",,,20060418,,,['PDB/2C6Y'],,,,,,,,,S0021-9258(20)55769-4 [pii] 10.1074/jbc.M600478200 [doi],,,

Epub 2006 Apr 19.,"The experience of the past 3 years, since the first case of leukemia was reported in a child cured of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) by gene therapy, indicates that the potential genotoxicity of retroviral integration in hematopoietic cells will remain a consideration in evaluating the relative risks versus benefits of gene therapy for specific blood disorders. Although many unique variables may have contributed to an increased risk in X-SCID patients, clonal dominance or frank neoplasia in animal models, clonal dominance in humans with chronic granulomatous disease, and the ability of retroviral integration to immortalize normal bone marrow cells or convert factor-dependent cells to factor independence suggest that transduction of cells with an integrating retrovirus has the potential for altering their subsequent biologic behavior. The selective pressure imposed during in vitro culture or after engraftment may uncover a growth or survival advantage for cells in which an integration event has affected gene expression. Such cells then carry the risk that subsequent mutations may lead to neoplastic evolution of individual clones. Balancing that risk is that the vast majority of integration events seem to be neutral and that optimizing vector design may diminish the probability of altering gene expression by an integrated vector genome. Several cell culture systems and animal models designed to empirically evaluate the safety of vector systems are being developed and should provide useful data for weighing the relative risks and benefits for specific diseases and patient populations. Gene therapy interventions continue to have enormous potential for the treatment of disorders of the hematopoietic system. The future of such efforts seems bright as we continue to evolve and improve various strategies to make such interventions both effective and as safe as possible.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",139,,20060419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increase in expression and half-life of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 has been found in carcinomas of the colon, lung, liver, prostate, and breast cancer. This overexpression of DNMT1 is responsible for hypermethylation of regulatory sequences of many genes involved in tumorigenesis. Using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we found that TSA down-regulate DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression in Jurkat T leukemia cells clone E6-1. We also observed that TSA decreased DNMT1 mRNA stability and reduced this transcript half-life from approximately 7 to 2h. We also found that protein biosynthesis is needed for posttranscriptional regulation of DNMT1 mRNA, which suggests the involvement of an RNase and/or mRNA stabilization protein entity in DNMT1 transcript stabilization. Our findings suggest that TSA not only alters histone acetylation, but also may affect DNA methylation.","['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)']",,,20060419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the important functional interaction between cyclin D1 and cyclin dependent kinases, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors such as flavopiridol are under consideration for treatment of patients with MCL. The present study investigated the in vitro effects of flavopiridol on the MCL cell line (JeKo-1). Flavopiridol at a dose of 10nmol/L induced apoptosis by 6h of treatment as noted by flow cytometric analysis, morphologic examination and Western blotting. The cleavage of procaspase-3 and PARP and the decrease of flavopiridol-induced apoptosis by pan-caspase inhibition suggested that the caspase pathway serves an important role in the apoptotic process. Furthermore, MCL cells exposed to flavopiridol showed down regulation of key cell cycle proteins acting at the restriction point control between the G1 and S phases. The onset of flavopiridol-induced apoptosis also coincided with the down regulation of Mcl-1, anti-apoptotic protein. Collectively, our data indicates that flavopiridol may have significant therapeutic potential in the context of MCL.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,20060419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism involved in this effect has remained elusive. Here we used the human leukemia cell line Jurkat-that expresses CB2 as the unique CB receptor-to investigate this mechanism. Our results show that incubation with the selective CB2 antagonist SR144528 abrogated the pro-apoptotic effect of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Cannabinoid treatment led to a CB2 receptor-dependent stimulation of ceramide biosynthesis and inhibition of this pathway prevented Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced mitochondrial hypopolarization and cytochrome c release, indicating that ceramide acts at a pre-mitochondrial level. Inhibition of ceramide synthesis de novo also prevented caspase activation and apoptosis. Caspase 8 activation-an event typically related with the extrinsic apoptotic pathway-was also evident in this model. However, activation of this protease was post-mitochondrial since (i) a pan-caspase inhibitor as well as a selective caspase 8 inhibitor were unable to prevent Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced loss of mitochondrial-membrane transmembrane potential, and (ii) cannabinoid-induced caspase 8 activation was not observed in Bcl-xL over-expressing cells. In summary, results presented here show that CB2 receptor activation signals apoptosis via a ceramide-dependent stimulation of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway.","['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '7J8897W37S (Dronabinol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,20060419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: (1) The CR rate (96.9%) in GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes double-present patients was significantly higher than that in patients of GSTT1 null or GSTM1 null (CR rate 78.0%) (P = 0.013). The risk of failure to achieve CR in patients with GSTT1 null/GSTM1 null is 8.736 times higher than that in patients with GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes double-present (odds ratio OR was 8.736, 95% CI was 1.146 - 66.574). The CR rate (88.4%) in GSTT1 present patients was also significantly higher than that in patients of GSTT1 null (CR rate 74.7%) (P = 0.021, OR = 2.572, 95% CI 1.136 - 5.826).

Relapse-free survival in GSTT1 null patients was significantly shorter than that in patients with GSTT1 present (26.7 months vs 64.3 months, P = 0.038), but there was no significant difference of overall survival between the two groups. The relapse rate of double-present patients was significantly lower than that of GSTT1 null/GSTM1 null patients (13.3% vs 35.6%, P = 0.019).

METHODS: TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and immunohistochemistry were used to study cell apoptosis and expression of MCL-1 proteins and survivin proteins in 43 patients with B-NHL and 10 with reactive hyperplasia (RH) lymphoid tissue. RESULTS: The positive rate of MCL-1 proteins and survivin proteins was 58.1% (25/43) and 69.8% (30/43) respectively. The expression of MCL-1 proteins was not detected in RH lymphoid tissue, but that of survivin was detected in 10.0% (1/10). The expression of MCL-1 proteins in aggressive B-NHL was higher than that in indolent B-NHL (70.0 % vs 30.8 %, P < 0.05). The expression of survivin in aggressive B-NHL was also higher than that in indolent B-NHL (80.0% vs 46.2%, P < 0.05). Apoptotic index (AI) was not correlated positively with the expression of MCL-1, but correlated positively with the expression of survivin (r = 0.429, P < 0.01). MCL-1 and survivin were correlated positively in B-NHL (r = 0.598, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MCL-1 proteins as family member of BCL-2 have no influence on apoptosis but survivin may participate in the regulation mechanism of B-NHL apoptosis.

METHODS: To analyze the outcomes of 30 patients with refractory leukemia who underwent HLA haploidentical peripheral blood stem cells transplantation from August 1998 to August 2004. RESULTS: Thirty refractory leukemia patients including 13 cases of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, 10 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 6 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia and 1 case of phase IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent HLA haploidentical peripheral blood stem cells transplantation. The median age was 25 years old (3-52 years old). Twelve patients received stem cells from parent donors, four from daughter or son donors and the remaining from sibling donors. Three HLA loci mismatched in twelve cases, two HLA loci mismatched in thirteen cases and one HLA locus mismatched in five cases. The conditioning regime consisted of fludara (25 mg/m(2) x 5 d), busulfan (4 mg/kg x 4 d) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2 d). Rabbit anti-human lymphocyte globulin (5 mg/kg x 5 d) was added in some patients in the conditioning regime. A mean of 5.0 (2.9-8.0) x 10(8)/kg mononucleated cells was grafted. The number of mean CD(34)(+) cells was 5.5 (3.0-6.5) x 10(6)/kg. Twenty-seven patients were successfully grafted, one failed to graft, one died from severe fungal infection at day 2 and one died from severe veno-occlusive disease at day 28. The mean time of white cell count more than 1.0 x 10(9)/L was 14 (11-18) days and platelet count more than 20 x 10(9)/L was 15 (11-18) days. ALL the 27 successfully grafted patients got complete remission. Severe acute graft versus host disease occurred in six patients and four of them died. Seven patients suffered from chronic graft versus host disease. Seven patients relapsed and died. The median relapse time was 10 (3-24) months. Fourteen patients are still surviving, and ten have disease free survival. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from our observation that HLA haploidentical peripheral blood stem cells transplantation may be an effective therapy for refractory and relapse leukemia. Some patients with refractory and relapse leukemia treated with HLA haploidentical stem cells transplantation may have disease free survival. Graft versus leukemia effect may be strong in patients receiving HLA haploidentical blood stem cells transplantation and leukemia will probably be relapsed when the patient without complete remission was treated with this therapy.",['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the related factors affecting unrelated umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation, the authors analyzed retrospectively the results of transplantation of unrelated umbilical cord blood stem cells for 65 patients. METHODS: ALL (acute lymphocytic leukemia) cord blood units were obtained from full term normal vaginal and cesarean deliveries in Guangzhou Women and Infants Hospital. The fractionation, cryopreservation and thawing of the cord blood were performed according to the regulations of New York umbilical cord blood bank and pertinent literature. The selection of cord blood was based on HLA typing and the number of nucleated cells. The sex and HLA antigens of donors were defined as the evidence of engraftment. Time to engraftment was recorded when the absolute number of neutrophil ANC (absolute neutrophil count) was higher than 5.0 x 10(8) for three days. Event-free survival and graft versus host disease (GVHD) were provided by transplant centers. RESULTS: Out of 65 patients who received unrelated cord blood stem cell transplant, 49 patients were diagnosed as having malignant diseases [including 23 with ALL, 16 with AML (acute myeloid leukemia), 7 with CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia), 3 with lymphoma and one with MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome)], 16 patients had non-malignant disease. The 65 transplanted patients (42 male, 23 female) had a median age of 10 years (range 1 - 33 years) and a median body weight of 27 kg (range 10 - 67 kg). The patients received cord blood stem cells from unrelated 0-locus (n = 9) or 1-locus (n = 43) or 2-locus (n = 13) HLA mismatched donor. The median dose of infused cells was: total neutrophil count (TNC) 5.7 x 10(7), CD(34)(+) 5.1 x 10(5), CFU-GM 3.8 x 10(4). Fifty of 65 (77%) patients had engraftment. GVHD occurred in 41 patients (63%), including acute grade I - II GVHD in 31 patients (76%), acute grade III - IV GVHD in 8 patients (20%) and chronic GVHD in 2 patients (5%). Fifty patients had engraftment (ANC > 5.0 x 10(8)) after a median time of 17 (range 7 to 44) days after transplant, while an autologous hematopoietic reconstitution was observed in 6 patients; 24 patients died of severe pneumonia (n = 8), acute GVHD (n = 4), or sepsis (n = 12) and the disease-free survival probability was 61%.

This study aimed at investigating the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of HC in children post umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). METHODS: From October 1998 to June the clinical records of 53 pediatric patients (aged 2-18 years with median age of 7.5 years) in our HCST center who underwent UCBT (n = 37) and PBSCT (n = 16) were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty out of 53 patients were diagnosed as hereditary hemolytic anemia (56.6%), and the others as haematological malignancies (43.4%): of whom 8 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 12 acute myeloid leukemia, 2 chronic myeloid leukemia and 1 non-hodgkin lymphoma. Conditioning regimen varied according to disease and clinical status, however based on cyclophosphamide (CTX, 120-200 mg/kg) and busulphan (BU, 12-16 mg/kg) in the cohort. Total body irradiation (TBI) or total lymphoid irradiation was added in 7 patients respectively. The patients were divided into regular treatment group (RTG) with 15 cases who received hyperhydration, alkalinizing, diuresis and Mesna during CTX infusion and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) group (PEG) with 38 cases who received hyperhydration, alkalinizing, diuresis and Mesna plus prostaglandin E1 (0.03 microg/kg.h). The risk factors of HC were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: In all, 11 of the 53 transplanted patients developed HC (21%) with a median onset time of day +15 (rage day +2 - +25). HC was classified as early in 4 (36%) and late in 7 (64%), and scored as grade Iin 2 cases (18%), grade II in 4 (36%) and grade III in 5 (46%). There was no significant difference between RTG and PEG in the incidence of HC, however, the incidence was much higher in the group of patients who were > or = 6 years old, positive group of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and group of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection than that in the group of patients who were < 6 years of age (32% vs. 8%, P < 0.05), negative group of GVHD (35% vs. 7%, P < 0.05) and CMV non-infected group (62% vs. 13%, P < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, by multivariate analysis, > or = 6 years old (OR = 3.53, P < 0.05) and CMV infection (OR = 4.31, P < 0.05) were significant risk factors for HC. Three of 11 patients were treated with bladder irrigation. All patients recovered from HC in a median 12.8 days (range 2-53 days). CONCLUSION: Older age (> or = 6 years) as well as CMV infection were the risk factors of HC. Both hyperhydration and Mesna were effective in preventing HC, while addition of PGE1 could not reduce the incidence of HC. The prognosis of HC in children post HSCT was satisfactory.","['0 (Protective Agents)', 'NR7O1405Q9 (Mesna)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intravenous administration of As(2)O(3) prolonged the QT interval in a dose- and time-dependent manner in guinea pig hearts, and the QT prolongation could be modulated by choline.

Choline corrected As(2)O(3)-mediated alterations of action potential duration, I(Ca-L) and [Ca(2+)](i), but had no effect on the I(K) inhibition. As(2)O(3) markedly disturbed the normal equilibrium of transmembrane currents (increasing I(Ca-L) and suppressing I(K)) in guinea pig cardiomyocyte, and induced prolongation of action potential duration, further degenerated into QT prolongation.

Scl is also expressed in neurons of the mouse diencephalon, mesencephalon and metencephalon; however, its requirement in those sites remains to be determined. Here we report conditional deletion of Scl in neuronal precursor cells using the Cre/LoxP system. Neuronal-Scl deleted mice died prematurely, were growth retarded and exhibited an altered motor phenotype characterized by hyperactivity and circling. Moreover, ablation of Scl in the nervous system affected brain morphology with abnormal neuronal development in brain regions known to express Scl under normal circumstances; there was an almost complete absence of Scl-null neurons in the hindbrain and partial loss of Scl-null neurons in the thalamus and midbrain from early neurogenesis onwards. Our results demonstrate a crucial role for Scl in the development of Scl-expressing neurons, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons. Our study represents one of the first demonstrations of functional overlap of a single bHLH protein that regulates neural and haematopoietic cell development. This finding underlines Scl's critical function in cell fate determination of mesodermal as well as neuroectodermal tissues.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The primary analysis used a 5-part composite endpoint: resolution of any baseline invasive fungal infection, no breakthrough invasive fungal infection, survival, no premature discontinuation of study drug, and fever resolution for 48 h during the period of neutropenia. Pre-specified analyses used 3 other definitions for fever resolution: afebrile for 24 h during the period of neutropenia, afebrile at 7 days post therapy, and eliminating fever resolution altogether from the composite endpoint. Patients were stratified on entry by use of antifungal prophylaxis and risk of infection. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants or relapsed acute leukemia defined high-risk patients. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, 41% of patients in each treatment group met the fever-resolution criteria. Low-risk patients had shorter durations of neutropenia but failed fever-resolution criteria more often than high-risk patients. In each exploratory analysis, response rates increased in both treatment groups compared to the primary analysis, particularly in low-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Response rates for the primary composite endpoint for both treatment groups in this study were driven by low rates of fever resolution. Requiring fever resolution during neutropenia in a composite endpoint can mask more clinically relevant outcomes.","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large body of available gene expression data has also allowed us to define the of coordinately expressed genes, termed gene expression signatures, which characterize the states of cellular physiology that reflect cellular differentiation, activation of signaling pathways, and the action of transcription factors. Gene expression signatures that reflect the action of individual transcription factors can be defined by perturbing transcription factor function using RNA interference (RNAi), small-molecule inhibition, and dominant-negative approaches. We have used this methodology to define gene expression signatures of various transcription factors controlling B-cell differentiation and activation, including BCL-6, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and c-myc. We have also curated a wide variety of gene expression signatures from the literature and assembled these into a signature database. Statistical methods can define whether any signature in this database is differentially expressed in independent biological samples, an approach we have used to gain mechanistic insights into the origin and clinical behavior of B-cell lymphomas. We also discuss the use of genomic-scale RNAi libraries to identify genes and pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets in B-cell malignancies.",['0 (Transcription Factors)'],144,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physiologically, melatonin is associated with T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, and its administration favours Th1 priming. In both normal and leukaemic mice, melatonin administration results in quantitative and functional enhancement of natural killer (NK) cells, whose role is to mediate defenses against virus-infected and cancer cells. Melatonin appears to regulate cell dynamics, including the proliferative and maturational stages of virtually all haemopoietic and immune cells lineages involved in host defense - not only NK cells but also T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes - in both bone marrow and tissues. In particular, melatonin is a powerful antiapoptotic signal promoting the survival of normal granulocytes and B lymphocytes. In mice bearing mid-stage leukaemia, daily administration of melatonin results in a survival index of 30-40% vs. 0% in untreated mice. Thus, melatonin seems to have a fundamental role as a system regulator in haemopoiesis and immuno-enhancement, appears to be closely involved in several fundamental aspects of host defense and has the potential to be useful as an adjuvant tumour immunotherapeutic agent.","['0 (Cytokines)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",75,,,,PMC2517357,,,"['Int J Exp Pathol. 2006 Jun;87(3):251.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of hepatitis B virus infection in children with malignant diseases, to investigate the clinical course of the illness, and to analyse the influence of hepatitis on cytotoxic treatment. METHOD: The study included children diagnosed and treated for malignant diseases at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade from 1997 to 2003. HBs Ag was analysed in all patients who had elevated transaminases of twice normal value, in children who had icterus, and in one group of patients treated routinely after 2001 before, during, and after therapy. RESULTS A total of 137 male and 107 female children who had malignancies were treated. From 113 children who were evaluated for the presence of HBs Ag at the beginning of treatment, 2 (1.7%) were HBsAg+. In this group of patients HBsAg was tested in 58 (51%) children during and after chemotherapy, and HBsAg was discovered in 17 (29%) of them. Of 123 children, in whom HBsAg was not tested at the beginning of their illness, 36 (55%) out of 66 (51%) tested patients were HBsAg+. No statistical difference between those two groups of patients was ascertained (chi2 = 3.27, p > 0.05). In summary, the presence of HBsAg was discovered in 53 patients, 22% out of 244 patients and 43% of tested patients. Nine patients had the icteric form of illness, with one case proving fatal due to fulminating hepatitis.

Epub 2006 Apr 19.,"STEAP is a recently identified protein shown to be particularly overexpressed in prostate cancer and also present in numerous human cancer cell lines from prostate, pancreas, colon, breast, testicular, cervical, bladder and ovarian carcinoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia and Ewing sarcoma. This expression profile renders STEAP an appealing candidate for broad cancer immunotherapy. In order to investigate if STEAP is a tumor antigen that can be targeted by specific CD8(+) T cells, we identified two high affinity HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides (STEAP(86-94) and STEAP(262-270)). These peptides were immunogenic in vivo in HLA-A*0201 transgenic HHD mice. Peptide specific murine CD8 T cells recognized COS-7 cells co-transfected with HHD (HLA-A*0201) and STEAP cDNA constructs and also HLA-A*0201(+) STEAP(+) human tumor cells. Furthermore, STEAP(86-94) and STEAP(262-270) stimulated specific CD8(+) T cells from HLA-A*0201(+) healthy donors, and these peptide specific CD8(+) T cells recognized STEAP positive human tumor cells in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner. Importantly, STEAP(86-94)-specific T cells were detected and reactive in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in NSCLC and prostate cancer patients ex vivo. These results show that STEAP can be a target of anti-tumor CD8(+) T cells and that STEAP peptides can be used for a broad-spectrum-tumor immunotherapy.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (STEAP protein (262-270), human)', '0 (STEAP protein (86-94), human)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.16.1.- (STEAP1 protein, human)']",,,20060419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 19.,"INTRODUCTION: In this retrospective, uncontrolled, observational study, the effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated granulocyte transfusions (GTX) in neutropenic paediatric patients with sepsis was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Granulocytes were collected from unrelated, ABO group-matched and cytomegalic-antibody compatible donors. For neutrophil mobilization, donors received a single subcutaneous dose of glycosylated G-CSF (Lenograstim, Chugai Pharma, Japan) plus oral dexamethasone (8 mg). In total, 168 (range 1-19 per patient) GTX were transfused in 32 children with a median age of 7.4 (0.25 to 16) years. RESULTS: The underlying diseases comprised predominantly haematooncological malignancies (31 children). In 15 of 32 patients, neutropenia was related to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All children suffered from sepsis based on international criteria (fever, tachycardia, respiratory rate >2 SD above normal in the context of a suspected or proven infection). In ten children bacteria were isolated, in six children a fungal infection was diagnosed and four sepsis episodes were caused by viral infections. GTX contained a median neutrophil number of 6.3 (range 1.9-13.9)x10(10) per transfusion and obtained a sustained haematological response after GTX. Nineteen out of 32 children survived the neutropenic sepsis, particularly nine out of 11 patients with bacterial sepsis. DISCUSSION: In contrast to the non-survivors, we observed a significant decrease in the C-reactive protein levels shortly after initiation of the GTX treatment in the surviving patients. A clear-cut benefit of GTX for children with neutropenic sepsis cannot be concluded from these data, but in children with (severe) bacterial sepsis refractory to antibiotic treatment, GTX were feasible, safe and could reduce mortality rates in this subgroup of patients.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",,,20060419,,PMC7102011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exact role of TBI as part of the conditioning regimen is largely unclear. In order to determine the relevance of TBI, the status of TBI utilization was analyzed on the basis of a nationwide registry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 14,371 patients (1998-2002) documented in the German Stem Cell Transplantation Registry (DRST) were analyzed regarding TBI utilization prior to autologous or allogeneic transplantation, underlying disorder, type of donor, stem cell source, and size of the treatment center. RESULTS: For autologous HSCT approximately 10% of the patients (873/8,167) received TBI, with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, approximately 80%, 171/214) and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (l-NHL, approximately 35%, 330/929) being the most important disorders. In the allogeneic setting 50% of the patients (2,399/4,904) received TBI, with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, 85%, 794/930), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 45%, 662/1,487) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, 49%, 561/1,156) being the key indications. The type of donor, stem cell source and center size did not strongly influence the use of TBI. CONCLUSION: TBI has only a limited role for the conditioning prior to autologous HCST. For allogeneic HSCT TBI is widely accepted with no major changes over the observation time. The use of TBI is generally accepted for ALL, whereas approximately half of the patients with CML or AML received TBI. Although a considerably large database was analyzed, no clear determinants for the use of TBI could be distinguished.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IGKV-KDE and IGKJ-C-intron-KDE rearrangements were also analyzed on genomic DNA. In kappa-CLL, only 3 of 188 cases carried double in-frame IGKV-J transcripts: in such cases, the possibility that leukemic cells expressed more than one kappa chain cannot be excluded. Twenty-eight kappa-CLL cases also carried nonexpressed (nontranscribed and/or out-of-frame) IGKV-J rearrangements. Taking IGKV-J, IGKV-KDE, and IGKJ-C-intron-KDE rearrangements together, 38% of kappa-CLL cases carried biallelic IGK locus rearrangements. In lambda-CLL, 69 IGKV-J rearrangements were detected in 64 of 103 cases (62%); 24 rearrangements (38.2%) were in-frame. Four cases carried in-frame IGKV-J transcripts but retained monotypic light-chain expression, suggesting posttranscriptional regulation of allelic exclusion. In all, taking IGKV-J, IGKV-KDE, and IGKJ-C-intron-KDE rearrangements together, 97% of lambda-CLL cases had at least 1 rearranged IGK allele, in keeping with normal cells. IG repertoire comparisons in kappa- versus lambda-CLL revealed that CLL precursor cells tried many rearrangements on the same IGK allele before they became lambda producers. Thirteen of 28 and 26 of 69 non-expressed sequences in, respectively, kappa- or lambda-CLL had < 100% homology to germline. This finding might be considered as evidence for secondary rearrangements occurring after the onset of somatic hypermutation, at least in some cases. The inactivation of potentially functional IGKV-J joints by secondary rearrangements indicates active receptor editing in CLL and provides further evidence for the role of antigen in CLL immunopathogenesis.","['0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,PMC1449522,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase II, open-label, multicenter study, 61 pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL received clofarabine 52 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours daily for 5 days, every 2 to 6 weeks. The median age was 12 years (range, 1 to 20 years), and the median number of prior regimens was three (range, two to six regimens). RESULTS: The response rate was 30%, consisting of seven complete remissions (CR), five CRs without platelet recovery (CRp), and six partial remissions. Remissions were durable enough to allow patients to proceed to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) after clofarabine. Median CR duration in patients who did not receive HSCT was 6 weeks, with four patients maintaining CR or CRp for 8 weeks or more (8+, 12, 37+, and 48 weeks) on clofarabine therapy alone. The most common adverse events of grade > or = 3 were febrile neutropenia, anorexia, hypotension, and nausea. CONCLUSION: Clofarabine is active as a single agent in pediatric patients with multiple relapsed or refractory ALL. The toxicity profile is as expected in this heavily pretreated patient population. Studies exploring rational combinations of clofarabine with other agents are ongoing in an effort to maximize clinical benefit.","['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",,,,['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stxs belong to a large family of ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), found in many plants and some bacteria. Plant RIPs, secreted into extracellular spaces, limit the spread of viruses through plant tissues by penetrating and killing virally infected cells. Previously, we showed Stx activity against bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected cells in vitro and hypothesized that STEC bacteria have antiviral activity in ruminant hosts. Here, we investigated the impact of STEC on the initial phases of BLV infection in sheep. Sheep were treated with biweekly oral doses of E. coli O157:H7 (an STEC) or an isogenic stx mutant strain. A different group of sheep were similarly treated with five naturally occurring ovine STEC isolates or stx-negative E. coli. Intestinal STEC bacteria were enumerated and identified by standard fecal culture and DNA hybridization. Oral STEC treatment did not always result in carriage of STEC, although many animals consistently presented with >10(4) CFU/g feces. BLV viremia was assessed by spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation (SLP) in cultures of blood mononuclear cells and by syncytium formation in cocultures of the same with F-81 indicator cells. SLP was lower (P < 0.05) and syncytia were fewer (P < 0.05) in STEC-treated sheep than in untreated sheep. Both lower SLP and fewer syncytia positively correlated with fecal STEC numbers. Average weight gain post-BLV challenge was higher in STEC-treated sheep than in untreated sheep (P < 0.05). These results support the hypothesis that in ruminants, intestinal STEC bacteria have antiviral activity and mitigate BLV-induced disease.",['0 (Shiga Toxins)'],,,,"['U54 AI057141/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20-RR16454/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U54-AI-57141/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HD-0-3309/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016454/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20-RR15587/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR015587/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1459712,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with increased neutrophil numbers in the airway. In this study, we assessed whether this ssRNA virus can directly influence granulocyte longevity. By culturing RSV with granulocytes, it was observed that virus delays both constitutive neutrophil and eosinophil apoptosis. Using pharmacological inhibitors, the RSV-induced delay in neutrophil apoptosis was found to be dependent on both PI3K and NF-kappaB, but not p38 MAPK or MEK1/MEK2 activation. Using blocking Abs and a reporter cell line, we were able to exclude TLR4 as the receptor responsible for mediating RSV-induced delay in neutrophil apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effect was abrogated by preincubation with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine, indicating the requirement for endolysosomal internalization. Furthermore, addition of ssRNA, a ligand for the intracellular TLR7/TLR8, also inhibited neutrophil apoptosis, suggesting that intracellular TLRs could be involved in induction of the antiapoptotic effect. Using the BioPlex cytokine detection assay (Bio-Rad), we found that IL-6 was present in supernatants from RSV-exposed neutrophils. IL-6 was found to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis, suggesting that there is an autocrine or paracrine antiapoptotic role for IL-6. Finally, RSV treatment of neutrophils resulted in increased expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1. Taken together, our findings suggest involvement of multiple intracellular mechanisms responsible for RSV-induced survival of granulocytes and point toward a role for intracellular TLRs in mediating these effects.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have isolated 70Z/3 variants divergent in their capacity to lead to morbidity after injections. One variant, 70Z/3-NL, elicits an immune response protecting the animal from tumor growth. Another variant, 70Z/3-L, does not induce an effective immune response and causes morbidity. We demonstrated that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are required for the rejection of 70Z/3-NL cells. Interestingly, the immune response generated against 70Z/3-NL cells was found to protect against a challenge with the lethal variant, 70Z/3-L. This indicates that although both lines can be recognized and killed by the immune system, only 70Z/3-NL is capable of inducing a protective response. Further observations, using subclones isolated from 70Z/3-NL, demonstrated that immune recognition of a portion of the cells was sufficient for protection. Depletion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in animals injected previously with 70Z/3-NL cells showed that T cells, and not Abs, were required for the maintenance of the protection initiated by 70Z/3-NL.

Epub 2006 Apr 18.,"Aberrant expression of 1 or more transcription factor oncogenes is a critical component of the molecular pathogenesis of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, oncogenic transcriptional programs downstream of T-ALL oncogenes are mostly unknown. TAL1/SCL is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor oncogene aberrantly expressed in 60% of human T-ALLs. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip to identify 71 direct transcriptional targets of TAL1/SCL. Promoters occupied by TAL1 were also frequently bound by the class I bHLH proteins E2A and HEB, suggesting that TAL1/E2A as well as TAL1/HEB heterodimers play a role in transformation of T-cell precursors. Using RNA interference, we demonstrated that TAL1 is required for the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype in Jurkat cells and showed that TAL1 binding can be associated with either repression or activation of genes whose promoters occupied by TAL1, E2A, and HEB. In addition, oligonucleotide microarray analysis of RNA from 47 primary T-ALL samples showed specific expression signatures involving TAL1 targets in TAL1-expressing compared with -nonexpressing human T-ALLs. Our results indicate that TAL1 may act as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator (activator and repressor) at the top of a complex regulatory network that disrupts normal T-cell homeostasis and contributes to leukemogenesis.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '142661-93-6 (TCF12 protein, human)']",,,20060418,"['DK68655/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114589-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK070813/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HG002668/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA109901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1895859,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 18.,"The absence of mutations in the IgV genes, together with the presence of ZAP-70 and CD38, are the most reliable negative prognostic markers for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Several lines of evidence indicate that CD38 may be not only a diagnostic marker but also a key element in the pathogenetic network in CLL. First, CD38 is a receptor that induces proliferation and increases survival of CLL cells. Second, CD38 signals start upon interaction with the CD31 ligand expressed by stromal and nurse-like cells. Third, CD38/CD31 contacts up-regulate CD100, a semaphorin involved in sustaining CLL growth. Fourth, evidence that nurselike cells express high levels of CD31 and plexin-B1, the high-affinity ligand for CD100, offers indirect confirmation for this model of receptor cross-talk. Elements of variation in the clinical course of CD38(+) CLL patients include (1) potential intersection with ZAP-70, a kinase involved in the CD38 signaling pathway in T and natural killer (NK) cells, and (2) the effects of genetic polymorphisms of the receptors involved, at least of CD38 and CD31. Consequently, CD38 together with ZAP-70 appear to be the key elements of a coreceptor pathway that may sustain the signals mediated by the B-cell receptor and potentially by chemokines and their receptors. This would result in acquisition of increased survival potential, providing clues to the poorer prognosis of CD38(+) patients.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD100 antigen)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Semaphorins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",123,,20060418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control ES cell self-renewal and differentiation, a comprehensive knowledge of the molecules involved in these processes is required. Here we describe an effective approach for genomewide identification of functionally active genes in ES cells. This approach combines genetic screens based on cDNA libraries with microarray detection methods to permit high-throughput functional analyses. We implement this strategy to identify genes whose overexpression can maintain phenotypic properties of undifferentiated mouse ES cells under differentiation-inducing conditions, specifically in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. The identified genes encode a variety of regulatory proteins whose function in ES cells was previously unknown. Moreover, our approach is capable of detecting genes whose overexpression promote differentiation or cell death. Overall, our studies establish a methodology for highly sensitive identification of genes that confer particular phenotypes on ES cells.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",,,20060418,,PMC1458999,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 18.,"Cell microencapsulation is likely to play a major role in cell and transplantation therapies in the next decade. The microcapsules provide a special microenvironment in which cells always have different behaviors compared with free non-encapsulated culture. In this work, the behaviors of K562 leukemia cells were studied once entrapped in solid and liquefied APA microcapsules as well as in free non-encapsulated culture. Glucose pulse culture was employed to characterize the growth and metabolism of microencapsulated K562 cells. And mathematical modeling was presented to develop a basis for the deeper understanding of cells responses to different culture environments. Based on the results of experiments and modeling, it was found that cells presented a better growing pattern and maintain the activity at a higher level for extending time. The concentration of lactate was higher in solid microcapsules culture than that of liquefied microcapsules culture, but the cell number was lower. And the lactate yield coefficients (lactate/glucose) were 0.8129, 0.6978 and 0.601 for free non-encapsulated, solid microcapsules and liquefied microcapsules culture, respectively. An increase of glucose concentration led a decrease of cell activity, The glucose consumption ratio were 99.9%, 86.8%, 49.4% and 28.6% with the decrease in its concentration from 2 to 4, 6, 10 g/L, however, the lactate yield coefficient were 0.7184, 0.6654, 0.8239 and 0.9693, respectively.","['0 (Alginates)', '0 (Capsules)', '0 (alginate-polylysine-alginate)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,20060418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the expression of TNF-alpha in IgM(+) B-cells from BLV-infected sheep with or without lymphocytosis was determined. Freshly isolated IgM(+) B-cells from three sheep with lymphocytosis constitutively transcribed TNF-alpha mRNA. Although TNF-alpha mRNA expression in IgM(+) B-cells was transiently up-regulated after cell culture, TNF-alpha mRNA expression was markedly higher in lymphocytotic sheep when compared to that of non-lymphocytotic sheep or uninfected sheep. Expression of membrane-bound TNF-alpha on IgM(+) B-cells was also augmented in lymphocytotic sheep.

Thirty-one invited speakers from seven different countries participated in the conference, which was attended by more than 300 individuals from 23 countries. As in previous years, a clinical symposium for patients, held the day before the symposium, was sponsored by the Cancer Research and Treatment Fund, Inc., New York, NY 10021. This meeting report provides a summary of the five sessions prepared and highlighted by one of the session chairs. In addition to the formal presentations on the biology, clinical aspects and management of these diverse marrow stem cell disorders, there was considerable interest generated because of the availability of several new agents that have been recently approved. A special luncheon satellite symposium was devoted to the dramatic changes in the therapeutic options for the myelodysplastic syndromes, sponsored by MGI Pharma, Inc. The keynote address was presented by Dr. George Q. Daley from Harvard Medical School and the Children's Hospital Medical Center. He reviewed the molecular steps in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome and some of the newly described mutations leading to resistance to chemotherapy (see Section 4).",,,,20060418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used RT-PCR to analyse the expression of three D52-like genes in bone marrow at the time of ALL or AML diagnosis in children. Whereas D53 transcripts were undetectable in all samples, D52 and D54 transcripts were frequently detected in ALL and AML, where they were frequently co-expressed. While D52 and D54 transcripts were detected in T-ALL and pre-B ALL at comparable frequencies, D52 was less frequently detected in ALL bone marrow with hyperdiploid karyotypes, compared with samples with normal karyotypes. We also found that total RNA yields significantly differed according to D52 and D54 expression status, and that bone marrow freezer storage time (up to 945 days) differed significantly according to D52 expression status.

Epub 2006 Apr 18.,"We have used a recombinant mouse pre-B cell line (TonB210.1, expressing Bcr/Abl under the control of an inducible promoter) and several human leukemia cell lines to study the effect of high tyrosine kinase activity on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist-stimulated cellular Ca(2+) release and store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). After induction of Bcr/Abl expression, GPCR-linked SOCE increased. The effect was reverted in the presence of the specific Abl inhibitor imatinib (1microM) and the Src inhibitor PP2 (10microM). In leukemic cell lines constitutively expressing high tyrosine kinase activity, Ca(2+) transients were reduced by imatinib and/or PP2. Ca(2+) transients were enhanced by specific inhibitors of PKC subtypes and this effect was amplified by tyrosine kinase inhibition in Bcr/Abl expressing TonB210.1 and K562 cells. Under all conditions Ca(2+) transients were essentially blocked by the PKC activator PMA. In Bcr/Abl expressing (but not in native) TonB210.1 cells, tyrosine kinase inhibitors enhanced PKCalpha catalytic activity and PKCalpha co-immunoprecipitated with Bcr/Abl. Unlike native TonB210.1 cells, Bcr/Abl expressing cells showed a high rate of cell death if Ca(2+) influx was reduced by complexing extracellular Ca(2+) with BAPTA. Our data suggest that tonic inhibition of PKC represents a mechanism by which high tyrosine kinase activity can enhance cellular Ca(2+) transients and thus exert profound effects on the proliferation, apoptosis and chemotaxis of leukemic cells.","['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,20060418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 18.,"Drugs causing endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondrial dysfunction may trigger apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. The thiol reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) belongs to the first group whereas the protein kinases inhibitor staurosporine acts on mitochondria. Since the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis may converge in common steps, we examined the possibility of synergism between these two drugs. Using the activation of caspase-3 as indicator of apoptosis, we found that in two cell lines, Jurkat and Mono-Mac 6, staurosporine and DTT elicited apoptosis with a different pattern: staurosporine acted rapidly and at nanomolar concentrations while DTT acted slowly and at higher concentrations (1mM). When staurosporine and DTT were combined, the proapoptotic action was increased. This was confirmed examining late apoptotic events such as the translocation of phosphatidylserine across the plasma membrane and the cleavage of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. The use of subthreshold DTT concentrations and isobologram analysis demonstrated the synergic nature of the interaction. Tunicamycin, a drug that, like DTT, inhibits protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum also increased the proapoptotic effect of staurosporine. In agreement with the interplay between the mitochondrial and the endoplasmic reticulum pathways it was found that both staurosporine and DTT induced cytochrome c release. Furthermore, 90min incubation with DTT did not induce caspase-4 activation while staurosporine alone or in combination with DTT stimulated caspase-4 activity. We conclude that staurosporine is more active in cells undergoing endoplasmic reticulum stress. This synergism may warrant evaluation to establish whether the anticancer activity of staurosporine is also enhanced.","['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases, Initiator)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",,,20060418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred and forty-three untreated de novo AML patients were treated with HA based three drugs induction therapy. CR rate, DFS and OS were calculated. One hundred and eighty-four patients who had karyotype results were divided into four or three groups according to SWOG or MRC criteria respectively. Differences in CR rate, DFS and OS among different groups were evaluated. RESULTS: The CR rate of all the 243 cases was 77.4%. The median DFS of the 188 CR patients was 28.5 (ranged from 1.0 to 153.0) months, DFS rates at 3 and 5 years were 45.4% and 40.2% respectively. The median OS of the 243 patients was 18.4 (range from 0.5 to 154.0) months. OS rates at 3 and 5 years were 36.9% and 31.4% respectively. According to SWOG criteria, CR rate, median DFS and OS were 97.8%, 87.4 months and 89.0 months for the favorable group; 81.9%, 17.6 months and 22.3 months for the intermediate group; 61.5%, 9 months and 11.5 months for the adverse group; and 79.3%, 29.0 months, 19.9 months for the unknown group, respectively. The differences among the four groups were statistically significant (P < 0.001). According to MRC criteria, CR rate, median DFS and OS were 96.1%, 79.9 months, 72.2 months for the favorable group; 80%, 17.6 months, 19.7 months for the intermediate group; and 43.8%, 16.5 months, 12 months for the adverse group, respectively. The differences among the three groups were statistically significant excepting for DFS between intermediate and adverse groups. CONCLUSIONS: HA based triple-drug induction regimens are highly effective in obtaining higher CR rate and longer survival time.

METHODS: Generation of resistant K562 cell line K562/Vp16 overexpressing P-gp was achieved by exposure of K562 cells to stepwise increase of concentrations of Vp16. A small set of side population (SP) with the characteristics of stem cells being capable of efflux fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 in the cell line was isolated by flow cytometry. The mechanisms involved in K562/Vp16 SP cells resistant to imatinib were studied. RESULTS: The levels of BCR/ABL and ABL proteins in K562 cells were similar to those in K562/Vp16 non-SP and K562/Vp16 SP cells. The 170 KDa P-gp was detected in K562/Vp16 and K562/Vp16 SP cells at similar levels but not in K562 cells. Compared with K562/Vp16 non-SP cells, K562/Vp16 SP cells were more resistant to imatinib, which could hardly be reversed by many multidrug resistance inhibitors. In addition, in vivo study showed that the malignancy of K562/Vp16 cells was largely attributed to the SP cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bcr/Abl gene amplification and multidrug-resistant gene 1 (mdr1) overexpression might not be an important clinical mechanism in the diversity of resistance to imatinib treatment, and the development of drug resistance by leukemia cells may be at least partly due to a rare SP of tumor stem-like cells which drives leukemia occurrence and maintenance.

METHODS: Sixty-six patients with hematological diseases (40 cases of acute leukemia, 24 chronic myeloid leukemia, and one each severe aplastic anemia and beta-thalassemia) received bone marrow (BMT, n = 48) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT, n = 18) from HLA-compatible unrelated donors after BUCY or TBI conditioning. Forty patients received longer and intensive GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporin A from day -10 combined with mycophenolate mofetil). RESULTS: Sixty-four patients achieved sustained donor engraftment. The median time of leukocyte engraftment was 15 days, being significantly earlier in PBSCT group compared with BMT group (12 vs 16 days, P = 0.002). The cumulative incidence rates of grades I-II and III-IV acute GVHD at day 100 were 57.15% and 32.25%, respectively. Chronic GVHD was seen in 21 of the 36 evaluable cases and ten of them were extensive type. Six patients relapsed and 27 dead, the overall survival at 5 years was 52.91%. The COX method analysis showed that HLA-compatible level and source of graft affected the incidence of aGVHD. The patients transplanted from HLA-matched donor with high resolution and PBSCT had the less probability for aGVHD. Patients without GVHD or with longer and intensive GVHD prophylaxis had significantly improved OS. CONCLUSION: The key to improvement the outcome of HCT from unrelated donor is to reduce the incidence and severity of aGVHD by selecting the HLA-matched donor, intensifying the immunosuppression at the early stage of transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: WT1 mRNA level was detected with real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-PCR) technique in bone marrow samples from 15 normal subjects (NBM) and 123 AML patients. Sixty-two AML samples were also detected AML1-ETO mRNA expression by RQ-PCR. Simultaneously follow-up of WT1 and AML1-ETO levels were carried out in 50 samples from 8 AML patients. WT1 and AML1-ETO levels were normalized by internal control ABL gene. RESULTS: All correlation co-efficiencies were over 0.99 for WT1, AML1-ETO and ABL standard curves. Co-efficiencies of both interassay and intraassay variation were below 4%. The WT1 expression levels in NBM were 0.001 to 0.019 with a median level of 0.008. Higher levels of WT1 expression were found in 61 of 67 (91%) newly diagnosed AML patients compared with NBMs and 37 of the 67 (55.2%) showed 100-fold higher WT1 levels than that in NBMs. WT1 mRNA levels were highest in M(4EO) and M(3) and lowest in M(1) and M(5) patients. There was an excellent correlation between WT1 and AML1-ETO gene expression levels (r = 0.88, P < 0.001).

Lipodystrophic conditions are often associated with significant insulin resistance. The commonest acquired form occurs with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Other medical conditions and drugs also have the potential to cause chronic subcutaneous fat damage. CASE REPORT: We describe an unfamiliar partial lipodystrophy in a young woman, associated with markedly insulin-resistant diabetes, acquired following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for childhood leukaemia complicated by late sclerodermatous chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Clinical examination revealed scarring and lipodystrophy affecting mainly legs, thighs, buttocks and forearms but sparing her face, neck and thorax. Her serum adiponectin level was markedly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: However, although thiazolidinediones lower insulin resistance and increase subcutaneous peripheral fat in Type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone treatment had little effect on either serum adiponectin, glycaemic control or the lipoatrophy. In this case, effective glycaemic control was best achieved using a combination of metformin and highly concentrated soluble insulin injections.","['0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Insulin)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flavopiridol in combination with PRIMA-1 caused a synergistic increase in necrosis in the WT L1210 cells while LY 294002 in combination with PRIMA-1 caused a synergistic increase in apoptosis in the Y8 L1210 cells. These studies showed that PRIMA-1 had an effect not only on cells expressing mutant p53, but also on cells that do not express p53, suggesting that PRIMA-1 and PRIMA-1-like molecules have multiple sites of action independent of restoring p53 function and that these can interact with other signaling pathways involving CDK's and PI3 kinases.","['0 (Aza Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'GHC34M30BG (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1-azabicyclo(2,2,2,)octan-3-one)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two in vivo antitumor models, the murine P388 leukemia ascites tumor model and the human non-small cell lung cancer A549 solid tumor model, were used and cisplatin (CDDP), gemcitabine (GEM), irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11), fluorouracil (5-FU), paclitaxel (PTX) and docetaxel (DTX) were selected to be combined with TZT-1027. Regarding the schedule of combination administration, simultaneous administration and sequential administration (TZT-1027 first and combined drugs administered 24 h later, and vice versa) were employed. RESULTS: A significant increase in lifespan was observed when TZT-1027 was combined with CDDP, GEM and CPT-11 in the P388 cell ascites tumor model, and a significant inhibition of growth was observed when TZT-1027 was combined with CDDP, GEM and DTX in the A549 solid tumor model. Sequential administration, particularly when the combined drug was administered first, showed the most potent antitumor efficacy.

However, the drug has a short plasma half-life and causes toxic effects on normal proliferating cells. Conjugation with carriers is a possible way to alter these disadvantageous pharmacokinetics. Our aim was to synthesize dextran-MTX (D-MTX) conjugates, using carriers with molecular weights (Mw) ranging from 10 kDa to 500 kDa. Their in vitro and in vivo properties were compared with free MTX. The in vitro studies revealed that D-MTX conjugates had 4- to 10-fold lower antiproliferative effects against neoplastic cell lines compared to free MTX. There was a negative relationship between the Mw of the carrier and the antiproliferative effect of the respective conjugate. The data obtained in a mouse leukemia P388 in vivo model suggested that a lower in vitro antiproliferative effect of the conjugates does not result in diminished antileukemic activity in vivo. The toxicity of the conjugates was greater in comparison with the parent drug and tended to rise with increasing Mw. However, no superiority over free MTX in terms of an antileukemic effect was demonstrated. In particular, the D-MTX conjugate based on the dextran with Mw 10 kDa showed a comparable antileukemic effect with an even lower toxicity than that of free MTX. The data suggest that at least the toxicity of conjugates is dependent on the Mw of the carrier. This fact should be taken into account when designing new anticancer polymer-drug compounds.","['0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (dextran T70-methotrexate conjugate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cell lines derived from megakaryocytic leukemia are valuable reagents for studies on these events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new cell line, JAS-R, was established from a 64-year-old patient with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AML M7). Its characteristics were studied by morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular biological analysis. RESULTS: Immunophenotyping showed that the JAS-R cells were positive for CD33, CD41 and CD61, as well as moderately to weakly positive for CD4, CD7, CD13 and glycophorin A. Chromosomal analysis revealed a composite karyotype, but no major translocation abnormalities were observed. Electron microscopy disclosed that the JAS-R cells had numerous surface blebs and some cells also had alpha-granules and demarcation membranes. The mRNAs of 4 major proteins (platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, selectin-P and thrombospondin 1) found in alpha-granules were all expressed by the JAS-R cells. In particular, expression of platelet factor 4 was high. To further characterize JAS-R cells, comparison with 4 other megakaryo-etythroid cell lines (CMK, MEG-01, K562 and KU812) was done by gene expression profiling using an oligo-DNA microarray. The results showed that JAS-R was a distinctive cell line. It was noteworthy that the JAS-R cells secreted erythropoietin and expressed erythropoietin receptor. A neutralizing antibody for erythropoietin partly inhibited the proliferation of the cells.

Because of this cancer-related expression, survivin is a promising target for cancer therapy. To determine the expression and prognostic role of survivin in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we investigated the mRNA expression pattern of survivin and of the splice variants survivin-2B and survivin-DeltaEx3 in adult (n = 74) and children (n = 31) with de novo AML using RT-PCR. Survivin was the predominant transcript variant in AML cells, whereas significantly lower levels of survivin-2B and survivin-DeltaEx3 were observed (p < or = 0.0001). Neither expression of survivin nor of any splice variant correlated with maturation stage (FAB subtypes, immunophenotype) or cytogenetic risk groups. For AML cases treated according to AMLCG92 (adult) and AML-BFM93 (children) protocols, respectively, expression patterns were correlated with clinical data: in adult AML (n = 51), low expression of survivin-2B correlated with a better overall survival (p = 0.05; mean survival time 19 months vs. 9 months) and a better eventfree survival (p < or = 0.01; 27 months vs. 10 months). In childhood AML (n = 31), high survivin-DeltaEx3 expression was associated with a shorter overall survival (p < or = 0.05; 24 months vs. 43 months).

The t(2;3) was the sole anomaly in three patients, whereas in three cases monosomy 7, trisomy 15 and 22, and trisomy 14 represented additional aberrations. No cryptic chromosome deletions at 5q, 7q, 12p, and 20q were observed. One patient carried a FLT3 D835 mutation; FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) was not detected in three patients tested. Characterization of the translocation breakpoints using a 3q26 BAC contig specific for the PRDM3 locus showed that the breakpoints were located 5' to EVIl as follows: within myelodysplatic syndrome (MDS) intron 1 (# 3), between MDS1 exons 2 and 3 in three patients (# 1, 2, 4) with a 170bp cryptic deletion distal to the breakpoint in one (# 2), and in a more centromeric position spanning from intron 2 to the 5' region of EVI1 (# 6, 5). A set of 2p16-21 BAC probes showed that the breakpoints on chromosome 2p were located within BCL11A in two separate regions (# 1, 4 and # 2-5), within the thyroid adenoma-associated (THADA) gene (# 6) or distal to the ZFP36L2 locus (# 3). Regulatory elements were present in proximity of these breakpoints. RACE PCR studies revealed a chimeric transcript in 1/6 patient analyzed, but no fusion protein. Quantitative PCR showed a 21-58-fold over-expression of the EVIl gene in all cases analyzed. The patients showed dysplasia of at least two myeloid cell lineages in all cases; they had a low-to-normal platelet count and displayed an immature CD34+ CD117+ immunophenotype. Despite intensive chemotherapy and a median age of 43 years (range 36-59), only two patients attained a short-lived response; one patient is alive with active disease at 12 months, five died at 4-14 months. We arrived at the following conclusions: (a) the t(2;3) is a recurrent translocation having an approximate 0.5% incidence in adult AML; (b) breakpoints involve the 5' region of EVIl at 3q26, and the BCL11A, the THADA gene or other regions at 2p16.1-21; (c) cryptic deletions distal to the 3q26 breakpoint may occur in some cases; (d) the juxtaposition of the 5' region of EVIl with regulatory elements normally located on chromosome 2 brings about EVI1 overexpression; (e) clinical outcome in these cases is severe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 17.,"PURPOSE: Treatment with alemtuzumab has resulted in negative responses for minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In a prior analysis we demonstrated that it is possible to achieved MRD negativity, as assessed by polyclonality of immunoglobulin heavy chain after consolidation with alemtuzumab. This phase II study evaluated 34 patients with CLL who received alemtuzumab consolidation in an effort to improve the quality of their response to fludarabine-based induction. Subsequent peripheral blood stem-cell (PBSC) collection and transplantation, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics also were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients younger than 65 years who had a clinical response to fludarabine-based induction therapy received alemtuzumab 10 mg subcutaneously three times per week for 6 weeks. PBSCs were collected after mobilization with cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics study were taken between days 1 and 31. RESULTS: The complete response rate improved from 35% after fludarabine induction to 79.4% after alemtuzumab consolidation, including 19 patients (56%) who achieved MRD negativity. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions and fever. Cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred in 18 patients, all of whom were successfully treated with oral ganciclovir. PBSC collection was successful in 24 (92%) of 26 patients, and 18 patients underwent autologous PBSC transplantation. Alemtuzumab plasma concentrations increased gradually during the first 2 weeks and accumulated more rapidly thereafter. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneously administered alemtuzumab was effective, safe, and well tolerated as consolidation therapy in patients with CLL who responded to fludarabine induction therapy. Subsequent PBSCT was feasible thereafter.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,20060417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the activity of the Arf tumor suppressor is compromised, these donor cells initiate a much more highly aggressive and rapidly fatal disease. When mouse bone marrow cells expressing Bcr-Abl are placed in short-term cultures selectively designed to support the outgrowth of pre-B cells, only those lacking one or two Arf alleles can initiate lympholeukemias when inoculated into immunocompetent, syngeneic recipient mice. Although the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) provides highly effective treatment for BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, it has proven far less efficacious in the treatment of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), many of which sustain deletions of the INK4A-ARF (CDKN2A) tumor suppressor locus. Mice receiving Arf-/- or Arf+/- p210(Bcr-Abl)-positive pre-B cells do not achieve remission when maintained on high doses of oral imatinib therapy and rapidly succumb to lympholeukemia. Although cells expressing the Bcr-Abl kinase can proliferate in the absence of IL-7, they remain responsive to this cytokine, which can reduce their sensitivity to imatinib. Treatment of Arf-/-, p210(Bcr-Abl)-positive pre-B cells with imatinib together with an inhibitor of JAK kinases abrogates this resistance, suggesting that this combination may prove beneficial in the treatment of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,20060417,"['T32 CA070089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA071907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA70089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1440588,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Apr 17.,"The Mll gene is a member of the mammalian trithorax group, involved with the antagonistic Polycomb group in epigenetic regulation of homeotic genes. MLL contains a highly conserved SET domain also found in various chromatin proteins. In this study, we report that mice in which this domain was deleted by homologous recombination in ES cells (DeltaSET) exhibit skeletal defects and altered transcription of particular Hox genes during development. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and bisulfite sequencing analysis on developing embryo tissues demonstrate that this change in gene expression is associated with a dramatic reduction in histone H3 Lysine 4 monomethylation and DNA methylation defects at the same Hox loci. These results establish in vivo that the major function of Mll is to act at the chromatin level to sustain the expression of selected target Hox genes during embryonic development. These observations provide previously undescribed evidence for the in vivo relationship and SET domain dependence between histone methylation and DNA methylation on MLL target genes during embryonic development.","['0 (Histones)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",,,20060417,,PMC1440589,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AP-1 complexes participate in diverse biological processes that include cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. These seemingly contrasting functions have been attributed to the intensity and duration of the signals provided by AP-1, but the biological consequences of changing composition of the AP-1 complex have not been fully explored. Here, we show that functional AP-1 is required for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D)-induced monocytic differentiation, and that the composition of the AP-1 protein complex that binds TRE, its cognate DNA element, changes as cells differentiate. In HL60 cells in an early stage of differentiation, the principal AP-1 components detected by gel shift analysis include c-jun, ATF-2, fos-B, fra-1, and fra-2. In cells with a more established monocytic phenotype, the demonstrable AP-1 components are c-jun, ATF-2, jun-B, and fos-B. Following the addition of 1 nmol/L of 1,25D, the cellular content of each of these four proteins markedly increased in a sustained manner, whereas the increases in c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and jun-D were minimal, if any. Small increases in mRNA levels encoding all AP-1 component proteins, except c-fos, were also noted. These findings provide a basis for the previously found participation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in 1,25D-induced differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells, and direct attention to jun-B and fos-B as new cellular therapeutic targets, that may promote replicative quiescence associated with differentiation of malignant cells.","['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,"['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2820233,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS159973'],,,,

Cultures incubated with the compound showed >50% of sub-G1 (hypodiploid) elements in flow cytometry analysis; the apoptosis-inducing activity was evident at <10 micromol/L and half-maximal at about 40 micromol/L 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one. The appearance of hypodiploid elements was preceded by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and Smac/DIABLO and procaspase-3 cleavage. We subsequently investigated the effect of 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one in combination with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in the four cell lines. Suboptimal concentrations (10 micromol/L 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one and 0.25 ng/mL TRAIL, respectively) of the two agents, unable to elicit apoptosis when used alone, induced mitochondrial depolarization, activation of caspase-3, and 45% to 85% of sub-G1 elements when added together to the cells. The synergism seemed to rely partly on the enhanced expression of TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1; DR4), analyzed by immunofluorescence, by 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one. Cell incubation with 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one resulted in activating c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), as revealed by Western blotting; induction of apoptosis and TRAIL-R1 up-regulation by 1-methoxy-canthin-6-one were >80% prevented by the addition of the JNK inhibitor (JNKI) SP600125JNKI, indicating that both effects were almost completely mediated by JNK activity.

Hemangioblastomas are composed of neoplastic ""stromal"" cells of unknown origin, accompanied by intensive reactive angiogenesis. Failure to specify the cytologic origin of the stromal cell has precluded the development of nonsurgical therapies and limits understanding of its basic biology. We report that the stromal cells express proteins (Scl, brachyury, Csf-1R, Gata-1, Flk-1, and Tie-2) that characterize embryonic progenitor cells with hemangioblastic differentiation potential and conclude that embryonic progenitors with hemangioblast potential represent a possible cytologic equivalent of the stromal cell. We also identified a new autocrine/paracrine stimulatory loop between the receptor Tie-2 and the hypoxia-inducible factor target Ang-1, which, combined with previous observations, suggests that a variety of autocrine loops may be initiated in hemangioblastomas, depending on the differentiation status of the tumor cells and the extent of HIF downstream activation. Finally, the consistent identification of Scl in the stromal cells may help explain the unique and characteristic topographical distribution of hemangioblastomas within the CNS.","['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EQ43SC3GDB (Brachyury protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced expression of Id1 plays a key role in BCR/ABL-mediated cell invasion. Down-regulation of Id1 in BCR/ABL leukemia cells by the antisense cDNA significantly reduced their invasive capability through the Matrigel membrane and their ability to infiltrate hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic organs resulting in delayed leukemogenesis in mice. The Id1-promoted cell invasiveness was seemingly mediated by matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Transactivation of MMP9 promoter in BCR/ABL cells was dependent on Id1 and abrogation of the MMP9 catalytic activity by a metalloproteinase inhibitor or blocking antibody decreased invasive capacity of leukemia cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate (i) whether the IL-12Rbeta2 gene is silenced in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells, and (ii) what the functional implications of such silencing for tumor growth are. Here, we show that although mature B cells expressed both chains of the IL-12R, normal pro-B and pre-B cells failed to express the IL-12Rbeta2 chain. Similarly, primary tumor cells from pediatric pro-B, early pre-B, and pre-B ALL (30 cases) did not express the IL-12Rbeta2 chain. IL-12Rbeta2 gene silencing in B-ALL was found to depend on methylation of a CpG island in exon 1. Such methylation was not detected in normal early B cells that when differentiated into mature B cells expressed the IL-12Rbeta2 gene. Detection of IL-12Rbeta2 mRNA and protein in the tumorigenic 697 pre-B-ALL cell line allowed to perform functional experiments in severe combined immunodeficient/nonobese diabetic mice receiving 697 cells with or without human recombinant IL-12 (hrIL-12). hrIL-12 administration reduced tumor growth and metastasis through antiproliferative and proapoptotic rather than antiangiogenic, activities. In conclusion, epigenetic silencing of the IL-12Rbeta2 gene represents a novel mechanism of tumor escape for B-ALL cells.","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (IL12RB2 protein, human)', '0 (Il12rb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-12)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stem cells can be used from the bone marrow or blood of matched siblings or appropriately matched unrelated volunteers, but many patients do not have a suitably matched donor. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been successfully used as an alternative stem cell source. It has the advantage of tolerance for a degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) incompatibility not possible with adult bone marrow, resulting in greater likelihood of finding an appropriate match. UCB is also stored fully tested and cryopreserved, leading to rapid availability. Greatest clinical experience in UCB transplants has been in treating paediatric leukaemia. Results using well matched UCB grafts are equivalent or better than with unrelated bone marrow transplant. Cell dose and the degree of HLA matching are critical determinants in the success of UCB transplant. The use of UCB in older children and adult patients has been limited by the fixed, low cell dose available in a UCB unit, relative to recipient weight. This can be overcome by strategies such as using two or more UCB units. Early animal studies suggest that UCB may have the potential to differentiate into other cell types, including nervous tissue, and may in future play a role in the treatment of disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.",,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study reports the results of cord blood transplantation in 7 adults with hematological malignancies. RESULTS: Median age was 56 years (range, 43-69 years). HLA match was 4 of 6 in 4 cases and 5 of 6 in 3 cases. Median nucleated cell dose was 2.74 x 10(7) cells/kg (range, 2.13-3.80) and CD34+ cell dose was 1.15 x 10(5) cells/kg (range, 0.44-2.79). Three patients had primary graft failure. There was one early death at day 24 after CBT due to pneumonia. Three patients with engraftment are alive and free of disease at day 390, day 348 and day 164 after CBT. Acute GVHD grade II occurred in 2 cases with engraftment, and chronic GVHD occurred in 1 of 3 evaluable patients. Six patients with and without engraftment received more than 2.0 x 10(7) cells/kg nucleated cells. Three patients without engraftment received CD34+ cell dose less than that of 3 patients with engraftment. CONCLUSIONS: It is considered that graft CD34+ cell dose besides nucleated cell dose is important for engraftment. We believe that adult patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT by the choice of CB including both sufficient nucleated cell dose and CD34+ cell dose.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have prepared a polyclonal anti-mouse EKLF antibody suitable for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (IP) qualities, and used it to define the expression patterns of the EKLF protein during mouse erythroid development. We have also used this antibody for the chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. EKLF was found to bind in vivo at both the mouse beta-major-globin promoter and the HS2 site of beta-LCR in the mouse erythroleukemia cells (MEL) in a DMSO-inducible manner. The DMSO-induced bindings of EKLF as well as three other proteins, namely, RNA polymerase II, acetylated histone H3, and methylated histone H3, were not abolished but significantly lowered in CB3, a MEL-derived cell line with null-expression of p45/NF-E2, an erythroid-enriched factor needed for activation of the mammalian globin loci. Interestingly, binding of EKLF in vivo was also detected in the mouse alpha-like globin locus, at the adult alpha globin promoter and its far upstream regulatory element alpha-MRE (HS26). This study provides direct evidence for EKLF-binding in vivo at the major regulatory elements of the mouse beta-like globin gene clusters the data also have interesting implications with respect to the role of EKLF-chromatin interaction in mammalian globin gene regulation.","['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib have been shown to have direct cytotoxic effects on MM cells. We show that a selective inhibitor of p38alpha, SCIO-469, enhances the ability of MG132 and bortezomib to induce the apoptosis of MM cells. Previously, we showed that p38 inhibition with SCIO-469 enhances MM cytotoxicity of bortezomib by inhibiting the transient expression and phosphorylation of Hsp27, a downstream target of p38. Here we show that continued treatment of MM cells with bortezomib leads to a SCIO-469-enhanced downregulation of Hsp27 and to increased MM apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that p38 inhibition enhances the bortezomib-induced MM apoptosis by upregulation of p53 and downregulation of Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1. In a mouse xenograft plasmacytoma model of MM, we found that inhibiting p38 augments the effects of bortezomib in decreasing MM tumor growth in vivo. Thus, in addition to its role in suppressing an activated MM microenvironment, co-treatment with a p38 inhibitor, such as SCIO-469, may enhance the cytotoxicity of bortezomib by modulating pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors in MM cells, suggesting great potential for co-therapy.","['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (SCIO-469)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
