When cytogenetic studies are normal or insufficient, FISH may detect cryptic rearrangements, rare or slowly proliferative abnormal populations in non-mitotic cells. We cytogenetically evaluated 70 childhood ALL - 67.1% were found to have an abnormal karyotype. The 23 patients (32.9%) with a normal karyotype were analyzed by FISH applying two probes; TEL/AML1 and MYB which detect cryptic rearrangements of t(12;21)(p13;q22) and deletion of (6q) respectively, associated with a good prognosis. Out of 23 patients, one was positive for t(12;21)(p13;q22) (4.3%). None of our patients were positive for MYB del(6q). Two patients showed an extra signal for MYB on chromosomes other than 6 (8.6 %) indicating amplification or duplication. Findings were compared with the available literature. Our study clearly indicated the integrated FISH screening method to increase the abnormality detection rate in a narrow range. FISH is less useful for diagnostic study of patients with suspected del(6q) but it helps in detecting known cryptic rearrangements as well as identification of new abnormalities(translocation , duplication and amplification) at the gene level.","['Mazloumi, Seyed Hashem Mir', 'Madhumathi, D S', 'Appaji, L', 'Prasannakumari']","['Mazloumi SH', 'Madhumathi DS', 'Appaji L', 'Prasannakumari']","['Department of Pathology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'India', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",2012/10/27 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.8.3825 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(8):3825-7. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.8.3825.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High levels of CD44v6/v7 have been reported to be associated with invasiveness and metastasis of many malignancies. The objective of this study was to detect expression of CD44v6-containing variants in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and evaluate the potential of CD44v6/v7 for risk stratification. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by PCR product purification, ligation into T vectors and positive clone sequencing were used to detect CD44 v6-containing variant isoforms in 23 APL patients. Real-time quantitative PCR of the CD44v6/v7 gene was performed in patients with APL and in NB4 cells that were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide (As2O3). Sequencing results identified four isoforms (CD44v6/v7, CD44v6/v8/v10, CD44v6/v8/v9/v10, and CD44v6/v7/v8/v9/v10) in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 23 patients with APL. The level of CD44v6/v7 in high-risk cases was significantly higher than those with low-risk. Higher levels of CD44v6/v7 were found in three patients with central nervous system relapse than in other patients inthe same risk group. Furthermore, in contrast to ATRA, only As2O3 could significantly down-regulate CD44v6/v7 expression in NB4 cells. Our data suggest that CD44v6/v7 expression may be a prognostic indicator for APL.","['Chen, Ping', 'Huang, Hui-Fang', 'Lu, Rong', 'Wu, Yong', 'Chen, Yuan-Zhong']","['Chen P', 'Huang HF', 'Lu R', 'Wu Y', 'Chen YZ']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (CD44v6 antigen)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/27 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.8.3791 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(8):3791-4. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.8.3791.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical manifestations of TLS include hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. These indications if untreated lead to life-threatening complications such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and eventually death due to multiorgan failure.

Nilotinib is a very effective drug in the treatment of imatinib-sensitive or -resistant patients. Although very successful hematologic and cytogenetic responses have been obtained in nilotinib-treated patients, in recent years cases showing resistance to nilotinib have been observed. We aimed to examine the mechanisms underlying nilotinib resistance and to provide new targets for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). There was an up-regulation of antiapoptotic BCR/ABL, GCS and SK-1 genes and MRP1 transporter gene and down-regulation of apoptotic Bax and CerS1 genes in nilotinib-resistant cells. There was no mutation in the nilotinib-binding region of BCR/ABL in resistant cells. Inhibiton of GCS and SK-1 restored nilotinib sensitivity. Targeting the proteins that are involved in nilotinib resistance in addition to the inhibition of BCR/ABL could be a better method of treatment in CML.","['Camgoz, Aylin', 'Gencer, Emel Basak', 'Ural, Ali Ugur', 'Baran, Yusuf']","['Camgoz A', 'Gencer EB', 'Ural AU', 'Baran Y']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, I zmir Institute of Technology, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2012/10/27 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.737919 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jun;54(6):1279-87. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.737919.

Mcl-1 differs from other Bcl-2 members by its high turnover rate. Its expression level is tightly regulated by ubiquitylating and deubiquitylating enzymes. Interaction of Mcl-1 with certain Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only members of the Bcl-2 family can limit the access to Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3 and stabilizes the antiapoptotic protein. In addition, the overexpression of the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 9x (USP9x) can result in the accumulation of Mcl-1 by removing poly-ubiquitin chains from Mcl-1 preventing its proteasomal degradation. Analyzing radiation-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, we found that Mcl-1 was downregulated more efficiently in sensitive parental cells than in a resistant subclone. The decline of Mcl-1 correlated with cell death induction and clonogenic survival. Knockdown of BH3-only proteins Bim, Puma, and Noxa did not affect Mcl-1 level or radiation-induced apoptosis. However, ionizing radiation resulted in activation of USP9x and enhanced deubiquitination of Mcl-1 in the radioresistant cells preventing fast Mcl-1 degradation. USP9x knockdown enhanced radiation-induced decrease of Mcl-1 and sensitized the radioresistant cells to apoptosis induction, whereas USP9x knockdown alone did not change Mcl-1 level in unirradiated cells. Together, our results indicate that radiation-induced activation of USP9x inhibits Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis resulting in increased radioresistance.","['Trivigno, Donatella', 'Essmann, Frank', 'Huber, Stephan M', 'Rudner, Justine']","['Trivigno D', 'Essmann F', 'Huber SM', 'Rudner J']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'OCY3JCT44X (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Coumarins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/radiation effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteolysis/*radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.12598 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2012 Oct;14(10):893-904. doi: 10.1593/neo.12598.,,,,,PMC3479835,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We prospectively evaluated whether the consumption of aspartame- and sugar-containing soda is associated with risk of hematopoetic cancers. DESIGN: We repeatedly assessed diet in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). Over 22 y, we identified 1324 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), 285 multiple myelomas, and 339 leukemias. We calculated incidence RRs and 95% CIs by using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: When the 2 cohorts were combined, there was no significant association between soda intake and risks of NHL and multiple myeloma. However, in men, >/=1 daily serving of diet soda increased risks of NHL (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.72) and multiple myeloma (RR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.20, 3.40) in comparison with men who did not consume diet soda. We observed no increased risks of NHL and multiple myeloma in women. We also observed an unexpected elevated risk of NHL (RR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.51) with a higher consumption of regular, sugar-sweetened soda in men but not in women. In contrast, when sexes were analyzed separately with limited power, neither regular nor diet soda increased risk of leukemia but were associated with increased leukemia risk when data for men and women were combined (RR for consumption of >/=1 serving of diet soda/d when the 2 cohorts were pooled: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.02). CONCLUSION: Although our findings preserve the possibility of a detrimental effect of a constituent of diet soda, such as aspartame, on select cancers, the inconsistent sex effects and occurrence of an apparent cancer risk in individuals who consume regular soda do not permit the ruling out of chance as an explanation.","['Schernhammer, Eva S', 'Bertrand, Kimberly A', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Sampson, Laura', 'Willett, Walter C', 'Feskanich, Diane']","['Schernhammer ES', 'Bertrand KA', 'Birmann BM', 'Sampson L', 'Willett WC', 'Feskanich D']","[""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. eva.schernhammer@channing.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,"['0 (Dietary Sucrose)', '0 (Sweetening Agents)', 'Z0H242BBR1 (Aspartame)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspartame/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Carbonated Beverages/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dietary Sucrose/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sweetening Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ajcn.111.030833 [pii]', '10.3945/ajcn.111.030833 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2012 Dec;96(6):1419-28. doi: 10.3945/ajcn.111.030833.

METHODS: Over the past 9 years, 756 patients underwent haploidentical transplantation using a protocol developed by the authors, which combines granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-primed bone marrow (G-BM) and peripheral blood stem cells without in vitro TCD. The long-term outcome with this treatment modality was reported, and a risk-factor analysis was provided. RESULTS: Of these patients, 752 (99%) achieved sustained, full donor chimerism. The incidence of grades 2 through 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 43%, and the 2-year cumulative incidence of total chronic GVHD was 53%. The 3-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 18%. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse were 15% and 26% in the standard-risk and high-risk groups, respectively. Of the 756 patients, 480 survived throughout the follow-up period of 1154 days (range: 335-3511 days) with the 3-year leukemia-free survival rates of 68% and 49% in the standard-risk and high-risk groups, respectively. Lower leukemia-free survival was associated with high-risk disease status (P = .001), chronic myelogenous leukemia disease type (P = .004), neutrophil engraftment beyond 13 days after transplant (P = .012), and the occurrence of grades 2 through 4 acute GVHD (P = .019).

The systemic clearance (CL) of nilotinib was relatively low in rodents with a value of less than 25% of hepatic blood flow (Q(H)), while it was moderate in monkeys and dogs (CL/Q(H) = 32-35%). The steady state volume of distribution (V(ss) ) ranged from 0.55 to 3.9 l/kg across the species tested. The maximum concentration (C(max)) of nilotinib occurred at 0.5-4 h and the bioavailability was moderate (17-44%). The plasma protein binding was high (> 97.5%) in preclinical species and humans. The human CL (~ 0.1 l/h/kg) and V(ss) (~2.0 l/kg) were best predicted by the rat-dog-human proportionality method and allometric scaling method, respectively. The human intravenous pharmacokinetic profile was projected by the Wajima 'C(ss)-MRT' method. The predicted micro-constants from human intravenous profiles were incorporated into the advanced compartmental absorption and transit model within the GastroPlus program to simulate the oral concentration-time curves in humans. Overall, the simulated oral human pharmacokinetic profiles showed good agreement with observed clinical data, and the model predicted that the C(max) , AUC, t((1/2)) , V(z) /F and CL/F values were within 1.3-fold of the observed values.

Here we show that an active mutant of c-Kit cooperates with AML1-ETO to induce AML in mouse bone marrow transplantation models. Leukemic cells expressing AML1-ETO with c-Kit(D814V) were serially transplantable. Transplantation experiments indicated that lineage(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) (KSL) leukemic cells, but not lineage(+) leukemic cells, were enriched for leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Comparison of gene expression profiles between KSL leukemic and normal cells delineated that CD200R1 was highly expressed in KSL leukemic cells as compared with KSL normal cells. Upregulation of CD200R1 was verified in lineage(-) leukemic cells, but not in lineage(+) leukemic cells. CD200R1 expression in the lineage(-) leukemic cells was not correlated with the frequency of LSCs, indicating that CD200R1 is not a useful marker for LSCs in these models. Interestingly, CD200R1 was upregulated in KSL cells transduced with AML1-ETO, but not with other leukemogenic mutants, including c-Kit(D814V), AML1(D171N), and AML1(S291fsX300). Consistently, upregulation of CD200R1 in lineage(-) leukemic cells was observed only in the BM of mice suffering from AML1-ETO-positive leukemia.

AIM: To determine the frequency of invasive fungal diseases by analyzing lung secretion samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) tracheal aspiration (TA) and induced sputum (IS) were obtained from patients of five hospitals in the Valparaiso Region for the diagnosis of invasive or non-invasive fungal disease, and pneumocystis (PCP), in the period 2007-2010. Clinical data of patients was obtained reviewing medical records or interviewing attending physicians. The diagnosis considered the clinical condition of the patient (immunocompromised or prior lung damage), computed tomography imaging, direct microscopy and cultures. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria was used for the diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases. RESULTS: Ninety respiratory samples were received and 39 fungal infections were diagnosed. Eleven were probably invasive, seven were non-invasive and 21 were PCP. All patients with probable invasive disease had neutropenia. Most patients with non-invasive infections had bronchiectasis. Aspergillus fumigatus was the main causing agent in both invasive and non-invasive fungal diseases. Patients with PCP were mostly adults with AIDS and children with leukemia. The total mortality rate of patients with invasive fungal disease was of 73%. No deaths were recorded among patients with non-invasive disease. Among patients with PCP, three of 11 HIV and six of 10 non HIV subjects died. CONCLUSIONS: Aspergillus fumigatus predominates both in invasive and non-invasive pulmonary mycoses. The former has a high mortality. PCP occurred mainly in adult patients with HIV-AIDS.","['Cruz C H, Rodrigo', 'Vieille O, Peggy', 'Fuentes H, Daniela', 'Ponce E, Elliete', 'Piontelli L, Eduardo']","['Cruz C H R', 'Vieille O P', 'Fuentes H D', 'Ponce E E', 'Piontelli L E']","['Micologia y Microbiologia, Universidad de Valparaiso, Chile. rcruzchoappa@gmail.com']",['spa'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*classification/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/07/10 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-98872012000500006 [pii]', '10.4067/S0034-98872012000500006 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2012 May;140(5):595-601. doi: 10.4067/S0034-98872012000500006.,10.4067/S0034-98872012000500006 [doi] S0034-98872012000500006 [pii],,,,,,,,Micosis pulmonares en pacientes de la Quinta Region: Periodo 2007-2010.,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis signaling pathway of TRAIL is well characterized involving TRAIL receptors, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8. In contrast, the molecular mechanism of TRAIL signaling to NF-kappaB remains controversial. Here, we characterized the receptor-proximal mediators of NF-kappaB activation by TRAIL. Deletion of the DD of TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 revealed that it is essential in NF-kappaB signaling. Because FADD interacts with the TRAIL receptor DD, FADD was tested. RNAi-mediated knockdown of FADD or FADD deficiency in JURKAT T-cell leukemia cells decreased or disabled NF-kappaB signaling by TRAIL. In contrast, TRAIL-induced activation of NF-kappaB was maintained upon loss of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) or knockdown of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP). Exogenous expression of FADD rescued TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB signaling. Loss-of-function mutations of FADD within the RHDLL motif of the death effector domain, which is required for TRAIL-induced apoptosis, abrogated FADD's ability to recruit caspase-8 and mediate NF-kappaB activation. Accordingly, deficiency of caspase-8 inhibited TRAIL-induced activation of NF-kappaB, which was rescued by wild-type caspase-8, but not by a catalytically inactive caspase-8 mutant. These data establish the mechanism of TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB activation involving the TRAIL receptor DD, FADD and caspase-8, but not RIP1 or FLIP. Our results show that signaling of TRAIL-induced apoptosis and NF-kappaB bifurcates downstream of caspase-8.","['Grunert, M', 'Gottschalk, K', 'Kapahnke, J', 'Gundisch, S', 'Kieser, A', 'Jeremias, I']","['Grunert M', 'Gottschalk K', 'Kapahnke J', 'Gundisch S', 'Kieser A', 'Jeremias I']","['Research Group Apoptosis, Department of Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Center Munich-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Caspase 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012154 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.154 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Oct 25;3:e414. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.154.,10.1038/cddis.2012.154 [doi],20121025,,,PMC3481141,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, we showed that miR-26a was induced upon VitD3-mediated monocytic differentiation. Here, we identify E2F7 as a novel target of miR-26a. We show that E2F7 significantly promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits monocytic differentiation of AML cells. We also demonstrate that E2F7 binds the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) promoter repressing its expression. Moreover, interfering with E2F7 expression results in inhibition of c-Myc (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) transcriptional activity. This leads to the downregulation of c-Myc transcriptional target miR-17-92 cluster, whose expression has a well-defined role in contributing to block monocytic differentiation and sustain AML cell proliferation. Finally, we show that the expression of E2F7 is upregulated in primary blasts from AML patients. Thus, these findings indicate that the newly identified miR-26a target E2F7 might have an important role in monocytic differentiation and leukemogenesis.","['Salvatori, B', 'Iosue, I', 'Mangiavacchi, A', 'Loddo, G', 'Padula, F', 'Chiaretti, S', 'Peragine, N', 'Bozzoni, I', 'Fazi, F', 'Fatica, A']","['Salvatori B', 'Iosue I', 'Mangiavacchi A', 'Loddo G', 'Padula F', 'Chiaretti S', 'Peragine N', 'Bozzoni I', 'Fazi F', 'Fatica A']","[""Department of Biology and Biotechnology 'Charles Darwin' and Institute Pasteur Cenci-Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (E2F7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (MIRN26A microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'E2F7 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012151 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.151 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Oct 25;3:e413. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.151.,10.1038/cddis.2012.151 [doi],20121025,,,PMC3481138,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent matched unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation resulted in full engraftment and complete remission, with no evidence of AML or CLL.

Herein, we demonstrate that the PERK-eIF2alpha phosphorylation pathway is upregulated in CML cell lines and CD34+ cells from CML patients and is associated with CML progression and imatinib resistance. We also show that induction of apoptosis by imatinib results in the downregulation of the PERK-eIF2alpha phosphorylation arm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inactivation of the PERK-eIF2alpha phosphorylation arm decreases the clonogenic and proliferative capacities of CML cells and sensitizes them to death by imatinib. These findings provide evidence for a pro-survival role of PERK-eIF2alpha phosphorylation arm that contributes to CML progression and development of imatinib resistance. Thus, the PERK-eIF2alpha phosphorylation arm may represent a suitable target for therapeutic intervention for CML disease.","['Kusio-Kobialka, Monika', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka, Paulina', 'Peidis, Philippos', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka, Eliza', 'Wolanin, Kamila', 'Leszak, Grzegorz', 'Seferynska, Ilona', 'Stoklosa, Tomasz', 'Koromilas, Antonis E', 'Piwocka, Katarzyna']","['Kusio-Kobialka M', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka P', 'Peidis P', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka E', 'Wolanin K', 'Leszak G', 'Seferynska I', 'Stoklosa T', 'Koromilas AE', 'Piwocka K']","['Laboratory of Cytometry, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/*toxicity', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'eIF-2 Kinase/*metabolism']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['22387 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.22387 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2012 Nov 1;11(21):4069-78. doi: 10.4161/cc.22387.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical antileukemic activity of erlotinib as a standalone agent have not yet been precisely elucidated. Conversely, in preclinical settings, erlotinib has been shown to inhibit the constitutive activation of SRC kinases and mTOR, as well as to synergize with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacytidine (a reference therapeutic for a subset of leukemia patients) by promoting its intracellular accumulation. Here, we show that both erlotinib and gefitinib (another EGFR inhibitor) inhibit transmembrane transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), also in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that do not overexpress these pumps. Thus, inhibition of drug efflux by erlotinib and gefitinib selectively exacerbated (in a synergistic or additive fashion) the cytotoxic response of KG-1 cells to chemotherapeutic agents that are normally extruded by ABC transporters (e.g., doxorubicin and etoposide). Erlotinib limited drug export via ABC transporters by multiple mechanisms, including the downregulation of surface-exposed pumps and the modulation of their ATPase activity. The effects of erlotinib on drug efflux and its chemosensitization profile persisted in patient-derived CD34+ cells, suggesting that erlotinib might be particularly efficient in antagonizing leukemic (stem cell) subpopulations, irrespective of whether they exhibit or not increased drug efflux via ABC transporters.","['Lainey, Elodie', 'Sebert, Marie', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Scoazec, Marie', 'Bouteloup, Cyrielle', 'Leroy, Carole', 'De Botton, Stephane', 'Galluzzi, Lorenzo', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Kroemer, Guido']","['Lainey E', 'Sebert M', 'Thepot S', 'Scoazec M', 'Bouteloup C', 'Leroy C', 'De Botton S', 'Galluzzi L', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM, U848, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Female', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/therapeutic use/*toxicity']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['22382 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.22382 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2012 Nov 1;11(21):4079-92. doi: 10.4161/cc.22382.

Our goal is to measure the performance of imputation in predicting the genotype of the best known gene polymorphisms involved in drug metabolism using a common SNP array genotyping platform generally exploited in genome wide association studies. METHODS: Thirty-nine (39) individuals were genotyped with both Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP 6.0 (AFFY) and Affymetrix DMET Plus (DMET) platforms. AFFY and DMET contain nearly 900000 and 1931 markers respectively. We used a 1000 Genomes Pilot + HapMap 3 reference panel. Imputation was performed using the computer program Impute, version 2. SNPs contained in DMET, but not imputed, were analysed studying markers around their chromosome regions. The efficacy of the imputation was measured evaluating the number of successfully imputed SNPs (SSNPs). RESULTS: The imputation predicted the genotypes of 654 SNPs not present in the AFFY array, but contained in the DMET array. Approximately 1000 SNPs were not annotated in the reference panel and therefore they could not be directly imputed. After testing three different imputed genotype calling threshold (IGCT), we observed that imputation performs at its best for IGCT value equal to 50%, with rate of SSNPs (MAF > 0.05) equal to 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the genes involved in drug metabolism can be imputed with high efficacy using standard genome-wide genotyping platforms and imputing procedures.","['Mijatovic, Vladan', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Sazzini, Marco', 'Xumerle, Luciano', 'Mori, Antonio', 'Pignatti, Pier Franco', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Malerba, Giovanni']","['Mijatovic V', 'Iacobucci I', 'Sazzini M', 'Xumerle L', 'Mori A', 'Pignatti PF', 'Martinelli G', 'Malerba G']","['Dep, of Life and Reproductions Sciences, Sec, of Biology and Genetics - University of Verona, strada Le grazie 8, 37134 Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome, Human', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'HapMap Project', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics/*methods', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Software', 'Statistics as Topic/*methods']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/05/03 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-13-S14-S7 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-13-S14-S7 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2012;13 Suppl 14:S7. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-13-S14-S7.

Sixty-one articles were included and provided 135 families with a total of 341 participants distributed to various subtypes of MPN: 50% PV, 23% ET, 14% PMF, 10% CML and 3% non-MPN hematological disorder. Women developed the disease earlier than men (43.1 years vs 47.3 years; p = 0.074), while the general average age of onset was 46 years, notably younger than sporadic cases. The clinical phenotype of the families showed a homogenous (67%) and a heterogeneous (33%) pattern, with the majority being PV-PV pairs (36%) and PV-PMF pairs (17%), respectively. This observation suggests that the susceptibility gene (or genes) is not restricted to one subtype supporting the hypothesis of a mutation in an early multipotent stem cell. Furthermore, a major subgroup of families provided evidence of an autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance with reduced penetrance. This study suggests that the origin of MPNs may occur in at least three different settings: (i) a sporadic, (ii) genetic heterogeneity with polygenetic and environmental impact and (iii) a familial phenotype following an AD inheritance.","['Ranjan, A', 'Penninga, E', 'Jelsig, A M', 'Hasselbalch, H C', 'Bjerrum, O W']","['Ranjan A', 'Penninga E', 'Jelsig AM', 'Hasselbalch HC', 'Bjerrum OW']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. ajenthen@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Inheritance Patterns', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics']",2012/10/26 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2012/10/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cge.12044 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 2013 Feb;83(2):99-107. doi: 10.1111/cge.12044.

In rats, mucosal mast cells are exposed to parasites during the earliest stage of infection, affording an opportunity for mast cells to contribute to an innate response to infection. During secondary infection, degranulation of rat mucosal mast cells coincides with expulsion of challenge larvae from the intestine. The goal of this study was to evaluate the rat bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) and the rat basophilic leukaemia cell line (RBL-2H3) as models for mucosal mast cells, using parasite glycoproteins and antibody reagents that have been tested extensively in rats in vivo. We found that BMMC displayed a more robust mucosal phenotype. Although T. spiralis glycoproteins bound to mast cell surfaces in the absence of antibodies, they did not stimulate degranulation, nor did they inhibit degranulation triggered by immune complexes. Parasite glycoproteins complexed with specific monoclonal IgGs provoked release of rat mast cell protease II (RMCPII) and beta-hexosaminidase from both cell types in a manner that replicated results observed previously in passively immunized rats.

The cure rate of ALL is now above 80%. The clinical and biological characteristics of ALL that have been studied to date are of limited use in predicting the individual response. Newly developed methods for the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) are more helpful in this regard. METHODS: Review of pertinent literature retrieved by a selective search in Medline. RESULTS: MRD assessment has gradually been incorporated into ALL treatment planning over the past two decades. In the largest study to date of the use of MRD for this purpose, which included 3648 children with ALL, the MRD status on days 33 and 78 after the start of treatment was found to be the most important prognostic factor. The study group included 3184 patients with B-precursor ALL (leukemia consisting of immature B-lymphocytes), of whom a large subgroup (standard risk profile, 42%) had a seven-year event-free survival rate (7Y-EFS) of 91.1%; for the 6% of B-ALL patients with a high-risk profile, the cumulative rate of recurrence was 38.5 %.The remaining 464 patients had T-ALL (leukemia consisting of T-lymphocytes). The leukemia cells were eliminated more slowly overall in these patients than in those with B-ALL. Nonetheless, the T-ALL patients with a standard risk profile (16% of all T-ALL patients) had an excellent 7Y-EFS rate (91.1%), while the high-risk group (21% of all T-ALL patients) had an MRD recurrence rate of 37.7%. These findings are representative of current data from around the world on children and adults with ALL. CONCLUSION: MRD analysis enables more accurate prediction of ALL patients' response to treatment. Risk-group stratification by MRD assessment has already brought about considerable improvement in individualized treatment planning.","['Bartram, Claus R', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Kohler, Rolf', 'Schrappe, Martin']","['Bartram CR', 'Schrauder A', 'Kohler R', 'Schrappe M']","['Institute for Human Genetics, Heidelberg University, Germany. cr.bartram@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', '*Patient Care Planning', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3238/arztebl.2012.0652 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2012 Oct;109(40):652-8. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2012.0652.

ERG, an ETS-family transcription factor, is commonly over-expressed or translocated in leukaemia and prostate carcinoma. In this work, we selected the di-(thiophene-phenyl-amidine) compound DB1255 as an ERG/DNA binding inhibitor using a screening test of synthetic inhibitors of the ERG/DNA interaction followed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) validation. Spectrometry, footprint and biosensor-surface plasmon resonance analyses of the DB1255/DNA interaction evidenced sequence selectivity and groove binding as dimer. Additional EMSA evidenced the precise DNA-binding sequence required for optimal DB1255/DNA binding and thus for an efficient ERG/DNA complex inhibition. We further highlighted the structure activity relationships from comparison with derivatives. In cellulo luciferase assay confirmed this modulation both with the constructed optimal sequences and the Osteopontin promoter known to be regulated by ERG and which ERG-binding site was protected from DNaseI digestion on binding of DB1255. These data showed for the first time the ERG/DNA complex modulation, both in vitro and in cells, by a heterocyclic diamidine that specifically targets a portion of the ERG DNA recognition site.","['Nhili, Raja', 'Peixoto, Paul', 'Depauw, Sabine', 'Flajollet, Sebastien', 'Dezitter, Xavier', 'Munde, Manoj M', 'Ismail, Mohamed A', 'Kumar, Arvind', 'Farahat, Abdelbasset A', 'Stephens, Chad E', 'Duterque-Coquillaud, Martine', 'David Wilson, W', 'Boykin, David W', 'David-Cordonnier, Marie-Helene']","['Nhili R', 'Peixoto P', 'Depauw S', 'Flajollet S', 'Dezitter X', 'Munde MM', 'Ismail MA', 'Kumar A', 'Farahat AA', 'Stephens CE', 'Duterque-Coquillaud M', 'David Wilson W', 'Boykin DW', 'David-Cordonnier MH']","['INSERM UMR837-JPARC, Team 4, Molecular and Cellular Targeting for Cancer Treatment, University of Lille North of France, IMPRT-IFR114, Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Place de Verdun, Lille F-59045, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DB1255)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amidines/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Thiophenes/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gks971 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gks971 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan 7;41(1):125-38. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks971.

Clinical trials are also underway to assess the role of bortezomib in several other human malignancies, including leukemia. However, the mechanism(s) by which bortezomib acts remain to be fully understood. Here, we studied the molecular requirements of bortezomib-induced apoptosis using the human T-cell leukemic Jurkat cells stably transfected with or without shRNA against apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). The Apaf-1-deficient Jurkat T cells were resistant to bortezomib-induced apoptosis, as assessed by caspase-3 activity, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, phosphatidylserine externalization, and hypodiploid DNA content. In contrast, Apaf-1-deficient cells were sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis. Bortezomib induced an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and release of cytochrome c in cells expressing or not expressing Apaf-1. Transient silencing of Apaf-1 expression in RPMI 8402 T-cell leukemic cells also diminished bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-deficient Jurkat cells were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis yet remained sensitive to bortezomib. Our results show that bortezomib induces apoptosis by regulating pathways that are mechanistically different from those activated upon death receptor ligation. Furthermore, in silico analyses of public transcriptomics databases indicated elevated Apaf-1 expression in several hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia. We also noted variable Apaf-1 expression in a panel of samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our results suggest that the expression of Apaf-1 may be predictive of the response to proteasome inhibition.","['Ottosson-Wadlund, Astrid', 'Ceder, Rebecca', 'Preta, Giulio', 'Pokrovskaja, Katja', 'Grafstrom, Roland C', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Grander, Dan', 'Hedenfalk, Ingrid', 'Robertson, John D', 'Fadeel, Bengt']","['Ottosson-Wadlund A', 'Ceder R', 'Preta G', 'Pokrovskaja K', 'Grafstrom RC', 'Heyman M', 'Soderhall S', 'Grander D', 'Hedenfalk I', 'Robertson JD', 'Fadeel B']","['Division of Molecular Toxicology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nobels vag 13, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.080788 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.080788 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Jan;83(1):245-55. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.080788.

However, its role in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is unknown. In this study, we employed methylation-specific PCR to examine the methylation status of six Wnt antagonist genes in 144 MDS patients and in the MDS cell line SKM-1. We also used real-time PCR to examine the expression of Wnt antagonist genes and Wnt pathway genes in the SKM-1 cell line after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. We found that methylation of the gene promoters of each of the six genes were observed in MDS patients at the following methylation frequencies: 41 % for sFRP1, 89.6 % for sFRP2, 43.1 % for sFRP4, 50.7 % for sFRP5, 44.4 % for DKK-1, and 69.4 % for DKK-3. In the SKM-1 cell line, the gene promoters sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP5, DKK-1, and DKK-3 were methylated, while sFRP4 was not methylated. Treatment of the SKM-1 cell line with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced re-expression of methylated Wnt antagonists and inactivation of the Wnt pathway. Survival analysis showed that methylation status of sFRP1, sFRP4, and sFRP5 was associated with worse survival in MDS and sFRP5 methylation also predicted a high risk of leukemia evolution (P = 0.018). Our results indicate that epigenetic regulation of the Wnt pathway in MDS cell line, and the methylation status of Wnt antagonists predicts prognoses of MDS patients.","['Wang, Hong', 'Fan, Rong', 'Wang, Xiao-Qin', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Lin, Guo-Wei', 'Xu, Yang', 'Li, Wei-Yang']","['Wang H', 'Fan R', 'Wang XQ', 'Wu DP', 'Lin GW', 'Xu Y', 'Li WY']","['Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, No.188 Shi Zi Street, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (DKK1 protein, human)', '0 (DKK3 protein, human)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SFRP1 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP2 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP4 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP5 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Chemokines', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Eye Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'beta Catenin/analysis']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1595-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Jan;92(2):199-209. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1595-y.

In a more recent UK study the overall response rate for patients with aggressive ATLL treated with chemotherapy alone was 49 % compared to 81 % with combined first line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent or sequential ZDV/IFN). Combined first line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (p = 0.0081) and lymphomatous ATLL (p = 0.001).These data support the use of low dose ZDV/IFN with chemotherapy as first line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed aggressive ATLL.

In addition, we found that the presence of chromosomal abnormalities (mainly aneuploidy) in hematopoietic cells/MSCs was also associated with higher levels of AURKA. Different from previous investigations, our findings, regarding AURKA expression support the hypothesis that the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in MSCs from MDS is not a consequence of the method used for chromosome preparation. They may reflect the genomic instability present in the bone marrow microenvironment of MDS patients. This information is also supported by differences observed in the growth kinetics between MSCs from healthy donors (normal karyotype) and from MDS patients with abnormal karyotype. In summary, our results may not be considered evidence that MDS and MSCs are originated from a single neoplastic clone. In fact, both cells (hematopoietic and MSCs) may probably be altered in response to damage-inducing factors, and the presence of genomic abnormalities in MSCs suggests that an unstable bone marrow microenvironment may facilitate the expansion of MDS/leukemic cells.","['Oliveira, Fabio Morato de', 'Lucena-Araujo, Antonio Roberto', 'Favarin, Maria do Carmo', 'Palma, Patricia Vianna Bonini', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Falcao, Roberto Passetto', 'Covas, Dimas Tadeu', 'Fontes, Aparecida Maria']","['Oliveira FM', 'Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Favarin Mdo C', 'Palma PV', 'Rego EM', 'Falcao RP', 'Covas DT', 'Fontes AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

However, little is known about the prognostic significance of immunophenotypes in AML patients with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics. We evaluated immunophenotypes, cytogenetics, clinical features and survival outcomes in 233 uniformly treated AML patients who harbored unfavorable cytogenetics. CD11b expression was observed in 145 (70%) of 208 patients and emerged as an independent prognostic factor for inferior overall survival in multivariate analysis (p=0.024). MK and age >/= 60 years were predictors for lower complete remission rate (p=0.017, p<0.0001, respectively) and shorter overall survival (p=0.024, p<0.0001), while complex karyotype (CK) predicted a shorter overall survival (p=0.013). CD11b expression was strongly correlated with MK and identified a subset of patients with MK who had extremely poor overall survival. We proposed a prognostic scoring model using CD11b positivity, age >/= 60 years, the presence of MK and the presence of CK to classify the patients into distinct risk groups. We identified the poor prognosis of CD11b expression and validated the adverse influence of MK, CK and age >/= 60 years in cytogenetically unfavorable AML patients. Our proposed scoring model may be adapted in clinical practice to further the stratification of this high-risk population.","['Chen, Mei-Hsi', 'Atenafu, Eshetu', 'Craddock, Kenneth J', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Chang, Hong']","['Chen MH', 'Atenafu E', 'Craddock KJ', 'Brandwein J', 'Chang H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (CD11b Antigen)'],IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00392-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Feb;37(2):122-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.019.

Infant leukemia is a rare neoplasm and its association with maternal pesticide exposure has been poorly explored. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between pesticide exposure during pregnancy and leukemia in children < 2 years of age. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was carried out in 13 Brazilian states during 1999-2007. Mothers of 252 cases and those of 423 controls were interviewed. Information on pesticide exposures 3 months before pregnancy, throughout pregnancy, and during breastfeeding was obtained. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for associations between pesticide exposures and leukemia. RESULTS: Associations with ever use of pesticides during pregnancy were observed for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (aOR = 2.10; 95% CI: 1.14, 3.86) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (aOR = 5.01; 95% CI: 1.97, 12.7) in children 0-11 months of age, and with ALL (aOR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.05, 5.23) at 12-23 months of age. According to reported maternal exposure to permethrin, higher risk estimates were verified for children 0-11 months of age (aOR = 2.47; 95% CI: 1.17, 5.25 for ALL; and aOR = 7.28; 95% CI: 2.60, 20.38 for AML). Maternal pesticide exposure related to agricultural activities showed an aOR of 5.25 (95% CI: 1.83, 15.08) for ALL, and an aOR of 7.56 (95% CI: 1.83, 31.23) for AML. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that pesticide exposure during pregnancy may be involved in the etiology of acute leukemia in children < 2 years of age.","['Ferreira, Jeniffer Dantas', 'Couto, Arnaldo Cezar', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Koifman, Sergio']","['Ferreira JD', 'Couto AC', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Koifman S']","['Environment and Public Health Post-graduation Program, National School of Public Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', '*Maternal Exposure', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1103942 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2013 Feb;121(2):269-75. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1103942.

The selective Chk1 inhibitor SCH 900776 abrogates cytarabine-induced S-phase arrest and enhances cytarabine cytotoxicity in acute leukemia cell lines and leukemic blasts in vitro. To extend these findings to the clinical setting, we have conducted a phase I study of cytarabine and SCH 900776. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-four adults with relapsed and refractory acute leukemias received timed sequential, continuous infusion cytarabine 2 g/m(2) over 72 hours (667 mg/m(2)/24 hours) beginning on day 1 and again on day 10. SCH 900776 was administered as a 15- to 30-minute infusion on days 2, 3, 11, and 12. The starting dose of SCH 900776 was 10 mg/m(2)/dose. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities consisting of corrected QT interval prolongation and grade 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia occurred at 140 mg flat dosing (dose level 5, equivalent to 80 mg/m(2)). Complete remissions occurred in 8 of 24 (33%) patients, with 7 of 8 at 40 mg/m(2) or higher. SCH 900776 did not accumulate at any dose level. Marrow blasts obtained pretreatment and during therapy showed increased phosphorylation of H2Ax after SCH 900776 beginning at 40 mg/m(2), consistent with unrepaired DNA damage. CONCLUSIONS: These data support a randomized phase II trial of cytarabine +/- SCH 900776 at a recommended flat dose of 100 mg (equivalent to 56 mg/m(2)) for adults with poor-risk leukemias.

METHODS: MTT cytotoxicity assay was used to determine the growth inhibition activity of ginsenoside (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 and 1.5625 mumol/L) on HL-60 cells. The apoptosis of HL-60 cells after treatment with ginsenoside (0,5,10 and 20 mumol/L) was determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. The cleavage of total proteins by caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 was evaluated by Western blot. The cleavage of caspase-3 protein was detected by Western blot after treatment with 10 mumol/L ginsenoside and caspase-8 and 9 inhibitors. RESULTS: Ginsenoside had potent cytotoxicity on HL-60 cells, with an IC50 value of 7.3+/-1.2 mumol/L. After treatment with ginsenoside (0, 5, 10 and 20 mumol/L) for 48 hours, the apoptotic rate displayed a dose dependency, as shown by flow cytometry, with significant differences between the groups (F=12.67, P<0.01). Western blot showed that there were caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage bands, but without caspase-8 cleavage band. The specific inhibitor of caspase-9 Z-LEHD-FMK could block the caspase-3 cleavage induced by 10 mumol/L ginsenoside, but the specific inhibitor of caspase-8 Z-IETD-FMK did not have this effect. CONCLUSIONS: Ginsenoside can induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells, which may be related to a mitochondria-dependent pathway.","['Liu, Xiao-Meng', 'Cao, Jiao-Ling', 'Zang, Yu-Zhu']","['Liu XM', 'Cao JL', 'Zang YZ']","['Luoyang Vocational and Technical College, Luoyang, Henan 471000, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9/physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2012)10-0792-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2012 Oct;14(10):792-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Four different shRNA plasmids were designed and built to interfere with HOXA10 gene. The four interference plasmids were transfected into 293T cells with the HOXA10 over expression plasmid and then the RNAi efficiency of the four interference plasmids was determined by Western blot. The best one was chosen to transfect 293T cells with lentiviral helping plasmids to produce packaged lentivirus (lenti-shHOXA10). U937 cells were divided into interference group (lenti-shHOXA10), negative control group and untreated group. After infection with the packaged lentivirus, infection efficiency of lentivirus for U937 was detected by flow cytometry, and the expression of HOXA10 gene mRNA and protein was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot. Cell survival was determined by MTT assay. Apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Lentiviral-shRNA vector of HOXA10 gene was successfully constructed. Compared with the negative control and untreated groups, mRNA level of HOXA10 decreased by (92.3+/-1.3)%, protein levels decreased by 91.1%, and the inhibition rate of U937 cells [(43.9+/-0.7)%] increased in the interference group (P<0.05). Wright's staining showed that the ratio of karyon to cytoplasm was reduced and mitotic phase was rare in the interference group. Apoptosis rate in the interference group [(27.1+/-1.4)%] was significantly higher than in the negative [(19.4+/-1.9)%] and untreated groups [(5.5+/-1.3)%] (P<0.05).

Many miRNAs are located in genomic regions that are frequently deleted in cancer, or are subject to epigenetic and transcriptional deregulation in cancer cells. The miRNA transcriptome of cancer cells is very different from that of their normal cell counterparts. miRNAs can exhibit oncogenic or tumor suppressive or even both properties depending on the specific targets and cellular context. It is becoming increasingly clear that miRNAs not only serve as useful tumor biomarkers with implications for diagnosis, prognosis and the prediction of treatment responses, but may also be used for targeted cancer treatment and even as therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the tumor suppressor miRNAs and oncomiRs involved in the pathogenesis of leukemias and lymphomas, and their target transcripts in cancer signaling networks. In particular, we focus on the role of miRNAs in chronic lymphocytic and acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in B-cell lymphomas. In the second part, we review the various alternative strategies of targeting miRNAs in cancer therapy. Methods of oncomiR antagonization by antagomiRs or locked nucleid acids are contrasted with strategies that harness the tumor suppressive properties of certain miRNAs for cancer treatment. Preclinical progress, also with regard to delivery strategies, possible side effects and other pharmacological aspects, is presented along with results from the first human trials assessing the safety and efficacy of miRNA-targeting therapeutics.","['Schmid, Corina A', 'Craig, Vanessa J', 'Muller, Anne', 'Flori, Michael']","['Schmid CA', 'Craig VJ', 'Muller A', 'Flori M']","['Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*therapy', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/08/08 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20120925-4 [pii]', '10.2174/138161213804805649 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2013;19(7):1201-10. doi: 10.2174/138161213804805649.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately the initial striking efficacy of this drug has been overshadowed by the development of clinical resistance. A wide variety of molecular mechanisms can underlie such resistance mechanisms. In the recent years, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression has been reported as an important protective endogenous mechanism against physical, chemical and biological stress and this cytoprotective role has already been demonstrated for several solid tumors and acute leukemias. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of HO-1 expression on cell proliferation and apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia cells, K562 and LAMA-84 cell lines following imatinib treatment. Cells were incubated for 24h with Imatinib (1 muM) alone or in combination with Hemin (10muM), an inducer of HO-1. In addition, cells were also treated with HO byproducts, bilirubin and carbon monoxide (CO), or with a protease inhibitor (Ed64) to inhibit HO-1 nuclear translocation. Pharmacological induction of HO-1 was able to overcome the effect of imatinib. The cytoprotective effect of HO-1 was further confirmed after silencing HO-1 by siRNA. Interestingly, neither bilirubin nor CO was able to protect cells from Imatinib-induced toxicity. By contrast, the protective effect of HO-1 was mitigated by the addition of E64d, preventing HO-1 nuclear translocation. Finally, imatinib was able to increase the formation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and this effect was reversed by HO-1 induction or the addition of N-acetylcisteine (NAC). In conclusion, the protective effect of HO-1 on imatinib-induced cytotoxicity does not involve its enzymatic byproducts, but rather the nuclear translocation of HO-1 following proteolytic cleavage.","['Tibullo, Daniele', 'Barbagallo, Ignazio', 'Giallongo, Cesarina', 'La Cava, Piera', 'Parrinello, Nunziatina', 'Vanella, Luca', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe A', 'Li Volti, Giovanni', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Tibullo D', 'Barbagallo I', 'Giallongo C', 'La Cava P', 'Parrinello N', 'Vanella L', 'Stagno F', 'Palumbo GA', 'Li Volti G', 'Di Raimondo F']","['Department of Clinical and Molecular Biomedicine Section of Hematology, Ferrarotto Hospital, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Silencing', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20121018-11 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612811319150012 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2013;19(15):2765-70. doi: 10.2174/1381612811319150012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we analyzed MOTN-1 and PLT-2 cell lines established from different stages of a T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia patient (Daibata et al. 2004). MOTN-1 is IL-2-dependent derived from the chronic phase, whereas IL-2-independent PLT-2 is from the aggressive and terminal stage. They shared considerable chromosome abnormalities and the pattern of T-cell receptor rearrangement, presuming that the cytokine independence of PLT-2 was due to the additive genetic abnormality. Besides IL-2, IL-15 supported MOTN-1 cell growth, because these receptors share beta- and gamma-subunits. IL-2 activated ERK, AKT and STAT pathway of MOTN-1. STAT3 pathway of PLT-2 was also activated by IL-2, suggesting intact IL-2 induces signal transduction of PLT-2. However, ERK1/2 but not AKT, was continuously activated in PLT-2, consistent with the increased Ras-activity of PLT-2. Sequence analysis revealed KRAS G12A mutation but not NRAS and HRAS mutation of PLT-2 but not MOTN-1. Another signaling molecule affecting Ras-signaling pathway, SHP2, which has been frequently mutated in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), did not show mutation. Moreover, MEK inhibitor, PD98059, as well as farnesylation inhibitor inhibited PLT-2 cell growth. Using NIH3T3 and MOTN-1, ERK activation, increased cell proliferation and survival by KRAS G12A were shown, suggesting the important role of KRAS G12A in IL-2-independent growth of PLT-2. Taken together, KRAS G12A is important for IL-2-independent growth of PLT-2 cells and suggests the possibility of involvement of KRAS mutation with disease progression.","['Mizutani, Naoki', 'Ito, Hiromi', 'Hagiwara, Kazumi', 'Kobayashi, Misa', 'Hoshikawa, Asuka', 'Nishida, Yayoi', 'Takagi, Akira', 'Kojima, Tetsuhito', 'Suzuki, Motoshi', 'Osawa, Yosuke', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Daibata, Masanori', 'Murate, Takashi']","['Mizutani N', 'Ito H', 'Hagiwara K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Hoshikawa A', 'Nishida Y', 'Takagi A', 'Kojima T', 'Suzuki M', 'Osawa Y', 'Ohnishi K', 'Daibata M', 'Murate T']","['Division of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Department of Radiological and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nagoya J Med Sci,Nagoya journal of medical science,0412011,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",2012/10/25 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nagoya J Med Sci. 2012 Aug;74(3-4):261-71.,,,,,PMC4831235,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Massive hemoptysis (MH) with blood loss more than 300-600 ml in 24 hours is a rare (5-10% of IA patients) but frequently fatal complication. Standard treatment of MH, such as oxygenation, a semi-sitting position with the bleeding site down, bronchoscopical suctioning, antifungal therapy, transfusion support and surgical resection might be either ineffective or not feasible in some cases. OUTLINE OF CASES: We report two patients with life threatening, non-controlled, massive hemoptysis who were successfully managed by non-standard measures. A 61-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia developed pulmonary IA and massive hemoptysis after consolidation cure by chemotherapy. The bleeding site was localized in the VI lung segment by bronchoscopy. Local application of fibrinogen-thrombin concentrate (fibrin glue) stopped the bleeding. A 22-year-old female patient with the diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia developed IA and massive hemoptysis early after application of immunosuppressive therapy (antilymphocyte globulin, cyclosporine and corticosteroids). Conventional transfusion therapy, desmopresine and antifibrinolytics were ineffective. This urgent condition was successfully treated with human activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven). CONCLUSION: Our experience together with data from the available literature suggests a potential benefit of fibrinogen-thrombin concentrate and rFVIIa in the treatment of refractory critical bleeding in hemato-oncological patients.","['Mitrovic, Mirjana', 'Elezovic, Ivo', 'Suvajdzic-Vukovic, Nada', 'Antic, Darko']","['Mitrovic M', 'Elezovic I', 'Suvajdzic-Vukovic N', 'Antic D']","['Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia. mmg@beotel.net']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,"['0 (Fibrin Tissue Adhesive)', '0 (Hemostatics)', '9001-25-6 (Factor VII)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Factor VII/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fibrin Tissue Adhesive/therapeutic use', 'Hemoptysis/*therapy', 'Hemostatics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/25 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/10/25 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2012 Jul-Aug;140(7-8):505-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that DLX4 induces cancer cells to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through TWIST. Overexpression of DLX4 increased expression of TWIST expression in cancer cell lines, resulting in increased migratory and invasive capacity. Likewise, knocking down expression of DLX4 decreased TWIST expression and the migration ability of cancer cell lines. DLX4 bound to regulatory regions of the TWIST gene. Both western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining showed that the expression of DLX4 and TWIST are correlated in most of breast tumors. Taken together, these data from both cell models and tumor tissues demonstrate that DLX4 not only upregulates TWIST expression but also induces EMT and tumor metastasis.

Overall, the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear and human leukemia cell lines to bacteria supernatants containing listeriolysin O depended on the bacteria strain, target cell type, and supernatant concentration.","['Stachowiak, R', 'Lyzniak, M', 'Budziszewska, B K', 'Roeske, K', 'Bielecki, J', 'Hoser, G', 'Kawiak, J']","['Stachowiak R', 'Lyzniak M', 'Budziszewska BK', 'Roeske K', 'Bielecki J', 'Hoser G', 'Kawiak J']","['Department of Applied Microbiology, University of Warsaw, 02-096 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', 'R06ZRQ1YX9 (hlyA protein, Listeria monocytogenes)']",IM,"['Bacillus subtilis/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Toxins/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Hemolysin Proteins', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Listeria monocytogenes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/954375 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2012;2012:954375. doi: 10.1155/2012/954375.

We designed and used simplified mRT-PCR system as a molecular screen for acute leukemia.

A total of 121 diagnostic acute leukemia specimens were studied, comparing the mRT-PCR system with standard cytogenetics. Fifty-six cases (46.3%) had fusion transcripts revealed by our mRT-PCR assay. The concordance rate between mRT-PCR and cytogenetics was 91.7%. However, false negative results were found in three cases who have inv(16), t(4;11) or t(11;19)(q23;p13.1), respectively. Seven cryptic translocations including ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-MLLT3, MLL-MLLT4, and PML-RARA were detected.

However, the functions of Meis1 in hematopoiesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we found that Meis1 is required for the maintenance of hematopoiesis under stress and over the long term, whereas steady-state hematopoiesis was sustained in the absence of Meis1 in inducible knock-out mice. BM cells of Meis1-deficient mice showed reduced colony formation and contained significantly fewer numbers of long-term HSCs, which exhibited loss of quiescence. Further, we found that Meis1 deletion led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in HSCs and decreased expression of genes implicated in hypoxia response. Finally, reactive oxygen species scavenging by N-acetyl cysteine or stabilization of hypoxia signaling by knockdown of the von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein led to reversal of the effects of Meis1 deletion. The results of the present study demonstrate that Meis1 protects and preserves HSCs by restricting oxidative metabolism.","['Unnisa, Zeenath', 'Clark, Jason P', 'Roychoudhury, Jayeeta', 'Thomas, Elizabeth', 'Tessarollo, Lino', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Kumar, Ashish R']","['Unnisa Z', 'Clark JP', 'Roychoudhury J', 'Thomas E', 'Tessarollo L', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA', 'Grimes HL', 'Kumar AR']","[""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45236, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49836-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-435800 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 13;120(25):4973-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-435800.

To investigate whether and to what extent different clone sizes influence disease and relapse development, we quantified the genomic P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion product and correlated it with the corresponding CRLF2 expression levels in patients enrolled in the BFM-ALL 2000 protocol in Austria. Of 268 cases without recurrent chromosomal translocations and high hyperdiploidy, representing approximately 50% of all cases, 67 (25%) were P2RY8-CRLF2 positive. The respective clone sizes were >/= 20% in 27% and < 20% in 73% of them. The cumulative incidence of relapse of the entire fusion-positive group was clone size independent and significantly higher than that of the fusion-negative group (35% +/- 8% vs 13% +/- 3%, P = .008) and primarily confined to the non-high-risk group. Of 22 P2RY8-CRLF2-positive diagnosis/relapse pairs, only 4/8 had the fusion-positive dominant clone conserved at relapse, whereas none of the original 14 fusion-positive small clones reappeared as the dominant relapse clone. We conclude that the majority of P2RY8-CRLF2-positive clones are small at diagnosis and virtually never generate a dominant relapse clone. Our findings therefore suggest that P2RY8-CRLF2-positive clones do not have the necessary proliferative or selective advantage to evolve into a disease-relevant relapse clone.","['Morak, Maria', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Fischer, Susanna', 'Nassimbeni, Christine', 'Grausenburger, Reinhard', 'Bastelberger, Stephan', 'Krentz, Stefanie', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Kasper, David', 'Schmitt, Klaus', 'Russell, Lisa J', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Eckert, Conny', 'Mann, Georg', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate']","['Morak M', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Fischer S', 'Nassimbeni C', 'Grausenburger R', 'Bastelberger S', 'Krentz S', 'Cario G', 'Kasper D', 'Schmitt K', 'Russell LJ', 'Potschger U', 'Stanulla M', 'Eckert C', 'Mann G', 'Haas OA', 'Panzer-Grumayer R']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (P2RY8 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Size', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics/*physiology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/02/16 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47436-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-07-443218 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 20;120(26):5134-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-07-443218.

However, the yield from these recommendations is not known. METHODS: Survivors underwent COG-LTFU Guideline-directed screening. Yield was classified as negligible/negative (< 1%), intermediate (>/= 1% to < 10%), or high (>/= 10%). For long-term complications with high yield, logistic regression was used to identify subgroups more likely to screen positive. RESULTS: Over the course of 1,188 clinic visits, 370 childhood cancer survivors (53% male; 47% Hispanic; 69% leukemia/lymphoma survivors; median age at diagnosis, 11.1 years [range, 0.3 to 21.9 years]; time from diagnosis, 10.5 years [range, 5 to 55.8 years]) underwent 4,992 screening tests. High-yield tests included thyroid function (hypothyroidism, 10.1%), audiometry (hearing loss, 22.6%), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans (low bone mineral density [BMD], 23.2%), serum ferritin (iron overload, 24.0%), and pulmonary function testing/chest x-ray (pulmonary dysfunction, 84.1%). Regression analysis failed to identify subgroups more likely to result in high screening yield, with the exception of low BMD (2.5-fold increased risk for males [P = .04]; 3.3-fold increased risk for nonobese survivors [P = .01]). Screening tests with negligible/negative (< 1%) yield included complete blood counts (therapy-related leukemia), dipstick urinalysis for proteinuria and serum blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (glomerular defects), microscopic urinalysis for hematuria (hemorrhagic cystitis, bladder cancer), ECG (anthracycline-related conduction disorder), and hepatitis B and HIV serology. CONCLUSION: Screening tests with a high yield are appropriate for risk groups targeted for screening by the COG-LTFU Guidelines.

We assessed their impact in the context of a prospective randomized trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the ATM gene in 224 patients treated on the Leukemia Research Fund Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 4 (LRF-CLL4) trial with chlorambucil or fludarabine with and without cyclophosphamide. ATM status was analyzed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and was related to treatment response, survival, and the impact of TP53 alterations for the same patient cohort. RESULTS: We identified 36 ATM mutations in 33 tumors, 16 with and 17 without 11q deletion. Mutations were associated with advanced disease stage and involvement of multiple lymphoid sites. Patients with both ATM mutation and 11q deletion showed significantly reduced progression-free survival (median, 7.4 months) compared with those with ATM wild type (28.6 months), 11q deletion alone (17.1 months), or ATM mutation alone (30.8 months), but survival was similar to that in patients with monoallelic (6.7 months) or biallelic (3.4 months) TP53 alterations. This effect was independent of treatment, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) status, age, sex, or disease stage. Overall survival for patients with biallelic ATM alterations was also significantly reduced compared with those with ATM wild type or ATM mutation alone (median, 42.2 v 85.5 v 77.6 months, respectively). CONCLUSION: The combination of 11q deletion and ATM mutation in CLL is associated with significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival following first-line treatment with alkylating agents and purine analogs. Assessment of ATM mutation status in patients with 11q deletion may influence the choice of subsequent therapy.","['Skowronska, Anna', 'Parker, Anton', 'Ahmed, Gulshanara', 'Oldreive, Ceri', 'Davis, Zadie', 'Richards, Sue', 'Dyer, Martin', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Gonzalez, David', 'Taylor, A Malcolm R', 'Moss, Paul', 'Thomas, Peter', 'Oscier, David', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Skowronska A', 'Parker A', 'Ahmed G', 'Oldreive C', 'Davis Z', 'Richards S', 'Dyer M', 'Matutes E', 'Gonzalez D', 'Taylor AM', 'Moss P', 'Thomas P', 'Oscier D', 'Stankovic T']","['University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'United Kingdom', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.41.0852 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.41.0852 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Dec 20;30(36):4524-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.41.0852.

DIAGNOSIS: CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson oncogene (ABL) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. FRONTLINE THERAPY: Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with 2nd generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses; their impact on long-term survival remains to be determined. SALVAGE THERAPY: For patients who fail standard-dose imatinib therapy, imatinib dose escalation is a second-line option. Alternative second-line options include 2nd generation TKIs. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs and are candidate for clinical trials. Allogeneic transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for CML-CP harboring the T315I mutation, patients who fail 2nd generation TKIs, and for all patients in advanced phase disease.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ejabbour@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23282 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Nov;87(11):1037-45. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23282.,10.1002/ajh.23282 [doi],,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed records of 767 patients treated at Moffitt Cancer Center between January 2001 and December 2009 to evaluate the relationship between serum albumin (SA) at the time of presentation and overall survival (OS). Patients (median age of 69 years) were stratified into three groups based on SA concentration (</=3.5, 3.6-4.0, and >4.0 g/dL). Two-thirds of the patients had low or intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-based risk for MDS. Median OS by SA concentration of </=3.5, 3.6-4.0, and >4.0 g/dL was 11, 23, and 34 months, respectively (P < 0.005), whereas rate of acute myeloid leukemia progression was highest in patients with low SA (</=3.5 g/dL). The SA level offered prognostic discrimination for outcomes within the lower and higher IPSS risk groups, as well as with the MD Anderson risk model. In multivariable analysis, SA was a significant independent co-variate for OS after adjustment for IPSS, age, serum ferritin, and transfusion dependence (hazard ratio = 0.8; 95% CI 0.6-0.9; P = 0.004). Our findings indicate that hypoalbuminemia is an independent prognostic biomarker that may serve as a surrogate representative of disease biology or comorbidities in patients with MDS.","['Komrokji, Rami S', 'Corrales-Yepez, Maria', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Al Ali, Najla H', 'Padron, Eric', 'Rollison, Dana E', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'List, Alan F']","['Komrokji RS', 'Corrales-Yepez M', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Al Ali NH', 'Padron E', 'Rollison DE', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Zhang L', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Lancet JE', 'List AF']","['H.

Compounds targeting the mTOR active site inhibit rapamycin-resistant functions and have enhanced anticancer activity in mouse models. MLN0128 (formerly known as INK128) is a novel, orally active mTOR kinase inhibitor currently in clinical development. Here, we evaluated MLN0128 in preclinical models of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). MLN0128 suppressed proliferation of B-ALL cell lines in vitro and reduced colony formation by primary human leukemia cells from adult and pediatric B-ALL patients. MLN0128 also boosted the efficacy of dasatinib (DA) in Philadelphia Chromosome-positive (Ph+) specimens. In a syngeneic mouse model of lymphoid BCR-ABL+ disease, daily oral dosing of MLN0128 rapidly cleared leukemic outgrowth. In primary xenografts of Ph+ B-ALL specimens, MLN0128 significantly enhanced the efficacy of DA. In non-Ph B-ALL xenografts, single agent MLN0128 had a cytostatic effect that was most pronounced in mice with low disease burden. In all in vivo models, MLN0128 was well tolerated and did not suppress endogenous bone marrow proliferation. These findings support the rationale for clinical testing of MLN0128 in both adult and pediatric B-ALL and provide insight towards optimizing therapeutic efficacy of mTOR kinase inhibitors.","['Janes, M R', 'Vu, C', 'Mallya, S', 'Shieh, M P', 'Limon, J J', 'Li, L-S', 'Jessen, K A', 'Martin, M B', 'Ren, P', 'Lilly, M B', 'Sender, L S', 'Liu, Y', 'Rommel, C', 'Fruman, D A']","['Janes MR', 'Vu C', 'Mallya S', 'Shieh MP', 'Limon JJ', 'Li LS', 'Jessen KA', 'Martin MB', 'Ren P', 'Lilly MB', 'Sender LS', 'Liu Y', 'Rommel C', 'Fruman DA']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzoxazoles)', '0 (INK128)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Benzoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012276 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.276 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):586-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.276.

Reports on disease characteristics and outcome of older patients are conflicting. We therefore analyzed 91 newly diagnosed APL patients aged 60 years or older (30 % of 305 adults with APL) registered by the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG) since 1994; 68 patients (75 %) were treated in studies, 23 (25 %) were non-eligible, and 31 % had high-risk APL. Fifty-six patients received induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid and TAD (6-thioguanine, cytarabine, daunorubicin), and consolidation and maintenance therapy. Treatment intensification with a second induction cycle (high dose cytarabine, mitoxantrone; HAM) was optional (n = 14). Twelve patients were randomized to another therapy not considered in this report. The early death rate was 48 % in non-eligible and 19 % in study patients. With the AMLCG regimen, 7-year overall, event-free and relapse-free survival (RFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse were 45 %, 40 %, 48 %, and 24 %, respectively. In patients treated with TAD-HAM induction, 7-year RFS was superior (83 %; p = 0.006) compared to TAD only, and no relapse was observed. In our registered elderly patients, we see a high rate of non-eligibility for treatment in studies and of high-risk APL. In patients who can undergo a curative approach, intensified chemotherapy is highly effective, but is restricted to a selection of patients. Therefore, new less toxic treatment approaches with broader applicability are needed.

We report results from a phase I dose-escalation study which aimed to identify tolerated dosing, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of 1D09C3. Fourteen patients with relapsed/refractory B cell type leukemia/lymphoma were treated and followed after up to 4 weekly infusions of 1D09C3, administered in 6 dose levels at 0.25-8 mg/kg/day. Treatment was tolerated well with mostly mild side effects. The most common grade III-IV toxicities were hematological events observed in 4 patients. In one patient, treated at 8.0 mg/kg/day, a dose limiting toxicity occurred, identified as an invasive catheter-related infection. Adverse events resolved completely without long-term sequelae. 1D09C3 reduced peripheral blood B cells and monocytes by a median of 73-81 % in all patients, with a nadir reached 30-60 min after infusion and sustained for <96 h. Granulocytes and natural killer cells predominantly increased with variable time courses. Pharmacokinetic assessments showed detectable drug concentrations at doses 4-8 mg/kg/day and a terminal half-life of 0.7-7.9 h. Effective saturation of HLA-DR on peripheral blood B cells/monocytes was achieved, varying consistently with available serum concentrations and the cell-reducing activity of 1D09C3. In summary, 1D09C3 could be administered safely in patients with advanced B cell malignancies. Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated a strong dose dependent but transient reduction of peripheral blood B cells and monocytes, consistent with a short drug serum availability.","['Schweighofer, Carmen D', 'Tuchscherer, Armin', 'Sperka, Sabine', 'Meyer, Thorsten', 'Rattel, Benno', 'Stein, Sandra', 'Ismail, Semra', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Staib, Peter', 'Reiser, Marcel', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Schweighofer CD', 'Tuchscherer A', 'Sperka S', 'Meyer T', 'Rattel B', 'Stein S', 'Ismail S', 'Elter T', 'Staib P', 'Reiser M', 'Hallek M']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne Bonn, University of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany. carmen.schweighofer@uk-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (1D09C3 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1362-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2012 Dec;61(12):2367-73. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1362-x.

We investigated whether resveratrol has protective effects on the kidney in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Four groups of male C57BLKS/J db/m and db/db mice were used in this study. Resveratrol was administered via gavage to diabetic and non-diabetic mice, starting at 8 weeks of age, for 12 weeks. RESULTS: The db/db mice treated with resveratrol had decreased albuminuria. Resveratrol ameliorated glomerular matrix expansion and inflammation. Resveratrol also lowered the NEFA and triacylglycerol content of the kidney, and this action was related to increases in the phosphorylation of AMPK and the activation of SIRT1-PGC-1alpha signalling and of the key downstream effectors, the PPARalpha-oestrogen-related receptor (ERR)-1alpha-sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Furthermore, resveratrol decreased the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt phosphorylation and class O forkhead box (FOXO)3a phosphorylation, which resulted in a decrease in B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-associated X protein (BAX) and increases in BCL-2, superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 and SOD2 production. Consequently, resveratrol reversed the increase in renal apoptotic cells and oxidative stress, as reflected by renal 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), urinary 8-OH-dG and isoprostane concentrations. Resveratrol prevented high-glucose-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured mesangial cells through the phosphorylation of AMPK and activation of SIRT1-PGC-1alpha signalling and the downstream effectors, PPARalpha-ERR-1alpha-SREBP1. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that resveratrol prevents diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice by the phosphorylation of AMPK and activation of SIRT1-PGC-1alpha signalling, which appear to prevent lipotoxicity-related apoptosis and oxidative stress in the kidney.","['Kim, M Y', 'Lim, J H', 'Youn, H H', 'Hong, Y A', 'Yang, K S', 'Park, H S', 'Chung, S', 'Ko, S H', 'Shin, S J', 'Choi, B S', 'Kim, H W', 'Kim, Y S', 'Lee, J H', 'Chang, Y S', 'Park, C W']","['Kim MY', 'Lim JH', 'Youn HH', 'Hong YA', 'Yang KS', 'Park HS', 'Chung S', 'Ko SH', 'Shin SJ', 'Choi BS', 'Kim HW', 'Kim YS', 'Lee JH', 'Chang YS', 'Park CW']","[""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, #505, Banpo-Dong, Seocho-Ku, Seoul 137-040, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,"['0 (Lipotropic Agents)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirt1 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/*prevention & control', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects', 'Lipotropic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mesangial Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'Resveratrol', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sirtuin 1/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factors/agonists/metabolism']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00125-012-2747-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2013 Jan;56(1):204-17. doi: 10.1007/s00125-012-2747-2.

We purified and characterized this 66-68-kDa protein by affinity chromatography purification using its two identified properties, tyrosine phosphorylation and MTX-binding, and yielded a single band of 66-68 kDa. The purified protein was subjected to trypsin digestion and the isolated peptide fragments were sequenced and yielded two partial peptide sequences: VEIIANDQ and VTNAVVTVPAYFNDSQRQA. The two peptide sequences were used to search for the mouse genome at the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) database for Open Reading Frame Sequence (ORFs) containing these peptides using the TBLASTN function. A single gene was identified containing both sequences, the HSPa8 gene, which codes for the heat shock family protein, HSC70. We further demonstrated that HSC70 is a MTX-binding protein using a binding assay with MTX-agarose beads followed by Western blotting. The HSC70 also existed in various cancer cell lines and showed binding to MTX. Additionally, the HSC70 protein, cloned from the L1210 murine leukemia cells, was expressed and purified from E. coli cells using a polyhistidine-tag purification system and it also showed the binding properties with MTX. DnaK, the HSC70 homologue in E. coli, also binds to MTX. By using the purified truncated HSC70 domains, we identified the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain of HSC70 that can bind to MTX. Thus, we have tentatively characterized a new, novel property of HSC70 as a MTX-binding protein.","['Liu, Tuoen', 'Dean, Allison', 'Ashwini, Saint', 'Sheridan, Peter P', 'Bhushan, Alok', 'Lai, James C K', 'Cao, Shousong', 'Daniels, Christopher K']","['Liu T', 'Dean A', 'Ashwini S', 'Sheridan PP', 'Bhushan A', 'Lai JC', 'Cao S', 'Daniels CK']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (dnaK protein, E coli)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12192-012-0376-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2013 Mar;18(2):223-34. doi: 10.1007/s12192-012-0376-9.

A specific reagent lyses mature white blood cells, allowing that immature myeloid cells remain intact and consequently detectable. It is known that lymphoblasts cannot be detected in this channel. This channel does not entail additional costs, since it is provided by the traditional hematology analyzers used in blood tests and is widely useful in differentiating cell lines. This study has aimed to assess the consonance between IMI results and subtypes of acute leukemias and other hematologic malignancies in order to use it as screening test in the definition of cell lineage. A total of 141 cases of hematologic malignancies have been evaluated. Results of the IMI channel were compared using the Sudan Black cytochemical and flow cytometry. The Cohen's Kappa coefficient of agreement between IMI and flow cytometry results was 0.8%. IMI had sensibility and specificity levels of 90.7% and 90.8%, respectively; VP: 68 (91.9%); FP: 6 (8.1%); VN: 59 (89.4%) and FN: 7 (10.6%); PPV 91.9% and NPV 89.4%. The Sysmex XE 2100 analyzer showed a good analytical performance for the detection of immature myeloid cells. These results indicate that the IMI channel has sensitivity and specificity levels, consistent with previous studies.

A large body of studies has investigated the potential role of MTHFR SNPs in MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL. However, the results are controversial. In this review and meta-analysis, we critically evaluate the relationship between the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of MTHFR and MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL.

However, it is not feasible to repeat this procedure except rarely because of the low incidence of the CCR5-Delta32 allele, the availability of only a small number of potential donors for most patients, and the need for a very close human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match between adult donors and recipients. In contrast, cord blood (CB) transplantations require significantly less stringent HLA matching. Therefore, our hypothesis is that cure of HIV infections by HCT can be accomplished much more readily using umbilical CB stem cells obtained from a modestly sized inventory of cryopreserved CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 CB units. To test this hypothesis, we developed a screening program for CB units and are developing an inventory of CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 cryopreserved units available for HCT. Three hundred such units are projected to provide for white pediatric patients a 73.6% probability of finding an adequately HLA matched unit with a cell dose of >/=2.5 x 10(7) total nucleated cells (TNCs)/kg and a 27.9% probability for white adults. With a cell dose of >/=1 x 10(7) TNCs/kg, the corresponding projected probabilities are 85.6% and 82.1%. The projected probabilities are lower for ethnic minorities. Impetus for using CB HCT was provided by a transplantation of an adult with acute myelogenous leukemia who was not HIV infected.

However, it remains unclear whether specific gene expression changes determine the apoptotic response following HDACis administration. Herein, we discuss evidence that HDACis trigger in cancer and leukemia cells not only widespread histone acetylation but also actual increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage that are further increased following treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapies. While the origins of ROS production are not completely understood, mechanisms, including inflammation and altered antioxidant signaling, have been reported. While the generation of ROS is an explanation, at least in part, for the source of DNA damage observed with HDACi treatment, DNA damage can also be independently induced by changes in the DNA repair activity and chromatin remodeling factors. Recent development of sirtuin inhibitors (SIRTis) has shown that, similar to HDACis, these drugs induce increases in ROS and DNA damage used singly, or in combination with HDACis and other drugs. Thus, induction of apoptosis by HDACis/SIRTis may result through oxidative stress and DNA damage mechanisms in addition to direct activation of apoptosis-inducing genes. Nevertheless, while DNA damage and stress responses could be of interest as markers for clinical responses, they have yet to be validated as markers for responses to HDACi treatment in clinical trials, alone, and in combination.","['Robert, Carine', 'Rassool, Feyruz V']","['Robert C', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology and Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/03/22 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-394387-3.00003-3 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-394387-3.00003-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2012;116:87-129. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-394387-3.00003-3.,10.1016/B978-0-12-394387-3.00003-3 [doi] B978-0-12-394387-3.00003-3 [pii],,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

HQ17(3) irreversibly inhibits Topo IIalpha activity in vitro and is more cytotoxic in leukemia HL-60 cells than in Topo IIalpha-deficient variant HL-60/MX2 cells, which suggests that Topo IIalpha is a cellular target of HQ17(3). This study further characterizes the molecular mechanisms of the anticancer activity of HQ17(3). Proteomic analyses indicated that HQ17(3) reacted with Cys-427, Cys-733, and Cys-997 of recombinant Topo IIalpha in vitro, whereas it reacted with Cys-427 of cellular Topo IIalpha in Huh7 hepatoma cells. The modification of HQ17(3) inhibited Topo IIalpha catalytic activity, increased the Topo IIalpha-DNA cleavage complex, and caused the accumulation of DNA breakage. In Huh7 cells, HQ17(3) treatment caused prompt inhibition of DNA synthesis and consequently induced the expression of DNA damage-related genes DDIT3, GADD45A, and GADD45G. Topo IIalpha inhibition, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were found to account for cytotoxicity caused by HQ17(3). Pretreatment of Huh7 cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) partially attenuated mitochondrial membrane damage, DNA breakage, and caspase activation. However, NAC pretreatment did not diminish HQ17(3)-induced cell death. These results suggest that the anticancer activity of HQ17(3) is attributed significantly to Topo IIalpha poisoning. The structural feature of HQ17(3) can be used as a model for the design of Topo IIalpha inhibitors and anticancer drugs.","['Lin, Ting-Yu', 'Huang, Cheng-Po', 'Au, Lo-Chun', 'Chang, Ya-Wen', 'Hu, Chung-Yi', 'Lin, Shwu-Bin']","['Lin TY', 'Huang CP', 'Au LC', 'Chang YW', 'Hu CY', 'Lin SB']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"[""0 (10'(Z),13'(E),15'(E)-heptadecatrienylhydroquinone)"", '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine/*chemistry', 'DNA Breaks/*drug effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/tx3002302 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2012 Nov 19;25(11):2340-51. doi: 10.1021/tx3002302.

This may lead to persistent inflammation, tissue injury and dysfunction. We therefore investigated by a translational approach the potential contribution of the intrinsic stress-induced mitochondrial pathway in extending neutrophil survival under IH conditions. Thus, neutrophils of healthy individuals treated with IH in-vitro and neutrophils of OSA patients undergoing nightly IH episodes in-vivo were investigated. Specifically, the balance between pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein expression, and the potential involvement of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in the control of Mcl-1 expression were investigated. METHODS: Purified neutrophils were exposed to IH and compared to normoxia and to sustained hypoxia (SH) using a BioSpherix-OxyCycler C42 system. Bax and Mcl-1 levels, and p38MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were determined by western blotting. Also, Bax/Mcl-1 expression and Bax translocation to the mitochondria were assessed by confocal microscopy in pre-apoptotic neutrophils, before the appearance of apoptotic morphology. Co-localization of Bax and mitochondria was quantified by LSM 510 CarlZeiss MicroImaging using Manders Overlap Coefficient. A paired two-tailed t test, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Compared to normoxia, IH and SH up-regulated the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 by about 2-fold, down-regulated the pro-apoptotic Bax by 41% and 27%, respectively, and inhibited Bax co-localization with mitochondria before visible morphological signs of apoptosis were noted. IH induced ERK1/2 and p38MAPKs phosphorylation, whereas SH induced only p38MAPK phosphorylation. Accordingly, both ERK and p38MAPK inhibitors attenuated the IH-induced Mcl-1 increase. In SH, only p38MAPK inhibition decreased Mcl-1 expression. Similar to neutrophils of healthy subjects exposed to IH (0.97+/- 0.2), in OSA neutrophils, Bax/Mcl-1 ratio was significantly lower compared to normoxic controls (1.0+/-0.5 vs.1.99+/-0.3, p=0.015), and Bax did not co-localize with mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that decreased Bax/Mcl-1 balance promotes neutrophil survival in IH in-vitro as well as in OSA patients. Moreover, Bax/Mcl-1 protein function in IH and SH might be regulated by different signal transduction pathways, highlighting a novel regulatory function through ERK1/2 signaling in IH.","['Dyugovskaya, Larissa', 'Polyakov, Andrey', 'Cohen-Kaplan, Victoria', 'Lavie, Peretz', 'Lavie, Lena']","['Dyugovskaya L', 'Polyakov A', 'Cohen-Kaplan V', 'Lavie P', 'Lavie L']","['The Lloyd Rigler Sleep Apnea Research Laboratory, The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Demography', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/complications/enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*pathology', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/complications/enzymology/*pathology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-10-211 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-10-211 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2012 Oct 22;10:211. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-10-211.,10.1186/1479-5876-10-211 [doi],20121022,,,PMC3543281,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their mode of action remains scantily documented. While other families of transcription factors, like Smad or Stat, are known cell signaling transducers, such a function has never been squarely addressed for Hox proteins. RESULTS: To investigate the mode of action of mammalian Hoxa1, we characterized its interactome by a systematic yeast two-hybrid screening against ~12,200 ORF-derived polypeptides. Fifty nine interactors were identified of which 45 could be confirmed by affinity co-purification in animal cell lines. Many Hoxa1 interactors are proteins involved in cell-signaling transduction, cell adhesion and vesicular trafficking. Forty-one interactions were detectable in live cells by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation which revealed distinctive intracellular patterns for these interactions consistent with the selective recruitment of Hoxa1 by subgroups of partner proteins at vesicular, cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments. CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of the Hoxa1 interactome presented here suggests unexplored roles for Hox proteins in cell-to-cell communication and cell physiology.","['Lambert, Barbara', 'Vandeputte, Julie', 'Remacle, Sophie', 'Bergiers, Isabelle', 'Simonis, Nicolas', 'Twizere, Jean-Claude', 'Vidal, Marc', 'Rezsohazy, Rene']","['Lambert B', 'Vandeputte J', 'Remacle S', 'Bergiers I', 'Simonis N', 'Twizere JC', 'Vidal M', 'Rezsohazy R']","['Molecular and Cellular Animal Embryology group, Life Sciences Institute (ISV), Universite Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, 1348, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Dev Biol,BMC developmental biology,100966973,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Maps', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/02/14 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-213X-12-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-213X-12-29 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Dev Biol. 2012 Oct 22;12:29. doi: 10.1186/1471-213X-12-29.,10.1186/1471-213X-12-29 [doi],20121022,['R01-HG001715/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC3514159,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, ITRT can possibly be regarded as a risk factor in childhood acute leukemias.","['Piatkowska, Magdalena', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Kolodziej, Beata', 'Kurylo-Rafinska, Beata', 'Kubicka, Malgorzata', 'Pogorzala, Monika', 'Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Debski, Robert', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Malinowska, Iwona', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Juraszewska, Edyta', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Konatkowska, Benigna', 'Wieczorek, Maria', 'Olejnik, Igor', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Kuzmicz, Marta', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Stefaniak, Maria Jolanta', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Tomaszewska, Renata', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska, Lucyna', 'Sobol, Grazyna', 'Mizia-Malarz, Agnieszka', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Piatkowska M', 'Styczynski J', 'Kolodziej B', 'Kurylo-Rafinska B', 'Kubicka M', 'Pogorzala M', 'Czyzewski K', 'Debski R', 'Matysiak M', 'Malinowska I', 'Balwierz W', 'Juraszewska E', 'Wachowiak J', 'Konatkowska B', 'Wieczorek M', 'Olejnik I', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Kuzmicz M', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Stefaniak MJ', 'Badowska W', 'Szczepanski T', 'Tomaszewska R', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska L', 'Sobol G', 'Mizia-Malarz A', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland. magda_piatkowska@o2.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/24 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.741231 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jun;54(6):1256-62. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.741231.

A retrospective review comparing the incidence of early and late CVAD-associated complications and their effect on CVAD removal was performed in patients with AML undergoing induction chemotherapy between 2007 and 2011. Overall, 64 Hickman((R)) catheters and 84 peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) were inserted. There was a trend toward increasing use of PICCs. The rate of CVAD occlusion was higher in PICCs compared to Hickman catheters (48.2% vs. 3.2%), for a rate of 20.43 vs. 1.25 per 1000 CVAD-days (p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the rates of CVAD-associated thrombosis, premature removal, blood stream infection (BSI) and CVAD-related BSI. Importantly, there was no significant difference in the rate of CVAD removal between Hickman catheters and PICCs for the duration that the CVADs were in place.

To assess the potential role of BRAF, we have sequenced exons 11 and 15 of BRAF in 138 cases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 32 cases of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL). We found an incidence of BRAF mutations of 2.8% in CLL (4/138), while no cases with B-PLL showed BRAF mutations. The analysis of a cohort of patients with fludarabine-refractory disease (n = 87) showed no increase in the mutation incidence, suggesting that this mutation is not selected for during the disease progression. A limited analysis of the effect of BRAF inhibition in primary CLL cells showed no cell death induction in CLL samples with and without BRAF mutations. Our analysis suggests that BRAF mutations occur at a low frequency in CLL.

Clinical features of patients with effusion were evaluated. For this purpose, we reviewed the medical records of ALL patients who had pretherapy echocardiograms. A total of 90 patients aged between 1.8 and 16.3 years were analyzed retrospectively. In 23 of 90 (25.6%) patients, PE was detected at initial diagnosis. The age of patients with PE ranged between 1.8 and 14.8 years (mean 5.05 +/- 3.77 years). The female/male ratio was 9/14. Six (26.1%) patients were T-lineage and 17 (73.9%) were B-lineage ALL. Nine (39%) patients were in standard risk group, 13 (57%) were in median risk group, 1 (4%) patient was in high-risk group. Mean initial white blood cell count was 40.756 +/- 38.653/mm(3) (range 23.000-130.000/mm(3)). Mean initial hemoglobin count was 7.3 +/- 1.39 gr/dL (range 5.5-10.1 gr/dL), mean initial platelet count was 35.200 +/- 26.300/mm(3) (range 4.000-118.000 mm(3)). Size of effusions was between 2 and 6 mm (mean size 3.3 +/- 1.8 mm). All patients had normal left ventricular systolic function. In 87% of patients, effusions disappeared in the first 7 days and, in 13%, disappeared between 8th and 15th days of chemotherapy. None of the patients required pericardiocentesis. Cardiac dysfunction did not occur among any of these patients during chemotherapy. In conclusion, PE is not frequent in childhood ALL. It usually does not cause cardiac impairment.

This infection is self-limiting in healthy persons; however, it can be severe, progressive and persistent in those who are immunocompromised. There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia.

P-gp overexpression reduces intracellular anticancer drug concentrations and is correlated with low remission rates. However, whether the presence of LRP influences the response to induction chemotherapy remains controversial. Therefore, we investigated the relationship of LRP and P-gp overexpression with the response to induction chemotherapy. Univariate analysis revealed that there was a significant difference between complete remission rates for acute myelogenous leukemia patients depending on their blast cell expressions, between LRP positive versus negative, P-gp positive versus negative, and LRP/P-gp double positive versus other groups. Crude odds ratios (ORs) for complete remission were 0.390, 0.360, and 0.307 for LRP positive, for P-gp positive, and LRP/P-gp double positive patients, respectively. After controlling the confounding variables by stepwise multivariate logistical regression analysis, the presence of LRP/P-gp double positivity and P-gp positivity were found to be independent prognostic factors; adjusted ORs were 0.233 and 0.393, respectively. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody against LRP significantly increased daunorubicin acumulation (P=0.004) in the nuclei of leukemic blast cells with LRP positivity in more than 10% of the cells. An LRP reversing agent, PAK-104P, was found to increase the daunorubicin content with marginal significance (P=0.060). The present results suggest that not only the presence of P-gp, but also LRP in leukemic blast cells is a risk factor for resistance to induction chemotherapy. Inhibiting LRP function, similar to the inhibition of P-gp function, will be necessary to improve the effectiveness of induction chemotherapy.","['Tsuji, Kazue', 'Wang, Yan-Hua', 'Takanashi, Minoko', 'Odajima, Tsuyoshi', 'Lee, Gabriel A', 'Sugimori, Hiroki', 'Motoji, Toshiko']","['Tsuji K', 'Wang YH', 'Takanashi M', 'Odajima T', 'Lee GA', 'Sugimori H', 'Motoji T']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University;""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,2012/10/23 06:00,2012/10/23 06:01,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4081/hr.2012.e18 [doi]', 'hr.2012.e18 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol Rep. 2012 Jul 11;4(3):e18. doi: 10.4081/hr.2012.e18.

Data regarding its prognosis with the use of the novel agents, i.e., the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and lenalidomide, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, are limited. We retrospectively reviewed clinical outcomes, response to therapy, and survival of 17 patients seen at the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute since the availability of novel agents (2006-2011). Twelve patients had primary PCL (pPCL), and 5 secondary PCL (sPCL). PCL was associated with aggressive clinicobiological features, such as high-risk cytogenetics, elevated serum beta-2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase, International Staging System stage III, and rapid relapse after therapy. With the use of thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib in 53%, 53%, and 88% patients, respectively, median overall survival (OS) was 18 months in the whole group (95% confidence interval, 11-21 months), and 21 and 4 months in pPCL and sPCL, respectively (P=0.015). OS was inferior to that of 313 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated in the same period, even when compared with a subset of 47 MM with high-risk cytogenetics. Although our data are limited by the small sample size, we conclude that novel agents may modestly improve survival in patients with PCL, when compared to historical controls.

The beneficial effect of IMOD administration for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient has been proved in previous clinical trials. Here the in vitro inhibitory effect of IMOD against HIV-1, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and murine leukemia viruses (MLV) was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HIV single cycle replication and HSV plaque reduction assays were used to evaluate the anti-viral effect. The level of HIV replication was monitored by p24 capture Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The single round infection [with green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter MLV and HIV], virucidal and time-of-additions (HSV) assays were utilized to determine the mode of anti-viral activity. The toxicity of IMOD for cells was monitored by XTT (sodium 3_-[1 (phenylaminocarbonyl)- 3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid) cell proliferation assay kit. RESULTS: IMOD inhibited 50% of HIV-1 and HSV replication (IC(50)) at 6.5 x 10(-4) and 4.3 x 10(-3)V/V concentrations, respectively. The IC(50) value against HIV-1 and MLV infection were 6 x 10(-4)V/V and 4.9 x 10(-4)V/V. Virucidal assay showed that IMOD reduces the potency of HIV and HSV particles to 41 and 54% of control, respectively. Time-of-addition study revealed that IMOD inhibits the replication of HSV at a stage after penetration of virions to the target cells. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study indicate that IMOD has significant anti-viral activity against HIV, HSV and MLV. Setarud could be subjected to further investigation after isolation of the constituents and determination of the toxic components.","['Zabihollahi, Rezvan', 'Namazi, Rahele', 'Aghasadeghi, Mohammad Reze', 'Esfahani, Azar Farhang', 'Sadat, Seyed Mehdi', 'Modarressi, Mohammad Hossein']","['Zabihollahi R', 'Namazi R', 'Aghasadeghi MR', 'Esfahani AF', 'Sadat SM', 'Modarressi MH']","['Department of Hepatitis and AIDS, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Indian J Pharmacol,Indian journal of pharmacology,7902477,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (setarud)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Phytotherapy/methods', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Plants, Medicinal', 'Vero Cells']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4103/0253-7613.99301 [doi]', 'IJPharm-44-448 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Pharmacol. 2012 Jul-Aug;44(4):448-53. doi: 10.4103/0253-7613.99301.,10.4103/0253-7613.99301 [doi],,,,PMC3469945,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-viral activity', 'human immunodeficiency virus', 'setarud (IMOD)']",,,,,,,

This mechanism could explain why historically, cytidine analogues have not been successful chemotherapeutics against hepatotropic cancers, despite efficacy in vitro. Importantly, this mechanism of resistance can be readily reversed, without increasing toxicity to sensitive organs, by combining a cytidine analogue with an inhibitor of cytidine deaminase (tetrahydrouridine). Specifically, CDA rapidly metabolizes cytidine analogues into inactive uridine counterparts. Hence, to determine if sheltering/protection of cancer cells in organs which express high levels of CDA (e.g., liver) is a mechanism of resistance, we utilized a murine xenotransplant model of myeloid cancer that is sensitive to epigenetic therapeutic effects of the cytidine analogue decitabine in vitro and hepato-tropic in vivo. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with decitabine (subcutaneous 0.2mg/kg 2X/week) doubled median survival and significantly decreased extra-hepatic tumor burden, but hepatic tumor burden remained substantial, to which the animals eventually succumbed. Combining a clinically-relevant inhibitor of CDA (tetrahydrouridine) with a lower dose of decitabine (subcutaneous 0.1mg/kg 2X/week) markedly decreased liver tumor burden without blood count or bone marrow evidence of myelotoxicity, and with further improvement in survival. In conclusion, sanctuary in a CDA-rich organ is a mechanism by which otherwise susceptible cancer cells can resist the effects of decitabine epigenetic therapy. This protection can be reversed without increasing myelotoxicity by combining tetrahydrouridine with a lower dose of decitabine.","['Ebrahem, Quteba', 'Mahfouz, Reda Z', 'Ng, Kwok Peng', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen']","['Ebrahem Q', 'Mahfouz RZ', 'Ng KP', 'Saunthararajah Y']","['Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '18771-50-1 (Tetrahydrouridine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Tetrahydrouridine/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['597 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.597 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 Oct;3(10):1137-45. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.597.,,,"['R01 CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54HL090513/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000439/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL090513/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3717944,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to identify a novel means of overcoming resistance of melanoma to killing by BRAF inhibitors. We examined the influence of the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 on induction of apoptosis by the selective BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 in melanoma cells with or without BRAF V600E mutation. Included were cell lines established from four patients before and during treatment with selective BRAF inhibitors and 3D spheroids derived from these cell lines. Cell lines with no or low sensitivity to PLX4720 underwent synergistic increases and increased rates of apoptosis when combined with ABT-737. This degree of synergism was not seen in cell lines without BRAF V600E mutations. Apoptosis was mediated through the mitochondrial pathway and was due in part to upregulation of Bim as shown by inhibition of apoptosis following small interfering RNA knockdown of Bim. Similar effects were seen in cell lines established from patients prior to treatment but not in lines from patients clinically resistant to the selective BRAF inhibitors and in 3D spheroids derived from these cell lines. These results suggest that combination of selective BRAF inhibitors with ABT-737 or the related orally available compound ABT-263 may increase the degree and rate of responses in previously untreated patients with V600E melanoma but not in those with acquired resistance to these agents.","['Wroblewski, David', 'Mijatov, Branka', 'Mohana-Kumaran, Nethia', 'Lai, Fritz', 'Gallagher, Stuart J', 'Haass, Nikolas K', 'Zhang, Xu Dong', 'Hersey, Peter']","['Wroblewski D', 'Mijatov B', 'Mohana-Kumaran N', 'Lai F', 'Gallagher SJ', 'Haass NK', 'Zhang XD', 'Hersey P']","['School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, New South Wales 2300, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PLX 4720)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs330 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs330 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Feb;34(2):237-47. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs330.

Here, we report a strategy to rapidly identify functionally important kinase targets, irrespective of the etiology of kinase pathway dysregulation, ultimately enabling a correlation of patient genetic profiles to clinically effective kinase inhibitors. Our methodology assessed the sensitivity of primary leukemia patient samples to a panel of 66 small-molecule kinase inhibitors over 3 days. Screening of 151 leukemia patient samples revealed a wide diversity of drug sensitivities, with 70% of the clinical specimens exhibiting hypersensitivity to one or more drugs. From this data set, we developed an algorithm to predict kinase pathway dependence based on analysis of inhibitor sensitivity patterns. Applying this algorithm correctly identified pathway dependence in proof-of-principle specimens with known oncogenes, including a rare FLT3 mutation outside regions covered by standard molecular diagnostic tests. Interrogation of all 151 patient specimens with this algorithm identified a diversity of kinase targets and signaling pathways that could aid prioritization of deep sequencing data sets, permitting a cumulative analysis to understand kinase pathway dependence within leukemia subsets. In a proof-of-principle case, we showed that in vitro drug sensitivity could predict both a clinical response and the development of drug resistance. Taken together, our results suggested that drug target scores derived from a comprehensive kinase inhibitor panel could predict pathway dependence in cancer cells while simultaneously identifying potential therapeutic options.","['Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Yang, Wayne F', 'Bankhead, Armand 3rd', 'Fan, Guang', 'Fletcher, Luke B', 'Bryant, Jade', 'Glover, Jason M', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Spurgeon, Stephen E', 'Fleming, William H', 'Kovacsovics, Tibor', 'Gotlib, Jason R', 'Oh, Stephen T', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Zwaan, Christian Michel', 'Den Boer, Monique L', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Druker, Brian J', 'Loriaux, Marc M']","['Tyner JW', 'Yang WF', 'Bankhead A 3rd', 'Fan G', 'Fletcher LB', 'Bryant J', 'Glover JM', 'Chang BH', 'Spurgeon SE', 'Fleming WH', 'Kovacsovics T', 'Gotlib JR', 'Oh ST', 'Deininger MW', 'Zwaan CM', 'Den Boer ML', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', ""O'Hare T"", 'Druker BJ', 'Loriaux MM']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-1906 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1906 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 1;73(1):285-96. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1906.

METHODS: The phenotypes of AML cell lines U937,Kasumi-1,and KG-1 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS). The effect of HHT on leukemia stem-like cells with immunophenotype of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) was detected with FACS. Cell growth was measured by MTT assay. Activation of Caspase pathway and expression of apoptosis-related regulator proteins were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: FACS demonstrated that the 69% of KG-1 cells expressed LSC phenotype CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+), while 26.7% on Kasumi-1 cells expressed this marker. In contrast,U937 cells showed CD96 negative. HHT significantly inhibited cell growth of KG-1 cells with an IC(50) of 16.9 ng/ml at 48 h. The ratio of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) cells decreased from 63.6% to 17.1% after HHT treatment.

However, mechanisms that regulate the amount of ROS in leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and the biological role of ROS in these cells are largely unknown. We show here that the ROS(low) subset of CD44(+) cells in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignancy of immature T cell progenitors, is highly enriched in the most aggressive LICs and that ROS accumulation is restrained by downregulation of protein kinase C theta (PKC-theta). Notably, primary mouse T-ALLs lacking PKC-theta show improved LIC activity, whereas enforced PKC-theta expression in both mouse and human primary T-ALLs compromised LIC activity. We also show that PKC-theta is regulated by a new pathway in which NOTCH1 induces runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), RUNX3 represses RUNX1 and RUNX1 induces PKC-theta. NOTCH1, which is frequently activated by mutation in T-ALL and required for LIC activity in both mouse and human models, thus acts to repress PKC-theta. These results reveal key functional roles for PKC-theta and ROS in T-ALL and suggest that aggressive biological behavior in vivo could be limited by therapeutic strategies that promote PKC-theta expression or activity, or the accumulation of ROS.","['Giambra, Vincenzo', 'Jenkins, Christopher R', 'Wang, Hongfang', 'Lam, Sonya H', 'Shevchuk, Olena O', 'Nemirovsky, Oksana', 'Wai, Carol', 'Gusscott, Sam', 'Chiang, Mark Y', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Eaves, Connie', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Giambra V', 'Jenkins CR', 'Wang H', 'Lam SH', 'Shevchuk OO', 'Nemirovsky O', 'Wai C', 'Gusscott S', 'Chiang MY', 'Aster JC', 'Humphries RK', 'Eaves C', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', '*Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', '*Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2960 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2960 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2012 Nov;18(11):1693-8. doi: 10.1038/nm.2960.

However, the FLT3 expression is variability among patients with calla-ALL. The aim of this study was to determine the FLT3 expression, to associate with the genotypes and allelic of G1082A (IL10) in 50 patients with calla-ALL and assess the overall survival at 98 months follow-up. The expression was assessed by quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR), the G1082A polymorphism was identified by allele-specific PCR and for immunophenotypic classification was used specific markers of B lineage-calla. We observed that patients who died showed higher FLT3 expression (p = 0.005), worse survival (p = 0.0137) and the IL10G allele may favor the survival, because the IL10 GG and IL10 GA genotypes showed a low FLT3 expression (p < 0.05).","['de Deus, Dayse Maria Vasconcelos', 'de Souza, Paulo Roberto Eleuterio', 'Muniz, Maria Tereza Cartaxo']","['de Deus DM', 'de Souza PR', 'Muniz MT']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology Center (CEONHPE/UPE), Recife, PE, Brazil. dayvasconcelos@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics/mortality', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-012-2209-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2013 Feb;40(2):1609-13. doi: 10.1007/s11033-012-2209-4.

Here we report that promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF), the BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF) transcription factor directing the innate-like effector program of natural killer T-cell thymocytes, is prominently associated with cullin 3 (CUL3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase previously shown to use BTB domain-containing proteins as adaptors for substrate binding. PLZF transports CUL3 to the nucleus, where the two proteins are associated within a chromatin-modifying complex. Furthermore, PLZF expression results in selective ubiquitination changes of several components of this complex. CUL3 was also found associated with the BTB-ZF transcription factor BCL6, which directs the germinal-centre B cell and follicular T-helper cell programs. Conditional CUL3 deletion in mice demonstrated an essential role for CUL3 in the development of PLZF- and BCL6-dependent lineages. We conclude that distinct lineage-specific BTB-ZF transcription factors recruit CUL3 to alter the ubiquitination pattern of their associated chromatin-modifying complex. We propose that this new function is essential to direct the differentiation of several T- and B-cell effector programs, and may also be involved in the oncogenic role of PLZF and BCL6 in leukaemias and lymphomas.","['Mathew, Rebecca', 'Seiler, Michael P', 'Scanlon, Seth T', 'Mao, Ai-ping', 'Constantinides, Michael G', 'Bertozzi-Villa, Clara', 'Singer, Jeffrey D', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Mathew R', 'Seiler MP', 'Scanlon ST', 'Mao AP', 'Constantinides MG', 'Bertozzi-Villa C', 'Singer JD', 'Bendelac A']","['Committee on Immunology, Department of Pathology, The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Bcl6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cul3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cullin Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', '*Zinc Fingers']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/01/16 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2011/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nature11548 [pii]', '10.1038/nature11548 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2012 Nov 22;491(7425):618-21. doi: 10.1038/nature11548.

Patients were stratified according to the paediatric TRM risk score derived from the paediatric BMT registry (PRST) and compared with the historical transplant population of this registry. Underlying diseases were malignancies, immunodeficiencies, and haematologic and metabolic disorders. TREO total dose ranged from 21-42 g/m(2). Additional conditioning drugs included fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, CY and/or TBI. EFS at 3 years for non-malignant and malignant diseases was 88% and 49%, respectively. Leukaemia patients in remission had a survival of 51% at 3 years; nonremission patients relapsed and died within 18 months. TRM and OS in the low-risk groups 0 and 1 were similar to PRST controls. TRM in the high-risk groups 2 and 3 was markedly lower (9% vs 28% and 13% vs 53%, respectively) than in the PRST group, but OS was similar. In conclusion, TREO-based conditioning regimens in children resulted in excellent engraftment and long-term survival in nonmalignant disease.

We performed immunohistochemical studies of BM microvessel density (MVD) using Abs against vascular-endothelial (VE)-cadherin, CD34 and CD105, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. At the time of diagnosis, the MVD in AML patients was higher than that in the normal controls, and the MVD decreased after induction chemotherapy. Patients with aGVHD had a significantly higher MVD than patients without aGVHD. Conversely, patients with cGVHD did not have a significantly different MVD. In previous aGVHD, we also found more VEGF+ megakaryocytes. XY FISH in sex-mismatched patients showed that the BM blood vessels consisted mainly of recipient endothelial cells.

METHODS: Mortality follow-up was performed of 9,501 workers first hired between 1962 when the plant started operations and 2000. Person-years of observation from 1962 to 2004, expected deaths, and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Follow-up for bladder cancer incidence from 1988 to 2003 was carried out, and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated. Multivariable (Poisson) analyses of bladder cancer incidence and mortality by duration of employment (DOE) and time since first employment (TSFE) were performed. RESULTS: Among men, SMRs were significantly reduced for all causes, all cancers, lung cancer, cardiovascular, and ischemic heart diseases. Bladder cancer mortality and leukemia mortality were close to expectation but increased with TSFE. Seventy-two incident cases of bladder cancer were observed (SIR = 1.15; 95 % confidence interval 0.90-1.44), and multivariable analysis suggested a possible increase in rate ratios with DOE. Among women, mortality was close to expectation, but the limited number of observed deaths prevented detailed analyses. CONCLUSIONS: No significant cancer excess was observed.

TKI therapy has a superior safety profile compared with the previous standard of care, interferon-alpha, and most adverse events (AEs) observed with front-line and second-line TKI treatment are managed with supportive care. However, some patients are intolerant to TKI therapy and experience AEs that cannot be managed through dose reduction or symptomatic treatment. Careful management of AEs helps patients to remain adherent with treatment and increases their chances for successful outcomes. Proactive vigilance for potential AEs and treatment strategies that reduce symptom burden will help to minimize patient intolerance.

The reference treatments for MDS include the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and decitabine. Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib has been shown to exert antileukemic activity in vitro and in vivo, independent of the EGFR. Thanks to this feature, erlotinib is currently being tested as an antileukemic drug in clinical trials. Here, we report that azacytidine and erlotinib mediate synergistic antineoplastic effects in several primary or secondary (post-MDS) AML cell lines. The combination of azacytidine and erlotinib blocked cell-cycle progression and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis more consistently than either of the two agents alone. These effects were not a consequence of cellular differentiation and could be discriminated from each other, as the former depended on caspases whereas the latter did not. The synergy between azacitidine and erlotinib, which involved the proteasomal degradation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members MCL-1 and BCL2L10 and the upregulation of their pro-apoptotic counterpart PUMA, was abolished when azacytidine was replaced by decitabine but persisted when erlotinib was substituted with gefitinib, another EGFR inhibitor. Of note, the intracellular accumulation of azacytidine was exacerbated by both erlotinib and gefitinib, pointing to a pharmacokinetic mechanism of synergy. In approximately half of the cases studied, marrow and circulating blasts from MDS and AML patients, respectively, exhibited hyperadditive cytotoxic responses to the combination of azacytidine and erlotinib. These results strongly suggest that the combination of azacytidine and erlotinib may exert clinically relevant antileukemic effects.","['Lainey, E', 'Wolfromm, A', 'Marie, N', 'Enot, D', 'Scoazec, M', 'Bouteloup, C', 'Leroy, C', 'Micol, J-B', 'De Botton, S', 'Galluzzi, L', 'Fenaux, P', 'Kroemer, G']","['Lainey E', 'Wolfromm A', 'Marie N', 'Enot D', 'Scoazec M', 'Bouteloup C', 'Leroy C', 'Micol JB', 'De Botton S', 'Galluzzi L', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['1] INSERM, U848, Villejuif, France [2] Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France [3] Hopital Robert Debre, AP-HP, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/11/10 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012469 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.469 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Sep 12;32(37):4331-42. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.469.

Molecular markers are helpful to define the minimal residual disease load after the achievement of hematological complete remission.

In this review, we discuss technical aspects of bone marrow biopsy processing and the application of diagnostic molecular techniques.","['Quintanilla-Martinez, L', 'Tinguely, M', 'Bonzheim, I', 'Fend, F']","['Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Tinguely M', 'Bonzheim I', 'Fend F']","['Institut fur Pathologie und Neuropathologie, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen, Liebermeisterstr 8, 72076 Tubingen, Deutschland. leticia.quintanilla-fend@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00292-012-1647-z [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2012 Nov;33(6):481-9. doi: 10.1007/s00292-012-1647-z.,10.1007/s00292-012-1647-z [doi],,,,,['Pathologe. 2012 Nov;33(6):479-80.

The role of this enzyme in high-risk myelodysplastic diseases (MDS) and the effect of azacitidine on its expression in MDS and AML have not been studied in detail. In this work, we have analyzed the effect of different concentrations of azacitidine in two well-established, MDS-derived, acute myeloid leukemic cell lines: MOLM-13 and SKM-1. We have demonstrated that 1 mumol/L azacitidine decreases MMP9 DNA methylation levels and that this is correlated with a significant increase in messenger RNA expression in both cell lines. Surprisingly, changes in protein levels were minor. This paradoxic effect is explained by the drug-dependent induction of apoptosis that reduces the amount of active secreting cells. A balance between induced expression and apoptosis was established at an azacitidine concentration of 0.2 mumol/L in MOLM-13 cells. This dose significantly increased the invasive capacity of viable cells, as measured in the Matrigel assay. To evaluate the clinical relevance of this observation, we have examined the effect of azacitidine on MMP9 expression in bone marrow from five patients with MDS, with the finding that this drug significantly increased MMP9 protein levels in all analyzed patients after six cycles of treatment. Based on these results, we conclude that azacitidine increases MMP9 expression and may enhance invasiveness in vitro. Because all five patients relapsed, these findings might explain, at least partially, the clinical failure of the drug and the progression to a more aggressive disease.","['Bernal, Teresa', 'Moncada-Pazos, Angela', 'Soria-Valles, Clara', 'Gutierrez-Fernandez, Ana']","['Bernal T', 'Moncada-Pazos A', 'Soria-Valles C', 'Gutierrez-Fernandez A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain. teresa.bernal@sespa.princast.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Antimetabolites/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Catalysis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/enzymology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Risk']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00436-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Feb;41(2):172-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.005.

The present studies were undertaken to clarify the relationship between the induction of a thymineless state and the formation of Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1CC) for inducing cell death and to clarify the role of DNA replication for induction of lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in FdUMP[10]-treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Human promyelocytic (HL60) and AML (KG1a, Molm13, THP-1) cells were synchronized by serum starvation and treated with FdUMP[10] with thymidine (Thy) rescue. Cells were assayed for TS inhibition, DNA DSBs, Top1CC, and apoptosis to clarify the interrelationship of TS inhibition and Top1CC for cell death. FdUMP[10] induced a thymineless state in AML cells and exogenous Thy administered within the first 18 hours of treatment rescued FdUMP[10]-induced Top1CC formation, gammaH2AX phosphorylation, and apoptosis induction. Exogenous Thy was not effective after cells had committed to mitosis and undergone cell division in the presence of FdUMP[10]. FdUMP[10] treatment resulted in Chk1 activation, and Chk1 inhibition enhanced FdUMP[10]-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Jnk-signaling was required for FdUMP[10]-induced apoptosis in promyelocytic HL60 cells and in THP1 cells, but was antiapoptotic in Molm13 and to a lesser extent KG1a AML cells. The results are consistent with FdUMP[10] inducing a thymineless state, leading to misincorporation of FdU into genomic DNA of proliferating cells. Top1CC form in cells upon re-entry into S-phase, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks, and initiating apoptotic signaling that can be either muted or enhanced by Jnk-signaling depending on cell type.","['Jennings-Gee, Jamie', 'Pardee, Timothy S', 'Gmeiner, William H']","['Jennings-Gee J', 'Pardee TS', 'Gmeiner WH']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (TOP1 protein, human)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)', 'S6U3J3UP11 (SB 218078)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00438-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Feb;41(2):180-188.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.007.

Hypoxoside is isolated from Hypoxis, a medicinal plant genus frequently used by the indigenous people of South Africa as an immune system booster. The aim of this study was to investigate rooperol's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties using the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay, NO and ROS production, and phagocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differentiation of human promonocytic U937 leukemia cells to monocyte-macrophages was induced using 10-100 nM 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and PMA over 72 h. Differentiation was confirmed by light microscopy and flow cytometry. Undifferentiated and/or differentiated cells were treated with DMSO (0.25 v/v%, vehicle control), hypoxoside (50 mug/mL), rooperol (20 mug/mL) or PMA (10/20 nM, positive control). ROS production was measured in undifferentiated and differentiated monocyte-macrophages using DCFH-DA and flow cytometry. Phagocytosis of pHrodo Escherichia coli BioParticles((R)) was measured using pre-treated monocyte-macrophage differentiated U937 cells. NO production was measured in monocyte-macrophage differentiated U937 cells using DAF-2 DA and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Rooperol was shown to have similar or greater antioxidant potential than ascorbic acid. Differentiation of human promonocytic U937 leukemia cells to monocyte-macrophages were confirmed morphologically (cell attachment, clump- and pseudopodia-formation) and biochemically (CD11b and CD14 cell surface marker expression). Rooperol significantly increased ROS and NO production, and phagocytosis in undifferentiated and/or differentiated human promonocytic U937 leukemia cells. Hypoxoside had no or very little effect on ROS and NO production, and phagocytosis. CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous reports that hypoxoside has to be converted to rooperol to be biologically active. The FRAP assay confirms the antioxidant capacity of rooperol seen in previous studies, whereas rooperol's induction of ROS and NO production, and phagocytosis constitute novel findings. Possible mode(s) of action for the in vitro anti-inflammatory activities of rooperol may be explained by ROS and NO production, and phagocytosis.","['Boukes, Gerhardt J', 'van de Venter, Maryna']","['Boukes GJ', 'van de Venter M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, P.O.

Thus, an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that ensure physiological PTK function and potential aberrations of these regulatory processes during diseases such as cancer are of broad interest in biology and medicine. Aside from the expected role of phospho-tyrosine phosphatases, recent studies have revealed a critical role of covalent modification of activated PTKs with ubiquitin as a critical mechanism of their negative regulation. Members of the Cbl protein family (Cbl, Cbl-b and Cbl-c in mammals) have emerged as dominant ""activated PTK-selective"" ubiquitin ligases. Structural, biochemical and cell biological studies have established that Cbl protein-dependent ubiquitination targets activated PTKs for degradation either by facilitating their endocytic sorting into lysosomes or by promoting their proteasomal degradation. This mechanism also targets PTK signaling intermediates that become associated with Cbl proteins in a PTK activation-dependent manner. Cellular and animal studies have established that the relatively broadly expressed mammalian Cbl family members Cbl and Cbl-b play key physiological roles, including their critical functions to prevent the transition of normal immune responses into autoimmune disease and as tumor suppressors; the latter function has received validation from human studies linking mutations in Cbl to human leukemia. These newer insights together with embryonic lethality seen in mice with a combined deletion of Cbl and Cbl-b genes suggest an unappreciated role of the Cbl family proteins, and by implication the ubiquitin-dependent control of activated PTKs, in stem/progenitor cell maintenance. Future studies of existing and emerging animal models and their various cell lineages should help test the broader implications of the evolutionarily-conserved Cbl family protein-mediated, ubiquitin-dependent, negative regulation of activated PTKs in physiology and disease.","['Mohapatra, Bhopal', 'Ahmad, Gulzar', 'Nadeau, Scott', 'Zutshi, Neha', 'An, Wei', 'Scheffe, Sarah', 'Dong, Lin', 'Feng, Dan', 'Goetz, Benjamin', 'Arya, Priyanka', 'Bailey, Tameka A', 'Palermo, Nicholas', 'Borgstahl, Gloria E O', 'Natarajan, Amarnath', 'Raja, Srikumar M', 'Naramura, Mayumi', 'Band, Vimla', 'Band, Hamid']","['Mohapatra B', 'Ahmad G', 'Nadeau S', 'Zutshi N', 'An W', 'Scheffe S', 'Dong L', 'Feng D', 'Goetz B', 'Arya P', 'Bailey TA', 'Palermo N', 'Borgstahl GE', 'Natarajan A', 'Raja SM', 'Naramura M', 'Band V', 'Band H']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*physiology']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(12)00292-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Jan;1833(1):122-39. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.10.010.

We assessed pretreatment parameters for their significance as prognostic factors in the overall survival (OS) of 53 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who had failed to achieve complete remission (CR) after first-line standard-dose remission-induction therapy. RESULTS: During the period January 2005-December 2009, 53 with acute myeloid leukemia received two cycles of the 3+7 protocol as a first-line standard-dose remission-induction therapy (ARA-C, days 1-7 and daunorubicin, days 1-3). The HiDAC (5 patients), MiDAC (7 patients), and FLAG-IDA protocols (3 patients) were given as salvage therapy. None of these patients achieved CR. There were 27 (51%) males and 26 (49%) females (median age, 55 years, range 28-76). The median white blood cell count was 53 (range 0.9 -350)x10(9)/L, platelets 44 (range 3-856x10(9)/l) and bone marrow blasts 67%. HCT-IC comorbidity scores were 3 in two (3.8%) patients, 2 in 11 (20.8%), 1 in 12 (22.6%) and 0 in 16 (30.2%) patients. Median OS was 3.9 months (range 1 -20 months). The hepatomegaly, white blood cell count, ECOG PS, serum level of lactate dehydrogenase, dysplastic changes, coexpression of CD64, CD15, CD11b, comorbidities and disease cytogenetics influenced survival. CONCLUSION: This single-center study evaluated the significance of pretreatment factors, and found that patient age, comorbidities, ECOG performance status, leukocytosis, hepatomegaly, LDH, and the disease cytogenetics were factors which influenced the outcomes of primary resistant patients with acute myeloid leukemia. An understanding of these factors may help to predict OS in cases where CR has not been achieved and may help when making further treatment decisions.","['Colovic, N', 'Tomin, D', 'Vidovic, A', 'Suvajdzic, N', 'Jankovic, G', 'Palibrk, V', 'Djunic, I', 'Djurasinovic, V', 'Virijevic, M']","['Colovic N', 'Tomin D', 'Vidovic A', 'Suvajdzic N', 'Jankovic G', 'Palibrk V', 'Djunic I', 'Djurasinovic V', 'Virijevic M']","['Clinic of Haematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia. natasacolovic73@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(11)00155-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2011.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2012 Dec;66(8):578-82. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2011.11.006.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from proven/probable IA cases that occurred from 2005 to 2009 at 10 hematology centers was performed. RESULTS: We identified 176 IA cases that mainly occurred in patients with acute leukemias (58.5%), mostly those on induction/re-induction treatments (39.8%). Prolonged neutropenia was the most frequent risk factor for IA (61.4%). The lungs were the most frequently affected site (93.8%) and computed tomography detected abnormalities in all episodes; however, only 53.7% of patients had findings suggestive of IA. Galactomannan (GM) detection in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (positive in 79.1% and 78.8% of episodes, respectively) played a crucial role in IA diagnosis. Neutrophil count and antifungal prophylaxis did not influence the GM positivity rate, but empirical therapy decreased this rate (in serum). Of the IA cases, 53.2% responded to initial antifungal therapy. The combination of voriconazole and echinocandin, even as initial or salvage therapy, did not perform better than voriconazole monotherapy (p=0.924 for initial therapy and p=0.205 for salvage therapy). Neutrophil recovery had a significant role in the response to initial (but not salvage) antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective analysis identified key diagnostic and treatment characteristics, and this understanding could improve the management of hematological malignancy patients with IA.","['Racil, Zdenek', 'Weinbergerova, Barbora', 'Kocmanova, Iva', 'Muzik, Jan', 'Kouba, Michal', 'Drgona, Lubos', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Guman, Tomas', 'Tothova, Elena', 'Forsterova, Kristina', 'Haber, Jan', 'Ziakova, Barbora', 'Bojtarova, Eva', 'Vydra, Jan', 'Mudry, Peter', 'Foralova, Renata', 'Sejnova, Daniela', 'Mallatova, Nada', 'Kandrnal, Vit', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Mayer, Jiri']","['Racil Z', 'Weinbergerova B', 'Kocmanova I', 'Muzik J', 'Kouba M', 'Drgona L', 'Masarova L', 'Guman T', 'Tothova E', 'Forsterova K', 'Haber J', 'Ziakova B', 'Bojtarova E', 'Vydra J', 'Mudry P', 'Foralova R', 'Sejnova D', 'Mallatova N', 'Kandrnal V', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Mayer J']","['Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic. zracil@fnbrno.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Int J Infect Dis,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,9610933,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Czech Republic/epidemiology', 'Databases, Factual', 'Echinocandins/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mannans/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Slovakia/epidemiology', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1201-9712(12)01252-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijid.2012.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Infect Dis. 2013 Feb;17(2):e101-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2012.09.004.

Relatively few cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma with t(14;18) have been reported previously. We report the clinicopathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic features of 12 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia associated with t(14;18). There were 9 men and 3 women, with a median age of 51 years at diagnosis. To date, 11 patients have required chemotherapy, 6 before coming to our institution. At last follow-up, 5 patients have died of disease. Karyotypic analysis showed that 10 cases had t(14;18) in the stemline and 2 cases in the sideline; t(14;18) was the sole abnormality in the stemline in 2 cases. In 11 cases, other abnormalities were identified in the stemline or sidelines, most commonly trisomy 12 in 6 cases. Trisomy 12 was associated with atypical morphology and immunophenotype. Of 8 cases tested, 7 showed somatically mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes. We conclude that the t(14;18) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with relatively young age at diagnosis, mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes, and a clinical course that usually requires chemotherapy. The cytogenetic findings, in particular, t(14;18) in the stemline in 10 cases and as the sole karyotypic abnormality in 2 cases, suggest that t(14;18) is an early pathogenetic event in this small subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases.","['Tang, Guilin', 'Banks, Haley E', 'Sargent, Rachel L', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V']","['Tang G', 'Banks HE', 'Sargent RL', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA..']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'Chromosome 12, 12p trisomy']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(12)00245-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2012.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2013 Apr;44(4):598-605. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2012.07.005.

Several lines of evidence suggest that overactive signaling via the Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta) and V-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (cAbl) may be etiologic factors in the development of radiation-induced fibrosis. We tested the hypothesis that imatinib, a clinically available inhibitor of PDGFR-beta, Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (c-kit) and cAbl, would reduce the severity of dermal fibrosis in a murine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The right hind legs of female C3H/HeN mice were exposed to 35 Gy of X-rays. Cohorts of mice were maintained on chow formulated with imatinib 0.5 mg/g or control chow for the duration of the experiment. Bilateral hind limb extension was measured serially to assess fibrotic contracture. Immunohistochemistry and biochemical assays were used to evaluate the levels of collagen and cytokines implicated in radiation-induced fibrosis. RESULTS: Imatinib treatment significantly reduced hind limb contracture and dermal thickness after irradiation. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated a substantial reduction in PDGFR-beta phosphorylation. We also observed reduced Transforming Growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and collagen expression in irradiated skin of imatinib-treated mice, suggesting that imatinib may suppress the fibrotic process by interrupting cross-talk between these pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results support that imatinib may be a useful agent in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced dermal fibrosis.","['Horton, Jason A', 'Chung, Eun Joo', 'Hudak, Kathryn E', 'Sowers, Anastasia', 'Thetford, Angela', 'White, Ayla O', 'Mitchell, James B', 'Citrin, Deborah E']","['Horton JA', 'Chung EJ', 'Hudak KE', 'Sowers A', 'Thetford A', 'White AO', 'Mitchell JB', 'Citrin DE']","['Radiation Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Skin/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2013.741281 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2013 Mar;89(3):162-70. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2013.741281.

There is currently no standard of care for post-transplant relapse of AML, but the increasing numbers of investigational agents in this setting require a better knowledge of their outcome. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of salvage therapies in 54 patients with AML relapsing after Allo-SCT. Twenty-four patients received intensive salvage treatment (17 non-intensive chemotherapy, 13 supportive care). Complete remissions (CRs) were seen only in the group who received intensive salvage (CR rate: 17/24 [71%]). One-year overall survival was 19% (median: 3.4 months) in the whole study group and 33% in the intensive savage group (vs. 7% for patients without intensive salvage, p = 0.004). Factors influencing overall survival (OS) were: time to relapse after Allo-SCT (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.7 [1.6-8.8]) and performance status (PS) at relapse (HR: 2.2 [1.1-4.4]) by multivariate analysis. Our results confirm the poor prognosis of AML relapse after Allo-SCT. In selected patients salvage chemotherapy produces CRs, but these are short lived.

Furthermore, somatic gain-of-function SHP2 mutants are commonly found in human myeloid leukemias. Given that pharmacologic inhibitors to SHP2 phosphatase activity are currently in development as putative antileukemic agents, we conducted a series of experiments examining the necessity of SHP2 phosphatase activity for human hematopoiesis. Anti-sense oligonucleotides to human SHP2 coding sequences reduced human cord blood- and human cell line, TF1-derived colony formation. Expression of truncated SHP2 bearing its Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, but lacking the phosphatase domain similarly reduced human cord blood- and TF1-derived colony formation. Mechanistically, expression of truncated SHP2 reduced the interaction between endogenous, full-length SHP2 with the adapter protein, Grb2. To verify the role of SHP2 phosphatase function in human hematopoietic cell development, human cord blood CD34+ cells were transduced with a leukemia-associated phosphatase gain-of-function SHP2 mutant or with a phosphatase dead SHP2 mutant, which indicated that increased phosphatase function enhanced, while decreased SHP2 phosphatase function reduced, human cord blood-derived colonies. Collectively, these findings indicate that SHP2 phosphatase function regulates human hematopoietic cell development and imply that the phosphatase component of SHP2 may serve as a pharmacologic target in human leukemias bearing increased SHP2 phosphatase activity.","['Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Etienne-Julan, Maryse', 'Gotoh, Akihiko', 'Braun, Stephen E', 'Lu, Li', 'Cooper, Scott', 'Feng, Gen-Sheng', 'Li, Xing Jun', 'Chan, Rebecca J']","['Broxmeyer HE', 'Etienne-Julan M', 'Gotoh A', 'Braun SE', 'Lu L', 'Cooper S', 'Feng GS', 'Li XJ', 'Chan RJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5181, USA. hbroxmey@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*enzymology', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Single-Cell Analysis']",2012/10/23 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0478 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Mar 15;22(6):998-1006. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0478.

We studied gene expression profile of 20 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with HCV infection and 20 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without HCV infection as a control group by c-DNA microarray. Out of the 15,500 studied genes, more than 1000 genes were differentially expressed; either upregulated or downregulated. We found that HCV may rescue B lymphocytes from apoptosis possibly through causing suppression of CASP1 and CASP4 and causing overexpression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 gene. Also, HCV was associated with overexpression of the genes related to myeloid/lymphoid leukemia and B lymphoma as MLLT3, BAL, influences the overexpression of transcription regulator genes as TATA box binding protein (TBP) and may influence the overexpression of some immunoglobulin genes as immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine gene in B cells resulting in overproduction of immunoglobulins in B-lymphocyte disorders. Moreover HCV was associated with reduced expression of MHC class II molecules in B lymphocytes, and therefore inhibition of antigen processing and presentation through downregulation of different MHC class II molecules genes. We conclude that the upregulated and the downregulated genes identified through the studied expression profiles of NHL with HCV infection may shed light on the mechanisms of HCV lymphomagenesis.","['Zekri, Abdel Rahman', 'Ahmed, Hydi', 'Ismail, Medhat', 'El-Nashar, Afaf T', 'El-Mokadem, Tamer', 'Hassan, Ahmed']","['Zekri AR', 'Ahmed H', 'Ismail M', 'El-Nashar AT', 'El-Mokadem T', 'Hassan A']","['Department of Virology & Immunology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PARP9 protein, human)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '0 (TBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases, Initiator)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Caspase 1/genetics', 'Caspases, Initiator/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/01/01 00:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2010;17(2):81-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognostic value of FLT3/ITD in various cytogenetic risk groups is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of FLT3/ITD in patients with de novo AML and normal or favorable risk cytogenetics (NFC-AML). Blood samples from 39 patients with AML were subjected to PCR of exons 14 and 15 of the FLT3 gene. Patients included 25 with normal cytogenetics, 8 with t(15;17), 4 with t(8;21) and 2 with inv(16). FLT3/1ITD was found in 6/39 (15.4%) patients, 4 of them showed normal cytogenetic, 1 positive for t(15;17) and 1 positive for t(8;21). Patients were M1 3/13, M2 2/12, M3 1/9, M4 0/4 and M5 0/1. The patients were followed up for a mean of 34.5 +/- 2.3 months. The complete remission (CR) rates for the FLT3/ITD+ and FLTITD- groups were 50% vs 63.6%, while the relapse rates were 50% vs 28.6% respectively. Interestingly, disease free survival (DFS) at 3 years was significantly different in studied patients: DFS was 5% in patients with FLT3/ITD+ vs 30% of patients with FLT3/ITD- (P = 0.001). Our data suggest a possible high prognostic value of FLT3/ITD in patients with normal/favorable cytogenetics.","['Shahin, Dina', 'Aly, Rabab', 'Ebrahim, Mohamed A']","['Shahin D', 'Aly R', 'Ebrahim MA']","['Departments of Internal Medicine, Mansoura School of Medicine, Oncology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cytogenetics/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2010/01/01 00:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2010;17(2):23-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical staging systems do not allow one to predict if and at what rate there will be disease progression in an individual patient diagnosed with early stage disease. There has been intensive work on clinical and biological factors of potential prognostic relevance that may add to the classic assessment provided by the staging systems. Among these are: Laboratory parameters reflecting the tumor burden or disease activity such as lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation, bone marrow infiltration pattern or lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), serum markers such as soluble CD23, beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) or thymidine kinase (TK), and genetic markers of tumor cells such as genomic aberrations, the mutation status of the variable segments of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (VH), or surrogate markers for these factors (CD38, ZAP-70, LPL). Thirty patients were included in our study, the investigation included CD38 expression, ZAP-70 expression, and interphase Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for the detection of trisomy 12, del 13q14.3, del 17p13, and del 11q22.3. Our results showed positive statistical significant correlation between ZAP-70 expression and CD38 expression with some of the chromosomal aberrations encompassing bad prognosis as ATM and p53. Also CD38 expression was positively correlated with trisomy 12 and p53 deletions. Chromosomal aberrations were found to be present in 76.6% of our patients with 13q deletion as the most frequent abnormality in our patients (46.7%), followed by trisomy 12 (36.7%), then ATM and p53 deletion (26.7%) each. Another interesting finding in our study is the fact that 100% of the ZAP-70 positive patients were of bad prognosis, 58.3% of the CD38 positive cases, 81.8% of the positive trisomy 12 cases, 100% of the ATM deletion, 62.5% of the p53 deletion, and 64.3% of the 13q- cases were also of bad prognosis, which indicates that ZAP-70, trisomy 12, and ATM deletion are powerful indicators of prognosis. We conclude that FISH for the detection of the most important chromosomal aberrations in CLL is an important laboratory parameter that is recommended for assessment and correlation with simultaneous evaluation of ZAP-70 and CD38 expression which could help in the prediction of outcome of CLL patients.","['Hassab, A H', 'Elbordiny, M M', 'Elghandour, A H', 'Sorour, A F', 'Swelem, R S']","['Hassab AH', 'Elbordiny MM', 'Elghandour AH', 'Sorour AF', 'Swelem RS']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood/*genetics', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood/*genetics', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",2011/01/01 00:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/10/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2011;18(2):77-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive mTOR activation seemed to be a general characteristic of primary AML cells. Increased cellular stress induced by serum deprivation increased both mTOR signaling, lysosomal acidity, and in vitro apoptosis, where lysosomal acidity/apoptosis were independent of increased mTOR signaling. Rapamycin had antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects only for a subset of patients. Proapoptotic effect was detected for AML cell lines only in the presence of serum. Combination of rapamycin with valproic acid, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and NF-kappaB inhibitors showed no interference with constitutive mTOR activation and mTOR inhibitory effect of rapamycin and no additional proapoptotic effect compared to rapamycin alone. In contrast, dual inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway by rapamycin plus a PI3K inhibitor induced new functional effects that did not simply reflect a summary of single drug effects.

Loss of Cited2 in mice results in cardiac and aortic arch malformations, adrenal agenesis, neural tube and placental defects, and partially penetrant defects in left-right patterning. By screening 1126 sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD) cases and 1227 controls, we identified 19 variants, including 5 unique non-synonymous sequence variations (N62S, R92G, T166N, G180-A187del and A187T) in patients. Many of the CHD-specific variants identified in this and previous studies cluster in the SRJ domain. Transient transfection experiments show that T166N mutation impairs TFAP2 co-activation function and ES cell proliferation. We find that CITED2 is phosphorylated by MAPK1 in vitro at T166, and that MAPK1 activation enhances the coactivation function of CITED2 but not of CITED2-T166N. In order to investigate the functional significance in vivo, we generated a T166N mutation of mouse Cited2. We also used PhiC31 integrase-mediated cassette exchange to generate a Cited2 knock-in allele replacing the mouse Cited2 coding sequence with human CITED2 and with a mutant form deleting the entire SRJ domain. Mouse embryos expressing only CITED2-T166N or CITED2-SRJ-deleted alleles surprisingly show no morphological abnormalities, and mice are viable and fertile. These results indicate that the SRJ domain is dispensable for these functions of CITED2 in mice and that mutations clustering in the SRJ region are unlikely to be the sole cause of the malformations observed in patients with sporadic CHD. Our results also suggest that coding sequence mutations observed in case-control studies need validation using in vivo models and that predictions based on structural conservation and in vitro functional assays, or even in vivo global loss of function models, may be insufficient.","['Chen, Chiann-mun', 'Bentham, Jamie', 'Cosgrove, Catherine', 'Braganca, Jose', 'Cuenda, Ana', 'Bamforth, Simon D', 'Schneider, Jurgen E', 'Watkins, Hugh', 'Keavney, Bernard', 'Davies, Benjamin', 'Bhattacharya, Shoumo']","['Chen CM', 'Bentham J', 'Cosgrove C', 'Braganca J', 'Cuenda A', 'Bamforth SD', 'Schneider JE', 'Watkins H', 'Keavney B', 'Davies B', 'Bhattacharya S']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CITED2 protein, human)', '0 (Cited2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/anatomy & histology/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0046256 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-24694 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46256. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0046256.

We tested whether a combination with ethacrynic acid (EA), a glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) inhibitor, and a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducer will extend the therapeutic effect of ATO beyond APL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The combined apoptotic effects of ATO plus ethacrynic acid were tested in non-APL leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. The role of ROS, GSTP1-1, glutathione (GSH), and Mcl-1 in apoptosis was determined. The selective response to this combination of cells with and without GSTP1-1 expression was compared. RESULTS: ATO/EA combination synergistically induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemia and lymphoma cells. This treatment produced high ROS levels, activated c-jun-NH(2)-kinase (JNK), and reduced Mcl-1 protein. This led to the decrease of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and subsequently, to activation of caspase-3 and -9. Induction of apoptosis in leukemia and lymphoma cells expressing GSTP1-1 required high ethacrynic acid concentrations to be combined with ATO. Silencing of GSTP1 in leukemia cells sensitized them to ATO/EA-induced apoptosis. In a subgroup of B-cell lymphoma, which does not express GSTP1-1, lower concentrations of ethacrynic acid and its more potent derivative, ethacrynic acid butyl-ester (EABE), decreased intracellular GSH levels and synergistically induced apoptosis when combined with ATO. CONCLUSION: B-cell lymphoma cells lacking GSTP1-1 are more sensitive than myeloid leukemia cells to ATO/EA-induced apoptosis.","['Wang, Rui', 'Liu, Changda', 'Xia, Lijuan', 'Zhao, Guisen', 'Gabrilove, Janice', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Wang R', 'Liu C', 'Xia L', 'Zhao G', 'Gabrilove J', 'Waxman S', 'Jing Y']","['The Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (ethacrynic acid butyl ester)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'M5DP350VZV (Ethacrynic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ethacrynic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphoma', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-0770 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0770 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Dec 15;18(24):6690-701. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0770.

In clinical trials, arsenic therapy is closely associated with hepatic toxicity. The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid against As(2)O(3)-induced hepatotoxicity. A 4 mg/kg body weight (bw) of As(2)O(3) was orally administered to Wistar male rats for 45 days. Hepatotoxicity was evaluated by biochemical tests, antioxidant assays and histopathological examinations. Arsenic accumulation was found in the liver tissue of rats treated with As(2)O(3). Hepatoprotective efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid was analysed by the combination therapy with As(2)O(3). In vivo studies revealed a significant rise in lipid peroxidation with concomitant decline in reduced glutathione, glutathione-dependant antioxidant enzymes and antiperoxidative enzymes in the liver tissue of rats treated with arsenic. The supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 50 mg/kg bw with As(2)O(3) offers ameliorative effect against hepatocellular toxicity. Omega-3 fatty acid maintained hepatic marker enzymes, antioxidant enzymes and decreased lipid peroxidation. The combination treatment clearly reduced the hepatic structural abnormalities such as haemorrhage, necrosis and cholangiofibrosis in the rats treated with arsenic. This study concludes that the omega-3 fatty acid might be useful for the protection against As(2)O(3)-induced hepatotoxicity.","['Mathews, Varghese V', 'Paul, Mv Sauganth', 'Abhilash, M', 'Manju, Alex', 'Abhilash, S', 'Nair, R Harikumaran']","['Mathews VV', 'Paul MS', 'Abhilash M', 'Manju A', 'Abhilash S', 'Nair RH']","['Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, P.D Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, P.D Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, P.D Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, P.D Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, P.D Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, P.D Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India harinairsbs@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Body Weight', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/drug therapy/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oxides/*adverse effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2012/10/20 06:00,2015/05/28 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0748233712463778 [pii]', '10.1177/0748233712463778 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2014 Oct;30(9):806-13. doi: 10.1177/0748233712463778.

METHODS: Children younger than 18 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma scheduled to undergo chemotherapy were randomized to receive oral ciprofloxacin 20mg/kg/day or placebo from the beginning of their chemotherapy. Rectal swab cultures were taken before and at 1 and/or 2 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: Of the total of 95 patients, 45 and 50 patients received ciprofloxacin and placebo, respectively. Of the 71 patients who developed neutropenia, the proportion of children who developed fever was significantly lower in the ciprofloxacin group than in the placebo group (17/34 [50.0%] versus 27/37 [73.0%]; absolute difference in risk, -23.0%; 95% confidence interval: -45.0% to -0.9%; P = 0.046). Ciprofloxacin significantly reduced the occurrence of febrile episodes in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the induction phase of chemotherapy, but not in patients with lymphoma or in the consolidation phase of chemotherapy. Adverse effects were not different between the groups. After intervention, the percentages of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptible to ciprofloxacin were significantly lower in the ciprofloxacin group. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin can prevent fever in neutropenic patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the induction phase of chemotherapy with good tolerance and no serious side effects. Due to the selective pressure of intestinal flora resistance to ciprofloxacin, the long-term effectiveness needs further investigation.","['Laoprasopwattana, Kamolwish', 'Khwanna, Thida', 'Suwankeeree, Pussayaban', 'Sujjanunt, Tipwan', 'Tunyapanit, Wanutsanun', 'Chelae, Sureerat']","['Laoprasopwattana K', 'Khwanna T', 'Suwankeeree P', 'Sujjanunt T', 'Tunyapanit W', 'Chelae S']","['Departments of Pediatrics, Prince of Songkla University, Hat-Yai, Songkhla, Thailand. kamolwish@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Placebos)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/adverse effects/methods', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ciprofloxacin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Fever/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/*complications', 'Placebos/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rectum/microbiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e3182793610 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013 Mar;32(3):e94-8. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e3182793610.,10.1097/INF.0b013e3182793610 [doi],,,,,['Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013 May;32(5):581.

To enable the clinical evaluation of the concept of mHag-based immunotherapy and subsequent broad implementation, the identification of more hematopoietic mHags with broad applicability is imperative. Here we describe novel mHag UTA2-1 with ideal characteristics for this purpose. We identified this antigen using genome-wide zygosity-genotype correlation analysis of a mHag-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone derived from a multiple myeloma patient who achieved a long-lasting complete remission after donor lymphocyte infusion from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling. UTA2-1 is a polymorphic peptide presented by the common HLA molecule HLA-A*02:01, which is encoded by the bi-allelic hematopoietic-specific gene C12orf35. Tetramer analyses demonstrated an expansion of UTA2-1-directed T cells in patient blood samples after several donor T-cell infusions that mediated clinical GvT responses. More importantly, UTA2-1-specific CTL effectively lysed mHag(+) hematopoietic cells, including patient myeloma cells, without affecting non-hematopoietic cells. Thus, with the capacity to induce relevant immunotherapeutic CTLs, it's HLA-A*02 restriction and equally balanced phenotype frequency, UTA2-1 is a highly valuable mHag to facilitate clinical application of mHag-based immunotherapy.","['Oostvogels, R', 'Minnema, M C', 'van Elk, M', 'Spaapen, R M', 'te Raa, G D', 'Giovannone, B', 'Buijs, A', 'van Baarle, D', 'Kater, A P', 'Griffioen, M', 'Spierings, E', 'Lokhorst, H M', 'Mutis, T']","['Oostvogels R', 'Minnema MC', 'van Elk M', 'Spaapen RM', 'te Raa GD', 'Giovannone B', 'Buijs A', 'van Baarle D', 'Kater AP', 'Griffioen M', 'Spierings E', 'Lokhorst HM', 'Mutis T']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Immunotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012277 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.277 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):642-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.277.

Accumulation of unbound alpha-globin chains in erythroid cells is the major cause of pathology in beta-thalassemia.

We examined gamma-globin-inducing effect of curcuminoids extracted from Curcuma longa L. and their metabolite reduced forms in erythroid leukemia K562 and human primary erythroid precursor cells. The results showed that curcuminoid compounds, especially bisdemethoxycurcumin are potential gamma-globin enhancers. We also demonstrated that its reduced analog, hexahydrobisdemethoxycurcumin (HHBDMC), is most effective and leads to induction of gamma-globin mRNA and HbF in primary erythroid precursor cells for 3.6 +/- 0.4- and 2.0 +/- 0.4-folds, respectively. This suggested that HHBDMC is the potential agent to be developed as a new therapeutic drug for beta-thalassemia and related beta-hemoglobinopathies.","['Chaneiam, Nattawara', 'Changtam, Chatchawan', 'Mungkongdee, Thongperm', 'Suthatvoravut, Umaporn', 'Winichagoon, Pranee', 'Vadolas, Jim', 'Suksamrarn, Apichart', 'Fucharoen, Suthat', 'Svasti, Saovaros']","['Chaneiam N', 'Changtam C', 'Mungkongdee T', 'Suthatvoravut U', 'Winichagoon P', 'Vadolas J', 'Suksamrarn A', 'Fucharoen S', 'Svasti S']","['Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University, Nakhonpathom, 73170, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Diarylheptanoids)', '0 (gamma-Globins)', '2EFO1BP34R (bis(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)methane)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'W2F8059T80 (demethoxycurcumin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Diarylheptanoids', 'Erythroid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/agonists/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'gamma-Globins/agonists/biosynthesis']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1604-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Mar;92(3):379-86. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1604-1.

Disturbance at either level could cause dysregulation of miRNAs. Here, we show that MLL fusion proteins negatively regulate production of miR-150, an miRNA widely repressed in acute leukemia, by blocking miR-150 precursors from being processed to mature miRNAs through MYC/LIN28 functional axis. Forced expression of miR-150 dramatically inhibited leukemic cell growth and delayed MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis, likely through targeting FLT3 and MYB and thereby interfering with the HOXA9/MEIS1/FLT3/MYB signaling network, which in turn caused downregulation of MYC/LIN28. Collectively, we revealed a MLL-fusion/MYC/LIN28 dash, verticalmiR-150 dash, verticalFLT3/MYB/HOXA9/MEIS1 signaling circuit underlying the pathogenesis of leukemia, where miR-150 functions as a pivotal gatekeeper and its repression is required for leukemogenesis.","['Jiang, Xi', 'Huang, Hao', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Chen, Ping', 'He, Chunjiang', 'You, Dewen', 'Zhang, Shuodan', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Arnovitz, Stephen', 'Elkahloun, Abdel', 'Price, Colles', 'Hong, Gia-Ming', 'Ren, Haomin', 'Kunjamma, Rejani B', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Matthews, Jonathan M', 'Xu, Mengyi', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Slany, Robert K', 'Liu, Paul P', 'Lu, Jun', 'Zhang, Jiwang', 'He, Chuan', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Jiang X', 'Huang H', 'Li Z', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Chen P', 'He C', 'You D', 'Zhang S', 'Wang J', 'Arnovitz S', 'Elkahloun A', 'Price C', 'Hong GM', 'Ren H', 'Kunjamma RB', 'Neilly MB', 'Matthews JM', 'Xu M', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Slany RK', 'Liu PP', 'Lu J', 'Zhang J', 'He C', 'Chen J']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Lin28A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN150 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(12)00391-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2012.08.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2012 Oct 16;22(4):524-35. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2012.08.028.,10.1016/j.ccr.2012.08.028 [doi] S1535-6108(12)00391-1 [pii],,"['P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL95896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL095896/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3480215,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Though the specific etiology of disseminated neoplasia in Mya arenaria remains undetermined, the involvement of viral pathogens and/or environmental pollutants has been suggested and considered. The current study used 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) known to induce the murine leukemia virus and filtered neoplastic hemolymph to initiate disseminated neoplasia in clams from different populations and size classes respectively. M. arenaria from three locations of different natural neoplasia occurrences were divided into a control and three experimental treatments and injected with 200 mul of sterile filtered seawater or 50-200 mug/ml BrDU respectively. In a concurrent experiment, animals from different size classes were injected with 2.5% total blood volume of 0.2 mum filtered blood from a fully neoplastic animal. Animals were biopsied weekly and cell neoplasia development was counted and scored as 0-25, 26-50, 51-75 and 76-100% neoplastic hemocytes (stages 1-4) in 50 mul samples. BrDU injection demonstrated that neoplasia development in M. arenaria was dose dependent on BrDU concentration. In addition, natural disease prevalence at the source location determined initiation of neoplasia induction, with animals from the area of the highest natural disease occurrence displaying fastest neoplasia development (p=0.0037). This could imply that depending on the natural disease occurrence, a potential infectious agent may remain dormant in normal (stage 1) individuals in higher concentrations until activated, i.e. through chemical injection or potentially stress. The size experiment demonstrated that only M. arenaria between 40 and 80 mm developed 26-100% neoplastic hemocytes when injected with filtered neoplastic hemolymph, indicating that individuals smaller than 20mm or larger than 80 mm were not or no longer susceptible to disease development.

The treatment of melanoma cells with bortezomib was found to induce apoptosis together with the upregulation of Noxa, Mcl-1, and HSP70 proteins, and the cleavage of LC3 and autophagic formation. Also, bortezomib induced ER-stress as evidenced by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+) release. In addition, bortezomib enhanced the phosphorylation of inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1alpha (IRE1alpha), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, and the activation of the transcription factors AP-1, ATF-2, Ets-1, and HSF1. Bortezomib-induced mitochondrial dysregulation was associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the release of both apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The pretreatment of melanoma cells with the inhibitor of caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-CHO) was found to block bortezomib-induced apoptosis that subsequently led to the increase of autophagic formation. In contrast, the inhibition of ASK1 abrogated bortezomib-induced autophagic formation and increased apoptosis induction. Furthermore, the inhibition of JNK, of HSP70 also increased apoptosis induction without influence of bortezomib-induced autophagic formation. Based on the inhibitory experiments, the treatment with bortezomib triggers the activation of both ER-stress-associated pathways, namely IRE1alpha-ASK1-p38-ATF-2/ets-1-Mcl-1, and IRE1alpha-ASK1-JNK-AP-1/HSF1-HSP70 as well as mitochondrial dysregulation-associated pathways, namely ROS-ASK1-JNK-AP-1/HSF1-HS70, and AIF-caspase-3-PARP and Cyt.c, and caspase-9-caspase-3-PARP. Taken together, our data demonstrates for the first time the molecular mechanisms, whereby bortezomib triggers both apoptosis and autophagic formation in melanoma cells.","['Selimovic, Denis', 'Porzig, Benjamin B O W', 'El-Khattouti, Abdelouahid', 'Badura, Helene E', 'Ahmad, Mutmid', 'Ghanjati, Foued', 'Santourlidis, Simeon', 'Haikel, Youssef', 'Hassan, Mohamed']","['Selimovic D', 'Porzig BB', 'El-Khattouti A', 'Badura HE', 'Ahmad M', 'Ghanjati F', 'Santourlidis S', 'Haikel Y', 'Hassan M']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, U 977, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*toxicity', 'Bortezomib', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/metabolism', 'Melanoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*toxicity', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(12)00284-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Jan;25(1):308-18. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.10.004.

In addition to cytotoxic chemotherapies, hypomethylating agents such as decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and azacitidine (5-azacytidine), have been approved during the past decade and represent a very important option for the treatment of MDS today. Due to their lower toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents are often a safe and feasible alternative also for frail patients. Decitabine has been shown to be active in numerous studies including International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) intermediate-1 to high risk patients, in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arising from MDS, and in MDS with poor-risk cytogenetics. Furthermore, decitabine has been studied in the allograft setting and in combination treatment regimens, and may play a role in epigenetic ""priming"" before conventional chemotherapy.

Scant literature exists regarding treatment of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia in patients with renal failure. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to report a safe and effective means of treatment for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia in the setting of advanced renal failure, employing titration of arsenic trioxide based on clinical parameters rather than arsenic trioxide levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old Caucasian man with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia in remission for 3 years, as well as dialysis-dependent chronic renal failure secondary to a solitary kidney and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and human immunodeficiency virus infection, receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy presented to our hospital with bone marrow biopsy-confirmed relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia. Arsenic trioxide was begun at a low dose with dose escalation based only on side effect profile monitoring and not laboratory testing for induction as well as maintenance without undue toxicity. Our patient achieved and remains in complete hematologic and molecular remission as of this writing. CONCLUSION: Arsenic trioxide can be used safely and effectively to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia in patients with advanced renal failure using careful monitoring of side effects rather than blood levels of arsenic to guide therapeutic dosing.","['Emmons, Gregory S', 'Steingart, Richard H', 'Stewart, James A', 'Mertens, Wilson C']","['Emmons GS', 'Steingart RH', 'Stewart JA', 'Mertens WC']","['Baystate Regional Cancer Program, 3400A Main Street, Springfield, MA 01199, USA. wilson.mertens@baystatehealth.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2012/10/20 06:00,2012/10/20 06:01,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-355 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-355 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 Oct 18;6:355. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-355.,10.1186/1752-1947-6-355 [doi],20121018,,,PMC3514175,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, they are thought to be able to undergo stimulation and become antigen-presenting cells possibly through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Several studies have examined the effect of TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation on the biology of CLL cells, revealing contradictory results in terms of cell proliferation and apoptosis. On the other hand, suppression of TLRs has not been studied in CLL so far, and the rationale for this may be increasing evidence of the supportive role of TLR signaling in CLL. In our study we assessed the effect of a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide with immunoregulatory sequences (IRS 954) on peripheral blood cells from patients with untreated CLL, in terms of expression of costimulatory molecules, production of cytokines and cell viability ex vivo. Agonists of TLR7 (imiquimod, IMI) and TLR9 (oligodeoxynucleotide ODN 2006) acted as positive internal controls. ODN 2006 most markedly induced CD86 expression compared to IMI and IRS 954. Both oligodeoxynucleotides - IRS 954 and ODN 2006 - caused 1.5- and 5-fold increases of CD40 on CLL cells, respectively. Immunostimulatory ODN 2006 induced CD95 expression 1.5-fold. Changes in costimulatory molecule expression were accompanied by a moderate response from CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. TLR7 and TLR9 agonists led to significantly higher production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-10. IRS 954 and ODN 2006 markedly increased the concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). IL-17A was significantly decreased by 50% after IMI. IRS 954 and IMI induced significant necrosis at all concentrations, and the effect was augmented by the addition of cladribine (2CdA). ODN 2006 presented a dual effect on cell viability, which was related to disease stage and baseline IL-17A concentration. The addition of 2CdA had little effect in a group where ODN 2006 supported cell survival, and further enhanced cytotoxicity of ODN 2006 in the second group. Inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides seem to exert promising antileukemic effects regardless of sample background, and thus may become a new modality in CLL.

A frequent side effect of etoposide is myelosuppression, which restricts the use of this drug. Antioxidants from the polyphenol group have the potential to limit this damage. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of (-)-epicatechin and curcumin on DNA damage and myelosuppression induced by etoposide in bone marrow cells of male rats. Rats were treated with the following: 1) (-)-epicatechin [20 and 40 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) by gavage] or curcumin (100 and 200 mg/kg b.w. by gavage) for 7 days; 2) etoposide (50 mg/kg b.w., intraperitoneally) for 3 days; 3) (-)-epicatechin or curcumin for 4 days, followed by coadministration of etoposide for the last 3 days of the experiment; and 4) solvents of the examined compounds (control group). Bone marrow cells were isolated, and DNA damage was analyzed by comet assay. Bone marrow smears were evaluated cytologically. Etoposide administration induced serious DNA damage and hypoplasia of bone marrow. Both curcumin and (-)-epicatechin significantly attenuated etoposide-induced oxidative DNA damage. Curcumin also significantly reduced the DNA strand break and hypoplasia caused by cytostatic drug. This polyphenol increased the percentage of granulocytic precursors and lymphocytes diminished by etoposide. Curcumin exerted greater protection than (-)-epicatechin against undesirable effects induced by the cytostatic.","['Papiez, Monika A']",['Papiez MA'],"['Department of Cytobiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. monika.papiez@uj.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Catechin/*pharmacology', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Polyphenols/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",2012/10/20 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2012/10/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01480545.2012.726626 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2013 Jan;36(1):93-101. doi: 10.3109/01480545.2012.726626.

Out these 8 samples 2 were from healthy people, 3 from chronic granulocytic leukemia patients, 2 from multiple myeloma patients and 2 from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Bone aspirates from healthy people were used to optimize the culture method and the rest were used for testing the optimized method. Two methods were tried: 1. Cell culture starting from whole bone marrow, 2) cell culture after bone marrow separation in density gradient with Histopaque. RESULTS: Cell culture starting from whole bone marrow gives better yields for mesenchymal stem cells than methods which include gradient density separation of mononuclear cells with Ficoll-Histopaque.

Recent studies show different mechanisms leading to miRNA deregulation in cancer; however, alterations affecting miRNAs by DNA copy number variations (CNV) remain poorly studied. RESULTS: Our integrative analysis including data from high resolution SNPs arrays, mRNA expression arrays, and miRNAs expression profiles in 16 myeloid cell lines highlights that CNV are alternative mechanisms to deregulate the expression of miRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and represent a novel approach to identify novel candidate genes involved in AML. We found association between the expression levels of 19 miRNAs and CNVs affecting their loci. Functional analysis showed that NF1 is a direct target of miR-370, and that overexpression of miR-370 has similar effects that NF1 inactivation, increasing proliferation and colony formation in AML cells. Moreover, real time RT-PCR showed that NF1 downregulation is a recurrent event in AML (30.8%), and western blot analysis confirmed this result. MiR-370 overexpression and deletions affecting the NF1 locus were identified as alternative mechanisms to downregulate NF1. CONCLUSIONS: NF1 downregulation is a common event in AML, and both deletions in the NF1 locus and overexpression of miR-370 are alternative mechanisms to downregulate NF1 in this disease. Our results suggest a leukemogenic role of miR-370 through NF1 downregulation in AML cells. Since NF1 deficiency leads to RAS activation, patients with AML and overexpression of miR-370 may potentially benefit from additional treatment with either RAS or mTOR inhibitors.","['Garcia-Orti, Laura', 'Cristobal, Ion', 'Cirauqui, Cristina', 'Guruceaga, Elisabet', 'Marcotegui, Nerea', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Castello-Cros, Remedios', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Garcia-Orti L', 'Cristobal I', 'Cirauqui C', 'Guruceaga E', 'Marcotegui N', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Castello-Cros R', 'Odero MD']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MIRN370 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', '*Neurofibromin 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', '*RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0047717 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-13664 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47717. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0047717.

In the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, antagonism of LIF and genetic deletion of CNTF worsen disease. The potential mechanism of action of these cytokines in EAE is complex, as gp130 is expressed by all neural cells, and could involve immuno-modulation, reduction of oligodendrocyte injury, neuronal protection, or a combination of these actions. In this study we aim to investigate whether the beneficial effects of CNTF/LIF signalling in EAE are associated with axonal protection; and whether this requires signalling through oligodendrocytes. We induced MOG(3)(5)(-)(5)(5) EAE in CNTF, LIF and double knockout mice. On a CNTF null background, LIF knockout was associated with increased EAE severity (EAE grade 2.1+/-0.14 vs 2.6+/-0.19; P<0.05). These mice also showed increased axonal damage relative to LIF heterozygous mice, as indicated by decreased optic nerve parallel diffusivity on MRI (1540+/-207 microm(2)-/s vs 1310+/-175 microm(2)-/s; P<0.05), and optic nerve (-12.5%) and spinal cord (-16%) axon densities; and increased serum neurofilament-H levels (2.5 fold increase). No differences in inflammatory cell numbers or peripheral auto-immune T-cell priming were evident. Oligodendrocyte-targeted gp130 knockout mice showed that disruption of CNTF/LIF signalling in these cells has no effect on acute EAE severity. These studies demonstrate that endogenous CNTF and LIF act centrally to protect axons from acute inflammatory destruction via an oligodendrocyte-independent mechanism.","['Gresle, Melissa M', 'Alexandrou, Estella', 'Wu, Qizhu', 'Egan, Gary', 'Jokubaitis, Vilija', 'Ayers, Margaret', 'Jonas, Anna', 'Doherty, William', 'Friedhuber, Anna', 'Shaw, Gerry', 'Sendtner, Michael', 'Emery, Ben', 'Kilpatrick, Trevor', 'Butzkueven, Helmut']","['Gresle MM', 'Alexandrou E', 'Wu Q', 'Egan G', 'Jokubaitis V', 'Ayers M', 'Jonas A', 'Doherty W', 'Friedhuber A', 'Shaw G', 'Sendtner M', 'Emery B', 'Kilpatrick T', 'Butzkueven H']","['Department of Medicine, The Melbourne Brain Centre at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. mgresle@unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligodendroglia/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0047379 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-21325 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47379. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0047379.

To identify new regulators, we carried out a screen of 43 human TRIM proteins for the ability to activate NF-kappaB, AP-1, and interferon, hallmarks of many innate immune signaling pathways. We identified 16 TRIM proteins that induced NF-kappaB and/or AP-1. We found that one of these, TRIM62, functions in the TRIF branch of the TLR4 signaling pathway. Knockdown of TRIM62 in primary macrophages led to a defect in TRIF-mediated late NF-kappaB, AP-1, and interferon production after lipopolysaccharide challenge. We also discovered a role for TRIM15 in the RIG-I-mediated interferon pathway upstream of MAVS. Knockdown of TRIM15 limited virus/RIG-I ligand-induced interferon production and enhanced vesicular stomatitis virus replication. In addition, most TRIM proteins previously identified to inhibit murine leukemia virus (MLV) demonstrated an ability to induce NF-kappaB/AP-1. Interfering with the NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling induced by the antiretroviral TRIM1 and TRIM62 proteins rescued MLV release. In contrast, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression was increased by TRIM proteins that induce NF-kappaB. HIV-1 resistance to inflammatory TRIM proteins mapped to the NF-kappaB sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) U3 and could be transferred to MLV. Thus, our work identifies new TRIM proteins involved in innate immune signaling and reinforces the striking ability of HIV-1 to exploit innate immune signaling for the purpose of viral replication.","['Uchil, Pradeep D', 'Hinz, Angelika', 'Siegel, Steven', 'Coenen-Stass, Anna', 'Pertel, Thomas', 'Luban, Jeremy', 'Mothes, Walther']","['Uchil PD', 'Hinz A', 'Siegel S', 'Coenen-Stass A', 'Pertel T', 'Luban J', 'Mothes W']","['Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TRAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interferons/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Vesiculovirus/*immunology']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01804-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01804-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jan;87(1):257-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01804-12.

Here we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells possess greater constitutive nuclear levels of Nrf2 than normal control CD34(+) cells because of an imbalance between mRNA expression levels of Nrf2 and its inhibitor Keap1 but not through their somatic mutation. Elevated Nrf2 was reduced by NF-kappaB inhibitors. Using promoter assays, ChIP and siRNA knockdown, we demonstrated NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 induce transcription of Nrf2 in AML cells at a specific promoter kappaB-site and that long-term lentiviral miRNA-knockdown of Nrf2 significantly reduced clonogenicity of AML patient cells and improved their chemotherapeutic responsiveness. Normal physiologic Nrf2 protects cells from damage, but here we have exposed aberrant continuous nuclear activation of Nrf2 in AML that allows cell survival, even against cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. We show for the first time that Nrf2, an important regulator of several biologic processes involved in the progression of cancer, has abnormal NF-kappaB-driven constitutive expression in AML. Such a mechanism allows for a greater cytoprotective response in human AML cells and encourages their evasion of chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity, which is necessary for improved clinical outcomes.","['Rushworth, Stuart A', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Murray, Megan Y', 'Shah, Niraj M', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Rushworth SA', 'Zaitseva L', 'Murray MY', 'Shah NM', 'Bowles KM', 'MacEwan DJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/02/16 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47443-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-422121 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 20;120(26):5188-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-422121.

Additional abnormalities involving der(21)t(12;21) and nonrearranged chromosome 12 are well characterized but aberrations involving the der(12)t(12;21) have rarely been described. Herein, we describe two novel abnormalities affecting the der(12)t(12;21): a deletion (20/247, 8%) and duplication (10/247, 4%). All 30 patients were under 10 years of age, had a median white blood count of 12.4 x 10(9)/L and 19.2 x 10(9)/L, respectively, with a good outcome. Deletions of der(12)t(12;21) on both sides of the breakpoint were confirmed and mapped: centromeric (12p11.21-12p13.2) and telomeric (21q22.12-21q22.3). The size of these deletions extended from 0.4-13.4 to 0.8-2.5 Mb, respectively. The centromeric deletion encompassed the following genes: LRP6, BCL2L14, DUSP16, CREBL2, and CDKN1B. We postulate that this deletion occurs at the same time as the translocation because it was present in all ETV6-RUNX1-positive cells. A second abnormality representing duplication of the reciprocal RUNX1-ETV6 fusion gene was a secondary event, which we hypothesize arose through mitotic recombination errors. This led to the formation of the following chromosome: der(12)(21qter-->21q22.12::12p13.2-12p12.3::12p12.3-->12qter). Both abnormalities affect the reciprocal RUNX1-ETV6 fusion product which could either eliminate or amplify its expression and thus contribute to leukemogenesis. However, other consequences such as haploinsufficiency of tumor suppressor genes and amplification of oncogenes could also be driving forces behind these aberrations. In conclusion, this study has defined novel abnormalities in ETV6-RUNX1 BCP-ALL, which implicate new genes involved in leukemogenesis.","['Al-Shehhi, Halima', 'Konn, Zoe J', 'Schwab, Claire J', 'Erhorn, Amy', 'Barber, Kerry E', 'Wright, Sarah L', 'Gabriel, Alem S', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Moorman, Anthony V']","['Al-Shehhi H', 'Konn ZJ', 'Schwab CJ', 'Erhorn A', 'Barber KE', 'Wright SL', 'Gabriel AS', 'Harrison CJ', 'Moorman AV']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (BCL2L14 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (CREBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (LRP6 protein, human)', '0 (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Centromere/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6/genetics', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis/methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases/genetics', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Telomere/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22021 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2013 Feb;52(2):202-13. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22021.

While the effects of doxorubicin on hematopoietic cells have been characterized, less is known about the response of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in the bone marrow stroma to anthracyclines. We characterized the effect of doxorubicin on key DNA damage responses in hMSCs, and compared doxorubicin sensitivity and DNA damage response activation between isolated hMSCs and the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562. Phosphorylation of H2AX, Chk1, and RPA2 was more strongly activated in K562 cells than in hMSCs, at equivalent doses of doxorubicin. hMSCs were relatively resistant to doxorubicin such that, following exposure to 15 muM doxorubicin, the level of cleaved caspase-3 detected by western blotting was lower in hMSCs compared to K562 cells. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle progression demonstrated that exposure to doxorubicin induced G2/M phase arrest in hMSCs, while 48 h after exposure, 15.6 % of cells were apoptotic, as determined from the percentage of cells having sub-G1 DNA content. We also show that the doxorubicin sensitivity of hMSCs isolated from a healthy donor was comparable to that of hMSCs isolated from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient. Overall, our results demonstrate that high doses of doxorubicin induce the DNA damage response in hMSCs, and that cultured hMSCs are relatively resistant to doxorubicin.","['Cruet-Hennequart, Severine', 'Prendergast, Aine M', 'Shaw, Georgina', 'Barry, Frank P', 'Carty, Michael P']","['Cruet-Hennequart S', 'Prendergast AM', 'Shaw G', 'Barry FP', 'Carty MP']","['DNA Damage Response Laboratory, Centre for Chromosome Biology and School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland. severine.hennequart@unicaen.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.1 (Inorganic Pyrophosphatase)', 'EC 3.6.1.1 (PPA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', '*DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Female', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inorganic Pyrophosphatase/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1196-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Nov;96(5):649-56. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1196-5.

FAT1 and FAT4 undergo the first proteolytic cleavage by Furin and are predicted to undergo the second cleavage by gammasecretase to release intracellular domain (ICD). Ena/VAPSbinding to FAT1 induces actin polymerization at lamellipodia and filopodia to promote cell migration, while Scribblebinding to FAT1 induces phosphorylation and functional inhibition of YAP1 to suppress cell growth. FAT1 is repressed in oral cancer owing to homozygous deletion or epigenetic silencing and is preferentially downregulated in invasive breast cancer. On the other hand, FAT1 is upregulated in leukemia and prognosis of preBALL patients with FAT1 upregulation is poor. FAT4 directly interacts with MPDZ/MUPP1 to recruit membraneassociated guanylate kinase MPP5/PALS1. FAT4 is involved in the maintenance of PCP and inhibition of cell proliferation. FAT4 mRNA is repressed in breast cancer and lung cancer due to promoter hypermethylation. FAT4 gene is recurrently mutated in several types of human cancers, such as melanoma, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. FAT1 and FAT4 suppress tumor growth via activation of Hippo signaling, whereas FAT1 promotes tumor migration via induction of actin polymerization. FAT1 is tumor suppressive or oncogenic in a contextdependent manner, while FAT4 is tumor suppressive.

However, it may be difficult to interpret FFR for the stenosis of the donor artery of chronic total occlusion (CTO), because revascularization of CTO may improve FFR of the donor artery. We present a case of 32-year-old male who had a CTO in right coronary artery (RCA), 90% stenoses in left circumflex artery (LCx) and a mild stenosis in the middle segment of left anterior descending artery (LAD). FFR for the mild stenosis in LAD showed significant value (0.72). However LAD was the donor artery to CTO of RCA, revascularization to RCA was expected to improve FFR for LAD. As the patient had chronic granulocytic leukemia and the difficulty in continuing dual antiplatelet therapy, we selected coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to RCA and LCx, and we decided not to perform anastomosis to LAD. Although each graft was patent and collateral flow from LAD to RCA disappeared after CABG, FFR for LAD was still 0.72. Careful consideration should be given when interpreting FFR for the donor artery to a CTO lesion.

Its action is affected by bleomycin hydrolase (BLH), DNA repair enzymes, membrane transport proteins and other cellular factors. To clarify whether BLH confers the resistance to bleomycin in tumor cells, it is necessary to further investigate the roles of BLH and its combination with other factors such as caveolin-1 in the action of bleomycin. In this study fourteen human cell lines were used for determination of bleomycin action and roles of BLH and caveolin-1. The relationship between action of bleomycin and cellular amount of BLH was detected by the MTT method and western blotting in the human leukemia cell line HL-60, HeLa cervical cancer cells and HaCaT immortalized keratinocyte cells. The sensitivity to bleomycin was increased in HeLa cells after knockdown of BLH mRNA by RNA interference. There is no relationship between caveolin-1 levels and action of bleomycin, although the distribution of the cell cycle was altered in the caveolin-1-knockdown HeLa cells after treatment with bleomycin. In addition, regulation of BLH and caveolin-1 expression in HeLa and HaCaT cells was observed in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to bleomycin. In conclusion, bleomycin hydrolase is one of the biomarkers for determination of bleomycin action. Although caveolin-1 can respond to bleomycin treatment, it is unrelated to bleomycin sensitivity.","['Chen, Jianguo', 'Chen, Yang', 'He, Qiyang']","['Chen J', 'Chen Y', 'He Q']","['Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100050, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.40 (bleomycin hydrolase)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Bleomycin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Caveolin 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'RNA Interference']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1668 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Dec;41(6):2245-52. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1668.

The identification of lung cancer associated genes is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Lung cancer metastasis-related protein 1 (LCMR1) is a novel gene cloned by differential display polymerase chain reaction in our laboratory. This study was designed to investigate the role of LCMR1 in the generation of apoptosis in lung cancer cells. RNA interference (RNAi) approach was used to knock down LCMR1 in lung cancer cells. The impacts of LCMR1 knockdown on the apoptosis of lung cancer cells were assessed using flow cytometry, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. The results demonstrated that the inhibition of LCMR1 by RNAi enhanced apoptotic activity in lung cancer cells and this process required the involvement of p53. In addition, LCMR1 knockdown resulted in the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Mcl-1. In conclusion, LCMR1 suppresses apoptosis in lung cancer cells and this effect is associated with multiple apoptosis-related proteins, including p53, Bax and Mcl-1. These results provide new insights into the potential role of LCMR1 in the regulation of lung cancer carcinogenesis.","['Xu, Yang', 'Li, Chunsun', 'Tian, Qing', 'Li, Yanqin', 'Yang, Zhen', 'Liang, Zhixin', 'Chen, Liangan']","['Xu Y', 'Li C', 'Tian Q', 'Li Y', 'Yang Z', 'Liang Z', 'Chen L']","['Department of Respiratory Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, P.R.

We describe here two patients with acute leukemia who developed disseminated amphotericin-resistant fusariosis, and review of six studies of cases series in the literature. Two Fusarium solani strains were isolated from blood and skin cultures of one patient, and one strain from the blood culture of the second patient. Both patients died despite antifungal treatment. Strains were identified by sequencing of ITS1 and ITS4 regions. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis of the three F. solani isolates showed a low degree of similarity. Screening for Fusarium spp. contaminants within our facility was negative. Using the CLSI M-38-A2 broth dilution method and E tests((R)), we found that the MICs were low for voriconazole (0.12 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively), unexpectedly high for amphotericin B (>/=8 and >/=32 mug/mL, respectively) and itraconazole (>/=16 mg/ml). Patients with leukemia or persistent neutropenia should be assessed for disseminated fungal infections, including biopsy and skin cultures. Antifungal susceptibility tests are important due to the possibility of the strains being amphotericin resistant.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of 50 umbilical cord blood transplantations UCBTs performed from 2001 to 2010, including 37 single and 13 double umbilical cord blood transplantations UCBTs. RESULTS: The rate of engraftment of neutrophils was 88% at a median time of 29 days (range, 3-79). Complete donor chimerism (DC) within the CD19, CD3, and CD33 cell lineages was seen in 74%, 72%, and 76% of the patients, respectively. DC was associated with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV for the CD3 cell lineage (P=0.01) and, in multivariate analysis, with total body irradiation for all lineages (P<0.01). Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 5 years was 55% and 43%. Nonmalignant diseases were associated with better 5-year OS (72%) than malignancies (28%; P=0.026). In multivariate analysis, a negative correlation was seen between OS and age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02-1.06; P<0.001), acute GVHD grades III and IV (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.95-6.02; P<0.001), and mesenchymal stem cell treatment (HR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.11-6.35; P=0.027). Transplant-related mortality at 100 days and 1 year was 16% and 30%. The incidence of acute GVHD grades II to IV was 34%. Acute GVHD grades III and IV was associated with ABO incompatibility (HR, 2.61; P=0.05) and myeloablative conditioning (HR, 4.17; P=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The outcome in patients with nonmalignant diseases was acceptable, but transplant-related mortality in the whole group remains high. A significantly higher rate of DC was associated with total body irradiation-based conditioning and with acute GVHD grades II and IV.","['Berglund, Sofia', 'Le Blanc, Katarina', 'Remberger, Mats', 'Gertow, Jens', 'Uzunel, Mehmet', 'Svenberg, Petter', 'Winiarski, Jacek', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Uhlin, Michael', 'Mattsson, Jonas']","['Berglund S', 'Le Blanc K', 'Remberger M', 'Gertow J', 'Uzunel M', 'Svenberg P', 'Winiarski J', 'Ljungman P', 'Ringden O', 'Uhlin M', 'Mattsson J']","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. sofia.berglund@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chimerism', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/04/02 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/TP.0b013e31826c39b2 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2012 Nov 27;94(10):1066-74. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e31826c39b2.,10.1097/TP.0b013e31826c39b2 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the hallmark of cancer revolves around cell-cycle deregulation, it is not surprising that antimitotic therapies are effective against the abnormal proliferation of transformed cells. Moreover, these antimitotic drugs are also highly selective and sensitive. Despite the robust rate of discovery and the development of mitosis-selective inhibitors, the unpredictable complexities of the human body's response to these drugs still herald the biggest challenge towards clinical success. Undoubtedly, the need to bridge the gap between promising preclinical trials and effective translational bedside treatment prompts further investigations towards mapping out the mechanistic pathways of MCD, understanding how these drugs work as medicine in the body and more comprehensive target validations. In this review, current antimitotic agents are summarized with particular emphasis on the evaluation of their clinical efficacy as well as their limitations.

We examined the ability of BiKEs and TriKEs to trigger NK cell activation through direct CD16 signaling, measuring intracellular Ca(2)(+) mobilization, secretion of lytic granules, induction of target cell apoptosis, and production of cytokine and chemokines in response to the Raji cell line and primary leukemia targets. Resting NK cells triggered by the recombinant reagents led to intracellular Ca(2)(+) mobilization through direct CD16 signaling. Coculture of reagent-treated resting NK cells with Raji targets resulted in significant increases in NK cell degranulation and target cell death. BiKEs and TriKEs effectively mediated NK cytotoxicity of Raji targets at high and low effector-to-target ratios and maintained functional stability after 24 and 48 hours of culture in human serum. NK cell production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and regulated and normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) was differentially induced in the presence of recombinant reagents and Raji targets. Moreover, significant increases in NK cell degranulation and enhancement of IFN-gamma production against primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia targets were induced with reagent treatment of resting NK cells. In conclusion, BiKEs and TriKEs directly trigger NK cell activation through CD16, significantly increasing NK cell cytolytic activity and cytokine production against tumor targets, showing their therapeutic potential for enhancing NK cell immunotherapies for leukemias and lymphomas.","['Gleason, Michelle K', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Todhunter, Deborah A', 'Zhang, Bin', 'McCullar, Valarie', 'Zhou, Sophia X', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Weiner, Louis M', 'Vallera, Daniel A', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Gleason MK', 'Verneris MR', 'Todhunter DA', 'Zhang B', 'McCullar V', 'Zhou SX', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Weiner LM', 'Vallera DA', 'Miller JS']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0692 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0692 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Dec;11(12):2674-84. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0692.

We assessed the efficacy and toxicity of sapacitabine, a novel oral cytosine nucleoside analogue, in elderly patients with AML. METHODS: In this randomised, phase 2 study, we recruited patients with AML who were either treatment naive or at first relapse and who were aged 70 years or older from 12 centres in the USA. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly allocate eligible patients to receive one of three schedules of oral sapacitabine (1:1:1; stratified by a history of AML treatment): 200 mg twice a day for 7 days (group A); 300 mg twice a day for 7 days (group B); and 400 mg twice a day for 3 days each week for 2 weeks (group C). All schedules were given in 28 day cycles. To confirm the safety and tolerability of dosing schedules, after 20 patients had been treated in a group we enrolled an expanded cohort of 20-25 patients to that group if at least four patients had achieved complete remission or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, and if the 30 day death rate was 20% or less. Our primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival, analysed by intention-to-treat (ie, patients who have received at least one dose of sapacitabine) in those patients who had been randomly allocated to treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00590187. RESULTS: Between Dec 27, 2007, and April 21, 2009, we enrolled 105 patients: 86 patients were previously untreated and 19 were at first relapse. Of the 60 patients randomly allocated to treatment, 1-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 16-59) in group A, 10% (2-33) in group B, and 30% (13-54) in group C. 14 (13%) of 105 patients died within 30 days and 27 (26%) died within 60 days. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were anaemia (eight of 40 patients in group A, 12 of 20 patients in group B, and 15 of 45 patients in group C), neutropenia (14 in group A, 10 in group B, 11 in group C), thrombocytopenia (24 in group A, 12 in group B, and 22 in group C), febrile neutropenia (16 in group A, nine in group B, and 22 in group C), and pneumonia (seven in group A, five in group B, and 10 in group C). The most common grade 5 events were pneumonia (two in group A, one in group B, and three in group C) and sepsis (six in group A, three in group B, and one in group C). Seven deaths were thought to be probably or possibly related to sapacitabine treatment. INTERPRETATION: Sapacitabine seems active and tolerable in elderly patients with AML. The 400 mg dose schedule had the best efficacy profile. Future investigations should aim to combine sapacitabine with other low-intensity therapies in elderly patients with AML.

We examined the killing effect of simvastatin on imatinib-sensitive and resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells (three kinds of CML cell lines representative of each hematopoietic lineage: K562, KCL22, and LAMA84) and T315I and E255K site-directed mutant cells (Ba/F3). The in-vivo effect of simvastatin was determined in K562-xenografted nude mice. Cotreatment with imatinib and simvastatin in imatinib-resistant CML cells showed a synergistic killing effect in K562-R, KCL22-R, LAMA84-R, and E255K mutant cells, but only an additive effect in the T315I mutant cell, although a single treatment of simvastatin strongly inhibited T315I mutant cells. Mechanisms of killing were an induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, through inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation, and activated STAT5 and STAT3. Simvastatin suppressed the growth of K562-transplanted tumors, and cotreatment with imatinib was more effective in reducing tumor size. Simvastatin also killed primary CD34 cells from patients with CML more efficiently, compared with CD34 CML cells. Our study shows a synergic effect of imatinib and simvastatin both in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant cells, but more effective synergism in resistant cells. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that a combination of simvastatin and imatinib may be a potential candidate for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.","['Oh, Bora', 'Kim, Tae Y', 'Min, Hyun J', 'Kim, Miyoung', 'Kang, Myung S', 'Huh, Ji Y', 'Kim, Youngsoo', 'Lee, Dong S']","['Oh B', 'Kim TY', 'Min HJ', 'Kim M', 'Kang MS', 'Huh JY', 'Kim Y', 'Lee DS']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Oncology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Simvastatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835a0fbd [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2013 Jan;24(1):20-31. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835a0fbd.,10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835a0fbd [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe a simple method, Digital Restriction Enzyme Analysis of Methylation (DREAM), based on next generation sequencing analysis of methylation-specific signatures created by sequential digestion of genomic DNA with SmaI and XmaI enzymes. DREAM provides information on 150,000 unique CpG sites, of which 39,000 are in CpG islands and 30,000 are at transcription start sites of 13,000 RefSeq genes. We analyzed DNA methylation in healthy white blood cells and found methylation patterns to be remarkably uniform. Inter individual differences > 30% were observed only at 227 of 28,331 (0.8%) of autosomal CpG sites. Similarly, > 30% differences were observed at only 59 sites when we comparing the cord and adult blood. These conserved methylation patterns contrasted with extensive changes affecting 18-40% of CpG sites in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and in two leukemia cell lines. The method is cost effective, quantitative (r ( 2) = 0.93 when compared with bisulfite pyrosequencing) and reproducible (r ( 2) = 0.997). Using 100-fold coverage, DREAM can detect differences in methylation greater than 10% or 30% with a false positive rate below 0.05 or 0.001, respectively. DREAM can be useful in quantifying epigenetic effects of environment and nutrition, correlating developmental epigenetic variation with phenotypes, understanding epigenetics of cancer and chronic diseases, measuring the effects of drugs on DNA methylation or deriving new biological insights into mammalian genomes.","['Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Lu, Yue', 'He, Rong', 'Ramagli, Louis S', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Jelinek J', 'Liang S', 'Lu Y', 'He R', 'Ramagli LS', 'Shpall EJ', 'Estecio MR', 'Issa JP']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA. jjelinek@temple.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['EC 3.1.21.4 (CCCGGG-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Conserved Sequence', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/economics/*methods']",2012/10/19 06:00,2013/06/07 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['22552 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.22552 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2012 Dec 1;7(12):1368-78. doi: 10.4161/epi.22552.

Some studies have also shown that peripheral-blood stem cells are associated with a decreased rate of relapse and improved survival among recipients with high-risk leukemia. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, randomized trial of transplantation of peripheral-blood stem cells versus bone marrow from unrelated donors to compare 2-year survival probabilities with the use of an intention-to-treat analysis. Between March 2004 and September 2009, we enrolled 551 patients at 48 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to peripheral-blood stem-cell or bone marrow transplantation, stratified according to transplantation center and disease risk. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 36 months (interquartile range, 30 to 37). RESULTS: The overall survival rate at 2 years in the peripheral-blood group was 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45 to 57), as compared with 46% (95% CI, 40 to 52) in the bone marrow group (P=0.29), with an absolute difference of 5 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 14). The overall incidence of graft failure in the peripheral-blood group was 3% (95% CI, 1 to 5), versus 9% (95% CI, 6 to 13) in the bone marrow group (P=0.002). The incidence of chronic GVHD at 2 years in the peripheral-blood group was 53% (95% CI, 45 to 61), as compared with 41% (95% CI, 34 to 48) in the bone marrow group (P=0.01). There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of acute GVHD or relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect significant survival differences between peripheral-blood stem-cell and bone marrow transplantation from unrelated donors. Exploratory analyses of secondary end points indicated that peripheral-blood stem cells may reduce the risk of graft failure, whereas bone marrow may reduce the risk of chronic GVHD.

Subjects were matched to 2 control patients and interviewed concerning previous diseases, work histories, and exposures to potential etiologic agents. Peripheral blood and bone marrow findings revealed clinical features of both myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), consistent with hematopoietic disease category of MDS/MPN. The frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in all CMML cases was 31%, with no consistent pattern identified. A select number of risk factors associated with occupational exposure, nonoccupational exposure, and prior medical or family history of disease were extracted from the questionnaire. The results were compared between the case and control subjects. A total of 5 study subjects (2 CMML cases and 3 control subjects) were determined to have had some benzene exposure. In addition, none of the highlighted risk factors associated with nonoccupational exposure to etiologic agents was significantly different among the study subjects.

Previously, in smooth muscle cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, carcinoma and leukemia cell lines, non-voltage-gated sodium (NVGS) channels have been found. The activity of NVGS channels was shown to be critically dependent on the organization of actin cytoskeleton. The molecular identity of NVGS channels remains unclear. The present work is focused on molecular and functional identification of NVGS channels in human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Degenerin/epithelial Na+ channels (DEG/ENaC) could be considered as a possible molecular correlates. Using RT-PCR, expression of alpha-, beta-, gamma-hENaC subunits in K562 cells was detected. Various modes of the patch-clamp method were employed to examine functional properties of sodium channels, specifically, to test the effect of amiloride on single channel and integral currents. Biophysical characteristics of NVSG channels were close to ENaC; the channels have unitary conductance 12 pS (145 mM Na+) and were impermeable for divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+). We found that amiloride did not inhibit NVGS channels. Importantly, no amiloride-blockable sodium current was detected in the plasma membrane of K562 cells. Taken together, our observations suggest that amiloride-insensitive sodium channels in K562 cells belong to the ENaC family.","['Sudarikova, A V', ""Vasil'ev, I O"", 'Morachevskaia, E A', 'Neguliaev, Iu A']","['Sudarikova AV', ""Vasil'ev IO"", 'Morachevskaia EA', 'Neguliaev IuA']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,"['0 (Epithelial Sodium Channels)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amiloride/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Epithelial Sodium Channels/*drug effects/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Permeability/drug effects']",2012/10/19 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/10/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 2012;54(7):573-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL NEED: Total hip replacement has proved to be very effective for late middle-aged and elderly patients with severe degenerative diseases of the hips. As indications for THR began to include younger patients and those with a more active life style, the longevity of the implant became a concern. Evidence suggests that these patients experience relatively higher rates of early implant failure and the need for revision. The Swedish hip registry, for example, has demonstrated a survival rate in excess of 80% at 20 years for those aged over 65 years, whereas this figure was 33% by 16 years in those aged under 55 years. Hip resurfacing arthroplasty is a bone-conserving alternative to THR that restores normal joint biomechanics and load transfer. The technique has been used around the world for more than 10 years, specifically in the United Kingdom and other European countries. THE TECHNOLOGY: Metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty is an alternative procedure to conventional THR in younger patients. Hip resurfacing arthroplasty is less invasive than THR and addresses the problem of preserving femoral bone stock at the initial operation. This means that future hip revisions are possible with THR if the initial MOM arthroplasty becomes less effective with time in these younger patients. The procedure involves the removal and replacement of the surface of the femoral head with a hollow metal hemisphere, which fits into a metal acetabular cup. Hip resurfacing arthroplasty is a technically more demanding procedure than is conventional THR. In hip resurfacing, the femoral head is retained, which makes it much more difficult to access the acetabular cup. However, hip resurfacing arthroplasty has several advantages over a conventional THR with a small (28 mm) ball. First, the large femoral head reduces the chance of dislocation, so that rates of dislocation are less than those with conventional THR. Second, the range of motion with hip resurfacing arthroplasty is higher than that achieved with conventional THR. A variety of MOM hip resurfacing implants are used in clinical practice. Six MOM hip resurfacing implants have been issued licences in Canada. REVIEW STRATEGY: A search of electronic bibliographies (OVID Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and DSR, INAHTA) was undertaken to identify evidence published from Jan 1, 1997 to October 27, 2005. The search was limited to English-language articles and human studies. The literature search yielded 245 citations. Of these, 11 met inclusion criteria (9 for effectiveness, 2 for safety). The result of the only reported randomized controlled trial on MOM hip resurfacing arthroplasty could not be included in this assessment, because it used a cemented acetabular component, whereas in the new generation of implants, a cementless acetabular component is used. After omitting this publication, only case series remained. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: HEALTH OUTCOMES: The Harris hip score and SF-12 are 2 measures commonly used to report health outcomes in MOM hip resurfacing arthroplasty studies. Other scales used are the Oxford hip score and the University of California Los Angeles hip score. The case series showed that the mean revision rate of MOM hip resurfacing arthroplasty is 1.5% and the incidence of femoral neck fracture is 0.67%. Across all studies, 2 cases of osteonecrosis were reported. Four studies reported improvement in Harris hip scores. However, only 1 study reported a statistically significant improvement. Three studies reported improvement in SF-12 scores, of which 2 reported a significant improvement. One study reported significant improvement in UCLA hip score. Two studies reported postoperative Oxford hip scores, but no preoperative values were reported. None of the reviewed studies reported procedure-related deaths. Four studies reported implant survival rates ranging from 94.4% to 99.7% for a follow-up period of 2.8 to 3.5 years. Three studies reported on the range of motion. One reported improvement in all motions including flexion, extension, abduction-adduction, and rotation, and another reported improvement in flexion. Yet another reported improvement in range of motion for flexion abduction-adduction and rotation arc. However, the author reported a decrease in the range of motion in the arc of flexion in patients with Brooker class III or IV heterotopic bone (all patients were men). SAFETY OF METAL-ON-METAL HIP RESURFACING ARTHROPLASTY: There is a concern about metal wear debris and its systemic distribution throughout the body. Detectable metal concentrations in the serum and urine of patients with metal hip implants have been described as early as the 1970s, and this issue is still controversial after 35 years. Several studies have reported high concentration of cobalt and chromium in serum and/or urine of the patients with metal hip implants. Potential toxicological effects of the elevated metal ions have heightened concerns about safety of MOM bearings. This is of particular concern in young and active patients in whom life expectancy after implantation is long. Since 1997, 15 studies, including 1 randomized clinical trial, have reported high levels of metal ions after THR with metal implants. Some of these studies have reported higher metal levels in patients with loose implants. ADVERSE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF COBALT AND CHROMIUM: Because patients who receive a MOM hip arthroplasty are shown to be exposed to high concentrations of metallic ions, the Medical Advisory Secretariat searched the literature for reports of adverse biological effects of cobalt and chromium. Cobalt and chromium make up the major part of the metal articulations; therefore, they are a focus of concern. RISK OF CANCER: To date, only one study has examined the incidence of cancer after MOM and polyethylene on metal total hip arthroplasties. The results were compared to that of general population in Finland. The mean duration of follow-up for MOM arthroplasty was 15.7 years; for polyethylene arthroplasty, it was 12.5 years. The standardized incidence ratio for all cancers in the MOM group was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.79-1.13). In the polyethylene on metal group it was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.86). The combined standardized incidence ratio for lymphoma and leukemia in the patients who had MOM THR was 1.59 (95% CI, 0.82-2.77). It was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.29-1.05) for the patients who had polyethylene on metal THR. Patients with MOM THR had a significantly higher risk of leukemia. All patients who had leukemia were aged over than 60 years. COBALT CARDIOTOXICITY: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF MYOCARDIOPATHY OF BEER DRINKERS: An unusual type of myocardiopathy, characterized by pericardial effusion, elevated hemoglobin concentrations, and congestive heart failure, occurred as an epidemic affecting 48 habitual beer drinkers in Quebec City between 1965 and 1966. This epidemic was directly related the consumption of a popular beer containing cobalt sulfate. The epidemic appeared 1 month after cobalt sulfate was added to the specific brewery, and no further cases were seen a month after this specific chemical was no longer used in making this beer. A beer of the same name is made in Montreal, and the only difference at that time was that the Quebec brand of beer contained about 10 times more cobalt sulphate. Cobalt has been added to some Canadian beers since 1965 to improve the stability of the foam but it has been added in larger breweries only to draught beer. However, in small breweries, such as those in Quebec City, separate batches were not brewed for bottle and draught beer; therefore, cobalt was added to all of the beer processed in this brewery. In March 1966, a committee was appointed under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister of Health for Quebec that included members of the department of forensic medicine of Quebec's Ministry of Justice, epidemiologists, members of Food and Drug Directorate of Ottawa, toxicologists, biomedical researchers, pathologists, and members of provincial police. Epidemiological studies were carried out by the Provincial Ministry of Health and the Quebec City Health Department. The association between the development of myocardiopathy and the consumption of the particular brand of beer was proven. The mortality rate of this epidemic was 46.1% and those who survived were desperately ill, and recovered only after a struggle for their lives. Similar cases were seen in Omaha (Nebraska). The epidemic started after a cobalt additive was used in 1 of the beers marketed in Nebraska. Sixty-four patients with the clinical diagnosis of alcoholic myocardiopathy were seen during an 18-month period (1964-1965). Thirty of these patients died. The first patient became ill within 1 month after cobalt was added to the beer, and the last patient was seen within 1 month of withdrawal of cobalt. A similar epidemic occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Between 1964 and 1967, 42 patients with acute heart failure were admitted to a hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Twenty of these patients were drinking 6 to 30 bottles per day of a particular brand of beer exclusively. The other 14 patients also drank the same brand of beer, but not exclusively. The mortality rate from the acute illness was 18%, but late deaths accounted for a total mortality rate of 43%. Examination of the tissue from these patients revealed markedly abnormal changes in myofibrils (heart muscles), mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic reticulum. In Belgium, a similar epidemic was reported in 1966, in which, cobalt was used in some Belgian beers.

We developed a high-throughput sequencing method that universally amplifies antigen-receptor gene segments and identifies all clonal gene rearrangements (ie, leukemia-specific sequences) at diagnosis, allowing monitoring of disease progression and clonal evolution during therapy. In the present study, the assay specifically detected 1 leukemic cell among greater than 1 million leukocytes in spike-in experiments. We compared this method with the gold-standard MRD assays multiparameter flow cytometry and allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) using diagnostic and follow-up samples from 106 patients with ALL. Sequencing detected MRD in all 28 samples shown to be positive by flow cytometry and in 35 of the 36 shown to be positive by ASO-PCR and revealed MRD in 10 and 3 additional samples that were negative by flow cytometry and ASO-PCR, respectively.

In this prospective study, we sought to determine whether 2-HG can potentially serve as a noninvasive biomarker of disease burden through serial measurements in patients receiving conventional therapy for newly diagnosed AML. Our data demonstrate that serum, urine, marrow aspirate, and myeloblast 2-HG levels are significantly higher in IDH-mutant patients, with a correlation between baseline serum and urine 2-HG levels. Serum and urine 2-HG, along with IDH1/2-mutant allele burden in marrow, decreased with response to treatment. 2-HG decrease was more rapid with induction chemotherapy compared with DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor therapy.

However, a significant proportion of patients treated with TKIs develop resistance because of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl. Here we describe the unknown activity of the natural product berbamine that efficiently eradicates LSCs and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl clones. Unexpectedly, we identify CaMKII gamma as a specific and critical target of berbamine for its antileukemia activity. Berbamine specifically binds to the ATP-binding pocket of CaMKII gamma, inhibits its phosphorylation and triggers apoptosis of leukemia cells. More importantly, CaMKII gamma is highly activated in LSCs but not in normal hematopoietic stem cells and coactivates LSC-related beta-catenin and Stat3 signaling networks. The identification of CaMKII gamma as a specific target of berbamine and as a critical molecular switch regulating multiple LSC-related signaling pathways can explain the unique antileukemia activity of berbamine. These findings also suggest that berbamine may be the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of CaMKII gamma, and potentially, can serve as a new type of molecular targeted agent through inhibition of the CaMKII gamma activity for treatment of leukemia.","['Gu, Ying', 'Chen, Ting', 'Meng, Zhipeng', 'Gan, Yichao', 'Xu, Xiaohua', 'Lou, Guiyu', 'Li, Hongzhi', 'Gan, Xiaoxian', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Tang, Jinfen', 'Xu, Genbo', 'Huang, Liansheng', 'Zhang, Xiaohong', 'Fang, Yongming', 'Wang, Kai', 'Zheng, Shu', 'Huang, Wendong', 'Xu, Rongzhen']","['Gu Y', 'Chen T', 'Meng Z', 'Gan Y', 'Xu X', 'Lou G', 'Li H', 'Gan X', 'Zhou H', 'Tang J', 'Xu G', 'Huang L', 'Zhang X', 'Fang Y', 'Wang K', 'Zheng S', 'Huang W', 'Xu R']","['Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (CAMK1G protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 1)', 'V5KM4XJ0WM (berbamine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Benzylisoquinolines/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49879-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-434894 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 6;120(24):4829-39. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-434894.

Progression of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia is associated with increased activation of Rac GTPases. Here, we demonstrate that MLL fusion oncogenes maintain leukemia-associated Rac activity by regulating Frat gene expression, specifically Frat2. Modulation of FRAT2 leads to concomitant changes in Rac activity, and transformation of Frat knockout hematopoietic progenitor cells by MLL fusions results in leukemias displaying reduced Rac activation and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. FRAT2 activates Rac through a signaling mechanism that requires glycogen synthase kinase 3 and DVL. Disruption of this pathway abrogates the leukemogenic activity of MLL fusions. This suggests a rationale for the paradoxical requirement of canonical Wnt signaling and glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity for MLL fusion oncogenicity and identifies novel therapeutic targets for this disease.","['Walf-Vorderwulbecke, Vanessa', 'de Boer, Jasper', 'Horton, Sarah J', 'van Amerongen, Renee', 'Proost, Natalie', 'Berns, Anton', 'Williams, Owen']","['Walf-Vorderwulbecke V', 'de Boer J', 'Horton SJ', 'van Amerongen R', 'Proost N', 'Berns A', 'Williams O']","['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dishevelled Proteins)', '0 (Frat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Frat2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mllt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dishevelled Proteins', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49878-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-432534 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 6;120(24):4819-28. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-432534.

We examined DNA methylation and RNA expression status during early B-cell development by sorting multiple replicates of four separate stages of pre-B cells derived from normal human fetal bone marrow and applied high-dimension DNA methylation scanning and expression arrays. Features of promoter and gene body DNA methylation were strongly correlated with RNA expression in multipotent progenitors (MPPs) both in a static state and throughout differentiation. As MPPs commit to pre-B cells, a predominantly demethylating phenotype ensues, with 79% of the 2966 differentially methylated regions observed involving demethylation. Demethylation events were more often gene body associated rather than promoter associated; predominantly located outside of CpG islands; and closely associated with EBF1, E2F, PAX5 and other functional transcription factor (TF) sites related to B-cell development. Such demethylation events were accompanied by TF occupancy. After commitment, DNA methylation changes appeared to play a smaller role in B-cell development. We identified a distinct development-dependent demethylation signature which has gene expression regulatory properties for pre-B cells, and provide a catalog reference for the epigenetic changes that occur in pre-B-cell leukemia and other B-cell-related diseases.","['Lee, Seung-Tae', 'Xiao, Yuanyuan', 'Muench, Marcus O', 'Xiao, Jianqiao', 'Fomin, Marina E', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Zheng, Shichun', 'Dou, Xiaoqin', 'de Smith, Adam', 'Chokkalingam, Anand', 'Buffler, Patricia', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['Lee ST', 'Xiao Y', 'Muench MO', 'Xiao J', 'Fomin ME', 'Wiencke JK', 'Zheng S', 'Dou X', 'de Smith A', 'Chokkalingam A', 'Buffler P', 'Ma X', 'Wiemels JL']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/02/23 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gks957 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gks957 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Dec;40(22):11339-51. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks957.

Progress in molecular genetic characterization of CLL has confirmed the prognostic role of unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities currently defined by molecular cytogenetic methods: conventional karyotyping and FISH. However, a significant percentage of genomic abnormalities escapes routine investigation due to the limitations of these methods. It is presently clear that some of these aberrations have impact on prognosis and disease progression. METHODS: We examined copy number changes in the tumor genomes of 50 CLL patients using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and/or oligonucleotide array platforms. We compared the results of arrayCGH with those obtained by FISH and conventional cytogenetics and evaluated their clinical importance. RESULTS: A total of 111 copy number changes were detected in 43 patients (86%) with clonal abnormalities present in at least 23% of the cells. Moreover, 14 patients (28%) were found to have 39 genomic changes that had not been detected by standard cytogenetic and/or FISH analyses. These included possibly prognostically important recurrent 2p and 8q24 gains. The most frequent unbalanced changes involved chromosomes 18, 7, 3, 9 and 17.

Until recently, histopathologic examination of splenectomy specimens was considered mandatory for the diagnosis of SMZL. However, nowadays, mainly because of advances in chemoimmunotherapy, splenectomy is performed much less frequently. We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of bone marrow biopsy (BMB) histopathology in the diagnostic approach toward SMZL and SDRL and tested whether it may serve as a substitute for spleen histopathology in the differential diagnosis between these 2 entities. To this end, we conducted a paired assessment of BMB and spleen diagnostic samples from 46 cases with a diagnosis of SMZL (n=32) or SDRL (n=14) based on spleen histopathology. We demonstrate that detailed immunohistopathologic BMB evaluation offers adequate evidence for the confirmation of these entities and their differential diagnosis from other small B-cell lymphoma histotypes. Notably, the immunophenotypical profile of SMZL and SDRL was identical in both BMB and spleen specimens for 21 evaluated markers. Paired assessment of BMB and spleen specimens did not identify discriminating patterns of BMB infiltration, cytology, and/or immunohistology between SMZL and SDRL. Accordingly, bone marrow histopathology contributes significantly in confirming the diagnosis of SMZL and SDRL. However, presently it is not possible to distinguish SMZL from SDRL on the basis of BMB evaluation alone; hence, histopathologic examination of the spleen remains the ""gold standard"" approach.","['Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Kanellis, George', 'Pouliou, Evi', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Ferreri, Andres J M', 'Doglioni, Claudio', 'Bikos, Vasilis', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Papadaki, Theodora']","['Ponzoni M', 'Kanellis G', 'Pouliou E', 'Baliakas P', 'Scarfo L', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Doglioni C', 'Bikos V', 'Dagklis A', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Ghia P', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Papadaki T']","['Pathology Unit, Department of Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. ponzoni.maurilio@hsr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318271243d [doi]', '00000478-201211000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2012 Nov;36(11):1609-18. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318271243d.,10.1097/PAS.0b013e318271243d [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The poorer outcomes in these patients are evidenced by increased rates of local recurrence, regional metastasis, and death. Lymphoproliferative neoplasms and certain skin cancers may share similar pathogenic factors, which could provide insights regarding their close relationship and the behavior of lymphoma-related skin cancers. As a consequence of the poorer prognosis in patients with lymphoma-related skin cancer, more aggressive therapeutic measures could reduce the risk of skin cancer recurrence, metastasis, and death.

Accelerated telomere attrition in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurs by an undefined mechanism. Although the MDS clone originates within the myeloid compartment, T-lymphocytes display repertoire contraction and loss of naive T-cells. The replicative lifespan of T-cells is stringently regulated by telomerase activity. In MDS cases, we show that purified CD3+ T-cells have significantly shorter telomere length and reduced proliferative capacity upon stimulation compared with controls. To understand the mechanism, telomerase enzymatic activity and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), gene expression were compared in MDS cases (n=35) and healthy controls (n=42) within different T-cell compartments. Telomerase activity is greatest in naive T-cells illustrating the importance of telomere repair in homeostatic repertoire regulation. Compared with healthy controls, MDS cases had lower telomerase induction (P<0.0001) that correlated with significantly lower hTERT mRNA (P<0.0001), independent of age and disease stratification. hTERT mRNA deficiency affected naive but not memory T-cells, and telomere erosion in MDS occurred without evidence of an hTERT-promoter mutation, copy number variation or deletion. Telomerase insufficiency may undermine homeostatic control within the hematopoietic compartment and promote a change in the T-cell repertoire in MDS.","['Yang, L', 'Mailloux, A', 'Rollison, D E', 'Painter, J S', 'Maciejewski, J', 'Paquette, R L', 'Loughran, T P', 'McGraw, K', 'Makishima, H', 'Radhakrishnan, R', 'Wei, S', 'Ren, X', 'Komrokji, R', 'List, A F', 'Epling-Burnette, P K']","['Yang L', 'Mailloux A', 'Rollison DE', 'Painter JS', 'Maciejewski J', 'Paquette RL', 'Loughran TP', 'McGraw K', 'Makishima H', 'Radhakrishnan R', 'Wei S', 'Ren X', 'Komrokji R', 'List AF', 'Epling-Burnette PK']","['Immunology Program at the H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012300 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.300 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):897-906. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.300.

Twenty-seven patients had secondary malignancy, diagnosed a median of 43 months (7 months-11.5 years) after SCT. The 10-year cumulative incidence was 5.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.6-8.7), twice the expected rate in matched normal population. The incidence was 1.7, 7.4 and 5.7% after MAC, RIC and RTC, respectively (P=0.02).

The present work reports the synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation of some N-(6(4)-indazolyl)benzenesulfonamides and 7-ethoxy-N-(6(4)-indazolyl)benzenesulfonamides. All compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antiproliferative activity against three tumor cell lines: A2780 (human ovarian carcinoma) A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) and P388 (murine leukemia). The results indicated that sulfonamides 2c, 3c, 6d, 8, 13, 3b and 16 were endowed with a pharmacologically interesting antiproliferative activity with compounds 2c and 3c showing the lower IC(50) (from 0.50 +/- 0.09 to 1.83 +/- 0.52 muM and from 0.58 +/- 0.17 to 5.83 +/- 1.83 muM, respectively). Moreover, these indazoles were able to trigger apoptosis through the upregulation of the typical apoptosis markers p53 and bax. As regard to the hypothetic targets of these compounds, a preliminary docking analysis showed that all compounds seemed to interact with beta-tubulin, in particular compound 3b that showed the lower Ki. The cytofluorimetric analysis of the cell cycle phases indicates that all compounds, when administered at their IC(75), caused a block in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle with the generation of subpopulations of cells with a number of chromosome >4n. When the IC(50)s were applied we observed a prevalent block in the G0/G1 phase except for compounds 16 and 8 where a partial G2/M block was present with a concomitant decrease of cells in the G0/G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. Altogether these results suggest a possible, but not exclusive, interaction with microtubules.","['Abbassi, Najat', 'Chicha, Hakima', 'Rakib, El Mostapha', 'Hannioui, Abdellah', 'Alaoui, Mdaghri', 'Hajjaji, Abdelouahed', 'Geffken, Detlef', 'Aiello, Cinzia', 'Gangemi, Rosaria', 'Rosano, Camillo', 'Viale, Maurizio']","['Abbassi N', 'Chicha H', 'Rakib el M', 'Hannioui A', 'Alaoui M', 'Hajjaji A', 'Geffken D', 'Aiello C', 'Gangemi R', 'Rosano C', 'Viale M']","['Laboratoire de Chimie Organique et Analytiques, Faculte des Sciences et Techniques, Universite Sultan Moulay Slimane, B.P. 523, Beni-Mellal, Morocco.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Polyploidy', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonamides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*chemistry/metabolism']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0223-5234(12)00552-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2012.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2012 Nov;57:240-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2012.09.013.

B-cell receptor (BCR) and co-receptor CD40 signaling is essential for normal B cells, and there is increasing evidence that signaling via BCR and CD40 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma. The aim of this study was to investigate basal and induced signaling in lymphoma B cells and infiltrating T cells in single-cell suspensions of biopsies from small cell lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) patients. METHODS: Samples from untreated SLL/CLL and MZL patients were examined for basal and activation induced signaling by phospho-specific flow cytometry. A panel of 9 stimulation conditions targeting B and T cells, including crosslinking of the B cell receptor (BCR), CD40 ligand and interleukins in combination with 12 matching phospho-protein readouts was used to study signaling. RESULTS: Malignant B cells from SLL/CLL patients had higher basal levels of phosphorylated (p)-SFKs, p-PLCgamma, p-ERK, p-p38, p-p65 (NF-kappaB), p-STAT5 and p-STAT6, compared to healthy donor B cells. In contrast, anti-BCR induced signaling was highly impaired in SLL/CLL and MZL B cells as determined by low p-SFK, p-SYK and p-PLCgamma levels. Impaired anti-BCR-induced p-PLCgamma was associated with reduced surface expression of IgM and CD79b. Similarly, CD40L-induced p-ERK and p-p38 were also significantly reduced in lymphoma B cells, whereas p-p65 (NF-kappaB) was equal to that of normal B cells. In contrast, IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 induced p-STAT5 in tumor-infiltrating T cells were not different from normal T cells. CONCLUSIONS: BCR signaling and CD40L-induced p-p38 was suppressed in malignant B cells from SLL/CLL and MZL patients. Single-cell phospho-specific flow cytometry for detection of basal as well as activation-induced phosphorylation of signaling proteins in distinct cell populations can be used to identify aberrant signaling pathways.","['Blix, Egil S', 'Irish, Jonathan M', 'Husebekk, Anne', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Forfang, Lise', 'Tierens, Anne M', 'Myklebust, June H', 'Kolstad, Arne']","['Blix ES', 'Irish JM', 'Husebekk A', 'Delabie J', 'Forfang L', 'Tierens AM', 'Myklebust JH', 'Kolstad A']","['Department of Oncology, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromso, Norway. egil.blix@uit.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'CD79 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Phospholipase C gamma/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/classification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-478 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-478 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Oct 16;12:478. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-478.,10.1186/1471-2407-12-478 [doi],20121016,"['K99 CA143231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA143231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3519597,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription of leukemic genes is triggered by reprogrammed transcription factors (TFs) mediated by chromatin histones. Reprogrammed TFs originate from transcriptional alterations of CpG methylation patterns of mutated epigenetic genes. They preserve memory information of earlier leukemogenic exposures, even transgenerationally via the zygote, through small (e.g. pi)RNA transmitted between cells by exosomes. Normally, reprogrammed TFs are enzymatically silenced and stored as markers in heterochromatic domains. Failure of intra S-phase surveillance (IS) permits the formation and continual operation of DNA replication forks in spite of persisting genotoxic stress. Silenced TFs are re-activated by euchromatin, most likely through leakages of insulator barriers of cis-regulating chromatin modulators (CRM) that normally separate hetero- from euchromatin domains. During transport by sliding nucleosomes, reprogrammed leukemogenic TFs are misplaced at transcription factor binding-/starting-sites (TFBS /TSS) allowing them to interact with and trigger replication of mutated leukemic genes. IN CONCLUSION: Interactions of enzymatically reprogrammed TFs, transcribed from mutated epigenetic genes, with replicating leukemic genes at TFBS/TSSs are key driving forces in leukemogenesis. Probably, epigenetic genes, although mutated, still retain their control of replication of leukemic genes. Epigenetics-based enzyme inhibitors must target reprogrammed TFs. Prudently, therapeutic corrections should be introduced within the frame of conventional, cytoreductive treatment protocols. Alternatively, reprogrammed TFs could be replaced by cell populations with regular TF production. Clinically, classification of leukemias should be based on their epigenetic presentation.","['Prindull, Gregor']",['Prindull G'],"['Department Pediatrics, University of Gottingen, Germany.

Violations of the protein conformational maturation processes in the endoplasmic reticulum can cause proteotoxic stress. Compensatory mechanisms are activated in response to ER stress include increased expression of enzymes involved in the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins. The sulfhydryl groups oxidation in the electron transport chain (PDI-ERO1-O2) is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Increased activity of oxidoreductase ERO1 could be one of the mechanisms of oxidative stress - however, a direct relationship of ER stress with the overproduction of ROS remains a subject of debate. In this study we have shown that induced by dithiothreitol (DTT) violation of the redox balance with low ROS production leads to the endoplasmic reticulum stress in Jurkat cells. ER-stress in these cells is not associated with increased ROS production, DTT treatment leads to induction of apoptosis. Modulation of intracellular levels of ROS can influence the apoptosis-inducing effects of ER-stress. Given the possible involvement of ROS in the generation of disulfide bonds, the role of ROS in ER stress may be a modulation of disulfide proteome including client proteins.","['Mesitov, M V', 'Ignashkova, T I', 'Meshcherskii, M E', 'Akopov, A S', 'Sokolovskaia, A A', 'Moskovtsev, A A', 'Kubatiev, A A']","['Mesitov MV', 'Ignashkova TI', 'Meshcherskii ME', 'Akopov AS', 'Sokolovskaia AA', 'Moskovtsev AA', 'Kubatiev AA']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Patol Fiziol Eksp Ter,Patologicheskaia fiziologiia i eksperimental'naia terapiia,0376421,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Acid-Base Imbalance/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homocysteine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",2012/10/18 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/10/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Patol Fiziol Eksp Ter. 2012 Jul-Sep;(3):87-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epitope liberation depends on constitutively active autophagy, as confirmed with immunocytochemistry for the autophagosome marker LC3 as well as RNA interference targeting two different autophagy-related genes.

Berries contain multiple phenolic compounds and secondary metabolites that contribute to their biological properties. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Current study investigates the anticancer activity of the methanolic extract of strawberry (MESB) fruits in leukaemia (CEM) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines ex vivo, and its cancer therapeutic and chemopreventive potential in mice models. Results of MTT, trypan blue and LDH assays suggested that MESB can induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells, irrespective of origin, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of mice bearing breast adenocarcinoma with MESB blocked the proliferation of tumor cells in a time-dependent manner and resulted in extended life span. Histological and immunohistochemical studies suggest that MESB treatment affected tumor cell proliferation by activating apoptosis and did not result in any side effects. Finally, we show that MESB can induce intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by activating p73 in breast cancer cells, when tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present study reveals that strawberry fruits possess both cancer preventive and therapeutic values and we discuss the mechanism by which it is achieved.","['Somasagara, Ranganatha R', 'Hegde, Mahesh', 'Chiruvella, Kishore K', 'Musini, Anjaneyulu', 'Choudhary, Bibha', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Somasagara RR', 'Hegde M', 'Chiruvella KK', 'Musini A', 'Choudhary B', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bid protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trp53bp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trp73 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', '*Fragaria', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0047021 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-15186 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47021. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0047021.

Using a model in young rats, we investigated damaging effects of long-term treatment with methotrexate on growth plate and metaphyseal bone, and the potential protective effects of antidote folinic acid. This study demonstrated that chronic folinic acid supplementation can prevent methotrexate-induced chondrocyte apoptosis and preserve chondrocyte columnar arrangement and number in the growth plate. In the metaphysis, folinic acid supplementation can preserve primary spongiosa heights and secondary spongiosa trabecular volume by preventing osteoblasts from undergoing apoptosis and suppressing methotrexate-induced marrow adiposity and osteoclast formation. Systemically, plasma of folinic acid supplemented rats, in comparison to plasma from rats treated with MTX alone, contained a significantly lower level of IL-1beta and suppressed osteoclast formation in vitro in normal bone marrow cells. The importance of IL-1beta in supporting plasma-induced osteoclast formation was confirmed as the presence of an anti-IL-1beta neutralizing antibody attenuated the ability of the plasma (from MTX-treated rats) in inducing osteoclast formation. Findings from this study suggest that folinic acid supplementation during chronic methotrexate treatment can alleviate growth plate and metaphyseal damages and therefore may be potentially useful in paediatric patients who are at risk of skeletal growth suppression due to chronic methotrexate chemotherapy.","['Fan, Chia-Ming', 'Foster, Bruce K', 'Hui, Susanta K', 'Xian, Cory J']","['Fan CM', 'Foster BK', 'Hui SK', 'Xian CJ']","['Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adiposity/*drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Resorption/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/blood/genetics', 'Femur/drug effects/growth & development/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'RANK Ligand/blood/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vitamin B Complex/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'X-Ray Microtomography']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0046915 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-14363 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46915. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0046915.

However, the mechanism of PCD involved in cancer chemoprevention is much less clear and may be different between types of chemopreventive agents and tumour cell types involved. Therefore, from a pharmacological view, it is crucial during the earlier steps of drug development to define the cellular specificity of the candidate as well as its capacity to bypass dysfunctional tumoral signalling pathways providing insensitivity to death stimuli. Studying the cytotoxic effects of violacein, an antibiotic dihydro-indolone synthesised by an Amazon river Chromobacterium, we observed that death induced in CD34(+)/c-Kit(+)/P-glycoprotein(+)/MRP1(+) TF1 leukaemia progenitor cells is not mediated by apoptosis and/or autophagy, since biomarkers of both types of cell death were not significantly affected by this compound. To clarify the working mechanism of violacein, we performed kinome profiling using peptide arrays to yield comprehensive descriptions of cellular kinase activities. Pro-death activity of violacein is actually carried out by inhibition of calpain and DAPK1 and activation of PKA, AKT and PDK, followed by structural changes caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress and Golgi apparatus collapse, leading to cellular demise. Our results demonstrate that violacein induces kinome reprogramming, overcoming death signaling dysfunctions of intrinsically resistant human leukaemia cells.","['Queiroz, Karla C S', 'Milani, Renato', 'Ruela-de-Sousa, Roberta R', 'Fuhler, Gwenny M', 'Justo, Giselle Z', 'Zambuzzi, Willian F', 'Duran, Nelson', 'Diks, Sander H', 'Spek, C Arnold', 'Ferreira, Carmen V', 'Peppelenbosch, Maikel P']","['Queiroz KC', 'Milani R', 'Ruela-de-Sousa RR', 'Fuhler GM', 'Justo GZ', 'Zambuzzi WF', 'Duran N', 'Diks SH', 'Spek CA', 'Ferreira CV', 'Peppelenbosch MP']","['Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'QJH0DSQ3SG (violacein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Calpain/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Golgi Apparatus/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/04/03 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0045362 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-23314 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e45362. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045362.

However, the genetic events underlying this transformation remain poorly understood. Aberrant DNA methylation may play a causative role in the disease and its prognosis. Thus, we compared the DNA methylation profiles in refractory anemia with excess blast (RAEB) to those in refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD). METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected from 20 patients with primary MDS (9 with RAEB and 11 with RCMD), and peripheral blood samples were collected from 4 healthy controls. These samples were assessed using a commercial whole genome-wide methylation assay. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the methylation of candidate gene promoters in RAEB and RCMD. RESULTS: Microarray data revealed significant hypermethylation in 69 genes within RAEB but not RCMD. Candidate genes were mapped to 5 different networks, and network 1 had the highest score due to its involvement in gene expression, cancer, and cell cycle. Five genes (GSTM5, BIK, CENPH, RERG, and ANGPTL2) were associated with malignant disease progression. Among them, the methylated promoter pairs of GSTM5 (55.5% and 20%), BIK (20% and 0%), and ANGPTL2 (44.4% and 10%) were observed more frequently in RAEB. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation of GSTM5, BIK, and ANGPTL2 may induce epigenetic silencing and contribute to the increasing blasts and resulting MDS progression; however, the functions of these genes were not determined. Further study focusing on epigenetic silencing using various detection modalities is required.","['Lee, Suee', 'Kwon, Hyuk-Chan', 'Kim, Sung-Hyun', 'Oh, Sung Yong', 'Lee, Ji Hyun', 'Lee, Yeon-Su', 'Seo, Daekwan', 'Han, Jin-Yeong', 'Kim, Hyo-Jin']","['Lee S', 'Kwon HC', 'Kim SH', 'Oh SY', 'Lee JH', 'Lee YS', 'Seo D', 'Han JY', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University Medical Center, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,,2012/10/17 06:00,2012/10/17 06:01,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2012.47.3.186 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2012 Sep;47(3):186-93. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2012.47.3.186.

However, the expression of AurA and the effects of AurA inhibition in cancer stem cells are not yet fully understood. We investigated the expression and inhibition of AurA in AML stem cells (CD34(+)/CD38(-)). METHODS: Expression of AurA was investigated in cell lines (NB4 and KG1) that express high levels of CD34 and low levels of CD38. Primary AML cells were harvested from 8 patients. The expression of AurA and cell death induced by inhibition of AurA were analyzed in CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells. RESULTS: AurA was shown to be overexpressed in both primary AML cells and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells. Inhibition of AurA plus cytarabine treatment in LSCs resulted in increased cytotoxicity compared to cytarabine treatment alone. Additional stimulation with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) increased the cell death caused by AurA inhibition plus cytarabine treatment. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report describing increased expression of AurA in LSCs. Our results suggest that selective AurA inhibition may be used to reduce LSCs, and this reduction may be enhanced by stimulation with G-CSF. Further exploration of relationship between nuclear factor kappa-B and AurA inhibition and the potential of AurA inhibition for use in leukemia treatment is needed.","['Kim, Soo-Jeong', 'Jang, Ji Eun', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Eom, Ju-In', 'Jeung, Hoi-Kyung', 'Kim, Yundeok', 'Hwang, Doh Yu', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Kim SJ', 'Jang JE', 'Cheong JW', 'Eom JI', 'Jeung HK', 'Kim Y', 'Hwang DY', 'Min YH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,,2012/10/17 06:00,2012/10/17 06:01,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2012.47.3.178 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2012 Sep;47(3):178-85. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2012.47.3.178.

A week prior to this visit, he had recieved a cycle of decitabine chemotherapy at 20 mg/metered square for ten days. This was his second cycle of decitabine. His out patient medications included megesterol, omeprazole, morphine sulfate and insulin glargine. The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for Acute Coronary Syndrome. His cardiac enzymes were elevated (peak troponin 30 ng/mL, CKMB 67.4 ng/mL). His 12 lead EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 113, but without acute ST-T wave changes. The BNP was 259 pg/mL. A 2D echo revealed moderate diffuse hypokinesis with an EF of 35%. He subsequently underwent a left heart catheterization, which showed non-obstructive CAD. In our patient, the elevated troponins (peak troponin 30 ng/mL) and BNP were seen concomitant with the onset of cardiogenic shock. Two months ago, his 2 D echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of about 55%-65% with slightly increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness. DISCUSSION: The most common adverse effects of decitabine include cytopenia, nausea, pain and erythema/nodules at the injection site. To date, there has been only one reported case of a hypomethylating agent inducing acute myocarditis. We a present a case of reversible, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy secondary to decitabine chemotherapy, which resolved after the drug was discontinued. Trials involving decitabine for the treatment of MDS reported no myocarditis. In our case, the diagnosis of transient cardiomyopathy was highly probable since the patient's troponins and echocardiogram returned to baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Also, the patient never had any further chest pain at his 6 month follow up. In this case, we believe that the elevated Troponin I levels, along with a cardiac catheterization revealing patent coronary vessels, favor our hypothesis that our patient suffered from acute myocarditis as a result of direct toxicity from decitabine chemotherapy. We doubt that there was an underlying infectious etiology, since the patient had three negative blood cultures, two negative urine cultures and a negative viral serology. Our case demonstrates that chest pains in a patient treated with hypomethylating agents should be further explored in order to rule out acute myocarditis.","['De, Chitradeep', 'Phookan, Jaya', 'Parikh, Valay', 'Nagrani, Tarun', 'Lakhani, Mayur', 'Forte, Frank', 'Lafferty, James']","['De C', 'Phookan J', 'Parikh V', 'Nagrani T', 'Lakhani M', 'Forte F', 'Lafferty J']","['Department of Cardiology, Staten Island University Hospital, New York.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Clin Med Insights Oncol,Clinical Medicine Insights.

Although similar losses were found in lymphoid blast crisis the genetic background of the transformation in CML is still poorly defined. We used Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) to analyze comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data from 30 CML (10 each of chronic phase, myeloid and lymphoid blast stage), 10 Ph(+)ALL adult patients and 10 disease free controls and were able to: (a) discriminate between the genomes of lymphoid and myeloid blast cells and (b) identify differences in the genome profile of de novo Ph(+)ALL and lymphoid blast transformation of CML (BC/L). Furthermore we were able to distinguish a sub group of Ph(+) ALL characterized by gains in chromosome 9 and recurrent losses at several other genome sites offering genetic evidence for the clinical heterogeneity. The significance of these results is that they not only offer clues regarding the pathogenesis of Ph(+) disorders and highlight the potential clinical implications of a set of probes but also demonstrates what SAM can offer for the analysis of genome data.","['Grace, Colin', 'Nacheva, Elisabeth P']","['Grace C', 'Nacheva EP']","['University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Inform,Cancer informatics,101258149,,,,2012/10/17 06:00,2012/10/17 06:01,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4137/CIN.S9258 [doi]', 'cin-11-2012-173 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Inform. 2012;11:173-83. doi: 10.4137/CIN.S9258.

Here we provide multifaceted genetic and biochemical evidence for a previously unknown function of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as a partner and posttranslational regulator of Ikaros. We demonstrate that SYK phoshorylates Ikaros at unique C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites S358 and S361, thereby augmenting its nuclear localization and sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Mechanistically, we establish that SYK-induced Ikaros activation is essential for its nuclear localization and optimal transcription factor function.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Ma, Hong', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Ozer, Zahide', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Mao, Cheney', 'Ishkhanian, Rita', 'Goodman, Patricia', 'Qazi, Sanjive']","['Uckun FM', 'Ma H', 'Zhang J', 'Ozer Z', 'Dovat S', 'Mao C', 'Ishkhanian R', 'Goodman P', 'Qazi S']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Systems Immunobiology Laboratory, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/01/09 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1209828109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1209828109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Oct 30;109(44):18072-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1209828109.

However, this possibility has been questioned in CLL because the number of circulating AID mRNA(+) cells is exceedingly low; synthesis of AID protein by blood CLL cells has not been demonstrated; the full range of AID functions is lacking in unmutated CLL (U-CLL), and no prospective analysis linking AID expression and disease severity has been reported. The results of the present study show that circulating CLL cells and those within secondary lymphoid tissues can make AID mRNA and protein. This production is related to cell division because more AID mRNA was detected in recently divided cells and AID protein was limited to the dividing fraction and was up-regulated on induction of cell division. AID protein was functional because AID(+) dividing cells exhibited more double-stranded DNA breaks, IGH class switching, and new IGHV-D-J mutations. Each of these actions was documented in U-CLL and mutated CLL (M-CLL). Furthermore, AID protein was associated with worse patient outcome and adverse cytogenetics. We conclude that the production of fully functional AID protein by U-CLL and M-CLL cells could be involved in clonal evolution of the disease.","['Patten, Piers E M', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Albesiano, Emilia', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Kim, Dorothy', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Magli, Amanda R', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Roa, Sergio', 'Mongini, Patricia K', 'MacCarthy, Thomas', 'Scharff, Matthew D', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Patten PE', 'Chu CC', 'Albesiano E', 'Damle RN', 'Yan XJ', 'Kim D', 'Zhang L', 'Magli AR', 'Barrientos J', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Roa S', 'Mongini PK', 'MacCarthy T', 'Scharff MD', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49876-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-08-449744 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 6;120(24):4802-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-08-449744.

The DNA-hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine are effective treatments for patients with MDS, increasing the time to progression to acute myelogenous leukemia and improving overall response rates. Although genome-wide increases in DNA methylation have been documented in BM cells from MDS patients, the methylation signatures of specific gene promoters have not been correlated with the clinical response to these therapies. Recently, attention has been drawn to the potential etiologic role of decreased expression of specific ribosomal proteins in MDS and in other BM failure states. Therefore, we investigated whether rRNA expression is dysregulated in MDS. We found significantly decreased rRNA expression and increased rDNA promoter methylation in CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells from the majority of MDS patients compared with normal controls. Treatment of myeloid cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in a significant decrease in the methylation of the rDNA promoter and an increase in rRNA levels. These observations suggest that an increase in rDNA promoter methylation can result in decreased rRNA synthesis that may contribute to defective hematopoiesis and BM failure in some patients with MDS.","['Raval, Aparna', 'Sridhar, Kunju J', 'Patel, Shripa', 'Turnbull, Brit B', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Mitchell, Beverly S']","['Raval A', 'Sridhar KJ', 'Patel S', 'Turnbull BB', 'Greenberg PL', 'Mitchell BS']","['Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA 94305-5458, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49877-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-423111 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 6;120(24):4812-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-423111.

Both groups were balanced according to cytogenetics and performance status. The complete response rates with chemotherapy and epigenetic therapy were 42% and 28%, respectively (P = .001), and the 8-week mortality 18% and 11%, respectively (P = .075). Two-year relapse-free survival rates (28% vs 39%, P = .843) and median survival (6.7 vs 6.5 months, P = .413) were similar in the 2 groups. Multivariate analysis identified older age, adverse cytogenetics, poor performance status, elevated creatinine, peripheral blood and BM blasts, and hemoglobin, but not type of AML therapy, as independent prognostic factors for survival. No outcome differences were observed according to cytogenetics, FLT3 mutational status, age, or performance status by therapy type.

23070252,NLM,MEDLINE,20121227,20211021,1940-087X (Electronic) 1940-087X (Linking),,68,2012 Oct 5,Examining BCL-2 family function with large unilamellar vesicles.,,"The BCL-2 (B cell CLL/Lymphoma) family is comprised of approximately twenty proteins that collaborate to either maintain cell survival or initiate apoptosis(1). Following cellular stress (e.g., DNA damage), the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family effectors BAK (BCL-2 antagonistic killer 1) and/or BAX (BCL-2 associated X protein) become activated and compromise the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), though the process referred to as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)(1). After MOMP occurs, pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., cytochrome c) gain access to the cytoplasm, promote caspase activation, and apoptosis rapidly ensues(2). In order for BAK/BAX to induce MOMP, they require transient interactions with members of another pro-apoptotic subset of the BCL-2 family, the BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins, such as BID (BH3-interacting domain agonist)(3-6). Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (e.g., BCL-2 related gene, long isoform, BCL-xL; myeloid cell leukemia 1, MCL-1) regulate cellular survival by tightly controlling the interactions between BAK/BAX and the BH3-only proteins capable of directly inducing BAK/BAX activation(7,8). In addition, anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein availability is also dictated by sensitizer/de-repressor BH3-only proteins, such as BAD (BCL-2 antagonist of cell death) or PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), which bind and inhibit anti-apoptotic members(7,9). As most of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 repertoire is localized to the OMM, the cellular decision to maintain survival or induce MOMP is dictated by multiple BCL-2 family interactions at this membrane. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) are a biochemical model to explore relationships between BCL-2 family interactions and membrane permeabilization(10). LUVs are comprised of defined lipids that are assembled in ratios identified in lipid composition studies from solvent extracted Xenopus mitochondria (46.5% phosphatidylcholine, 28.5% phosphatidylethanoloamine, 9% phosphatidylinositol, 9% phosphatidylserine, and 7% cardiolipin)(10). This is a convenient model system to directly explore BCL-2 family function because the protein and lipid components are completely defined and tractable, which is not always the case with primary mitochondria. While cardiolipin is not usually this high throughout the OMM, this model does faithfully mimic the OMM to promote BCL-2 family function. Furthermore, a more recent modification of the above protocol allows for kinetic analyses of protein interactions and real-time measurements of membrane permeabilization, which is based on LUVs containing a polyanionic dye (ANTS: 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid) and cationic quencher (DPX: p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide)(11). As the LUVs permeabilize, ANTS and DPX diffuse apart, and a gain in fluorescence is detected. Here, commonly used recombinant BCL-2 family protein combinations and controls using the LUVs containing ANTS/DPX are described.","['Asciolla, James J', 'Renault, Thibaud T', 'Chipuk, Jerry E']","['Asciolla JJ', 'Renault TT', 'Chipuk JE']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Department of Dermatology, The Tisch Cancer Institute, The Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', ""14208-10-7 (N,N'-4-xylylenebis(pyridinium))"", 'D33V8NB7KB (8-amino-1,3,6-naphthalenetrisulfonic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Naphthalenes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pyridinium Compounds/chemistry/metabolism', 'Xenopus', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/chemistry/metabolism']",2012/10/17 06:00,2012/12/28 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['4291 [pii]', '10.3791/4291 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2012 Oct 5;(68). pii: 4291. doi: 10.3791/4291.,10.3791/4291 [doi] 4291 [pii],20121005,"['P20 AA017067/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA157740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20AA017067/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3490295,,,,,,,['NIHMS556765'],,,,,,

The current analysis evaluated potential bosutinib pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. METHODS: Bosutinib exposure metrics at steady state were estimated from a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model. Safety and efficacy metrics were from two clinical studies of bosutinib 500 mg/day in patients with CP CML. RESULTS: The analysis included 749 patients (aged 18-91 years; mean weight, 75 kg; 54% male). An exposure-response relationship was identified for the pooled incidence (but not severity) of diarrhea, with predicted probability ranging from 0.575 to 0.797 for the lowest and highest area under the curve bins, respectively; a weak relationship was also observed for the incidence of rash (predicted probability, 0.216-0.419). There was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship for nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated alanine and aspartate aminotransferases. Exposure-response relationships were observed in patients with newly diagnosed CP CML for complete cytogenetic response at 1 year (predicted probability, 0.476-0.650), major molecular response at 1 year (0.238-0.497), and cumulative complete hematologic response (CHR) at 1 year (0.605-0.763). Patients with previously treated CP CML showed no exposure-response relationship for major cytogenetic response at 24 weeks (0.320); for CHR, higher bosutinib exposure was associated with a lower probability of response (0.926-0.743). CONCLUSIONS: The absence of exposure-response relationships for some safety and efficacy metrics may reflect bosutinib exposure metrics that exceeded the half-maximal inhibitory values and achieved a maximum effect.","['Hsyu, Poe-Hirr', 'Mould, Diane R', 'Upton, Richard N', 'Amantea, Michael']","['Hsyu PH', 'Mould DR', 'Upton RN', 'Amantea M']","['Pfizer Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA.

One hundred and seventy-five adult de novo AML patients were screened with two different methods for the detection of SNP rs16754: high-resolution melting (HRM) and FRET hybridization probes. Direct sequencing was used to validate both techniques. The SNP was detected in 52 out of 175 patients (30 %), both by HRM and hybridization probes. Direct sequencing confirmed that every positive sample in the screening methods had a variation in the DNA sequence. Patients with the wild-type genotype (WT1(AA)) for the SNP rs16754 were significantly younger than those with the heterozygous WT1(AG) genotype. No other difference was observed for baseline characteristic or outcome between patients with or without the SNP. Both techniques are equally reliable and reproducible as screening methods for the detection of the SNP rs16754, allowing for the selection of those samples that will need to be sequenced.

To test the hypothesis that ABCB7 is a key mediator of ineffective erythropoiesis of RARS, we modulated its expression in hematopoietic cells. ABCB7 up and downregulation did not influence growth and survival of K562 cells. In normal bone marrow, ABCB7 downregulation reduced erythroid differentiation, growth and colony formation, and resulted in a gene expression pattern similar to that observed in intermediate RARS erythroblasts, and in the accumulation of FTMT. Importantly, forced ABCB7 expression restored erythroid colony growth and decreased FTMT expression level in RARS CD34+ marrow cells. Mutations in the SF3B1 gene, a core component of the RNA splicing machinery, were recently identified in a high proportion of patients with RARS and 11 of the 13 RARS patients in this study carried this mutation. Interestingly, ABCB7 exon usage differed between normal bone marrow and RARS, as well as within the RARS cohort. In addition, SF3B1 silencing resulted in downregulation of ABCB7 in K562 cells undergoing erythroid differentiation. Our findings support that ABCB7 is implicated in the phenotype of acquired RARS and suggest a relation between SF3B1 mutations and ABCB7 downregulation.","['Nikpour, Maryam', 'Scharenberg, Christian', 'Liu, Anquan', 'Conte, Simona', 'Karimi, Mohsen', 'Mortera-Blanco, Teresa', 'Giai, Valentina', 'Fernandez-Mercado, Marta', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Hogstrand, Kari', 'Jansson, Monika', 'Vedin, Inger', 'Wainscoat, James Stephen', 'Campbell, Peter', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Grandien, Alf', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Nikpour M', 'Scharenberg C', 'Liu A', 'Conte S', 'Karimi M', 'Mortera-Blanco T', 'Giai V', 'Fernandez-Mercado M', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Hogstrand K', 'Jansson M', 'Vedin I', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Campbell P', 'Cazzola M', 'Boultwood J', 'Grandien A', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Skaraborgs Hospital, Skovde, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK, Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK, Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, and Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABCB7 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/*genetics', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Down-Regulation', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Splicing', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2012.298 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):889-896. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.298.

A robust, reproducible, sensitivity of at least 0.01% has been achieved for IG/TCR clonal rearrangements using allele-specific quantitative PCR (IG/TCR-QPCR) within the EuroMRD consortium. Whether multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) can reach such inter-center performance in ALL MRD monitoring remains unclear. In a multicenter study, MRD was measured prospectively on 598 follow-up bone marrow samples from 102 high-risk children and 136 adult ALL patients, using IG/TCR-QPCR and 4/5 color MFC. At diagnosis, all 238 patients (100%) had at least one suitable MRD marker with 0.01% sensitivity, including 205/238 samples (86%) by using IG/TCR-QPCR and 223/238 samples (94%) by using MFC. QPCR and MFC were evaluable in 495/598 (83%) samples. Qualitative results (<0.01% or >/=0.01%) concurred in 96% of samples and overall positivity (including <0.01% and nonquantifiable positivity) was concurrent in 84%. MRD values >/=0.01% correlated highly (r(2)=0.87) and 69% clustered within half-a-log(10). QPCR and MFC can therefore be comparable if properly standardized, and are highly complementary.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves of Wattakaka volubilis were extracted with aqueous methanol. Liquid-liquid fractionation of the crude methanolic extract with different organic solvents was done and the fractions were screened for in vitro anti-leukemic activity using different leukemic cell lines. The active fractions were then subjected to chromatographic separation for isolation of bioactive compounds. Structure of isolated compound was elucidated by spectroscopic methods. The in vitro anti-leukemic activities of different extracts of the leaves and isolated compound WVP were studied in U-937, HL-60 and K-562 cell-lines by using cell count, MTT [(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] and DNA laddering assays, flow-cytometric and confocal microscopic techniques. RESULTS: Kaempferol-3-O-[alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6) -O]-beta-d-glucopyranoside (WVP) was isolated from crude leaves extract of Wattakaka volubilis. Both the n-butanolic extract (WVB) of Wattakaka volubilis and its isolate WVP were found to be responsible for in vitro anti-leukemic activity. The IC(50) values of WVB were found be 120, 100 and 50(mug/ml) in U937, K562, and HL-60 cell lines, respectively. Whereas, the pure isolate WVP exhibited anti-leukemic activity with IC(50) values of 13.5, 10.8, and 13.2(mug/ml) in U937, K562, and HL-60 cell lines, respectively. The flow-cytometric analysis confirms that the cell cycle arrest occurs at G1 phase in case of U937 and K562 cell lines and G2/M phase in case of HL60 cell lines. Similarly both confocal microsocopic analysis and DNA laddering assay confirm the apoptosis and cell cycle arrests of leukemic cells.

Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was the first oncogenic human retrovirus to be discovered and has been found to be associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has consistently been linked to both endemic and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (BL), as well as to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), post-transplantation proliferative disorders, extra-nodal NK-T-cell lymphoma (nasal type) and B-cell NHL arising in HIV patients; HCV infection is also associated to low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders that can progress to NHL. Bacterial infections have also been associated to NHL; chronic gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori is responsible for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) NHL and high prevalence of Chlamydia psittaci infections has been reported in ocular adnexal lymphomas. In both these conditions, infection may contribute to the development of lymphomas, as proven by the clinical responses eradicating antibiotic therapies. Histological diagnosis coupled with immunohistochemical and molecular procedures are needed for a definitive diagnosis, but Fine Needle Cytology (FNC) combined with ancillary techniques can also produce correct diagnoses in most cases. In patients suffering from NHL, FNC also plays an important role in differential diagnosis between relapse of primary disease and reactive lymph nodes enlargement. This review explores the role of FNC in the diagnosis and classification of NHL trying to highlight possibilities and the limitations of the technique.","['Vigliar, Elena', 'Cipullo, Ciro', 'Todaro, Paolo', 'Giuffre, Giuseppe', 'Pepe, Stefano']","['Vigliar E', 'Cipullo C', 'Todaro P', 'Giuffre G', 'Pepe S']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomorfologiche e Funzionali, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Infez Med,Le infezioni in medicina,9613961,,IM,"['HIV Infections', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', '*Needles']",2012/10/25 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Infez Med. 2012;20 Suppl 3:39-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recurrent nature of the IL7R mutations in the same region strongly suggests that the IL7R mutations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of childhood T-ALL. The aim of this study was to address whether IL7R exon 6 mutation occurs in other human tumors besides childhood T-ALL. For this, we analyzed 1792 tumor tissues from various origins, including 432 hematologic and 1360 nonhematopoietic tumors by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect the exon 6 mutations. Overall, we found 10 IL7R exon 6 mutations in seven hematologic malignancies (three childhood T-ALL [12%], one adult T-ALL [7%], two childhood precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) [2%] and one adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) [1%]) and three nonhematopoietic malignancies (one lung cancer [0.6%] and two colorectal cancer [0.5%]), but none in other tumors. IL7R mutations detected in hematologic tumors were exclusively inframe insertion and delins mutations, whereas those detected in non-hematologic tumors were missense and frameshift mutations. Our data indicate that IL7R exon 6 inframe mutations occur not only in childhood T-ALL but also other acute leukemias at slightly lower frequencies. Our data suggest that the IL7R mutations may contribute to the development of diverse types of acute leukemias, and that possible therapies targeting the IL7R exon 6 mutation should include not only childhood T-ALL but also T-ALL, childhood precursor B-ALL, and adult AML.","['Kim, Min Sung', 'Chung, Nak Gyun', 'Kim, Myung Shin', 'Yoo, Nam Jin', 'Lee, Sug Hyung']","['Kim MS', 'Chung NG', 'Kim MS', 'Yoo NJ', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/*genetics']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(12)00237-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2012.06.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2013 Apr;44(4):551-5. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2012.06.017.

This ability depends on the glutathionylation state of UCP2. UCP2 is often overexpressed in drug resistant cancer cells and therein controls cell ROS levels and limits drug toxicity. With our recent observation that glutathionylation deactivates proton leak through UCP2, we decided to test if diamide, a glutathionylation catalyst, can sensitize drug resistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Using drug sensitive HL-60 cells and the drug resistant HL-60 subline, Mx2, we show that chemical induction of glutathionylation selectively deactivates proton leak through UCP2 in Mx2 cells. Chemical glutathionylation of UCP2 disables chemoresistance in the Mx2 cells. Exposure to 200muM diamide led to a significant increase in Mx2 cell death that was augmented when cells were exposed to either menadione or the anthracycline doxorubicin. Diamide also sensitized Mx2 cells to a number of other chemotherapeutics. Proton leak through UCP2 contributed significantly to the energetics of the Mx2 cells. Knockdown of UCP2 led to a significant decrease in both resting and state 4 (i.e., proton leak-dependent) respiration (~43% and 62%, respectively) in Mx2 cells. Similarly diamide inhibited proton leak-dependent respiration by ~64%. In contrast, diamide had very little effect on proton leak in HL-60 cells. Collectively, our observations indicate that manipulation of UCP2 glutathionylation status can serve as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.","['Pfefferle, Aline', 'Mailloux, Ryan J', 'Adjeitey, Cyril Nii-Klu', 'Harper, Mary-Ellen']","['Pfefferle A', 'Mailloux RJ', 'Adjeitey CN', 'Harper ME']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Proton Pumps)', '0 (UCP2 protein, human)', '0 (Uncoupling Protein 2)', '10465-78-8 (Diamide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diamide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/physiology', 'Proton Pumps/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uncoupling Protein 2']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(12)00288-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Jan;1833(1):80-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.10.006.

To find new agent to overcome GC resistance of ALL is an urgent problem. Here we investigated potential effect of anisomycin on GC-resistant T-ALL CEM-C1 cells and explored involved molecular mechanisms. Dramatic growth inhibition and apoptosis in GC resistant CEM-C1 cells and GC-sensitive CEM-C7 cells induced by anisomycin were observed, which presented in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Correspondingly, anisomycin induced cleaved caspase-3 and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (BimEL and Bad), meanwhile down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1 and Bcl-2), both in a dose- and time-dependent manner in GC resistant CEM-C1 cells. Anisomycin also induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in CEM-C1 cells through increasing expressions of p21 and p27, and attenuating the expression of cyclinA. The rapid up-regulation of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were observed after CEM-C1 cells were incubated with anisomycin. The activation of p38 and JNK could be blocked by respective inhibitors (SB203580 for p38 and SP600125 for JNK) accompanied with the inhibition of apoptosis and changes of apoptosis associated proteins in CEM-C1 cells. These results suggested that anisomycin induced apoptosis of CEM-C1 cells via activation of p38 and JNK, and might be an attractive new agent for treatment of GC-resistant ALL.","['Liu, Y', 'Ge, J', 'Li, Q', 'Gu, L', 'Guo, X', 'Ma, Z G', 'Zhu, Y P']","['Liu Y', 'Ge J', 'Li Q', 'Gu L', 'Guo X', 'Ma ZG', 'Zhu YP']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Immunology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anisomycin/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2013_014 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2013;60(1):101-10. doi: 10.4149/neo_2013_014.,10.4149/neo_2013_014 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of WT1 gene was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood (PB) according to European Leukemia Net (ELN) recommendations. The WT1 expression was related to the expression of a reference gene Abelson (ABL) and the results were calculated as a number of WT1 copies related to 104 copies of ABL gene. The upper normal limit of WT1 expression was set at 50 copies of WT1 to 104 copies of ABL. Morphological, flow cytometry and chimerism examinations were evaluated according to standard protocols.A total of 51 AML patients with overexpressed WT1 gene were analyzed. The median follow-up after transplantation was 14 (2-72) months. WT1 expression levels exceeding the upper normal limit were considered as a sign of impending hematological relapse, in accord with morphological, flow cytometry and chimerism data, as well as with the expression of the specific fusion genes. Moreover, in 7 patients the rise of WT1 expression preceded all other standard methods. Patients with high WT1 expression before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) had significantly worse outcome than patients with low WT1 level.

Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression level of these genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 24 patients with AML, eight patients with AML-CR, 13 patients with CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP), 12 patients with CML in blast crisis (CML-BC), 13 patients with CML-CR and 11 healthy individuals (HI). RESULTS: Overexpression of the BMI-1 gene was found in the AML, CML-CP and CML-BC groups as compared with HI group, while the BMI-1 expression level was lower in patients who achieved CR. In contrast, significantly increased SALL4 expression was only found in AML group, additionally, SALL4 expression was lower in the CML-CP and CML-CR groups compared with the HI group, while the SALL4 expression level in the CML-BC group was higher and significantly greater than that in the CML-CP and CML-CR groups. Moreover, a positive correlation between the expression of SALL4 and BMI-1 genes was found in samples from most groups. There was no significant difference of ABCA3 expression level in AML and CML-BC group in comparison with HI group. Interestingly, the ABCA3 expression level was significantly decreased in the CML-CP, AML-CR and CML-CR in comparison with the HI group. Moreover, the ABCA3 expression level in all of the CR groups was lower than that in their corresponding groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the altered SALL4, ABCA3 and BMI-1 expression pattern in different phases of myeloid leukemia, which may relate to the development and progression to different diseases. SALL4 expression was strongly correlated with BMI-1 in most of the myeloid leukemia patient groups, providing a potential link between SALL4 and BMI-1 in leukemogenesis.","['Shen, Qi', 'Liu, Sichu', 'Hu, Junyan', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Li, Bo', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Ma, Yu', 'Yang, Jianchang', 'Ma, Yupo', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Shen Q', 'Liu S', 'Hu J', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Li B', 'Wu X', 'Ma Y', 'Yang J', 'Ma Y', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2012/10/17 06:00,2012/10/17 06:01,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-12-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-12-42 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2012 Oct 15;12(1):42. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-12-42.,10.1186/1475-2867-12-42 [doi],20121015,,,PMC3538712,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated the trends in CML therapy, including changes, patterns, and persistence to imatinib therapy among patients with newly diagnosed CML. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of 11 years of claims data for patients with newly diagnosed CML included in the Taiwan National Health Insurance program. Pharmacy and diagnosis claims for newly diagnosed CML recorded between 1997 and 2007 year were extracted from the database. Annual overall use, new use of CML therapy, and persistence to imatinib therapy were estimated. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes for CML therapy [i.e., imatinib and conventional therapy: busulfan, hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha (IFNalpha), and cytarabine], and the process code for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were used to categorize treatment patterns. Associations with patients characteristics were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed CML to all patients with CML increased by approximately 4-fold between 1998 and 2007. There were steady increases in the proportions of all treated patients and those starting therapy from 2003 to 2007. Fewer comorbid conditions and lower severity of CML were associated with treatment initiation. Medication persistence varied according to treatment duration, as 38.7% patients continued imatinib for >/= 18 months without interruption but only 7.7% continued imatinib for >/= 5 years. Factors associated with persistence to imatinib therapy were removal of the need for prior authorization for imatinib, and prior use of hydroxyurea and IFNalpha, whereas having undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation led to reduced likelihood of persistence to imatinib therapy. CONCLUSION: Treatment decisions for patients with CML changed over time in routine clinical practice. Our findings suggest that clinicians are increasingly adopting the recommendations of international treatment guidelines for CML. However, persistence to imatinib therapy is still substantially below the recommended level based on current evidence for its efficacy. Our study also highlights the need to improve treatment persistence and effectiveness of imatinib over the long term.","['Chang, Chao-Sung', 'Yang, Yi-Hsin', 'Hsu, Chien-Ning', 'Lin, Min-Ting']","['Chang CS', 'Yang YH', 'Hsu CN', 'Lin MT']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine,Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Health Serv Res,BMC health services research,101088677,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Guideline Adherence/trends', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Taiwan']",2012/10/17 06:00,2013/05/22 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6963-12-359 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6963-12-359 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Health Serv Res. 2012 Oct 16;12:359. doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-12-359.,10.1186/1472-6963-12-359 [doi],20121016,,,PMC3524465,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of more recent vintage has been the appreciation that an alternative outcome of benzene exposure has been the development of one or more types of leukemia. While many investigators agree that the array of toxic metabolites, generated in the liver or in the bone marrow, can lead to traumatic bone marrow injury, the more subtle mechanisms leading to leukemia have yet to be critically dissected. This problem appears to have more general interest because of the recognition that so-called ""second cancer"" that results from prior treatment with alkylating agents to yield tumor remissions, often results in a type of leukemia reminiscent of benzene-induced leukemia. Furthermore, there is a growing literature attempting to characterize the fine structure of the marrow and the identification of so called ""niches"" that house a variety of stem cells and other types of cells. Some of these ""niches"" may harbor cells capable of initiating leukemias. The control of stem cell differentiation and proliferation via both inter- and intra-cellular signaling will ultimately determine the fate of these transformed stem cells. The ability of these cells to avoid checkpoints that would prevent them from contributing to the leukemogenic response is an additional area for study. Much of the study of benzene-induced bone marrow damage has concentrated on determining which of the benzene metabolites lead to leukemogenesis. The emphasis now should be directed to understanding how benzene metabolites alter bone marrow cell biology.","['Snyder, Robert']",['Snyder R'],"['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers the State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA. rsnyder@eohsi.rutgers.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph9082875 [doi]', 'ijerph9082875 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2012 Aug;9(8):2875-93. doi: 10.3390/ijerph9082875.

Benzene is converted to hematotoxic metabolites by the hepatic phase-I enzyme CYP2E1, and these metabolites are detoxified by the phase-II enzyme NQO1. The genes encoding these enzymes are highly polymorphic and studies of these polymorphisms have shown different pathogenic and prognostic features in various hematological malignancies. The potential role of different cytochrome p450 metabolizing enzymes in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in an area of active interest. In this study, we demonstrate aberrant CYP2E1 mRNA over-expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 11 cases of de novo AML with inv(16); CBFbeta-MYH11. CYP2E1 mRNA levels correlated with CBFbeta-MYH11 transcript levels and with bone marrow blast counts in all cases. CYP2E1 over-expression correlated positively with NQO1 mRNA levels (R(2) = 0.934, n = 7). By immunohistochemistry, CYP2E1 protein was more frequently expressed in AML with inv(16) compared with other types of AML (p < 0.001). We obtained serial bone marrow samples from two patients with AML with inv(16) before and after treatment. CYP2E1 mRNA expression levels decreased in parallel with CBFbeta-MYH11 transcript levels and blast counts following chemotherapy. In contrast, CYP1A2 transcript levels did not change in either patient. This is the first study to demonstrate concurrent over-expression of CYP2E1 and NQO1 mRNA in AML with inv(16). These findings also suggest that a balance between CYP2E1 and NQO1 may be important in the pathogenesis of AML with inv(16).","['Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Vadhan-Raj, Saroj', 'Nguyen, Martin H', 'Fernandez, Michael H', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Zhao W', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Nguyen MH', 'Fernandez MH', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Without repair, damage can result in genetic instability and eventually cancer. The strong association between the lack of DNA damage repair, mutations and cancer is dramatically demonstrated by a number of cancer-prone human syndromes, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, ataxia-telangiectasia and Fanconi anemia. Notably, DNA damage responses, and particularly DNA repair, influence the outcome of therapy. Because DNA repair normally excises lethal DNA lesions, it is intuitive that efficient repair will contribute to intrinsic drug resistance. Unexpectedly, a paradoxical relationship between DNA mismatch repair and drug sensitivity has been revealed by model studies in cell lines. This suggests that connections between DNA repair mechanism efficiency and tumour therapy might be more complex. Here, we review the evidence for the contribution of carcinogenic properties of several drugs as well as of alterations in specific mechanisms involved in drug-induced DNA damage response and repair in the pathogenesis of therapy-related cancers.","['Casorelli, Ida', 'Bossa, Cecilia', 'Bignami, Margherita']","['Casorelli I', 'Bossa C', 'Bignami M']","[""Azienda Ospedaliera Sant'Andrea, Via di Grottarossa 1035-1039, Rome, Italy. icasorelli@ospedalesantandrea.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph9082636 [doi]', 'ijerph9082636 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2012 Aug;9(8):2636-57. doi: 10.3390/ijerph9082636.

In these leukemias, proliferation is thought to be driven by constitutive Jak3/Stat5 signaling, mostly due to autocrine production of IL-7, together with high surface expression of the pre-BCR. In this study, we investigated whether particular IgH specificities would predispose Slp65-deficient pre-B cells to malignant transformation. Whereas V(H)-D-J(H) junctions were diverse, we found highly restricted Ig V(H) gene usage: 55 out of 60 (~92%) leukemias used a V(H)14/SM7-family gene, mainly V(H)14-1 and V(H)14-2. When combined with surrogate or conventional L chains, these V(H)14 IgH chains did not provide increased proliferative signals or exhibit enhanced poly- or autoreactivity. We therefore conclude that pre-BCR specificity per se did not contribute to oncogenic transformation. Remarkably, in a high proportion of Slp65-deficient leukemias, the nonexpressed IgH allele also harbored a V(H)14-family rearrangement (10 out of 50) or was in the germline configuration (10 out of 50). V(H)14-1 and V(H)14-2 gene regions differed from their neighboring V(H) genes in that they showed active H3K4me3 histone modification marks and germline transcription at the pro-B cell stage in Rag1-deficient mice. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that in Slp65-deficient mice, malignant transformation is largely limited to particular pre-B cells that originate from pro-B cells that had restricted IgH V(H) region accessibility at the time of V(H)-to D-J(H) recombination.","['Ta, Van B T', 'de Bruijn, Marjolein J W', 'Matheson, Louise', 'Zoller, Markus', 'Bach, Martina P', 'Wardemann, Hedda', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Corcoran, Anne', 'Hendriks, Rudi W']","['Ta VB', 'de Bruijn MJ', 'Matheson L', 'Zoller M', 'Bach MP', 'Wardemann H', 'Jumaa H', 'Corcoran A', 'Hendriks RW']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam 3000 CA, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-7/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/01/16 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1201440 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1201440 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Nov 15;189(10):4842-51. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1201440.

A fusion protein consisting of the ectodomain of B7-H6 and the CD20 single-chain fragment variable 7D8 was generated to mimic an induced self phenotype required for NK cell-mediated target cell elimination. B7-H6:7D8 had bifunctional properties as reflected by its ability to simultaneously bind to the CD20 Ag and to the NKp30 receptor. B7-H6:7D8 bound by CD20(+) lymphoma cells activated human NK cells and triggered degranulation. Consequently, the immunoligand B7-H6:7D8 induced killing of lymphoma-derived cell lines as well as fresh tumor cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma patients. B7-H6:7D8 was active at nanomolar concentrations in a strictly Ag-specific manner and required interaction with both CD20 and NKp30. Remarkably, NK cell cytotoxicity was further augmented by concomitant activation of Fcgamma receptor IIIa or NK group 2 member D. Thus, B7-H6:7D8 acted synergistically with the CD20 Ab rituximab and the immunoligand ULBP2:7D8, which was similarly designed as B7-H6:7D8 but engaging the NK group 2 member D receptor. In conclusion, to our knowledge, B7-H6:7D8 represents the first Ab-based molecule stimulating NKp30-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity for therapeutic purposes and provides proof of concept that Ag-specific NKp30 engagement may represent an innovative strategy to enhance antitumoral NK cell cytotoxicity.","['Kellner, Christian', 'Maurer, Tina', 'Hallack, Daniela', 'Repp, Roland', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'Valerius, Thomas', 'Humpe, Andreas', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Peipp, Matthias']","['Kellner C', 'Maurer T', 'Hallack D', 'Repp R', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Parren PW', 'Valerius T', 'Humpe A', 'Gramatzki M', 'Peipp M']","['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Medicine II, Christian Albrechts University Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7 Antigens)', '0 (FCGR3A protein, human)', '0 (NCR3 protein, human)', '0 (NCR3LG1 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/pharmacology', 'B7 Antigens/agonists/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects/genetics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Rituximab']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/01/16 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1201321 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1201321 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Nov 15;189(10):5037-46. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1201321.

We hypothesized that TERT polymorphisms are associated with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We first conducted a case-control study of 570 ALL cases and 673 cancer-free controls of Chinese children, using the tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) approach. We then examined the functionality of the important SNPs. We found that TERT promoter region tSNP (rs2735940) and two intron region tSNPs (rs2736100 and rs10069690) were associated with risk of childhood ALL (P = 0.036, 0.011 and 0.022, respectively, in allele comparison). The in vitro luciferase assays in Jurkat cells showed an increased transcriptional activity of rs2735940 T allele compared with the C allele. Additional experiments with ALL bone marrow revealed that the rs2735940 T allele increased levels of the TERT messenger RNA. Notably, TERT intron 2 polymorphism (rs2736100) was associated with lower telomerase activity and longer telomeres. Our findings suggested that TERT promoter rs2735940 polymorphism may affect the TERT activity, and rs2736100 may be associated with telomere function, and thus, it is a potential biomarker for genetic susceptibility to ALL in Chinese children.","['Sheng, Xiaojing', 'Tong, Na', 'Tao, Guoquan', 'Luo, Dewei', 'Wang, Meilin', 'Fang, Yongjun', 'Li, Jie', 'Xu, Ming', 'Zhang, Zhengdong', 'Wu, Dongmei']","['Sheng X', 'Tong N', 'Tao G', 'Luo D', 'Wang M', 'Fang Y', 'Li J', 'Xu M', 'Zhang Z', 'Wu D']","['Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'China', 'DNA Primers', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs325 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs325 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Jan;34(1):228-35. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs325.

In order to do this, a retrospective multicenter study was performed from 2005-2011 in 28 Italian hematology divisions in which 43 cases were collected. Forty-one patients received an induction therapy, consisting of an acute myeloid leukemia-type regimen in 26 patients (60%) and acute lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma-type regimen in 15 patients (35%). Six patients (14%) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Seventeen patients (41%) achieved a complete remission: seven after acute myeloid leukemia-type treatment and 10 after an acute lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma-type regimen, with a significant advantage for acute lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma-type chemotherapy (P=0.02). Relapse occurred in six of the 17 patients (35%) who achieved complete remission, more frequently after acute lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma-type chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 8.7 months (range, 0.2-32.9). The patients treated with an acute myeloid leukemia-type regimen had an overall survival of 7.1 months (range, 0.2-19.5), whereas that of the patients receiving acute lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma-type chemotherapy was 12.3 months (range, 1-32.9) (P=0.02). The median overall survival of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 22.7 months (range, 12-32.9), and these patients had a significant survival advantage compared to the non-transplanted patients (median 7.1 months, 0.2-21.3; P=0.03). In conclusion, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm with bone-marrow involvement is an aggressive subtype of high-risk acute leukemia.

Many dose adjustments of the original MD Anderson Cancer Center regimen have been proposed. However, whether fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab relative dose intensity may have an impact on outcome has not yet been investigated. We retrospectively assessed relative dose intensity in 106 community-based patients included in our regional healthcare network from 2004-11, all receiving fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab as first-line treatment outside clinical trials. Dose reductions were observed in 51.4% of patients, mainly decided by the individual physician and not based on recommendations (52.7%), while there were fewer reports of toxicity or dose reduction because of impaired renal function. Progression-free survival was significantly reduced in patients who had a reduction in dose intensity of more than 20% in fludarabine-cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab. Multivariate analysis showed dose of rituximab had a significant impact on minimal residual disease and progression-free survival. Although prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor significantly reduced the rate of grade 3-4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, it had no impact on relative dose intensity and outcome. This study shows that, in routine clinical practice, there is low adherence to the original MD Anderson Cancer Center fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab schedule, and that the decision to modify dosage was mostly taken by the individual physician and was based on anticipated toxicity. This study shows that reduction of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide and, more importantly, of rituximab doses seriously interferes with progression-free survival.","['Bouvet, Emmanuelle', 'Borel, Cecile', 'Oberic, Lucie', 'Compaci, Gisele', 'Cazin, Bruno', 'Michallet, Anne-Sophie', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Ysebaert, Loic']","['Bouvet E', 'Borel C', 'Oberic L', 'Compaci G', 'Cazin B', 'Michallet AS', 'Laurent G', 'Ysebaert L']","['Department of Hematology, Purpan University Hospital, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/16 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.070755 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.070755 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Jan;98(1):65-70. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.070755.

Here, we showed that the homozygous nucleotide T deletion was associated with adverse outcomes and could independently predict shortened survival in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the nucleotide T deletion created an illegitimate binding NPM1 for miR-337-5p, which was widely expressed in different acute myeloid leukemia subtypes and inhibited NPM1 expression. Accordingly, NPM1 levels were found to be significantly reduced and correlated with miR-337-5p levels in patients carrying a homozygous nucleotide T-deletion genotype.

While imatinib uptake into CD34(+) cells is low compared to mononuclear cells, few data evaluate how well dasatinib targets primitive CML cells. This study compares intracellular concentration of dasatinib and Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition in CML-CD34(+) progenitors and mononuclear cells induced by dasatinib. The intracellular concentrations of dasatinib were similar between CML-CD34(+) and mononuclear cells (P=0.8). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the degree of dasatinib-mediated Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition. ABCB1 (MDR1) and ABCG2 inhibitors neither increased dasatinib intracellular concentration nor enhanced dasatinib-mediated Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition. In contrast to nilotinib, we show that dasatinib is not an ABCB1 inhibitor. Thus, dasatinib targets CML-CD34(+) progenitors as effectively as it targets mononuclear cells. ABCB1 and ABCG2 efflux pumps do not appear to influence the intracellular dasatinib concentration in CML-CD34(+) progenitors.","['Hiwase, Devendra K', 'Saunders, Verity A', 'Nievergall, Eva', 'Ross, Douglas D', 'White, Deborah L', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['Hiwase DK', 'Saunders VA', 'Nievergall E', 'Ross DD', 'White DL', 'Hughes TP']","['Haematology Division, SA Pathology, SA, Australia.

We ask whether this distinction may have a molecular basis. We established the gene expression profiles of 39 samples of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (including 12 CD34-positive) and 32 CD34-positive samples of myelodysplastic syndromes by using Affymetrix microarrays, and studied the status of 18 genes by Sanger sequencing and array-comparative genomic hybridization in 53 samples. Analysis of 12 mRNAS from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia established a gene expression signature of 122 probe sets differentially expressed between proliferative and dysplastic cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. As compared to proliferative cases, dysplastic cases over-expressed genes involved in red blood cell biology. When applied to 32 myelodysplastic syndromes, this gene expression signature was able to discriminate refractory anemias with ring sideroblasts from refractory anemias with excess of blasts. By comparing mRNAS from these two forms of myelodysplastic syndromes we derived a second gene expression signature. This signature separated the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative forms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemias. These results were validated using two independent gene expression data sets. We found that myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukemias are characterized by mutations in transcription/epigenetic regulators (ASXL1, RUNX1, TET2) and splicing genes (SRSF2) and the absence of mutations in signaling genes. Myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukemias and refractory anemias with ring sideroblasts share a common expression program suggesting they are part of a continuum, which is not totally explained by their similar but not, however, identical mutation spectrum.","['Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Cervera, Nathalie', 'Bertucci, Francois', 'Brecqueville, Mandy', 'Finetti, Pascal', 'Murati, Anne', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Birnbaum, Daniel']","['Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Cervera N', 'Bertucci F', 'Brecqueville M', 'Finetti P', 'Murati A', 'Arnoulet C', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Mills KI', 'Cross NC', 'Vey N', 'Birnbaum D']","[""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, UMR1068 Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France. gelsiv@marseille.fnclcc.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.071506 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.071506 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Apr;98(4):576-83. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.071506.

Therefore, screening tools are needed for evaluation in treatment protocols and possible inclusion in risk stratification. Besides monosomy 7 and large 7p abnormalities encompassing IKZF1, most IKZF1 alterations are short, intragenic deletions. Based on cohorts of patients, we mapped the microdeletion breakpoints and developed a breakpoint-specific fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction that allows detection of recurrent intragenic deletions. This sensitive test could also detect IKZF1 subclonal deletions, whose prognostic significance should be evaluated.

In preclinical models of B-cell malignancies, alpha-galactosylceramide is an adjuvant to tumor vaccination, enhancing tumor-specific T-cell responses and prolonging survival. However, numerical and functional invariant natural killer T-cell defects exist in patients with some cancers. Our aim was to assess this axis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The numbers of circulating invariant natural killer T cells and the expression of CD1d on antigen-presenting cells were evaluated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and age-matched controls. Cytokine profile and in vitro proliferative capacity were determined. Patient- and control-derived invariant natural killer T-cell lines were generated and characterized, and allogeneic and autologous responses to alpha-galactosylce-ramide-treated leukemia cells were assessed. Absolute numbers and phenotype of invariant natural killer T cells were normal in patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and cytokine profile and proliferative capacity were intact. Chemotherapy-treated patients had reduced numbers of invariant natural killer T cells and myeloid dendritic cells, but alpha-galactosylceramide-induced proliferation was preserved. Invariant natural killer T-cell lines from patients lysed CD1d-expressing targets. Irradiated alpha-galactosylceramide-treated leukemic cells elicited allogeneic and autologous invariant natural killer T-cell proliferation, and alpha-galactosylceramide treatment led to increased proliferation of conventional T cells in response to tumor. In conclusion, the invariant natural killer T-cell and CD1d axis is fundamentally intact in patients with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia and, despite reduced circulating numbers, function is retained in fludarabine-treated patients.

We analyzed 257 consecutive patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia at our institution to characterize extramedullary relapse, identify predictive variables and assess outcomes. The 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated extramedullary or bone marrow relapse was 9% and 29%, respectively. Extramedullary relapse occurred later than marrow relapse and most frequently involved skin and soft tissue. Factors predictive of extramedullary relapse after transplantation included previous extramedullary disease, French-American-British classification M4/M5 leukemia, high risk cytogenetics, and advanced disease status at the time of transplantation. Children were more likely than adults to develop extramedullary relapse, a finding probably explained by an overrepresentation of extramedullary disease prior to transplantation and M4/M5 leukemia in children. Acute graft-versus-host disease was not protective against relapse. Unlike medullary relapse, chronic graft-versus-host disease was not protective against extramedullary relapse. The survival rate after extramedullary relapse was 30% at 1 year and 12% at 2 years.

Somatic mutations in exon 10 of the MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene) gene, mainly substitutions encoding W515 variants, have recently been described in a minority of patients with ET or PMF. We optimized analytically sensitive methods for detecting and genotyping MPL variants. METHODS: We used DNA previously isolated from circulating granulocytes of 60 patients with MPN that had previously been analyzed by high-resolution melting (HRM), direct sequencing, and the TaqMan allelic-discrimination assay. We developed conditions for enriching tumor mutant alleles with COLD-PCR (coamplification at lower denaturation temperature PCR) and coupled it with direct sequencing. Assays were designed for identifying MPL W515 substitutions with full COLD-PCR protocols. In parallel, we used innovative microarray substrates to develop assays for evaluating the mutant burden in granulocyte cells. RESULTS: Mutations that were present at very low levels in patients who had previously been scored as having an MPL variant by HRM and as wild type by direct sequencing were successfully identified in granulocyte DNA. Notably, the microarray approach displayed analytical sensitivities of 0.1% to 5% mutant allele, depending on the particular mutation.

The assay requires no enrichment strategy and allows both the characterization of each variant allele and the evaluation of its proportion in every patient.

In children, T-ALL usually has a worse prognosis than B-ALL, although childhood T-ALL prognoses have improved remarkably. The varying outcomes among T-ALL cases suggest that an unrecognized biological heterogeneity may contribute to chemo-resistance. Deep exploration of T-lymphocyte development in recent years has found a subgroup of patients with a phenotype that resembles early T-cell precursor, which confers a much poorer prognosis than any other form of T-ALL. This novel subtype of T-ALL was called early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL). Flow cytometry data from T-ALL patients enrolled in Shanghai Children's Medical Center between July 2002 and October 2010 were assessed according to Dr. Campana's protocol. Among total 89 T-ALL cases, 74 cases had enough immunophenotype data available to differentiate between ETP (CD1a(-), CD8(-), CD5(dim), at least one marker of stem cell or myeloid lineage) and non-ETP. From these 74 subjects, 12 ETP-ALL cases (16.2%) were identified. The event-free survival (EFS) rate at 66.8 months was 11.1% +/- 10.1% for ETP-ALL and 57.6% +/- 5.6% for non-ETP-ALL (P = 0.003). The overall survival rates were 13.3% +/- 11.0% for ETP-ALL and 64.7% +/- 6.3% for non-ETP-ALL (P = 0.002). Our findings demonstrate that early T-cell precursor leukemia is a very high-risk subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with poor prognosis.","['Ma, Meilin', 'Wang, Xiang', 'Tang, Jingyan', 'Xue, Huiliang', 'Chen, Jing', 'Pan, Ci', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Shen, Shuhong']","['Ma M', 'Wang X', 'Tang J', 'Xue H', 'Chen J', 'Pan C', 'Jiang H', 'Shen S']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'China', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Medical Records/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Treatment Failure']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/05/28 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-012-0224-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2012 Dec;6(4):416-20. doi: 10.1007/s11684-012-0224-4.

The etiology of ALL remains poorly understood, with few established environmental risk factors. These risks were influenced by co-inheritance of multiple low-risk genetic polymorphisms such as variants within cytochrome P450A1 (CYP1A1), NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genes. In this work, we conduct a case-control study to assess the impact of CYP1A1*2A (CYP1A1 T6235C); NQO1*2 (NQO1 C609T); TPMT*2 (TPMT G238C) and TPMT A719G polymorphisms on the risk of developing ALL. The frequencies of TPMT*2, TPMT A719G, NQO1*2 and CYP1A1*2 variants were examined in 100 patients with ALL and 106 healthy controls by allele specific PCR and/or PCR-RFLP methods using blood samples. We have found that NQO1 609CT genotype was overrepresented in patients and was associated with an aggravating effect compared to the reference group with NQO1 609CC genotype (p = 0.028, OR = 1.41; CI 95 %: 1.04-1.93). However, TPMT*2, TPMT 719*G and CYP1A1*2 variants did not appear to influence ALL susceptibility (p > 0.05). Moreover we have not found a significant correlation between the studied variants and Bcr-Abl transcript. In conclusion we retain that leukemogenesis of ALL is associated with carcinogens metabolism and consequently related to environmental exposures.","['Ouerhani, Slah', 'Cherif, Nouha', 'Bahri, Ikbel', 'Safra, Ines', 'Menif, Samia', 'Abbes, Salem']","['Ouerhani S', 'Cherif N', 'Bahri I', 'Safra I', 'Menif S', 'Abbes S']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Haematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia. slah_mekni@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tunisia', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-012-2174-y [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2013 Feb;40(2):1307-14. doi: 10.1007/s11033-012-2174-y.

However, there are only a few studies which have analyzed the prognostic implications of these complex translocations in CML patients after the advent of imatinib mesylate and the results found are conflicting. We investigated the clinical features and cytogenetic response of Brazilian chronic phase (CP) CML patients with variant Ph treated with imatinib mesylate. Among 93 CP CML patients, eight (8.6 %) exhibited complex translocations, involving one (n = 6), two (n = 1), or three (n = 1) additional chromosomes. At 6, 12, and 18 months, a complete cytogenetic response was observed in 100 % of variant Ph patients, respectively. No significant difference was found between variant Ph and standard translocation patients regarding the response to IM treatment at 6, 12, and 18 months. Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups concerning the overall survival, failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and event-free survival. The results obtained in our study, despite our sample size, suggest, in agreement to other data found in the literature, that the presence of variant Philadelphia chromosome does not bestow a prognostic disadvantage when compared to the group with classic Ph. This observation does not suggest the need to adjust the treatment protocol due to the presence of variant Ph. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and evaluating both the cytogenetic and molecular response to IM treatment should be conducted to confirm our findings.","['Koshiyama, Dayane B', 'Capra, Marcelo E Z', 'Paskulin, Giorgio A', 'Rosa, Rafael F M', 'Oliveira, Ceres A V', 'Vanelli, Tito', 'Fogliatto, Laura M', 'Zen, Paulo R G']","['Koshiyama DB', 'Capra ME', 'Paskulin GA', 'Rosa RF', 'Oliveira CA', 'Vanelli T', 'Fogliatto LM', 'Zen PR']","['Clinical Genetics and Graduate Program of Pathology, Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre, Rua Sarmento Leite 245/403, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Chromosomes, Human/ultrastructure', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1598-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Jan;92(2):185-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1598-8.

However, their role in SDS is still unexplored. We demonstrated that morphology, growth kinetics and expression of surface markers of MSCs from SDS patients (SDS-MSCs) were similar to normal MSCs. Moreover, SDS-MSCs were able to differentiate into mesengenic lineages and to inhibit the proliferation of mitogen-activated lymphocytes. We demonstrated in an in vitro coculture system that SDS-MSCs, significantly inhibited neutrophil apoptosis probably through interleukin-6 production. In a long-term coculture with CD34(+)-sorted cells, SDS-MSCs were able to sustain CD34(+) cells survival and to preserve their stemness. Finally, SDS-MSCs had normal karyotype and did not show any chromosomal abnormality observed in the hematological components of the BM of SDS patients.

The results clearly showed the power of sensor as a promising tool for the sensitive, specific, and portable detection of APL and other diseases.","['Lei, Yun', 'Feng, Mei-juan', 'Wang, Kun', 'Lin, Li-qing', 'Chen, Yuan-zhong', 'Lin, Xin-hua']","['Lei Y', 'Feng MJ', 'Wang K', 'Lin LQ', 'Chen YZ', 'Lin XH']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, Faculty of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350004, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Anal Bioanal Chem,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,101134327,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Biosensing Techniques', 'Biotinylation', 'Calibration', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Electrochemistry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00216-012-6477-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Bioanal Chem. 2013 Jan;405(1):423-8. doi: 10.1007/s00216-012-6477-6.

However, the role of Col1a1 in spermatogenesis, especially in the control of proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), remains unknown. In this study, we explored effects of downregulation of Col1a1 on differentiation and proliferation of mouse spermatogonia. Loss-of-function study revealed that Oct4 and Plzf, markers of SSC self-renewal, were significantly decreased, whereas the expression of c-kit and haprin, hallmarks of SSC differentiation, was enhanced after Col1a1 knockdown. Cell cycle analyses indicated that two-thirds of spermatogonia were arrested in S phase after Col1a1 knockdown. In vivo experiments, DNA injection and electroporation of the testes showed that spermatogonia self-renewal ability was impaired remarkably with the loss-of-function of Col1a1. Our data suggest that silencing of Col1a1 can suppress spermatogonia self-renewal and promote spermatogonia differentiation.","['Chen, Sun-Hong', 'Li, Ding', 'Xu, Chen']","['Chen SH', 'Li D', 'Xu C']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Asian J Androl,Asian journal of andrology,100942132,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Seminal Plasma Proteins)', '0 (Trim36 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/*genetics', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/biosynthesis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Seminal Plasma Proteins/metabolism', 'Spermatogenesis/*drug effects', 'Spermatogonia/drug effects/*metabolism']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['aja201266 [pii]', '10.1038/aja.2012.66 [doi]']",ppublish,Asian J Androl. 2012 Nov;14(6):842-9. doi: 10.1038/aja.2012.66.

Gene expression profiling studies suggested that TCL1A could be a marker of SMZL, but reported data are conflicting. We evaluated TCL1A expression in a series of spleen and bone marrow samples involved by SMZL and correlated the findings with other immunophenotypical, morphological, and clinical data. In addition, we evaluated the expression of TCL1A in a series of spleens and lymph nodes involved by lymphomas that might mimic SMZL (13 nodal marginal zone lymphomas (NMZL), 39 follicular lymphomas (FL), 30 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL), 31 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 1 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) and 15 bone marrow specimens involving hairy cell leukemia (HCL). TCL1A staining was negative in 24/31 cases of SMZL (77 %); 27/31 MCL and all B-CLL were positive for TCL1A; 32/34 cases of nodal FL (96 %) and all five splenic FL were positive for TCL1A, although at a lower intensity. Eight of 13 NMZL were positive for TCL1A, often showing a heterogeneous staining pattern. All HCL samples were strongly positive for TCL1A. No correlation was found between the pattern of splenic infiltration, TCL1A expression, and the clinical course. TCL1A-positive SMZL showed a higher rate of DBA44 staining compared to the negative ones, and this difference was statistically significant (Fisher test, single-tailed, p = 0.0397). Our data support the use of TCL1A in the panel of diagnostic markers used in the differential diagnosis of splenic low-grade B-cell lymphoma; a possible prognostic value, however, needs a larger series to be established.","['Munari, Enrico', 'Rinaldi, Marianna', 'Ambrosetti, Achille', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Bonalumi, Angela', 'Chilosi, Marco', 'Zamo, Alberto']","['Munari E', 'Rinaldi M', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Bonifacio M', 'Bonalumi A', 'Chilosi M', 'Zamo A']","['Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, Section of Anatomic Pathology, University of Verona, P.le Scuro 10, 37134 Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/01/24 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00428-012-1322-z [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2012 Dec;461(6):677-85. doi: 10.1007/s00428-012-1322-z.

The study comprised of 133 patients with primary MCC. The expression of BMI1, Snail and c-Myc protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry and compared with clinical parameters, MCV status and patient survival. The presence of MCV was inversely correlated with the expression of BMI1 protein. Tumours expressing BMI1 protein more often presented with lymph node metastases. Snail protein expression was decreased in cases with metastatic dissemination. This study identified two subgroups of MCC: tumours expressing BMI1 but negative for MCV DNA and tumours negative for BMI1 expression but positive for MCV. Importantly, BMI1-positive cases often presented with lymph node metastases. Combined, these results suggest that subtypes of this malignancy exist.","['Kouzmina, Maria', 'Hayry, Valtteri', 'Leikola, Junnu', 'Haglund, Caj', 'Bohling, Tom', 'Koljonen, Virve', 'Hagstrom, Jaana']","['Kouzmina M', 'Hayry V', 'Leikola J', 'Haglund C', 'Bohling T', 'Koljonen V', 'Hagstrom J']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Kasarminkatu 11-13, 00029 HUS, Helsinki, Finland. maria.kouzmina@fimnet.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Merkel cell polyomavirus/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/01/24 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00428-012-1327-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2012 Dec;461(6):647-53. doi: 10.1007/s00428-012-1327-7.

This is consistent with epidemiological evidence suggesting that enteroviral infection may contribute to the autoimmune response in type 1 diabetes. However, immunostaining of VP1 is not definitive since the antibody widely used to detect the protein (Clone 5D8/1) might also cross-react with additional proteins under some conditions. Therefore, we sought to verify that VP1 immunopositivity correlates with additional markers of viral infection. METHODS: Antigen immunoreactivity was examined in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, pancreases from two different collections of type 1 diabetes and control cases: a historical collection from the UK and the nPOD (network of Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes) cohort from the USA. RESULTS: VP1 immunoreactivity was present in ~20% of insulin-containing islets of both cohorts under stringent conditions but was absent from insulin-deficient islets. The presence of VP1 was restricted to beta cells but only a minority of these contained the antigen. The innate viral sensor, protein kinase R (PKR) was upregulated selectively in beta cells that were immunopositive for VP1. The anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukaemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1) was abundant in beta cells that were immunonegative for VP1 but Mcl-1 was depleted in cells containing VP1. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The presence of immunoreactive VP1 within beta cells in type 1 diabetes is associated with a cellular phenotype consistent with the activation of antiviral response pathways and enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis.

Triterpenes has been identified as the major active constituents in Patrinia heterophylla. To elucidate the antitumor mechanism of triterpenes from Patrinia heterophylla1 (TPH), a proteomic analysis is carried out with TPH treatment in K562 cells. The total proteins extracted from TPH treated K562 cells are analyzed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and compared with those untreated K562 cells. Mass spectrometry is applied to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Twenty-three differentially expressed significant proteins are discovered. Eight proteins are later identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and Mascot software. Among them, four proteins are up-regulated (Aldolase A, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Flavin reductase and Hemoglobin subunit) and four proteins were down-regulated (Heat-shock protein 90 <Alpha> (HSP90-<Alpha>), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A, Moesin, tublin) by TPH treatment in K562 cells. The identified proteins are associated with energy metabolism, oxidative stress, apoptosis, signal transduction, differential induction, and protein biosynthesis.

We hypothesized that exercise can reduce the CKD-induced cardiac damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The doxorubicin-induced CKD (DRCKD) model was used in rats to compare two exercise models: 60-min running and 60-min swimming. Results indicated that in healthy normal groups, the signals cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), and gp130 were upregulated and janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) were downregulated by both exercises. In contrast, all signals were highly upregulated in CKD. After exercise training, all signals (CT-1, IL-6, LIFR, gp130, and STAT) were downregulated, with JAK being only slightly upregulated in the running group but not in the swimming group. The myocyte death pathway (CT-1/IL-6 --> LIFR/gp130 --> PI3K --> Akt --> Bad) was excluded due to no change found for Bad. Nitric oxide (NO; normal, 15.63 +/- 0.86 micromol/l) was significantly suppressed in CKD rats (2.95 +/- 0.32 micromol/l), and both running and swimming training highly upregulated the NO level to 30.33 +/- 1.03 micromol/l and 27.82 +/- 2.47 micromol/l in normal subjects and 24.0 +/- 3.2 micromol/l and 22.69 +/- 3.79 micromol/l in the DRCKD rats, respectively. The endothelial progenic cells CD34 were significantly suppressed in DRCKD rats, which were not rescued significantly by exercise. In contrast, the CD 34 cells were only slightly suppressed in the healthy subjects by exercise. CONCLUSION: Both exercise regimens were beneficial by rescuing cardiac function in CKD victims. Its action mechanism was by way of inhibiting myocyte death and rescuing cardiac hypertrophy.","['Chen, Kuan-Chou', 'Hsieh, Chiu-Lan', 'Peng, Chiung-Chi', 'Peng, Robert Y']","['Chen KC', 'Hsieh CL', 'Peng CC', 'Peng RY']","['Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Prev Cardiol,European journal of preventive cardiology,101564430,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cardiomegaly/diagnosis/enzymology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endothelial Cells/enzymology/pathology', '*Exercise Therapy/methods', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Kidney/physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*enzymology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/diagnosis/enzymology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Running', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Swimming', 'Time Factors']",2012/10/16 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2047487312462827 [pii]', '10.1177/2047487312462827 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2014 Apr;21(4):507-20. doi: 10.1177/2047487312462827.

Computer tomography scan showed mild hepatosplenomegaly, lymph node swelling of the neck and axilla, and abdominal lymphadenopathy. He was diagnosed as CLL by bone marrow examination. His laboratory data revealed hepatis C virus(HCV)antibody-positive, and elevated levels of both aminotransferase and HCV-RNA. Liver biopsy demonstrated significant CLL involvement of portal areas and a mild T lymphocyte invasion of centrilobular and portal areas. After treatment with polyethylene glycol interferon (PEG-IFN)-alpha-2b for CH-C, the CLL count was decreased in both peripheral blood and the liver.

If leukemia risks are substantially influenced by exposures that vary in prevalence across generations, then population incidence rates should vary significantly by birth cohort. However, prior studies have not examined leukemia birth cohort effects using contemporary data and methods. METHODS: We used incidence data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program from 1992 through 2009 for adults 25-84 years old and age period cohort models to estimate incidence rate ratios according to birth cohort for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). RESULTS: Leukemia incidence varied significantly between birth cohorts for each major leukemia type in men and women except female AMLs; changes on the order of 1% per birth year or 20% per generation were observed. The most significant birth cohort signatures were observed for CLLs and AMLs in men, which were decreasing and increasing, respectively, in cohorts born since 1946. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that adult leukemia risks are significantly modulated by environmental and lifestyle exposures. IMPACT: A number of well-established (smoking, certain chemicals, radiation) and newly recognized (obesity) leukemia risk factors are modifiable; ultimately, efforts to promote healthy lifestyles might also help reduce incidence rates of adult leukemia.","['Rosenberg, Philip S', 'Wilson, Katherine L', 'Anderson, William F']","['Rosenberg PS', 'Wilson KL', 'Anderson WF']","['Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Blvd, Executive Plaza South, Room 8022, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. rosenbep@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/08/14 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-0910 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0910 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Dec;21(12):2159-66. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0910.

The cytotoxicities of complexes 2-5 were evaluated in vitro against human Jurkat-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and DU-145 human prostate cancer cells. Pt (4) and Au compounds (2 and 5) are more cytotoxic than cisplatin to these cell lines and to cisplatin-resistant Jurkat sh-Bak cell lines and their cell death mechanism is different from that of cisplatin. All the compounds show higher toxicity against leukemia cells when compared to normal human T-lymphocytes (PBMC). The interaction of the Pd and Pt compounds with calf thymus and plasmid (pBR322) DNA is different from that of cisplatin. All compounds bind to human serum albumin (HSA) faster than cisplatin (measured by fluorescence spectroscopy). Weak and stronger binding interactions were found for the Pd (3) and Pt (4) derivatives by isothermal titration calorimetry.

The canonical HAT domain of MORF/MOZ is preceded by a tandem of plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers whose biological roles and requirements for MORF/MOZ activity are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the tandem PHD1/2 fingers of MORF recognize the N-terminal tail of histone H3. Acetylation of Lys9 (H3K9ac) or Lys14 (H3K14ac) enhances binding of MORF PHD1/2 to unmodified H3 peptides twofold to threefold. The selectivity for acetylated H3 tail is conserved in the double PHD1/2 fingers of MOZ. This interaction requires the intact N-terminus of histone H3 and is inhibited by trimethylation of Lys4. Biochemical analysis using NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy and mutagenesis identified key amino acids of MORF PHD1/2 necessary for the interaction with histones. Fluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that both PHD fingers are required for binding to H3K14ac in vivo and localization to chromatin. The HAT assays indicate that the interaction with H3K14ac may promote enzymatic activity in trans. Together, our data suggest that the PHD1/2 fingers play a role in MOZ/MORF HATs association with the chromatic regions enriched in acetylated marks.","['Ali, Muzaffar', 'Yan, Kezhi', 'Lalonde, Marie-Eve', 'Degerny, Cindy', 'Rothbart, Scott B', 'Strahl, Brian D', 'Cote, Jacques', 'Yang, Xiang-Jiao', 'Kutateladze, Tatiana G']","['Ali M', 'Yan K', 'Lalonde ME', 'Degerny C', 'Rothbart SB', 'Strahl BD', 'Cote J', 'Yang XJ', 'Kutateladze TG']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6B protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(12)00813-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2012.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2012 Dec 14;424(5):328-38. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2012.10.004.

Hence, the study of cells in a bulk, whether this bulk is homogenous or heterogeneous, does not provide sufficiently detailed or interpretable results. An advantageous approach would rather be a comprehensive study of cell biological activity in single isolated living cells. In this study, we present an imaging approach for studying pre-apoptotic and very early apoptotic events, during cell death induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) at the single cell level. The aim of this study is to investigate intracellular events, such as the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, before and immediately after LPC introduction to the lymphocytes at the level of individual cells. A new protocol of sequential staining was developed to study the relation between early apoptosis signs (PS externalization), MMP changes and intracellular ROS production rates at an individual Jurkat cell resolution. Simultaneous kinetic assessments of MMP, intracellular ROS levels and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization were performed at a single cell resolution, using Optical LiveCell Array technology and image analysis. The parameters were measured and analyzed both before and during exposure to inducers in a Jurkat cell population, including three groups of single cells: spontaneous apoptotic cells, induced apoptotic cells and fully functional living cells. Exogenous LPC caused a heterogeneous intracellular response among Jurkat cells immediately after its introduction. Subgroups of cells with opposite changes of MMP and different kinetics of ROS increase, were revealed within the whole cell population. The subset of apoptosis-induced Jurkat cells, which became apoptotic within 3h after the LPC introduction, exhibited higher initial MMP compared to fully functional or spontaneous apoptotic cells. LPC-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a concomitant increase in intracellular ROS levels. In the present study, a method is described to assess the intracellular events in cells which were initially different in their physiological status. The individual T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) in vitro have various susceptibilities to LPC effects at the very early stage of contact with the inducer. The apoptotic effect of LPC in individual Jurkat cells is associated with a relatively higher initial MMP before the introduction of the inducer and with a faster ROS formation within the affected cells. Such divergence may be significant in regulating the balance of lymphocyte subsets in pathological sites, either maintaining or preventing the inflammation components of atherosclerosis. We conclude that the presented approach provides the researcher, not only with the cell retaining methodology, but with opportunities to observe and find the distinctive cell subsets within the whole cell population as well, thus helping to define more exactly the role and importance of such sub-populations in physiological or pathological conditions.","['Afrimzon, Elena', 'Zurgil, Naomi', 'Shafran, Yana', 'Leibovich, Pnina', 'Sobolev, Maria', 'Guejes, Larissa', 'Deutsch, Mordechai']","['Afrimzon E', 'Zurgil N', 'Shafran Y', 'Leibovich P', 'Sobolev M', 'Guejes L', 'Deutsch M']","['The Biophysical Interdisciplinary Schottenstein Center for the Research and Technology of the Cellome, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan 52900, Israel. afrimzon@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rhodamines/chemistry/metabolism', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods', 'Time Factors']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-1759(12)00299-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2012.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2013 Jan 31;387(1-2):96-106. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2012.10.001.

We wondered whether the currently recognized predictors could be used to categorize acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who underwent transplantation during remission into risk groups. We analyzed the data of 255 consecutive patients (median age, 26) with AML in their first or second remission (CR1 or CR2) after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Three parameters were found to be predictive of outcome: response after induction therapy, white blood cell count at diagnosis, and cytogenetics. These three factors were combined to yield two risk groups. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse for patients at low and high risk were 8% and 36% (P = .001), respectively. The 3-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival for these two groups were 80% and 52% (P = .001), respectively. Multivariate analysis for relapse and for leukemia-free survival showed that not achieving CR after two courses of therapy was the strongest independent prognostic factor (P = .001 and P = .028, respectively).

Rather than taking a genetic approach favored by many, we took a functional approach to ask how differential mitochondrial readiness for apoptosis (""priming"") might explain individual variation in clinical behavior. We found that mitochondrial priming measured by BH3 profiling was a determinant of initial response to induction chemotherapy, relapse after remission, and requirement for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Differential priming between malignant myeloblasts and normal hematopoietic stem cells supports a mitochondrial basis to the therapeutic index for chemotherapy. BH3 profiling identified BCL-2 inhibition as a targeted strategy likely to have a useful therapeutic index. BH3 profiling refines predictive information provided by conventional biomarkers currently in use and thus may itself have utility as a clinical predictive biomarker.

Few, if any, studies provide the reasons. This hospital-based population study aimed to describe and compare the patient population hospitalized in 2002 and 2010 and determine the disease-specific incidences of candidemia and evaluate the impact of time to initiate antifungal therapy on 30-day mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients hospitalized at a 2300-bed teaching hospital in Taiwan in 2002 and 2010 were analyzed for the distribution of age, sex, and type of underlying diseases (maximum of six diagnoses). All patients with blood isolates that were collected in 2002 and 2010 and yielded Candida species were included for analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics, distribution of Candida species, length of hospital stay before candidemia, stay in the intensive care units at onset of candidemia, time of initiating systemic antifungal agent, antifungal regimen, and 30-day crude mortality. RESULTS: In 2010, the hospitalized patients were older (p < 0.001), had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p < 0.001), and more underlying disease/status, including chronic pulmonary diseases, moderate-to-severe renal diseases, leukemia, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal malignancies (p < 0.001) than those seen in 2002. Multivariate analysis identified the following host factors were associated with the occurrence of candidemia in 2010: neonate (adjust odds ratio [OR], 3.67), 45-64 year (OR, 2.18) and the elderly (OR 2.64), compared with young adult (20-44 year); patients with moderate-to-severe renal diseases (OR, 8.08), leukemia (OR, 4.58) and lymphoma (OR 3.98) and gastrointestinal malignancies (OR 2.80). The incidence density of candidemia was 0.34 and 0.41 per 1000 patient-days in 2002 and 2010, respectively (p = 0.04). The majority of characteristics of patients with candidemia and disease-specific incidences of candidemia did not differ between 2002 and 2010. Despite more patients in 2010 receiving antifungal therapy on the same day or 1 day after onset (27.5% vs. 41.2%, respectively, p = 0.002), the 30-day mortality remained high (45.9% in 2002 and 44.4% in 2010). Moreover, time to initiate antifungal therapy had no impact on 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: This hospital-based population study demonstrated that the incidence density of candidemia was high and increased in 2010 compared with 2002, which was at least in part due to the increase in the proportion of patients at a higher risk of candidemia. Although antifungal therapy was initiated earlier in 2010, the 30-day mortality remained high.","['Chen, Pao-Yu', 'Chuang, Yu-Chung', 'Wang, Jann-Tay', 'Sheng, Wang-Huei', 'Yu, Chung-Jen', 'Chu, Chen-Chen', 'Hsueh, Po-Ren', 'Chang, Shan-Chwen', 'Chen, Yee-Chun']","['Chen PY', 'Chuang YC', 'Wang JT', 'Sheng WH', 'Yu CJ', 'Chu CC', 'Hsueh PR', 'Chang SC', 'Chen YC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Medical Information Management Office, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Infection Control, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University, College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.

Today, steroids have become an important therapeutic tool in many diseases, but pharmacological mechanisms responsible for their side effects are still little known. The neuropsychiatric side effects concern 15% of patients while severe reactions occur in 5% of cases, mostly as acute psychotic episodes such as delusion. Serious forensic risks in this context are poorly documented and underestimated. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 77 year-old man, treated by methylprednisolone for chronic lymphoid leukemia. After two months of treatment, although stabilized for the neoplastic disease, he stabbed his wife to death with a knife. In the emergency unit, an acute delirious state, a disorganization syndrome, and confusion items such as amnesia, disorientation and symptomatology fluctuation were observed. Mr. M also presented with hyponatremia and infectious pneumonia. Steroids were stopped and his condition rapidly declined, he died one month later during the hospitalization. DISCUSSION: This clinical case underlines the importance of the early detection of steroid psychosis and its management. Treatment should not be stopped brutally and a dose reducing strategy should be applied in combination with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic treatment. Disease management strategies are insufficiently documented to be recommended. The extremely acute onset of the symptoms, a partial insight into delusions, a history of iatrogenic neuropsychiatry, the existence of somatic precipitating disorders and confusion factors should always alert the practitioner. The patient, and eventually his family circle, must be aware of the risks of adverse psychiatric effects of steroids for both ethical and forensic reasons, and must report them as early as possible to the clinician if they occur.","['Airagnes, G', 'Rouge-Maillart, C', 'Garre, J-B', 'Gohier, B']","['Airagnes G', 'Rouge-Maillart C', 'Garre JB', 'Gohier B']","[""Departement de psychiatrie et de psychologie medicale, CHU d'Angers, 49933 Angers cedex 09, France. guillaumeairagnes@yahoo.fr""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Encephale,L'Encephale,7505643,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Homicide/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Psychoses, Substance-Induced/*diagnosis/*psychology', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis/mortality']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0013-7006(11)00222-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.encep.2011.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Encephale. 2012 Oct;38(5):440-4. doi: 10.1016/j.encep.2011.11.007.

To investigate the emergence dynamics of mutations and their effects on outcomes, we conducted a systematically longitudinal study of BCR-ABL1 mutation dynamics during TKI therapy. Seminested polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography with sequence confirmation were used to detect BCR-ABL1 mutations in 202 CML patients with imatinib resistance at different CML phases. We detected 68 mutations in 58 imatinib-failure patients. Mutations were present in 27.6% of patients who failed front-line imatinib therapy and in 68.1% with advanced disease. Mutations were not detected in patients before commencing imatinib treatment. Pyrosequencing was then used to quantitatively monitor the mutant levels sequentially and also traced back for their earlier appearance. The mutants differed in rapidity of emergence which appeared to arise in different time frame as well as in speed of rising mutant levels. In the 78 front-line imatinib-failure patients, mutation positive patients had significantly higher risk of disease progression or relapse and inferior progression-free survival compared to those without mutations (p=0.006). Our study demonstrates kinetics of different BCR-ABL1 mutant emergence and an association between BCR-ABL1 mutations and disease progression.","['Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Kuo, Ming-Chung', 'Kuo, Ching-Yuan', 'Lin, Tseng-Hsi', 'Bai, Li-Yaun', 'Chen, Tsai-Yun', 'Wang, Ming-Chung', 'Lin, Tung-Liang', 'Lan, Yii-Jenq', 'Chen, Chih-Cheng', 'Yang, Youngsen', 'Hsiao, Pei-Ching', 'Lai, Chang-Liang', 'Chang, Chia-Hui', 'Lin, Tung-Huei']","['Shih LY', 'Kuo MC', 'Kuo CY', 'Lin TH', 'Bai LY', 'Chen TY', 'Wang MC', 'Lin TL', 'Lan YJ', 'Chen CC', 'Yang Y', 'Hsiao PC', 'Lai CL', 'Chang CH', 'Lin TH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan. sly7012@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00385-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jan;37(1):43-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.012.

Biochemical signaling pathways for these responses have been elucidated, and recent evidence points to the involvement of force-induced deformation of the nucleus. However, it is still unclear how physical cues received at the plasma membrane (PM) spatiotemporally integrate to the functional chromatin organization of the cell nucleus. To investigate this issue, we applied mechanical forces through magnetic particles adhered to the PM of single cells and mapped the accompanying changes in actin polymerization, nuclear morphology, chromatin remodeling, and nuclear transport of soluble signaling intermediates using high-resolution fluorescence anisotropy imaging. Using this approach, we show the timescales associated with force-induced polymerization of actin and changes in the F/G actin ratio resulting in nuclear translocation of the G-actin-associated transcriptional cofactor, megakaryoblastic acute leukemia factor-1 (MKL). Further, this method of measuring nuclear organization at high spatiotemporal resolution with simultaneous force application revealed the physical propagation of forces to the nucleus, resulting in changes to chromatin organization, followed by nuclear deformation. We also describe a quantitative model that incorporates active stresses and chemical kinetics to evaluate the observed timescales. Our work suggests that mechanical activation of cells is accompanied by distinct timescales involved in the reorganization of actin and chromatin assembly, followed by translocation of transcription cofactors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.","['Iyer, K Venkatesan', 'Pulford, S', 'Mogilner, A', 'Shivashankar, G V']","['Iyer KV', 'Pulford S', 'Mogilner A', 'Shivashankar GV']","['Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Actins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Magnets', '*Mechanical Phenomena', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Trans-Activators']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-3495(12)00967-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.041 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2012 Oct 3;103(7):1416-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2012.08.041.

The comparative analysis of HL-60 versus CD34+ cells revealed differentially methylated promoter regions including genes that are frequently methylated in AML, such as p15/INK4B, OLIG2, RARss2 and estrogen receptor. Microarray data was validated by quantitative pyrosequencing. We corroborate previous reports that MeDIP, in our study combined with a promoter tiling array (MeDIP-Chip), is a robust method to identify genes that are differentially methylated in AML cells in a genome-wide manner, and is thus useful to identify new epigenetic targets for therapeutic or prognostic research.","['Yalcin, Arzu', 'Kreutz, Clemens', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Abdelkarim, Mahmoud', 'Klaus, Gregor', 'Timmer, Jens', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Hackanson, Bjorn']","['Yalcin A', 'Kreutz C', 'Pfeifer D', 'Abdelkarim M', 'Klaus G', 'Timmer J', 'Lubbert M', 'Hackanson B']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2012/10/16 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00387-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jan;37(1):102-11. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.014.

Knowledge about uptake mechanisms could be used to increase the selectivity of the drugs. We compared the uptake patterns of, daunorubicin (DNR), doxorubicin (DOX), epirubicin (EPI), idarubicin (IDA), and pirarubicin (PIRA) by cultured leukemic cells and investigated possible involvement of specific carriers. METHODS: HL-60 cells were incubated with anthracyclines for 1 hour in the absence or presence of transport inhibitors, suramin, or nucleosides and cellular drug uptake was determined. Cell survival was also determined. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were used as a negative control for concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs). Anthracycline concentration was determined with HPLC and fluorometric detection and apoptosis was determined with propidium iodide and flow cytometry. RESULTS: DNR, IDA, and PIRA had higher uptake than DOX and EPI with a prominent increase in uptake at concentrations > 1 microM. Uptake of all anthracyclines was greatly reduced at 0 degrees C. Suramin, a purinergic-2-receptor inhibitor, strongly inhibited the uptake of all anthracyclines except PIRA and increased cell survival. Dipyridamole, an equilibrative NT (ENT) inhibitor, significantly inhibited the uptake of DNR only. The addition of nucleosides significantly inhibited the uptake of DNR, IDA, and PIRA but not in MCF-7 cells lacking functional CNTs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest different uptake mechanisms for the anthracyclines studied. We found evidence for carrier mediated uptake mechanisms, supporting involvement of NTs in transmembrane transport of DNR, IDA, and PIRA. The results also showed a strong inhibition of suramin on anthracycline uptake by so far unknown mechanisms.","['Karim, Hazhar', 'Bogason, Alex', 'Bhuiyan, Hasanuzzaman', 'Fotoohi, Alan K', 'Lafolie, Pierre', 'Vitols, Sigurd']","['Karim H', 'Bogason A', 'Bhuiyan H', 'Fotoohi AK', 'Lafolie P', 'Vitols S']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, L7:03, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. sigurd.vitols@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Deliv,Current drug delivery,101208455,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Purinergic Antagonists)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nucleosides/pharmacology', 'Purinergic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Suramin/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2012/10/16 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,['2012/10/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['CDD-EPUB-20121008-2 [pii]', '10.2174/1567201811310040005 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Deliv. 2013 Aug;10(4):404-12. doi: 10.2174/1567201811310040005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adults tend to present with higher-risk features and are unable to tolerate chemotherapy regimens as intense as those administered to children. The overall treatment plan for adult ALL is modeled after the pediatric paradigm and includes multi-agent chemotherapy in the forms of induction, consolidation, maintenance, and central nervous system prophylaxis. Most patients will go into complete remission but often relapse; relapse is typically indicative of chemotherapy-refractory disease. Salvage therapy generally consists of cytotoxic agents from drug classes the patient has had limited or no exposure to. The results of conventional chemotherapy for relapsed ALL are unacceptable. The goal of therapy in these patients is to achieve a second remission followed by allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Monoclonal antibodies directed at cell-surface antigens offer a targeted approach to treating leukemia and other cancers. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to improve survival when used in the frontline setting. Novel, highly active antibodies directed at CD19 and CD22 are being investigated in the relapsed and refractory settings.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Three hundred thirty five HIV seropositive cases, selected from 7,387 forensic postmortem inquests by law, were studied in Ramathibodi hospital between 2000 and 2010. The study topics were sex, age, cause of death, manner of death, and pathological features. Autopsies were done in 67 cases. The pathological features were classified into five groups, (a) HIV disease with infectious and parasitic diseases, (b) HIV disease with malignant neoplasms, (c) HIV disease with other specified diseases, (d) HIV disease with other conditions, and (e) HIV disease with unspecified pathology. RESULTS: The average prevalence of HIV seropositive cases was 4.5%. The peak was 10.0% in 2001 and gradually decreased until 1.8% in 2010. The ratio of male:female was 4:1. The most manner of death was natural death (83.6%). In unnatural death cases, the most frequently method was suicide by hanging. The prevalence of HIV group (a) to group (e) were 56.7%, 6.0%, 3.0%, 17.9%, and 16.4%, respectively. Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common found in group (a) with frequency of 28.4%. Kaposi's sarcoma of skin, coronary atherosclerosis, and fatty change of liver were frequently observed in HIV group (b) to group (d), respectively. The pathology showed multiple pathological features in each group, i.e., group (a) pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, disseminated fungal infection, brain abscess, and meningitis, group (b) Kaposi's sarcoma of skin and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, group (c) coronary atherosclerosis, chronic pyelonephritis, gastritis, and cirrhosis of the liver, and group (d) cardiomegaly, fatty change of liver; pulmonary edema, and splenomegaly. CONCLUSION: HIV disease causes pathology of various organs. The severities vary from severe to asymptomatic disease. Five pathological patterns of HIV were established in this study that showed interesting topics, i.e., pulmonary tuberculosis was the most frequent and occurred (28.4%) in HIV disease with infectious and parasitic diseases while Kaposi's sarcoma of skin frequently occurred in HIV disease with malignant neoplasms.

While the aberrant activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been linked with hematopoietic malignancies, we hypothesized that scorpion venom mediates its effects by modulating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In the present study, we examined the effects of scorpion venom component III (SVCIII) on the human leukemia cell lines THP-1 and Jurkat and focused on the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Our results showed that SVCIII inhibited cell proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and inhibited the expression of cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 in a dose-dependent manner in THP-1 and Jurkat cells. SVCIII also suppressed the constitutive NF-kappaB activation through inhibition of the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. NF-kappaB luciferase reporter activity was also inhibited by SVCIII. Our data suggest that SVCIII, a natural compound, may exert its antiproliferative effects by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB and, thus, has potential use in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, alone or in combination with other agents.","['Song, Xiangfeng', 'Zhang, Guojun', 'Sun, Aiping', 'Guo, Jiqiang', 'Tian, Zhongwei', 'Wang, Hui', 'Liu, Yufeng']","['Song X', 'Zhang G', 'Sun A', 'Guo J', 'Tian Z', 'Wang H', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou; ; Department of Immunology, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,2012/10/13 06:00,2012/10/13 06:01,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2012.548 [doi]', 'etm-04-01-0146 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2012 Jul;4(1):146-150. doi: 10.3892/etm.2012.548.

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratorial test results and treatment outcome of the pediatric APL patients. Regime 1 used an in-house developed protocol, regime 2 was modified from the PETHEMA LPA99 protocol, regime 3 was modified from the European-APL93 protocol, and regime 4 used a protocol suggested by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology. The overall complete remission rates for the four regimes were 88.9, 87.5, 97.1 and 87.5%, respectively, which exhibited no statistical difference. However, more favorable results were observed for regimes 2 and 3 than regimes 1 and 4, in terms of the estimated 3.5-year disease-free survivals, relapse rates, drug toxicity (including hepatotoxicity, cardiac arrhythmia, and differentiation syndrome) and sepsis.

Nevertheless, we are now confronted the therapeutic difficulties of ATL that is a most aggressive T cell leukemia/lymphoma. Using next-generation strategies, emerging molecular characteristics such as specific surface markers and an additional catalog of signals affecting the fate of leukemic cells have been added to the molecular hallmarks that constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of ATL. Although human T cell leukemia virus type 1 is undoubtedly involved in ATL leukemogenesis, most leukemic cells do not express the viral protein Tax. Instead, cellular gene expression changes dominate homeostasis disorders of infected cells and characteristics of ATL. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of ATL molecular pathology, which supports the biological properties of leukemic cells. In addition, we discuss the recent discovery of two molecular hallmarks of potential generality; an abnormal microRNA pattern and epigenetic reprogramming, which strongly involve the imbalance of the molecular network of lymphocytes. Global analyses of ATL have revealed the functional impact of crosstalk between multifunctional pathways. Clinical and biological studies on signaling inhibitory agents have also revealed novel oncogenic drivers that can be targeted in future. ATL cells, by deregulation of such pathways and their interconnections, may become masters of their own destinies. Recognizing and understanding of the widespread molecular applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of novel strategies for treating ATL.","['Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Yamagishi M', 'Watanabe T']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2012/10/13 06:00,2012/10/13 06:01,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2012.00334 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2012 Sep 17;3:334. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00334. eCollection 2012.,10.3389/fmicb.2012.00334 [doi],20120917,,,PMC3444139,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'epigenetics', 'genome', 'miRNA', 'signal transduction']",,,,,,,

We hypothesized that these patients are at an increased risk for a secondary malignancy. OBJECTIVES: (i) To investigate the epidemiology and site-specific risk of second primary cancers (SPCs) in patients with MM (ii) To investigate the factors affecting survival in MM patients with SPCs. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study employing data available in the US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. SUBJECTS: Adult patients (>18 years) where MM was the first of two, or more primary cancers, such that the diagnosis of MM and the SPC was separated by at least 1 month. RESULTS: The age-adjusted rate SPCs in MM was 0.22 per 100,000 (95% CI=0.05-2.1). The incidence of SPCs was higher in patients aged >/=70 years, men and blacks. Age, gender and race were significant predictors for the occurrence of SPCs in MM. The risk of solid malignancies was significantly decreased (SIR: 0.94, 95% CI=0.89-0.99), while that of lymphohematopoieitc (LAHM) malignancies increased in MM (SIR: 1.68, 95% CI= 1.46-1.92). 5-year relative survival among MM patients with SPCs was higher in blacks (54.6%, 95% CI=49.5-59.4) than whites (53.8%, 95% CI=51.3-56.3) or other races (49.9%, 95% CI=39.8-59.3).

RESULTS: The final diagnoses included AML, MDS, AA, drug poisoning, and non-hematological diseases. PB WT1 mRNA was overexpressed in AML and MDS, whereas the patients with other diseases mostly tested negatively for the transcript. The patients with MDS with higher marrow blast counts had higher PB WT1 mRNA levels. The sensitivity of the PB WT1 transcript in detecting AML and MDS was 78%, and the specificity was 90%. CONCLUSION: The WT1 mRNA level in PB may help diagnose AML and MDS in patients with pancytopenia.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Matsuda, Yasufumi', 'Takai, Mihoko', 'Tasaki, Toshiki', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Negoro, Eiju', 'Ikegaya, Satoshi', 'Takagi, Kazutaka', 'Kishi, Shinji', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Matsuda Y', 'Takai M', 'Tasaki T', 'Hosono N', 'Negoro E', 'Ikegaya S', 'Takagi K', 'Kishi S', 'Yoshida A', 'Urasaki Y', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Matsuoka, Eiheiji, Fukui, Japan. tyamauch@u-fukui.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis', 'Pancytopenia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'WT1 Proteins/*blood']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['32/10/4479 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Oct;32(10):4479-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: By direct sequencing, we first found two known polymorphisms (-536 A/G and -276 C/T). Further TaqMan assays and logistic regression analyses were performed in order to characterize the association between the -276 C/T polymorphism of ERBB3 and lung cancer risk in 425 patients with lung cancer and 411 healthy controls. To examine the potential effects of the -276 C/T polymorphism on ERBB3 transcription, luciferase reporter assays were performed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. RESULTS: The -276 C/T polymorphism was associated with the risk of lung cancer in a recessive model of never-smokers. Interestingly, the T allele conferred significantly lower promoter activity by 32% and 33% than the C allele in H2009 and H358 cell lines. CONCLUSION: ERBB3 promoter polymorphisms affect ERBB3 gene expression, and contribute to genetic susceptibility to lung cancer in never-smokers.","['Sung, Jae Sook', 'Jin, Lihua', 'Jo, Ukhyun', 'Park, Kyong Hwa', 'Kim, Yeul Hong']","['Sung JS', 'Jin L', 'Jo U', 'Park KH', 'Kim YH']","['Genomic Research Center for Lung and Breast/Ovarian Cancers, Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Aged', 'Asians/*genetics/statistics & numerical data', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Genes, erbB', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Risk', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Smoking/adverse effects']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['32/10/4433 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Oct;32(10):4433-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure of the compound has been previously described. However, only limited bioactivity data are available and little has been reported about the cytotoxic potential of ianthelline since its discovery. In addition, no study has so far aimed at identifying which cellular mechanisms are affected by ianthelline to generate cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of ianthelline was tested against one non-malignant and ten malignant cell lines. The effects of ianthelline on key cell division events were studied in sea urchin embryos. Tyrosine kinase ABL (ABL), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and a panel of 131 kinases were further tested for sensitivity to ianthelline. RESULTS: Ianthelline inhibits cellular growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Disturbed mitotic spindle formation was found in sea urchin embryos exposed to ianthelline. In addition, pronuclear migration and cytokinesis were severely inhibited. No effect on DNA synthesis was detectable. Ianthelline did not significantly inhibit ABL, but did provoke weak dose-dependent inhibition of PKA and PTP1B. It strongly inhibited the activity of 1 out of 131 tested kinases (to residual activity <10 %), with a Gini co-efficient of 0.22 for the degree of selectivity of kinase inhibition. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that ianthelline is a cytotoxic marine compound, which exerts its antiproliferative effects by several mechanisms that include inhibition of mitotic spindle formation and inhibition of protein kinase activity.","['Hanssen, Kine O', 'Andersen, Jeanette H', 'Stiberg, Trine', 'Engh, Richard A', 'Svenson, Johan', 'Geneviere, Anne-Marie', 'Hansen, Espen']","['Hanssen KO', 'Andersen JH', 'Stiberg T', 'Engh RA', 'Svenson J', 'Geneviere AM', 'Hansen E']","['Centre for Research-based Innovation on Marine Bioactivities and Drug Discovery, MabCent, University of Tromso, Breivika, Tromso, Norway. kine.o.hanssen@uit.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (ianthelline)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Products/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Porifera/*chemistry', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sea Urchins/drug effects/embryology', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['32/10/4287 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Oct;32(10):4287-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We characterized non-apoptotic actions of glucocorticoids on tumor cell lines, primary tumor cells and an in vivo model, together with molecular signaling studies. RESULTS: Glucocorticoids enhanced cell proliferation in 9/17 cell lines and significantly promoted tumor cell proliferation in a pre-clinical mouse model of lung carcinoma. 65/139 primary acute childhood leukemia samples were glucocorticoid-resistant. Both dexamethasone and prednisolone increased in vitro survival in 21/65 samples from glucocorticoid-resistant primary leukemias, revealing a completely new action of glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone-induced proliferation was mediated by glucocorticoid receptor and activated the proliferation signaling pathways of protein kinase B/AKT and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that restriction of the use of glucocorticoids during anticancer treatment might improve the outcome of patients with solid tumors.","['Gundisch, Sibylle', 'Boeckeler, Eva', 'Behrends, Uta', 'Amtmann, Eberhard', 'Ehrhardt, Harald', 'Jeremias, Irmela']","['Gundisch S', 'Boeckeler E', 'Behrends U', 'Amtmann E', 'Ehrhardt H', 'Jeremias I']","['Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/analysis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['32/10/4251 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Oct;32(10):4251-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A monoallelic deletion (del13qx1) was detected in 123 cases (88%), a biallelic deletion (del13qx2) in eight and a mosaic of monoallelic and biallelic deletions (del13qx1/del13qx2) in nine. In 33% of cases, deletion encompassed the Rb1 locus The median percentage of abnormal nuclei was 50% (15%-96%), and it was higher in patients with a biallelic/mosaic pattern in comparison with patients with monoallelic deletion. Sixty two patients (44%) have been treated; 5-year treatment free survival rate was 56% and the median treatment free survival was 65 months. The baseline percentage of deleted nuclei, as a continuous variable, was related to progression (HR: 1.02; p = 0.001). According to deletion burden, three groups were identified: 64 cases (46%) had <50% deleted nuclei, 47 (33%) had 50-69% deleted nuclei, and 29 (21%) had >/=70% deleted nuclei. The 5-year untreated rate was 70.5% , 52.6% and 28.7% (p < 0.0001), respectively. In multivariate analysis using IGHV mutational status, presence of a nullisomic clone, CD38 expression and percentage of deleted nuclei as covariates, only IGHV mutational status and the percentage of deleted nuclei were independent risk factors for treatment. In 103 patients serially monitored by I-FISH before starting any treatment, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of del13q14 cells, and this increase affected the risk of subsequent treatment requirement (HR 2.54, p = 0.001). The appearance of a new clone was detected in 16 patients (15.5%) and chromosome 13 was involved in 14 of them.

Constitutive expression of COX-2 protects hepatocytes from several pro-apoptotic stimuli. Increased hepatic apoptosis has been observed in experimental models of diabetes. Our present aim was to analyze the role of COX-2 as a regulator of apoptosis in diabetic mouse liver. Mice of C57BL/6 strain wild type (Wt) and transgenic in COX-2 (hCOX-2 Tg) were separated into Control (vehicle) and SID (streptozotocin induced diabetes, 200 mg/kg body weight, i.p.). Seven days post-injection, Wt diabetic animals showed a decrease in PI3K activity and P-Akt levels, an increase of P-JNK, P-p38, pro-apoptotic Bad and Bax, release of cytochrome c and activities of caspases-3 and -9, leading to an increased apoptotic index. This situation was improved in diabetic COX-2 Tg. In addition, SID COX-2 Tg showed increased expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and XIAP. Pro-apoptotic state in the liver of diabetic animals was improved by over-expression of COX-2. We also analyzed the roles of high glucose-induced apoptosis and hCOX-2 in vitro. Non-transfected and hCOX-2-transfected cells were cultured at 5 and 25 mM of glucose by 72 h. At 25 mM there was an increase in apoptosis in non-transfected cells versus those exposed to 5 mM. This increase was partly prevented in transfected cells at 25 mM. Moreover, the protective effect observed in hCOX-2-transfected cells was suppressed by addition of DFU (COX-2 selective inhibitor), and mimicked by addition of PGE(2) in non-transfected cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that hyperglycemia-induced hepatic apoptosis is protected by hCOX-2 expression.","['Frances, Daniel E A', 'Ingaramo, Paola I', 'Mayoral, Rafael', 'Traves, Paqui', 'Casado, Marta', 'Valverde, Angela M', 'Martin-Sanz, Paloma', 'Carnovale, Cristina E']","['Frances DE', 'Ingaramo PI', 'Mayoral R', 'Traves P', 'Casado M', 'Valverde AM', 'Martin-Sanz P', 'Carnovale CE']","['Instituto de Fisiologia Experimental (IFISE-CONICET), Facultad de Ciencias Bioquimicas y Farmaceuticas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Rosario, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/biosynthesis', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Liver/*metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Streptozocin', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/biosynthesis', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/biosynthesis']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/07/10 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24409 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2013 Mar;114(3):669-80. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24409.,10.1002/jcb.24409 [doi],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

The translation elongation inhibitor homoharringtonine (Omacetaxine mepesuccinate) is undergoing clinical trials for chronic myeloid leukemia, whereas the translation initiation inhibitor silvestrol has shown promise in mouse models of cancer. Precisely how these compounds induce cell death is unclear, but reduction in Mcl-1, a labile pro-survival Bcl-2 family member, has been proposed to constitute the critical event. Moreover, the contribution of translation inhibitors to neutropenia and lymphopenia has not been precisely defined. Herein, we demonstrate that primary B cells and neutrophils are highly sensitive to translation inhibitors, which trigger the Bax/Bak-mediated apoptotic pathway. However, contrary to expectations, reduction of Mcl-1 did not significantly enhance cytotoxicity of these compounds, suggesting that it does not have a principal role and cautions that strong correlations do not always signify causality. On the other hand, the killing of T lymphocytes was less dependent on Bax and Bak, indicating that translation inhibitors can also induce cell death via alternative mechanisms. Indeed, loss of clonogenic survival proved to be independent of the Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis altogether. Our findings warn of potential toxicity as these translation inhibitors are cytotoxic to many differentiated non-cycling cells.","['Lindqvist, L M', 'Vikstrom, I', 'Chambers, J M', 'McArthur, K', 'Ann Anderson, M', 'Henley, K J', 'Happo, L', 'Cluse, L', 'Johnstone, R W', 'Roberts, A W', 'Kile, B T', 'Croker, B A', 'Burns, C J', 'Rizzacasa, M A', 'Strasser, A', 'Huang, D C S']","['Lindqvist LM', 'Vikstrom I', 'Chambers JM', 'McArthur K', 'Ann Anderson M', 'Henley KJ', 'Happo L', 'Cluse L', 'Johnstone RW', 'Roberts AW', 'Kile BT', 'Croker BA', 'Burns CJ', 'Rizzacasa MA', 'Strasser A', 'Huang DC']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. lindqvist@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (silvestrol)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational/drug effects', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012149 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.149 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Oct 11;3:e409. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.149.,10.1038/cddis.2012.149 [doi],20121011,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,PMC3481137,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding affinity and binding mode of this tri-copper complex (as well as the previously reported mono- and di-copper analogues) towards duplex DNA were determined by using UV/Vis spectroscopic titrations and fluorescent indicator displacement (FID) assays. These studies showed the three complexes to bind moderately (in the order of 10(4) M(-1)) to duplex DNA (ct-DNA and a 26-mer sequence). Furthermore, the number of copper centres and the nature of the substituents were found to play a significant role in defining the binding mode (intercalative or groove binding). The nuclease potential of the three complexes was investigated by using circular plasmid DNA as a substrate and analysing the products by agarose-gel electrophoresis. The cleaving activity was found to be dependent on the number of copper centres present (cleaving potency was in the order: tri-copper>di-copper>mono-copper). Interestingly, the tri-copper complex was able to cleave DNA without the need of external co-reductants. As this complex displayed the most promising nuclease properties, cell-based studies were carried out to establish if there was a direct link between DNA cleavage and cellular toxicity. The tri-copper complex displayed high cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines. Of particular interest was that it displayed high cytotoxicity against the cisplatin-resistant MOLT-4 leukaemia cell line. Cellular uptake studies showed that the tri-copper complex was able to enter the cell and more importantly localise in the nucleus. Immunoblotting analysis (used to monitor changes in protein levels related to the DNA damage response pathway) and DNA-flow cytometric studies suggested that this tri-copper(II) complex is able to induce cellular DNA damage.","['Suntharalingam, Kogularamanan', 'Hunt, Douglas J', 'Duarte, Alexandra A', 'White, Andrew J P', 'Mann, David J', 'Vilar, Ramon']","['Suntharalingam K', 'Hunt DJ', 'Duarte AA', 'White AJ', 'Mann DJ', 'Vilar R']","['Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London SW7 2AZ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Copper/*chemistry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/chemistry/*drug effects', 'DNA Cleavage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/chem.201202482 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2012 Nov 19;18(47):15133-41. doi: 10.1002/chem.201202482.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in almost all cellular activities such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In this work, we use miRNA microarrays to profile miRNA expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with inducible HIF-1alpha expression, and identify 19 differentially expressed miRNAs. Our study shows that HIF-1alpha represses the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a by downregulating c-Myc expression. These two miRNAs alleviate hypoxia and HIF-1alpha-induced differentiation of AML cells. More intriguingly, miR-17 and miR-20a directly inhibit the p21 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) expression, both of which can reverse miR-17/miR-20a-mediated abrogation of HIF-1alpha-induced differentiation. Moreover, we show in vivo that miR-20a contributes to HIF-1alpha-induced differentiation of leukemic cells.

However, despite the improved prognosis, the course of cancer treatment continues to be a very stressful experience in the life of a child. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to assess the occurrence and severity of treatment-related symptoms manifested by children and adolescents undergoing active cancer treatment and to examine the relationships between therapy-related symptoms, depressive symptoms, and quality of life of these pediatric patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used, and 135 Hong Kong Chinese children (9- to 16-year-olds) who were admitted for treatment of cancer in a pediatric oncology unit were invited to participate in the study. RESULTS: Results indicated that children and adolescents receiving combined cancer treatment generally experienced greater symptom occurrence and severity. In addition, children reporting greater symptom occurrence and severity experienced higher levels of depression and a lower level of quality of life. The study revealed that therapy-related symptoms are a strong predictor of quality of life of children and adolescents hospitalized for cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer and its treatments significantly affect the psychosocial well-being and quality of life of children and adolescent hospitalized for cancer care. Therapy-related symptoms can be a useful indicator for screening those pediatric patients who are likely to exhibit psychosocial distress or are at high risk of depression. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is essential for nurses to be sensitive and knowledgeable about the therapy-related symptoms of cancer treatment and their effects on children and adolescents to promote the psychosocial well-being of these patients and enhance their quality of life.","['Li, Ho Cheung William', 'Williams, Phoebe D', 'Lopez, Violeta', 'Chung, Joyce Oi Kwan', 'Chiu, Sau Ying']","['Li HC', 'Williams PD', 'Lopez V', 'Chung JO', 'Chiu SY']","['School of Nursing, University of Hong Kong, China. william3@hku.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Asians/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/diagnosis/etiology/*nursing', 'Female', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Inpatients/*statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia/nursing', 'Lymphoma/nursing', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/ethnology/*nursing/psychology/therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Survival Rate']",2012/10/13 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0b013e31824062ec [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2013 Sep-Oct;36(5):346-54. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e31824062ec.,10.1097/NCC.0b013e31824062ec [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cardiotoxicity is usually detected only when clinical symptoms or progressive cardiac dysfunction have already occurred. Early detection of cardiotoxicity may lead to better therapeutic outcome. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) has been hypothesized to reflect increased left ventricular wall stress before development of echocardiographic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to detect cardiac abnormalities using plasma NTproBNP and echocardiography in asymptomatic childhood leukemia survivors treated with or without cardiotoxic anthracycline therapy. METHODS: Serum levels of NTproBNP were determined in 69 asymptomatic survivors of childhood leukemia treated with or without anthracyclines and in 44 apparently healthy controls. The survivors were divided into two treatment groups: 36 patients after chemotherapy containing anthracyclines (ANT) and 33 patients after chemotherapy without anthracyclines (nonANT). Levels of NTproBNP were measured by using the Elecsys 2010 immunoassay analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Echocardiography using M-mode, two-dimensional and Doppler measurements were performed on the same day as blood samples were obtained for NTproBNP analysis in survivors. RESULTS: Serum levels of NTproBNP were significantly higher in the ANT group than in controls (median 51.52 vs 17.37 pg/ml; p=0.0026). Survivors exposed to ANT had significantly increased levels of NTproBNP compared with patients treated without ANT (median 51.52 vs 12.24 pg/ml; p=0.0002). Female exposed and unexposed survivors had significantly higher NTproBNP levels than males. Four of the 36 survivors (11%) treated with ANT and two of the 33 patients (6%) not exposed to ANT had abnormal NTproBNP levels. Although no patient had echocardiographic abnormalities, significant differences were found in values of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and deceleration time (DT) between survivors treated with or without anthracyclines. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of NTproBNP detected in childhood leukemia survivors after low anthracycline cumulative doses might reflect an initial stage of ANT cardiotoxicity before the development of echocardiographic abnormalities. Although the current studies support NTproBNP as one of the best available biochemical markers of late anthracycline cardiotoxicity, a possible strategy toward further improvement and combination with other cardiac biomarkers and novel echocardiographic methods should be explored in additional studies.","['Mladosievicova, Beata', 'Urbanova, Dagmar', 'Radvanska, Eva', 'Slavkovsky, Peter', 'Simkova, Iveta']","['Mladosievicova B', 'Urbanova D', 'Radvanska E', 'Slavkovsky P', 'Simkova I']","['Institute of Pathological Physiology, School of Medicine, Comenius University, Sasinkova 4, 811 08, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. beata.mladosievicova@fmed.uniba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', '*Heart Injuries/blood/chemically induced/complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Survivors']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-31-86 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-31-86 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Oct 11;31:86. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-31-86.,10.1186/1756-9966-31-86 [doi],20121011,,,PMC3503876,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphological features of bone marrow necrosis are disruption of the normal marrow architecture and necrosis of myeloid tissue and medullary stroma. Non-malignant conditions associated with bone marrow necrosis are sickle cell anemia, infections, drugs (sulfasalazine, interferon alpha, all-trans retinoic acid, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and fludarabine), disseminated intravascular coagulation, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and acute graft versus host diseases. The malignant causes are leukemia, lymphoma and metastatic carcinomas. Herein we report the case of a patient with precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and bone marrow necrosis at initial presentation.

On examination, we observed pallor, tachypnea, tachycardia, low blood pressure, fever, petechial hemorrhage, ecchymoses, tortuous dilated veins over the chest and upper part of abdomen, multiple small cervical lymph node enlargements, mildly enlarged spleen, palpable liver and gross abdominal distention. Blood analysis revealed pancytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Imaging results showed mediastinal widening on a planar chest X-ray and diffuse focal infiltration of the axial bone marrow on magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral vertebrae. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy examination showed extensive bone marrow necrosis. Immunophenotyping analysis of the bone marrow biopsy confirmed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as CD3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase markers were positive and CD10, CD20 and CD79a markers were negative. CONCLUSION: The aggressive initial clinical presentation of our patient with huge mediastinal widening, development of superior vein cava syndrome and extensive bone marrow necrosis as initial signs made the diagnosis of the case difficult. The necrotic hematopoietic cells gave inconclusive results on the initial immunohistochemistry tests. The prognosis of bone marrow necrosis is better secondary to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the pediatric age group compared with adults and those with underlying solid tumors. Despite the aggressive behavior at initial presentation, the patient responded to chemotherapy and necrosis disappeared at day 28 after the start of the therapeutic regimen.","['Khoshnaw, Najmaddin S H', 'Al-Rawi, Hisham A', 'Nore, Beston F']","['Khoshnaw NS', 'Al-Rawi HA', 'Nore BF']","['Department of Hematology, Hiwa Hematology-Oncology Center, Kurdistan Regional Government, Sulaimaniyah, Iraq. najmaddin_salih@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2012/10/13 06:00,2012/10/13 06:01,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-349 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-349 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 Oct 11;6:349. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-349.,10.1186/1752-1947-6-349 [doi],20121011,,,PMC3492084,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we explored the possibility that forced TCRzeta gene expression may upreg-u-late T cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation and reverse interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in T cells from patients with CML. A recombinant eukaryotic vector expressing TCRzeta was transfected into T cells by nucleofection. Phosphorylated TCRzeta, phosphorylated NF-kappaB, and the IL-2 level in TCRzeta-transfected CD3+T cells that were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies were measured by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significantly increased TCRzeta levels were found in TCRzeta-transfected CD3+T cells. After CD3 and CD28 antibody stimulation, a significantly higher phosphorylated TCRzeta chain level was demonstrated, and an increased IL-2 production in TCRzeta-upregulated T cells was associated with the increased expression of the phosphorylated NF-kappaB. In conclusion, TCRzeta gene transfection could restore TCRzeta chain deficiency and enhance IL-2 production in T cells from patients with CML. It is possible that TCRzeta chain reconstitution in leukemia-specific, clonally expanded T cells will effectively increase their activation of antileukemia cytotoxicity.","['Zha, Xianfeng', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Shi, Li', 'Li, Bo', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zha X', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Shi L', 'Li B', 'Wu X', 'Lu Y', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, zeta chain)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'CD3 Complex/immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Muromonab-CD3/immunology/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/01/19 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2012.1798 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2012 Nov;31(11):1628-35. doi: 10.1089/dna.2012.1798.

Despite all efforts made in past years, prognosis remains to be poor. At least in part, this might be explained by a pronounced resistance of CC cells to undergo apoptosis. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are imperatively required. In this study we investigated the effect of Salinomycin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic, on CC cells as an appropriate agent to treat CC. Salinomycin was quite recently identified to induce apoptosis in cancer stem cells and to overcome apoptosis-resistance in several leukemia-cells and other cancer cell lines of different origin. METHODS: To delineate the effects of Salinomycin on CC, we established an in vitro cell culture model using three different human CC cell lines. After treatment apoptosis as well as migration and proliferation behavior was assessed and additional cell cycle analyses were performed by flowcytometry. RESULTS: By demonstrating Annexin V and TUNEL positivity of human CC cells, we provide evidence that Salinomycin reveals the capacity to break apoptosis-resistance in CC cells. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate that the non-apoptotic cell fraction is characterized by sustainable impaired migration and proliferation. Cell cycle analyses revealed G2-phase accumulation of human CC cells after treatment with Salinomycin. Even though apoptosis is induced in two of three cell lines of CC cells, one cell line remained unaffected in regard of apoptosis but revealed as the other CC cells decreased proliferation and migration. CONCLUSION: In this study, we are able to demonstrate that Salinomycin is an effective agent against previously resistant CC cells and might be a potential candidate for the treatment of CC in the future.","['Lieke, Thorsten', 'Ramackers, Wolf', 'Bergmann, Sabine', 'Klempnauer, Jurgen', 'Winkler, Michael', 'Klose, Johannes']","['Lieke T', 'Ramackers W', 'Bergmann S', 'Klempnauer J', 'Winkler M', 'Klose J']","['Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrans)', '62UXS86T64 (salinomycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/*pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology']",2012/10/13 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/10/13 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-466 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-466 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Oct 11;12:466. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-466.,10.1186/1471-2407-12-466 [doi],20121011,,,PMC3487825,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood of leukemic children were induced with gamma- interferon (IFN-gamma), CD3McAb and interluki-2 (IL-2), and co-cultured with dendritic cells (DCs) to generate DC-CIK cells. The morphology and immunophenotype of these cells were determined by a light microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels released by DC-CIK cells were quantified by ELISA. Cytotoxicity of DC-CIK cells against leukemia cell lines was measured by MTT assay. FCM was used to detect CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells, while RT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine mRNA and protein expressions of Foxp3 and GATA3 in DC-CIK cells treated with T-bet monoclonal antibody. FINDINGS: Induced DC-CIK cells were regular, round and transparent with variable cell volume and cellular aggregation. The main effector cells in this population were CD3(+)CD8(+) cells and CD3(+)CD56(+) cells. We demonstrated a time dependent increase in IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels after induction. DC-CIK cells were cytotoxic to B95 cells, Jhhan cells and M07e cells, with the highest cytotoxicity towards B95 cells. Treatment with mouse anti-human T-bet monoclonal antibody resulted in an increase in the proportion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells and elevation of Foxp3 and GATA3 mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: DC-CIK cells induced with cytokines were strongly cytotoxic towards a number of cancer cell lines. Foxp3 and GATA3 were implicated in the T-bet mediated anti-neoplastic effects of DC-CIK cells via activation of the Th1 pathway and suppression of the Th2 and Treg pathways.","['Miao, Liu', 'Run-Ming, Jin', 'Yi, Jiang']","['Miao L', 'Run-Ming J', 'Yi J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,,2012/10/12 06:00,2012/10/12 06:01,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2012 Mar;22(1):43-51.,,,,,PMC3448214,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytokine Induced Killer Cells', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Foxp3', 'GATA3']",,,,,,,

Bone pain is an important symptom that can be severe. Eosinophilia without any other abnormal laboratory findings is rare in ALL. Strongyloides stercoralis in ALL causes disseminated fatal disease. CASE PRESENTATION: This 9-year-old girl presented with bone pain in lumbar region. Bone pain was the only symptom. The patient didn't have organomegaly. The BM samples were studied by flow cytometry, which showed pre-B cell ALL. Larva of Strongyloides stercoralis was found in fecal examination. Plain chest x ray showed bilateral para-cardiac infiltration. Strongyloidiasis was treated before starting chemotherapy. After two days treatment with Mebendazol the patient developed cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress and fever. The treatment changed to Ivermectin for 2 days. Chemotherapy started five days after diagnosis of leukemia. CONCLUSION: The patient complained merely of bone pain in lumbar region without any other signs and symptoms. Peripheral blood smear showed eosinophilia without any other abnormality. Stool examination showed Strongyloides stercoralis larvae. We suggest that all patients diagnosed as ALL in tropical and subtropical regions should be evaluated for parasitic infection especially with Strongyloides stercoralis.","['Nesheli, Hassan Mahmoodi', 'Moghaddam, Tahereh Galini', 'Zahedpasha, Yadollah', 'Norouzi, Ali-Reza']","['Nesheli HM', 'Moghaddam TG', 'Zahedpasha Y', 'Norouzi AR']","['Non-Communicable pediatric disease research center, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,,2012/10/12 06:00,2012/10/12 06:01,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2011 Dec;21(4):549-52.,,,,,PMC3446142,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Eosinophilia', 'Strongyloidiasis']",,,,,,,

The AMLL is easily misdiagnosed because of a dual character involved with lymphoid and myeloid cells. At present, researches of AMLL in adults are more common. Only some are reported for children. Therefore, our aim was to study clinical characteristics of the childhood AMLL. METHODS: From January 2000 to July 2009, 14 cases of AMLL children were selected by morphological and immunophenotyping methods from 185 cases of childhood acute leukemia admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Science and Technology of Huazhong University. Medical records of all AMLL cases were reviewed for clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Fourteen cases of AMLL were screened from 185 cases of acute leukemia by morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular (MICM). The rate of childhood AMLL accounted for 7.57% of pediatric acute leukemia (AL) diagnosed in the research period; white blood cell count in most of the patients was normal, the average value being 31.0x10(9)/L in the first visit. In the 14 cases of AMLL, 8 cases were B-Ly+/My+, 2 cases were T-Ly+/My+B, and 4 were T+B-Ly+/My+. Among them, nine cases received treatment. Consequently, 6 cases reached complete remission (CR); 1 case had not complete remission; 2 cases did not complete the treatment. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of AMLL should depend on the comprehensive evaluation of MICM. As there are still many problems concerning AMLL, it is very necessary that the research units collaborate with each other to improve the prognosis of childhood AMLL. The limitations and applications of the results are that they are only based on the patients of one hospital.","['Zhang, Yaodong', 'Tan, Lina', 'Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Wei, Haiyan', 'Hu, Qun']","['Zhang Y', 'Tan L', 'Zhang X', 'Wei H', 'Hu Q']","[""Zhengzhou Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,,2012/10/12 06:00,2012/10/12 06:01,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2011 Dec;21(4):521-5.,,,,,PMC3446147,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Mixed-Lineage Leukemia', 'Bone Marrow Morphology', 'Hydrochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping']",,,,,,,

Rapid diagnostic tests are needed for prompt diagnosis and early treatment which is crucial for optimal management. We assessed the utility of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1) in the diagnosis of bacteremia and fungemia in febrile neutropenic patients. METHODS: Sixty-five febrile neutropenic children with malignancy hospitalized in Mofid Children's Hospital during a period of one year from January 2007 were recruited for this cross sectional study (mean age 66.2+/- 37 months; 35 females and 30 males). Thirty patients (46.2%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 (3.1%) acute myeloid leukemia, one (1.5%) lymphoma and 32 (49.2%) were under treatment for solid tumors. Simultaneous blood samples were collected for measurement of serum sTREM-1 levels and for blood cultures which were grown in BACTEC media. Gold standard for the presence of infection was a positive BACTEC culture as a more sensitive method compared to current blood culture techniques. FINDINGS: Blood cultures with BACTEC system were positive in 13(20%) patients (12 bacterial and one fungal culture). The mean serum sTREM-1 level in BACTEC positive patients was 948.2+/-592.9 pg/ml but in BACTEC negative cases it was 76.3+/-118.8 pg/ml (P<0.001). The optimal cut-off point of sTREM-1 for detecting patients with positive result of BACTEC was 525 pg/ml with sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a significant association between serum sTREM-1 level and bacteremia and fungemia in febrile neutropenic patients suffering malignancy with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.","['Arzanian, Mohammad-Taghi', 'Soltani, Babak', 'Fahimzad, Alireza', 'Shiva, Farideh', 'Shamshiri, Ahmad-Reza', 'Karimi, Abdollah']","['Arzanian MT', 'Soltani B', 'Fahimzad A', 'Shiva F', 'Shamshiri AR', 'Karimi A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,,2012/10/12 06:00,2012/10/12 06:01,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2011 Sep;21(3):301-6.,,,,,PMC3446192,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BACTEC', 'Fever', 'Malignancy', 'Neutropenia', 'sTREM-1']",,,,,,,

The biological activity of BLyS is mediated by three cell surface receptors: BR3/BAFF-R, TACI and BCMA. The expression of these receptors is highly restricted to B cells, both normal and malignant. A BLyS-gelonin fusion toxin (BLyS-gel) was generated consisting of the recombinant plant-derived toxin gelonin fused to the N-terminus of BLyS and tested against a large and diverse panel of B-NHL cell lines. Interestingly, B-NHL subtypes mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B cell precursor-acute lymphocytic leukemia (BCP-ALL) were preferentially sensitive to BLyS-gel mediated cytotoxicity, with low picomolar EC(50) values. BLyS receptor expression did not guarantee sensitivity to BLyS-gel, even though the construct was internalized by both sensitive and resistant cells. Resistance to BLyS-gel could be overcome by treatment with the endosomotropic drug chloroquine, suggesting BLyS-gel may become trapped within endosomal/lysosomal compartments in resistant cells. BLyS-gel induced cell death was caspase-independent and shown to be at least partially mediated by the ""ribotoxic stress response."" This response involves activation of p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK, and BLyS-gel mediated cytotoxicity was inhibited by the p38/JNK inhibitor SB203580. Finally, BLyS-gel treatment was shown to localize to sites of disease, rapidly reduce tumor burden, and significantly prolong survival in xenograft mouse models of disseminated BCP-ALL, DLBCL, and MCL. Together, these findings suggest BLyS has significant potential as a targeting ligand for the delivery of cytotoxic ""payloads"" to malignant B cells.","['Luster, Troy A', 'Mukherjee, Ipsita', 'Carrell, Jeffrey A', 'Cho, Yun Hee', 'Gill, Jeffrey', 'Kelly, Lizbeth', 'Garcia, Andy', 'Ward, Christopher', 'Oh, Luke', 'Ullrich, Stephen J', 'Migone, Thi-Sau', 'Humphreys, Robin']","['Luster TA', 'Mukherjee I', 'Carrell JA', 'Cho YH', 'Gill J', 'Kelly L', 'Garcia A', 'Ward C', 'Oh L', 'Ullrich SJ', 'Migone TS', 'Humphreys R']","['Department of Oncology Research, Human Genome Sciences, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0047361 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-16909 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47361. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0047361.

Emerging conflicting data and lack of reproducibility of results within the scientific community has now led to the association of XMRV with CFS being discounted. Indeed the case for an involvement with any human disease has been questioned with the suggestion that XMRV is a laboratory generated recombinant virus. The fact that not all published positive findings can be easily explained as contamination artefacts coupled with the observation that XMRV may have a sexually transmitted mode of infectivity and can be infectious for primates, where it preferential resides in cells of the reproductive tract, prompted us to look for evidence of XMRV in the cervical cells of a cohort of Kenyan women both with and without pre-existing HIV/HPV infections. RESULTS: Using a highly sensitive and selective triplex PCR approach we analysed DNA from the liquid based cytology (LBC) cervical smears of 224 Kenyan women. There was no evidence of XMRV expression in any of the sample population irrespective of HPV and/or HIV status. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented show no indication of XMRV infection in any of the cervical samples screened in this study. Approximately 50% of the women were HIV positive but this did not influence the findings signifying that XMRV does not act as an opportunistic infection in this cohort nor is it related to HPV status. Our results therefore support the findings that XMRV is confined to the laboratory and does not currently represent an infectious agent for humans, with a cautionary adage that such potential zoonotic viruses should be carefully monitored in the future.","['He, Xiaotong', 'Walker, Thomas D J', 'Maranga, Innocent O', 'Oliver, Anthony W', 'Hampson, Lynne', 'Hampson, Ian N']","['He X', 'Walker TD', 'Maranga IO', 'Oliver AW', 'Hampson L', 'Hampson IN']","[""Viral Oncology Laboratories, University of Manchester School of Cancer & Enabling Sciences, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Kenya', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*diagnosis/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/*diagnosis/virology', '*Vaginal Smears', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*pathogenicity']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0047208 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-17658 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47208. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0047208.

Impaired degradation leading to the maintenance of Mcl-1 expression is an important determinant of drug resistance in cancer. Phosphorylation at Thr 163 in the PEST region, stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetic acid (TPA)-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), is associated with Mcl-1 stabilization in BL41-3 Burkitt lymphoma cells. This contrasts with the observation that Thr 163 phosphorylation in normal fibroblasts primes glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3)-induced phosphorylation at Ser 159, producing a phosphodegron that targets Mcl-1 for degradation. In the present follow-up studies in BL41-3 cells, Mcl-1 degradation was found to be independent of the GSK3-mediated pathway, providing a parallel to emerging findings showing that Mcl-1 degradation through this pathway is lost in many different types of cancer. Findings in Mcl-1-transfected CHO cells corroborated those in BL41-3 cells in that the GSK3-targeted phosphodegron did not play a major role in Mcl-1 degradation, and a phosphomimetic T163E mutation resulted in marked Mcl-1 stabilization. TPA-treated BL41-3 cells, in addition to exhibiting Thr 163 phosphorylation and Mcl-1 stabilization, exhibited an approximately 10-fold increase in resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including Ara-C, etoposide, vinblastine, or cisplatin. In these cancer cells in which Mcl-1 degradation is not dependent on the GSK3/phosphodegron-targeted pathway, ERK activation and Thr 163 phosphorylation are associated with pronounced Mcl-1 stabilization and drug resistance - effects that can be suppressed by inhibition of ERK activation.","['Nifoussi, Shanna K', 'Vrana, Julie A', 'Domina, Aaron M', 'De Biasio, Alfredo', 'Gui, Jingang', 'Gregory, Mark A', 'Hann, Stephen R', 'Craig, Ruth W']","['Nifoussi SK', 'Vrana JA', 'Domina AM', 'De Biasio A', 'Gui J', 'Gregory MA', 'Hann SR', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Threonine/*metabolism', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0047060 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-19117 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47060. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0047060.

Increasing reports have focused on the association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphisms with susceptibility to acute leukemia and have generated controversial results. The goal of the present study was to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. METHODS: Relevant literature has been rigorously searched and screened. Eligible studies were identified for the period up to Apr 2012. Meta-analyses evaluating the association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val variation with acute leukemia were carried out. Subgroup analyses on ethnicity, clinical types and source of controls were further performed. RESULTS: A total of thirteen publications including fourteen case-control studies with 2164 cases and 4160 controls were selected for analysis. The overall data indicated a significant association of CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism with acute leukemia risk (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.11-1.98; dominant model: OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.05-1.51; recessive model: OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.04-1.83). In subgroup analysis on ethnicity, increased risk was shown among mixed ethnicities (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.46-3.82; dominant model: OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.01-1.86; recessive model: OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.37-3.53) but not Asians or Caucasians. In subgroup analysis on clinical types, increased risk was observed in the acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) subgroup (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.42-3.01; recessive model: OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.32-2.76) but not in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subgroup. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism might be a low-penetrant risk factor for acute leukemia. Subgroup analyses suggest that homozygous Val/Val alleles might modify the susceptibility to ALL.","['Zhuo, Wenlei', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Zhu, Bo', 'Qiu, Zhiqun', 'Chen, Zhengtang']","['Zhuo W', 'Zhang L', 'Zhu B', 'Qiu Z', 'Chen Z']","['Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. zhuowenlei@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0046974 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-13633 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46974. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0046974.

Despite recent advances in the treatment, AML remains an incurable disease. Matrine, a major component extracted from Sophora flavescens Ait, has been demonstrated to exert anticancer effects on various cancer cell lines. However, the effects of matrine on AML remain largely unknown. Here we investigated its anticancer effects and underlying mechanisms on human AML cells in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that matrine inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in AML cell lines as well as primary AML cells from patients with AML in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Matrine induced apoptosis by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential, inducing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, reducing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, increasing activation of caspase-3, and decreasing the levels of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2. The apoptotic effects of matrine on AML cells were partially blocked by a caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK and a PI3K/Akt activator IGF-1, respectively. Matrine potently inhibited in vivo tumor growth following subcutaneous inoculation of HL-60 cells in SCID mice. These findings indicate that matrine can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of AML cells and may be a novel effective candidate as chemotherapeutic agent against AML.","['Zhang, Shenghui', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Zhuang, Yan', 'Wang, Jiajie', 'Ye, Jianqin', 'Zhang, Si', 'Wu, Jianbo', 'Yu, Kang', 'Han, Yixiang']","['Zhang S', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhuang Y', 'Wang J', 'Ye J', 'Zhang S', 'Wu J', 'Yu K', 'Han Y']","['Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolizines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinolizines/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0046853 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-15164 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46853. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0046853.

Deregulated expression of each of these three oncogenes has been independently shown to contribute to cell proliferation of erythroleukemic clones. Previous studies showed a close relationship between Spi-1 and Fli-1, which belong to the same ETS family, Spi-1 activating fli-1 gene, and both Spi-1 and Fli-1 activating multiple common target genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that Spi-1 and Fli-1 are also involved in direct miR-17-92 transcriptional activation through their binding to a conserved ETS binding site in its promoter. Moreover, we demonstrated that physiological re-expression of exogenous miR-17 and miR-20a are able to partially rescue the proliferation loss induced by Fli-1 knock-down and identified HBP1 as a target of these miRNA in erythroleukemic cells.

We originally targeted PML-RARA expression with CTSG regulatory elements, based on the early observation that this gene was maximally expressed in cells with promyelocyte morphology. Here, we show that both Ctsg, and PML-RARA targeted to the Ctsg locus (in Ctsg-PML-RARA mice), are expressed in the purified KLS cells of these mice (KLS = Kit(+)Lin(-)Sca(+), which are highly enriched for HSPCs), and this expression results in biological effects in multi-lineage competitive repopulation assays. Further, we demonstrate the transcriptional consequences of PML-RARA expression in Ctsg-PML-RARA mice in early myeloid development in other myeloid progenitor compartments [common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs)], which have a distinct gene expression signature compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Although PML-RARA is indeed expressed at high levels in the promyelocytes of Ctsg-PML-RARA mice and alters the transcriptional signature of these cells, it does not induce their self-renewal. In sum, these results demonstrate that in the Ctsg-PML-RARA mouse model of APL, PML-RARA is expressed in and affects the function of multipotent progenitor cells. Finally, since PML/Pml is normally expressed in the HSPCs of both humans and mice, and since some human APL samples contain TCR rearrangements and express T lineage genes, we suggest that the very early hematopoietic expression of PML-RARA in this mouse model may closely mimic the physiologic expression pattern of PML-RARA in human APL patients.","['Wartman, Lukas D', 'Welch, John S', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Klco, Jeffery M', 'Lamprecht, Tamara', 'Varghese, Nobish', 'Nagarajan, Rakesh', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Wartman LD', 'Welch JS', 'Uy GL', 'Klco JM', 'Lamprecht T', 'Varghese N', 'Nagarajan R', 'Ley TJ']","['Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cathepsin G/*genetics', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0046529 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-24620 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46529. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0046529.

Evaluating gene polymorphisms in ABC transporters could help identify relapse risk and predict outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The SNaPshot SNP technique was used to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multidrug transporter 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP1, MRP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) genes of 82 pediatric ALL patients. The association between the SNPs with risk of all events and death as well as with survival was evaluated by the univariate Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The BCRP G34A SNP was the only SNP significantly associated with ALL. Risk factors included pre-treatment WBC counts and post-treatment peripheral and bone marrow leukemic cell counts. We found no association between MDR1 SNPs with these factors. The BCRP C421A C/A and C/C genotypes were significantly associated with low pre-treatment WBC counts while MRP2 G1249A G/G was significantly associated with low levels of post-treatment peripheral and bone marrow leukemic cells. A combination of C1236T, G1249A and/or G34A SNPs was significantly associated with lower EFS and OS.

The aberrant expression of this microRNA has been demonstrated as a frequent event in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but little is known for pediatric AML. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and clinical significance of miR-100 in pediatric AML. METHODS: The expression levels of miR-100 in bone marrow mononuclear cells were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a cohort of 106 patients with de novo pediatric AML. The prognostic values of miR-100 in pediatric AML were also analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, upregulation of miR-100 in the bone marrow of pediatric AML patients with statistically significant differences (P < 0.001) was found. The expression levels of miR-100 were found to be significantly higher in pediatric AML patients with extramedullary disease, with the French-American-British classification subtype M7, and with unfavorable day 7 response to induction chemotherapy (P = 0.008, 0.001 and 0.01, respectively). Moreover, both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that miR-100 upregulation was associated with poorer relapse-free and overall survival in pediatric AML patients. CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating the upregulation of miR-100 in pediatric AML, and its association with poor relapse-free and overall survival. These results suggest that miR-100 upregulation may be used as an unfavorable prognostic marker in pediatric AML.","['Bai, Jin', 'Guo, Aiping', 'Hong, Ze', 'Kuai, Wenxia']","['Bai J', 'Guo A', 'Hong Z', 'Kuai W']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an Hospital to Xuzhou Medical College and Huai'an Second People's Hospital, Huai'an, China;""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2012/10/12 06:00,2012/10/12 06:01,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S36017 [doi]', 'ott-5-213 [pii]']",ppublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2012;5:213-9. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S36017.

Imitanib, a small molecule ABL kinase inhibitor is a highly effective therapy for early phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which has constitutively active ABL kinase activity owing to the over expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. But some patients develop imatinib resistance, particularly in the advanced phases of CML.The discovery of resistance mechanisms of imitanib; urge forward the development of second generation drugs. Nilotinib, a second generation drug is more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL than imatinib. But nilotinib also develops dermatologic events and headache in patients. Large information about BCR-ABL structure and its inhibitors are now available. Based on the pharmacophore modeling approaches, it is possible to decipher the molecular determinants to inhibit BCR-ABL. We conducted a structure based and ligand based study to identify potent natural compounds as BCR-ABL inhibitor. First kinase inhibitors were docked with the receptor (BCR-ABL) and nilotinib was selected as a pharmacophore due its high binding efficiency. Eleven compounds were selected out of 1457 substances which have mutual pharmacopohre features with nilotinib. These eleven compounds were validated and used for docking study to find the drug like molecules. The best molecules from the final set of screening candidates can be evaluated in cell lines and may represent a novel class of BCR-ABL inhibitors.

METHODS: The Safety Assessment of Biological Therapeutics study used data from 4 sources: national Medicaid and Medicare databases, Tennessee Medicaid, pharmacy benefits plans for Medicare beneficiaries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed to estimate the relative rates of cancer, comparing those treated with TNFalpha inhibitors to those treated with alternative disease-modifying therapies. The cancer-finding algorithm had a positive predictive value ranging from 31% for any leukemia to 89% for female breast cancer. RESULTS: We included 29,555 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (13,102 person-years), 6,357 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (1,508 person-years), 1,298 patients with psoriasis (371 person-years), and 2,498 patients with psoriatic arthritis (618 person-years). The incidence of any solid cancer was not elevated in RA (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.59-1.08]), inflammatory bowel disease (HR 1.42 [95% CI 0.47-4.26]), psoriasis (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.10-3.31]), or psoriatic arthritis (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.20-2.76]) during TNFalpha inhibitor therapy compared to disease-specific alternative therapy. Among RA patients, the incidence of any of the 10 most common cancers in the US and of nonmelanoma skin cancer was not increased with TNFalpha inhibitor therapy compared to treatment with comparator drugs. CONCLUSION: Short-term cancer risk was not elevated among patients treated with TNFalpha inhibitor therapy relative to commonly used therapies for immune- mediated chronic inflammatory diseases in this study.","['Haynes, Kevin', 'Beukelman, Timothy', 'Curtis, Jeffrey R', 'Newcomb, Craig', 'Herrinton, Lisa J', 'Graham, David J', 'Solomon, Daniel H', 'Griffin, Marie R', 'Chen, Lang', 'Liu, Liyan', 'Saag, Kenneth G', 'Lewis, James D']","['Haynes K', 'Beukelman T', 'Curtis JR', 'Newcomb C', 'Herrinton LJ', 'Graham DJ', 'Solomon DH', 'Griffin MR', 'Chen L', 'Liu L', 'Saag KG', 'Lewis JD']","['University of Pennsylvania, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. khaynes@upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Immunologic Factors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.37740 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2013 Jan;65(1):48-58. doi: 10.1002/art.37740.,10.1002/art.37740 [doi],,"['K24-DK07822806/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 DK078228/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HS-018517/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States', 'K23 AR053351/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-053351/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 RR025776/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1U18-HS-017919-0/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States', '5KL2-RR-025776/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HS018517/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States', 'U18 HS017919/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States']",,PMC3778442,,,['Copyright (c) 2013 by the American College of Rheumatology.'],,,,['NIHMS496617'],['SABER Collaboration'],"['Nourjah P', 'Glynn R', 'Kowal M', 'Lii J', 'Rassen J', 'Schneeweiss S', 'Ouellet-Hellstrom R', 'Gilbert J', 'McCloskey C', 'Phucas K', 'William J', 'Harrold L', 'Raebel M', 'Grijalva C', 'Mitchel E']","['Nourjah, Parivash', 'Glynn, Robert', 'Kowal, Mary', 'Lii, Joyce', 'Rassen, Jeremy', 'Schneeweiss, Sebastian', 'Ouellet-Hellstrom, Rita', 'Gilbert, Jane', 'McCloskey, Carolyn', 'Phucas, Kristin', 'William, James', 'Harrold, Leslie', 'Raebel, Marcia', 'Grijalva, Carlos', 'Mitchel, Ed']",,,

Monitoring response to TKI therapy is a critical component of managing CML, and molecular response seems to be the most important milestone for predicting long-term outcomes. How best to assess response, including how to define treatment failure, and how monitoring should be conducted remain controversial. Strategies for overcoming imatinib resistance include increasing the imatinib dose or switching to a second-generation TKI. Another approach is to use higher doses of imatinib or second-generation TKIs up front to increase the rate of earlier responses, with the hope that this will translate into a reduced risk of resistance. Several investigational therapies are also being evaluated as a means of overcoming TKI resistance, including ponatinib (AP24534), omacetaxine, and bosutinib (SKI-606). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has also shown efficacy in patients with imatinib-resistant disease. Alternatives to long-term TKI therapy that are currently being explored include discontinuation of treatment and eradication of minimal residual disease with investigational treatment regimens, such as those involving interferon, hydroxychloroquine, BCL6 inhibitors, and the smoothened antagonists LDF225 and BMS-833923.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Goldman, John M', 'Hughes, Timothy']","['Cortes J', 'Goldman JM', 'Hughes T']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Monitoring', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis']",2012/10/25 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10/Suppl_3/S-1 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2012.0184 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2012 Oct 1;10 Suppl 3:S1-S13. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2012.0184.,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 98 proteins were overexpressed, while six proteins were underexpressed in CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells compared with their CD34(+) /CD38(+) counterparts. Proteins overexpressed in CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells included a number of proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, gland differentiation, antiapoptosis, adhesion, and drug resistance. Aberrant expression of CD82, a family of adhesion molecules, in CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells was noted in additional clinical samples (n = 12) by flow cytometry. Importantly, down-regulation of CD82 in CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells by a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibited adhesion to fibronectin via up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) and colony forming ability of these cells as assessed by transwell assay, real-time RT-PCR, and colony forming assay, respectively. Moreover, we found that down-regulation of CD82 in CD34(+) /CD38(-) AML cells by an shRNA significantly impaired engraftment of these cells in severely immunocompromised mice. Taken together, aberrant expression of CD82 might play a role in adhesion of LSCs to bone marrow microenvironment and survival of LSCs.

Nevertheless, the anatomic and functional characterizations of the niche cells for normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have proved a formidable task. It is uncertain whether the combinational effects of a few sets of molecular niche elements, behind the long-sought cellular architectures with preferred anatomic locations, actually meets the functional definition of HSC niche. Moreover, even much less is known about the niche components for numerous types of leukemia-stem cells (LSCs) that originate via discrete cellular and molecular transforming mechanisms. However, one interesting scenario is emerging, i.e., the leukemia cells can positively remodel the hematopoietic microenvironment favorable for their competition over the normal hematopoiesis that co-exists within the same eco-system. This property probably represents a previously unappreciated essential trait of a functional LSC. Obviously, the further exploration into how the hematopoietic microenvironment interplay with normal or malignant hematopoiesis will shed light onto the designing of novel types of niche-targeting therapies for leukemia.","['Huang, Meng-Meng', 'Zhu, Jiang']","['Huang MM', 'Zhu J']","[""State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Microenviron,Cancer microenvironment : official journal of the International Cancer Microenvironment Society,101322634,,,,2012/10/12 06:00,2012/10/12 06:01,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12307-012-0114-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Microenviron. 2012 Dec;5(3):295-305. doi: 10.1007/s12307-012-0114-y.

Two major rearrangements of the MLL gene are found in MLL-related leukemia. The most common of these is balanced translocations in which the N-terminal portion of MLL is fused to the C-terminus of the translocation partner. To date, nearly 100 different chromosome bands have been described in rearrangements involving MLL, and more than 70 known fusion partners of MLL have been cloned and characterized at the molecular level. Another major aberration of the MLL gene creates a repeat within the N-terminal MLL resulting in an internal partial tandem duplication (PTD). As a consequence, an extra amino-terminus is added in-frame to full-length MLL, resulting in leukemogenic MLL-PTD. MLL-PTD occurs predominantly in myeloid dysplasia syndromes, secondary AML (s-AML), and de novo AML. The presence of an MLL rearrangement generally confers a poor prognosis. MLL fusions and MLL-PTD are transcriptional regulators that take control of targets normally controlled by MLL, with the clustered HOX homeobox genes as prominent examples. Several epigenetic regulators that modify DNA or histones have been implicated in MLL fusion driven leukemogenesis, including DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and histone methylation. Recently, the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, and the MLL-interacting protein Menin have emerged as important mediators of MLL fusion-mediated leukemic transformation. The clinical development of targeted inhibitors of these epigenetic regulators has heralded promise for the treatment of MLL fusion leukemia. Although the biological function and molecular mechanism for MLL-PTD remains largely unknown, based on the primary protein structure of MLL-PTD and the knowledge gained so far from MLL fusions, newly developed inhibitors of epigenetic regulators could potentially also prove effective in the treatment of MLL-PTD related leukemias.","['Zhang, Yue', 'Chen, Aili', 'Yan, Xiao-Mei', 'Huang, Gang']","['Zhang Y', 'Chen A', 'Yan XM', 'Huang G']","[""Division of Pathology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Room S7.607, MLC 7013, Cincinnati, OH 45229-3039, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1180-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Oct;96(4):428-37. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1180-0.

HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 encode the Tax1 and Tax2 proteins, respectively, which are essential for the immortalization of human T cells by the respective viruses, thereby causing persistent infection. In this study, we compared Tax1 and Tax2 with respect to their immortalization activity in human T cells. Lentivirus-mediated transduction of the tax2 gene into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 in 96-well plates induced outgrowing T cells in most wells, but the cells infected with the control viruses died within 3 weeks. Surprisingly, the number of outgrowing cells induced by Tax2 was much higher than that induced by Tax1, and the appearance of outgrowing cells by Tax2 was earlier than that induced by Tax1. Nevertheless, both Tax2 and Tax1 preferentially immortalized CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) T cells. Our study showed that HTLV-2 Tax2 can immortalize human CD4(+) T cells, and the activity is much higher than that of Tax1. The distinct T cell immortalization activities of Tax2 and Tax1 might therefore play a role in the different pathogeneses observed for these two viruses.","['Imai, Michitaka', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Kawamura, Hiroki', 'Yoshita, Manami', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Matsuki, Hideaki', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Aoyagi, Yutaka', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Imai M', 'Higuchi M', 'Kawamura H', 'Yoshita M', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Matsuki H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Aoyagi Y', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 2)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*pathogenicity', 'Humans']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11262-012-0831-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2013 Feb;46(1):39-46. doi: 10.1007/s11262-012-0831-9.

The efficacy of this drug is often limited by mucositis and intestinal injury, which are the major causes of morbidity in children and adults. AIM: The present study investigates whether melatonin, a powerful antioxidant, could have a protective effect. METHOD: Rats were pretreated with melatonin (20 and 40 mg/kg body weight) daily 1 h before methotrexate (7 mg/kg body weight) administration for three consecutive days. After the final dose of methotrexate, the rats were sacrificed and the small intestine was used for light microscopy and biochemical assays. Intestinal homogenates were used for assay of oxidative stress parameters malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content, and myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration as well as for the activities of the antioxidant enzymes. RESULT: Pretreatment with melatonin had a dose-dependent protective effect on methotrexate (MTX)-induced alterations in small intestinal morphology. Morphology was saved to some extent with 20 mg melatonin pretreatment and near normal morphology was achieved with 40 mg melatonin pretreatment. Biochemically, pretreatment with melatonin significantly attenuated MTX-induced oxidative stress (P < 0.01 for MDA, P < 0.001 for protein carbonyl content) and restored the activities of the antioxidant enzymes (glutathione reductase P < 0.05, superoxide dismutase P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate that supplementation by exogenous melatonin significantly reduces MTX-induced small intestinal damage, indicating that it may be beneficial in ameliorating MTX-induced enteritis in humans.","['Kolli, Viswa Kalyan', 'Abraham, Premila', 'Isaac, Bina', 'Kasthuri, N']","['Kolli VK', 'Abraham P', 'Isaac B', 'Kasthuri N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Christian Medical College, Bagayam, Vellore 632002, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dig Dis Sci,Digestive diseases and sciences,7902782,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Intestine, Small/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Melatonin/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Mucositis/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10620-012-2437-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Dig Dis Sci. 2013 Apr;58(4):959-69. doi: 10.1007/s10620-012-2437-4.

METHODS: The medical records of 492 unselected patients treated with infliximab at Mayo Clinic were reviewed and abstracted for demographic features, usage patterns, and adverse events. RESULTS: The patients received a median of seven infusions and had a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Twenty-eight patients (6 %) were lost to follow-up, 63 patients (13 %) had no clinical benefit, and 401 patients (80 %) had partial or complete response. Of the responding patients, 114 (28 %) received induction treatment only, 167 (42 %) received initial episodic treatment (62 switched to scheduled maintenance treatment of whom 32 [42 %] were still on infliximab at last follow-up), and 120 (30 %) received scheduled maintenance treatment (56 patients [32 %] still on infliximab at last follow-up). Three patients (0.6 %) developed septic shock and six patients (1.5 %) developed septicemia. One patient (0.2 %) developed Mycobacterium avium complex. Histoplasmosis occurred in three patients (0.6 %). The cumulative 10-year probability for developing cancer after infliximab was 9 %. Among the 31 patients developing malignancies (6 %), 15 (3 %) had solid tumors, 11 (2 %) had melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, three (0.6 %) had lymphomas (0.6 %), and two (0.4 %) had leukemia. Overall 10-year survival after the final course of infliximab was 94 %. Among the 28 deaths (6 %), nine occurred within 12 weeks of an infliximab infusion-two of these deaths were due to infections. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with infliximab initially between 1998 and 2002 showed persistence of therapy (due to clinical benefit) and an acceptable safety profile, despite the fact that less than one-third initially received three-dose induction followed by scheduled maintenance therapy.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated by LPS. Extravasated FITC-dextran reflecting permeability was assessed by multimode microplate reader, and the migration of bis-carboxyethyl-carboxyfluorescein acetoxy-methyl-labeled human acute monocytic leukemia cell line and leukemia cell line cells through HUVECs were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The phosphorylations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, protein kinase C (PKC), and cofilin in HUVECs were assessed by western blotting, and the F-actin level was detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy. After LPS stimulation, inflammatory endothelial cells exhibited significantly increased permeability. Paeoniflorin (10, 30, and 100 muM) inhibited dextran extravasation and leukocyte migration through HUVECs induced by LPS in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, paeoniflorin was able to suppress the phosphorylations of PI3K/Akt, PKC, and cofilin, as well as F-actin reorganization in HUVECs induced by LPS. These findings revealed that paeoniflorin partly blocked LPS-induced endothelium permeability, supporting a new explanation for its anti-inflammatory effects.","['Xu, Huan', 'Song, Jie', 'Gao, Xinghua', 'Xu, Zhao', 'Xu, Xianxiang', 'Xia, Yufeng', 'Dai, Yue']","['Xu H', 'Song J', 'Gao X', 'Xu Z', 'Xu X', 'Xia Y', 'Dai Y']","['Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tong Jia Xiang, Nanjing, 210009, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Inflammation,Inflammation,7600105,"['0 (Actin Depolymerizing Factors)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran)', '21AIQ4EV64 (peoniflorin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Actin Depolymerizing Factors/metabolism', 'Actins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement', 'Dextrans/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Monoterpenes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10753-012-9537-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Inflammation. 2013 Feb;36(1):216-25. doi: 10.1007/s10753-012-9537-3.,10.1007/s10753-012-9537-3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to assess professional practices of hospital-based rheumatologists with regard to BMA in order to identify the relevant indications. A retrospective observational study in patients hospitalised in a French university hospital was conducted between 2005 and 2011. All of the patients who had a BMA in the rheumatology department during the study period were included. Clinical indication, number and results of BMA and of bone marrow biopsy (BMB) were collected. Stage and treatment of the haematological disease implemented following the BMA were described. Two hundred fifty-seven BMAs and 79 BMBs were performed during the study period. Of the BMAs, 14.1 % were pathological: myeloma (n = 12), malignant B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 6), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 6), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (n = 4), Waldenstrom's disease (n = 3), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n = 2), hairy cell leukaemia (n = 1) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 1). Eight of the 14 pathological BMBs were associated with normal BMA. BMAs were performed equally for gammaglobulin abnormalities (monoclonal peak = 45 % of indications, hypogammaglobulinemia = 6 %) and for other reasons (haemogram abnormality = 24 %, skeletal osteolysis = 6 %, unexplained inflammatory syndrome = 5 %, lymph node disease = 4 % and others). In clinical rheumatology, BMA may reveal two major types of malignant haematological diseases: myeloma with poor prognostic factors justifying polychemotherapy and autologous grafts and, in contrast, slowly evolving B cell lymphoid haemopathies. Given the additional risk in some types of chronic inflammatory rheumatism, BMB should be performed more frequently in certain specific situations (skeletal or lymph node tumour and unexplained inflammatory syndrome).","['Loctin, Amelie', 'Bailly, Francois', 'Laroche, Davy', 'Tavernier, Christian', 'Maillefert, Jean-Francis', 'Ornetti, Paul']","['Loctin A', 'Bailly F', 'Laroche D', 'Tavernier C', 'Maillefert JF', 'Ornetti P']","['Service de Rhumatologie, Hopital General, CHU Dijon, 3 rue du Faubourg Raines, 21000, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Male', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatic Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Rheumatology/*methods']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10067-012-2097-y [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2013 Jan;32(1):115-21. doi: 10.1007/s10067-012-2097-y.

High-dose etoposide 60 mg/kg in combination with fractionated total body irradiation (TBI), usually single fractions of 1.2 Gy up to a total of 13.2 Gy, is used as conditioning therapy for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Most studies of this conditioning regimen have included patients with acute leukemia receiving bone marrow or mobilized stem cell grafts derived from family or matched unrelated donors, and the treatment is then effective even in patients with high-risk disease. The most common adverse effects are fever with hypotension and rash, nausea and vomiting, sialoadenitis, neuropathy and metabolic acidosis. A small minority of patients develop severe allergic reactions. Etoposide has also been tested in a wide range of combination regimens, but for many of these combinations, relatively few patients are included, and some combinations have only been tested in patients who have undergone autologous transplants. However, the general conclusion is that many of these combinations are effective in patients with high-risk malignancies and the toxicity often seems acceptable. Thus, etoposide-based conditioning therapy should be further evaluated in patients having allogeneic transplants, but randomized trials are needed and the design of future trials should be based on the well-characterized TBI + high-dose etoposide regimen.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Kittang, Astrid Olsnes', 'Ahmed, Aymen Bushra', 'Tvedt, Tor Henrik Anderson', 'Sjo, Malvin', 'Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne']","['Bruserud O', 'Reikvam H', 'Kittang AO', 'Ahmed AB', 'Tvedt TH', 'Sjo M', 'Hatfield KJ']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clofarabine', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage', 'Mucositis/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-012-1990-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Dec;70(6):765-82. doi: 10.1007/s00280-012-1990-z.

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of bosutinib in patients with chronic hepatic impairment and matched healthy subjects. METHODS: Hepatically impaired patients were aged 18-65 years and of Child-Pugh classes A, B, or C; healthy subjects were matched by age, sex, body mass index, and smoking habits. A single oral dose of bosutinib 200 mg was administered on day 1 within 5 min after completion of breakfast. RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects (n = 9), maximal plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the curve increased 2.42-fold and 2.25-fold in Child-Pugh A (n = 6), 1.99-fold and 2.0-fold in Child-Pugh B (n = 6), and 1.52-fold and 1.91-fold in Child-Pugh C patients (n = 6). Time to C(max) decreased from 4 h in healthy subjects to 2.5, 2.0, and 1.5 h in Child-Pugh A, B, and C patients, respectively; the elimination half-life increased from 55 h in healthy subjects to 86, 113, and 111 h in Child-Pugh A, B, and C patients. Bosutinib oral clearance was lower in hepatically impaired patients compared with healthy subjects. Frequently reported adverse events included prolonged QTc interval (37.0%, n = 10), nausea (11.1%, n = 3), and vomiting (7.4%, n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: A single oral dose of bosutinib 200 mg showed acceptable tolerability in healthy subjects and in patients with mild, moderate, or severe chronic hepatic impairment.","['Abbas, Richat', 'Chalon, Stephan', 'Leister, Cathie', 'El Gaaloul, Myriam', 'Sonnichsen, Daryl']","['Abbas R', 'Chalon S', 'Leister C', 'El Gaaloul M', 'Sonnichsen D']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA. richat.abbas-borhan@pfizer.com']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aniline Compounds/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Quinolines/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Time Factors']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-012-1987-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2013 Jan;71(1):123-32. doi: 10.1007/s00280-012-1987-7.

A subcutaneous (SC) formulation demonstrated efficacy and safety in phase 1/2 trials in patients previously treated with >/=1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This study assessed pharmacokinetics and safety of SC omacetaxine in patients with advanced cancers. METHODS: Omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m(2) SC was administered BID, days 1-14 every 28 days for 2 cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and urine were collected to measure omacetaxine concentrations and inactive metabolites. Adverse events, including QT interval prolongation, were recorded. Tumor response was assessed at cycle 2 completion. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from cycle 1, day 1 data in 21 patients with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies and cycle 1, day 11 data in 10 patients. Omacetaxine was rapidly absorbed, with mean peak plasma concentrations observed within 1 h, and widely distributed, as evidenced by an apparent volume of distribution of 126.8 L/m(2). Plasma concentration versus time data demonstrated biexponential decay; mean steady-state terminal half-life was 7 h. Concentrations of inactive metabolites 4'-DMHHT and cephalotaxine were approximately 10 % of omacetaxine and undetectable in most patients, respectively. Urinary excretion of unchanged omacetaxine accounted for <15 % of the dose. Grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events included thrombocytopenia (48 %) and neutropenia (33 %). Two grade 2 increases in QTc interval (>470 ms) were observed and were not correlated with omacetaxine plasma concentration. No objective responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Omacetaxine is well absorbed after SC administration. Therapeutic plasma concentrations were achieved with 1.25 mg/m(2) BID, supporting clinical development of this dose and schedule.","['Nemunaitis, John', 'Mita, Alain', 'Stephenson, Joe', 'Mita, Monica M', 'Sarantopoulos, John', 'Padmanabhan-Iyer, Swami', 'Nanda, Nisha', 'Gleich, Lyon', 'Benichou, Annie-Claude', 'Craig, Adam']","['Nemunaitis J', 'Mita A', 'Stephenson J', 'Mita MM', 'Sarantopoulos J', 'Padmanabhan-Iyer S', 'Nanda N', 'Gleich L', 'Benichou AC', 'Craig A']","['Mary Crowley Cancer Research Centers, Dallas, TX 75201, USA. jnemunaitis@mcmrc.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"[""0 (4'-desmethylhomoharringtonine)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Harringtonines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Tissue Distribution']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-012-1963-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2013 Jan;71(1):35-41. doi: 10.1007/s00280-012-1963-2.

The current retrospective study attempted to validate a prognostic role of KIT mutation in 121 Korean patients with CBF AML. The study patients consisted of 121 patients with CBF AML (82 patients with RUNX1/RUNX1T1 [67.8 %] and 39 patients with CBFB/MYH11 [32.2 %]) recruited from eight institutions in Korea. All patients received idarubicin plus cytarabine or behenoyl cytosine arabinoside 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy. The KIT gene mutation status was determined by direct sequencing analyses. A KIT mutation was detected in 32 cases (26.4 %) in our series of patients.

Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot assays indicated that STAT expressions were downregulated both at mRNA and protein levels, and TUNEL assay showed that leukemic cell apoptosis was induced due to inhibition of STATs. Array analysis resulted with decreases in signal transducer, phosphorylation inducer, and oncogene expressions, whereas increased expressions in STAT inhibitor and apoptosis inducer genes were observed.

METHODS: Concentration data from 493 patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP), accelerated phase, or blast crisis were used to perform a population pharmacokinetic analysis using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling. Steady-state nilotinib trough concentrations (Cmin) in individual patients were estimated from the population PK model for correlation with the efficacy and safety variables. Exposure-efficacy analysis was performed in patients with CML-CP, whereas exposure-safety analysis was performed in all patients who had both nilotinib PK data and efficacy/safety measures available. RESULTS: Baseline demographics and CML disease phase did not significantly affect nilotinib PK. Patients with a lower Cmin had significantly longer time to complete cytogenetic response (P = 0.010), longer time to major molecular response (P = 0.012), shorter time to progression (TTP; P = 0.009), and a trend toward lower response rates vs. patients with higher Cmin. A joint effect of prognostic risk score and Cmin on TTP was significant (P < 0.001). Nilotinib Cmin was also associated with the occurrence of all-grade elevations in total bilirubin (P < 0.001) and lipase (P = 0.002) levels. CONCLUSIONS: When tolerability allows, adherence to the nilotinib dose (400 mg twice daily) in order to maintain sufficient Cmin is important in maximizing the efficacy of nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML.","['Giles, Francis J', 'Yin, Ophelia Q P', 'Sallas, William M', 'le Coutre, Philipp D', 'Woodman, Richard C', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Giles FJ', 'Yin OQ', 'Sallas WM', 'le Coutre PD', 'Woodman RC', 'Ottmann OG', 'Baccarani M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['HRB Clinical Research Facility, Galway, and Trinity College, National University of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-012-1385-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2013 Apr;69(4):813-23. doi: 10.1007/s00228-012-1385-4.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying iAs(III) and its intermediate metabolite MMA(III)-induced anticancer effects in the HL-60 cells. Here, we show that the HL-60 cells exhibit resistance to inorganic iAs(III) (IC(50) = 10 muM), but are relatively sensitive to its intermediate MMA(III) (IC(50) = 3.5 muM). Moreover, we found that the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), but not MRP2, is expressed in HL-60 cells, which reduced the intracellular arsenic accumulation, and conferred resistance to inorganic iAs(III) and MMA(III). Pretreatment of HL-60 with MK571, an inhibitor of MRP1, significantly increased iAs(III) and MMA(III)-induced cytotoxicity and arsenic accumulations, suggesting that the expression of MRP1/4 may lead to HL-60 cells resistance to trivalent arsenic compounds.","['Xu, Shi', 'Zhang, Yan Fang', 'Carew, Micheal W', 'Hao, Wen Hui', 'Loo, Jacky Fong Chuen', 'Naranmandura, Hua', 'Le, X Chris']","['Xu S', 'Zhang YF', 'Carew MW', 'Hao WH', 'Loo JF', 'Naranmandura H', 'Le XC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Biochemical Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '0 (monomethylarsonous acid)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenites/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Sodium Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-012-0956-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2013 Jun;87(6):1013-23. doi: 10.1007/s00204-012-0956-6.

The purpose of this study was to investigate DEK expression level in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), analyze the correlation between DEK expression and CLL prognostic markers, and characterize the role of DEK in the response to either chemotherapeutic drugs or nongenotoxic activators of the p53 pathway. DEK mRNA was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and primary CLL samples were treated in vitro with either fludarabine or Nutlin-3 to explore the interaction of p53 status and DEK mRNA expression. The median expression levels of DEK mRNA were 6.792 x 10 (-2) (1.438 x 10 (-2) -3.201 x 10 (-1) ) in 65 patients with CLL.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the larger research was to document and explore issues associated with the experience of survivorship for hematology patients supported by Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland. The experience with BMABs was one of the issues explored. METHODS: The qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 50 individuals with a diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy from a range of locations throughout Queensland, Australia. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and then analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate that, for many of the hematology patients in the study, BMABs were a painful experience. The findings indicate that a major contributing factor to the pain and discomfort is the lack of effective procedural care. CONCLUSIONS: The findings emphasized the importance of the provision of choice with regard to anesthesia or sedation as part of the procedural care for BMABs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The insights provide urgency to the call for further research to improve clinical practice and procedural care in relation to BMABs. The strong recommendation from the study is that procedural pain in relation to BMABs for hematology patients be managed from the initial procedure as the consequences of a traumatic experience can be far reaching, particularly in light of the need for repeated BMABs over the treatment trajectory. As specialist nurses are now increasingly taking responsibility for carrying out such procedures, the findings have implications for the nursing profession.","['McGrath, Pam', 'Rawson-Huff, Nicole', 'Holewa, Hamish']","['McGrath P', 'Rawson-Huff N', 'Holewa H']","['Population and Social Health Research Program, Griffith Health Institute, Meadowbrook, Queensland, Australia. pmcgrathgu@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anesthesia/methods', 'Biopsy, Needle/*adverse effects/methods', 'Bone Marrow Examination/adverse effects/methods', 'Conscious Sedation/methods', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Pain Management/*methods', 'Pain Measurement', 'Qualitative Research', 'Queensland', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/12 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0b013e31826f3bac [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2013 Jul-Aug;36(4):309-16. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e31826f3bac.,10.1097/NCC.0b013e31826f3bac [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of LCS requires morphological and immunophenotypic characterization to distinguish it from other epithelioid-appearing malignancies. Four cases of LCS were encountered in the consultative practices of 2 of the authors. The patients ranged in age from 54 to 88 years of age. In 2 of the cases the patients had a history of acute myelogenous leukemia with eruptions occurring after initiation of decitabine. One patient died within 3 months of presenting with the skin eruption, whereas the other patient is in remission. In the other 2 patients, there was no antecedent history; the presentation was in the context of a solitary nodule. One patient declined treatment and died of disseminated metastatic disease. The other patient had complete excision with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. In all cases, the biopsies showed a sheet-like growth of large atypical epithelioid cells. Phenotypic studies revealed positivity for CD4, CD1a, and S100 in all and variable staining for langerin, lysozyme, CD83, CD31, and CD14. Cutaneous LCS represents a terminally differentiated myeloid tumor with a variable but potentially aggressive clinical course. It may be related to a common stem cell defect given the association with acute leukemia.

Leukemia mortality after external exposure at low doses and low-dose rates has been investigated at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and Nuclear Fuel Company (AREVA NC) after an additional follow-up of 10 years. The cohort included radiation-monitored workers employed for at least one year during 1950-1994 at CEA or AREVA NC and followed during 1968-2004. Association between external exposure and leukemia mortality was estimated with excess relative risk (ERR) models and time-dependent modifying factors were investigated with time windows. The cohort included 36,769 workers, followed for an average of 28 years, among whom 73 leukemia deaths occurred. Among the workers with a positive recorded dose, the mean cumulative external dose was 21.7 mSv. Results under a 2-year lag assumption suggested that the risk of leukemia (except chronic lymphatic leukemia) increased significantly by 8% per 10 mSv. The magnitude of the association for myeloid leukemia was larger. The higher ERR/Sv for doses received 2-14 years earlier suggest that time since exposure modifies the effect. The ERR/Sv also appeared higher for doses received at exposure rates >/=20 mSv per year. These results are consistent with those found in other studies of nuclear workers. However, confidence intervals are still wide.

Recently, the obesity-cancer link has received much attention. Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is also associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, and leukemia, and can also lead to poorer treatment and increased cancer-related mortality. Biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and cancer are not well understood. They include modulation of energy balance and calorie restriction, growth factors, multiple signaling pathways, and inflammatory processes. Key among the signaling pathways linking obesity and cancer is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade, which is a target of many of the obesity-associated factors and regulates cell proliferation and survival. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the obesity-cancer connection is important in developing potential therapeutics. The link between obesity and cancer underscores the recommendation to maintain a healthy body weight throughout life as one of the most important ways to protect against cancer.","['Vucenik, Ivana', 'Stains, Joseph P']","['Vucenik I', 'Stains JP']","['Department of Medical and Research Technology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. ivucenik@som.umaryland.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Comorbidity', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', '*Global Health', 'Health Policy', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Risk']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06750.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2012 Oct;1271:37-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06750.x.,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06750.x [doi],,['R01 AR052719/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC3476838,,,['(c) 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.'],,,,['NIHMS399642'],,,,,,

It was reported previously that FVII gene (F7) expression was up-regulated by ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus-infected haemophilia patients; however, its precise mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of ribavirin-induced up-regulation of F7 expression in HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line). We found that intracellular GTP depletion by ribavirin as well as other IMPDH (inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitors, such as mycophenolic acid and 6-mercaptopurine, up-regulated F7 expression. FVII mRNA transcription was mainly enhanced by accelerated transcription elongation, which was mediated by the P-TEFb (positive-transcription elongation factor b) complex, rather than by promoter activation. Ribavirin unregulated ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukaemia) 3 mRNA expression before F7 up-regulation. We observed that ribavirin enhanced ELL3 recruitment to F7, whereas knockdown of ELL3 diminished ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation. Ribavirin also enhanced recruitment of CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) and AFF4 to F7. These data suggest that ribavirin-induced intracellular GTP depletion recruits a super elongation complex containing P-TEFb, AFF4 and ELL3, to F7, and modulates FVII mRNA transcription elongation. Collectively, we have elucidated a basal mechanism for ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation by acceleration of transcription elongation, which may be crucial in understanding its pleiotropic functions in vivo.","['Suzuki, Atsuo', 'Miyawaki, Yuhri', 'Okuyama, Eriko', 'Murata, Moe', 'Ando, Yumi', 'Kato, Io', 'Takagi, Yuki', 'Takagi, Akira', 'Murate, Takashi', 'Saito, Hidehiko', 'Kojima, Tetsuhito']","['Suzuki A', 'Miyawaki Y', 'Okuyama E', 'Murata M', 'Ando Y', 'Kato I', 'Takagi Y', 'Takagi A', 'Murate T', 'Saito H', 'Kojima T']","['Department of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 461-8673, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9001-25-6 (Factor VII)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites/*pharmacology', 'Factor VII/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/antagonists & inhibitors/*deficiency', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Elongation, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology']",2012/10/12 06:00,2013/02/09 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20121286 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20121286 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2013 Jan 1;449(1):231-9. doi: 10.1042/BJ20121286.,10.1042/BJ20121286 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occasionally, chickens that do clear viremia by developing an efficient Nab response revert to viremia, and the factors responsible for this reversion are not clear. In this study, it was hypothesized that stress can cause seroconverted viremia-free chickens to revert to viremia. Adult (52-wk-old) male commercial meat-type chickens that were exposed to ALV J at hatch and had since cleared viremia and remained viremia-free for up to 40 wk, when subjected to chronic stress (for 14 days) induced by porcine adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), reverted to viremia and cloacal shedding (2/6 [33%]). However, chickens that were contact-exposed to ALV J at 32 wk of age and had seroconverted failed to revert to viremia when subjected to similar chronic stress. Stress did not increase the susceptibility of adult meat-type chickens to ALV J infection by contact exposure. The lack of statistical significance due to the small sample size is a limitation of this study. However, in general, the results suggest that treatment of chickens with ACTH can cause reversion of viremia and cloacal shedding in ALV J-seroconverted adult male chickens that had been exposed to the virus at hatch, but not in chickens that were contact-exposed at 32 wk of age. The results warrant further studies with greater sample size to examine the role of stress in ALV J epidemiology.","['Pandiri, A R', 'Gimeno, I M', 'Mays, J K', 'Reed, W M', 'Fadly, A M']","['Pandiri AR', 'Gimeno IM', 'Mays JK', 'Reed WM', 'Fadly AM']","['U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, 4279 East Mount Hope Road, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/genetics', '*Chickens', 'Male', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects/immunology', '*Viremia']",2012/10/12 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/10/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1637/9949-092611-ResNote.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Dis. 2012 Sep;56(3):578-82. doi: 10.1637/9949-092611-ResNote.1.,,,,,,,['Avian Dis. 2012 Dec;56(4):791'],,,,,,,,,,,

It is well known that chemotherapy regimens may have a negative effect on ovarian reserve, leading to amenorrhea or premature ovarian failure. There are little data regarding the effects of leukemia chemotherapy on ovarian reserve, specifically in women who received the chemotherapy as adults and are having regular menstrual periods. Our primary objective was to determine if premenopausal women with a history of chemotherapy for leukemia, without subsequent stem cell transplantation, have decreased ovarian reserve. Materials and Methods. We measured ovarian reserve in five women who had been treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and compared them to age-matched control women without a history of chemotherapy. Results. There appeared to be a trend towards lower antimullerian hormone and antral follicle counts and higher follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the leukemia group. Conclusion. Our results indicate that chemotherapy for AML or ALL without stem cell transplantation may compromise ovarian reserve. Although our results should be confirmed by a larger study, oncologists, infertility specialists, and patients should be aware of the potential risks to ovarian function and should be counseled on options for fertility preservation.","['Rossi, Brooke V', 'Missmer, Stacey', 'Correia, Katharine F', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Ginsburg, Elizabeth S']","['Rossi BV', 'Missmer S', 'Correia KF', 'Wadleigh M', 'Ginsburg ES']","[""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA ; University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, Suite 310, 1000 Auburn Drive, Beachwood, OH 44122, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,ISRN Oncol,ISRN oncology,101567026,,,,2012/10/11 06:00,2012/10/11 06:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5402/2012/956190 [doi]'],ppublish,ISRN Oncol. 2012;2012:956190. doi: 10.5402/2012/956190.

We employed a Test Cancer BioChip that contains silencing RNAs (siRNAs) targeting cancer-related genes to identify 3D-specific effectors of breast cancer cell growth. We compared the effect of these siRNAs on colony growth of the hormone receptor positive (MCF7) and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2/c- Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (HER2/c-erb-b2) positive (SK-BR-3) cells on the Test Cancer BioChip. Our results confirmed cell-specific inhibition of MCF7 and SK-BR-3 colony formation by estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and (ERBB2) siRNA, respectively. Both cell lines were also suppressed by Phosphoinositide-3-kinase Catalytic, alpha Polypeptide (PIK3CA) siRNA. Interestingly, we have observed responses to siRNA that are unique to this 3D setting. For example, ss-actin (ACTB) siRNA suppressed colony growth in both cell types while Cathepsin L2 (CTSL2) siRNA caused opposite effects. These results further validate the importance of the CBCS as a tool for the identification of clinically relevant breast cancer targets.","['Marhefka, Joie N', 'Abbud-Antaki, Rula A']","['Marhefka JN', 'Abbud-Antaki RA']","['Falcon Genomics, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics', 'Female', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*analysis/*genetics', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/04/11 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0046086 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-11898 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e46086. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0046086.

Fast diagnosis in those illnesses is crucial in treatment results. The point of this work was to value usefulness of CT and MRI in diagnostics of neoplasmatic diseases in children. MATERIAL/METHODS: The retrospective study involved 121 children examined in CT and MRI because of suspicion or during treatment of neoplasmatic disease. Together 184 CT and 119 MRI examination were performed. Eventually in 106 children neoplasmatic disease was diagnosed. In 16 cases neoplasm was excluded. RESULTS: In the analyzed group of patients acute lymphoblastic and non lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in 68 children (55.7%); among them mycosis was identified after radiological examinations in 7 cases (10.3%). 8 children (6.6%) with non Hodgkin lymphoma and 11 (9%) with Hodgkin lymphoma were examined. Nephroblastoma was found after MRI and CT in 6 cases (4.9%). Presence of tumors, that were classified histopatologically as PNET, was confirmed in 4 children. In 15 cases after MRI and CT neoplasmatic disease was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the kind of sickness MRI and CT may fulfill basic or subsidiary role in diagnostic and estimating the progress of treatment in neoplasmatic diseases among children.","['Myga-Porosilo, Jolanta', 'Borowiak, Hanna', 'Sraga, Wojciech', 'Jackowska, Zuzanna', 'Serafin, Magdalena', 'Kluczewska, Ewa']","['Myga-Porosilo J', 'Borowiak H', 'Sraga W', 'Jackowska Z', 'Serafin M', 'Kluczewska E']","['Department and Institute of Medical Radiology and Radiodiagnosis in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Zabrze, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol J Radiol,Polish journal of radiology,101175532,,,,2012/10/11 06:00,2012/10/11 06:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12659/pjr.883374 [doi]'],ppublish,Pol J Radiol. 2012 Jul;77(3):46-52. doi: 10.12659/pjr.883374.,,,,,PMC3447433,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'computed tomography', 'hematology', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'pediatric oncology']",,,,,,,

This study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of the active form of novel agent sapacitabine, CNDAC, compared to current chemotherapeutic drugs Ara-C and mitoxantrone using two AML cell lines, HL-60 (promyelocytic) and THP-1 (monocytic), as well as bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) cells collected from AML patients. Cell lines were exposed to compound for 3-6 days and primary cells for 4 days. The viability of primary cells was additionally evaluated 3, 7, and 31 days after removal of tested compound to determine the durability of the response. Our studies indicate that CNDAC and mitoxantrone have a greater impact on viability than ara-C in primary AML cells and AML cell lines. CNDAC is more effective at reducing viability and inducing apoptosis than ara-C at equivalent concentrations in the THP-1 cell line, which is defined as displaying resistance to ara-C. As sapacitabine has shown in vivo activity at clinically achievable doses, future studies are warranted to assess the potential for combining it with ara-C and/or mitoxantrone, with an emphasis on cells and patients insensitive to ara-C treatment.","['Jagan, Sucheta', 'Paganessi, Laura A', 'Frank, Robin R', 'Venugopal, Parameswaran', 'Larson, Melissa', 'Christopherson, Kent W 2nd']","['Jagan S', 'Paganessi LA', 'Frank RR', 'Venugopal P', 'Larson M', 'Christopherson KW 2nd']","['Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Cell Therapy, Rush University Medical Center, 1725 West Harrison Street, Chicago, IL 60612, USA ; Rush University Cancer Center, 1725 West Harrison Street, Chicago, IL 60612, USA ; Section of Hematology, Rush University Medical Center, 1725 West Harrison Street, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,2012/10/11 06:00,2012/10/11 06:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/727683 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2012;2012:727683. doi: 10.1155/2012/727683.

Among retroviruses, Oncovirinae regroup according to their genetic structure and sequence, several related viruses such as human T-cell lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2), simian T cell lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 (STLV-1 and STLV-2), and bovine leukemia virus (BLV). As in many diseases, animal models provide a useful tool for the studies of pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention. In the current review, an overview on different animal models used in the study of these viruses will be provided. A specific attention will be given to the HTLV-1 virus which is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) but also of a number of inflammatory diseases regrouping the HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), infective dermatitis and some lung inflammatory diseases. Among these models, rabbits, monkeys but also rats provide an excellent in vivo tool for early HTLV-1 viral infection and transmission as well as the induced host immune response against the virus. But ideally, mice remain the most efficient method of studying human afflictions. Genetically altered mice including both transgenic and knockout mice, offer important models to test the role of specific viral and host genes in the development of HTLV-1-associated leukemia. The development of different strains of immunodeficient mice strains (SCID, NOD, and NOG SCID mice) provide a useful and rapid tool of humanized and xenografted mice models, to test new drugs and targeted therapy against HTLV-1-associated leukemia, to identify leukemia stem cells candidates but also to study the innate immunity mediated by the virus. All together, these animal models have revolutionized the biology of retroviruses, their manipulation of host genes and more importantly the potential ways to either prevent their infection or to treat their associated diseases.","['Hajj, Hiba El', 'Nasr, Rihab', 'Kfoury, Youmna', 'Dassouki, Zeina', 'Nasser, Roudaina', 'Kchour, Ghada', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'de The, Hugues', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Hajj HE', 'Nasr R', 'Kfoury Y', 'Dassouki Z', 'Nasser R', 'Kchour G', 'Hermine O', 'de The H', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2012/10/11 06:00,2012/10/11 06:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2012.00333 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2012 Sep 21;3:333. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00333. eCollection 2012.,10.3389/fmicb.2012.00333 [doi],20120921,,,PMC3448133,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'BLV', 'HTLV-1', 'STLV-1', 'animal models']",,,,,,,

METHODS: This prospective study examined children ages 1-15 years with a confirmed diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Each child was subjected to a detailed history, anthropometric examination, and laboratory investigations. Based on the anthropometric measurements that used weight-for-age Z scores, we divided the children into 4 groups: group 1, without malnutrition; group 2, mild malnutrition; group 3, moderate malnutrition; and group 4, severe malnutrition. We analyzed data for each group regarding the behavior of blood indices, the quantum of hematological support, bone marrow remission status on day 28, adherence to protocol schedules, and complications in the first 4 months of intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients in the study (mean age, 7.1 years; male:female ratio, 1.6:1), 79% had deficient calorie intake and 74% had deficient protein intake. Packed cell requirements and complications were significantly higher in malnourished children, whereas the requirement for platelet transfusions was statistically insignificant. Also, 50%, 40%, 38%, and 44% of children in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, completed chemotherapy within the specified time period. At the end of the induction phase, 92%, 60%, 87%, and 77% of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, achieved bone marrow remission. No deaths occurred in group 1; 1 death each occurred in groups 3 and 4, and 2 in group 2. When these deaths were extrapolated to the weight/height ratio (acute malnutrition), we found that all occurred in children with malnutrition, a statistically significant result.

A control group was obtained from the data of potential bone marrow donors registered in the Brazilian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (REDOME). RESULTS: Positive associations with HLA-A25 and HLA-B18 were found for the b2a2 transcript, as well as a tendency towards a positive association with HLA-B40 and a negative association with HLA-A68. The b3a2 transcript showed positive associations with HLA-B40 and HLA-DRB1*3.

Furthermore, there should be an absence of the Philadelphia chromosome and the BCR/ABL fusion gene and less than 20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow. Phenotypically, the cells in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia can present myelomonocytic antigens, such as CD33 and CD13, overexpressions of CD56 and CD2 and variable expressions of HLA-DR, CD36, CD14, CD15, CD68 and CD64. The increase in the CD34 expression may be associated with a transformation into acute leukemia.

In 2005, the identification of a recurrent molecular abnormality characterized by a gain of function with a mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) paved the way for greater knowledge of the pathophysiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Although there is information on unconventional practices in oncological diseases, specific data regarding the use of complementary and alternative medicine by hematology patients is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to document the prevalence of this modality of unconventional therapy in patients with malignant and benign hematological diseases, particularly children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: An observational study of adult patients and guardians of children with malignant or benign hematological diseases was carried out by applying a structured questionnaire detailing the use and results of the most prevalent complementary and alternative medicine practices. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were included; 104 had malignant and 16 had benign hematological diseases. The use of complementary and alternative medicine was greater in benign diseases but the difference was not statistically significant (64.7% versus 41.7%; p-value = 0.08). Patients and guardians with high school or college educations used these alternative practices more than patients with less schooling (60.7% versus 54.7%; p-value = 0.032). The use of folk remedies was most prevalent followed by herbal preparations and spiritual healing. Sixty-four percent of patients that used these unconventional practices reported improvement in their symptoms and increased capacity to perform daily activities.

We describe a case of an unusual presentation of acute promyelocytic leukemia. A 53 year-old male was admitted complaining of pain and weakness in his legs. He presented at examination a spastic paraparesis with a sensitive level at the eighth thoracic medullar (T8) segment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a posterolateral extradural mass from T6 through T8 segments with medullar compression. A complete blood count showed anemia, thrombocytopenia and the presence of promyelocytes and blasts. Marrow examination was compatible with the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia by cytogenetics and polymerase chain reaction for the PML-RARalpha gene. He was treated with all-trans-retinoic acid therapy plus daunorubicin and presented an all-trans-retinoic acid syndrome. Despite hematological remission, the patient presented neurologic deterioration and had to be treated with radiotherapy (total dose 3000 cGy) of the extradural lesion. The patient evolved with severe sepsis and died without any recovery from his neurologic deficit. Extramedullary infiltration is a very rare complication in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Most cases are related to relapse after initial treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid. The skin and the central nervous system are the most frequently involved sites. This is possibly the first case reported of this condition in which the patient had a symptomatic extradural mass.","['Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Teixeira Junior, Antonio Lucio', 'Gloria, Ana Beatriz Firmato', 'Ribeiro, Ana Flavia Leonardi Tiburcio', 'Fagundes, Evandro Maranhao']","['Bittencourt H', 'Teixeira Junior AL', 'Gloria AB', 'Ribeiro AF', 'Fagundes EM']","['Hematology and Oncology Service, Centro Hospitalar Universitario Sainte-Justine, Universidade de Montreal, Montreal, AC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20110126 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2011;33(6):478-80. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20110126.,10.5581/1516-8484.20110126 [doi],,,,PMC3459371,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Case reports', 'Leukemia, promyelocytic, acute', 'Sarcoma, myeloid', 'Spinal cord neoplasms']",,,,,,,

The improvement of anticancer agents and immunosuppressive drugs seem to be associated with an increased incidence of secondary myeloid neoplasms. Karyotyping of bone marrow is essential for diagnosis and prognosis. Previous use of alkylating agents and radiation are associated with clonal abnormalities such as recurrent unbalanced -5/5q-, -7/7q- and complex karyotypes, whereas topoisomerase-II inhibitors lead to changes such as the balanced 11q23 rearrangement, t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16). OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and cytogenetic data of patients with secondary myeloid neoplasms who took antineoplastic and/or immunosuppressive drugs or progressed from aplastic anemia. METHODS: The clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of 42 patients diagnosed with secondary myeloid neoplasms in one institution were retrospectively evaluated. Of these, 25, 11 and 6 patients had had oncological diseases, aplastic anemia and other diseases, respectively. Conventional cytogenetic and FISH analyses were performed for monosomy 7. RESULTS: The cytogenetic study was conclusive in 32 cases with 84.4% of clonal abnormalities. Monosomy 7 and complex karyotypes were present in 44.4% and 37%, respectively. A high prevalence of unbalanced abnormalities (96.3%) was observed. Monosomy 7 was more prevalent in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloid neoplasms after aplastic anemia (66.6%). The median survival after diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms was only 5.7 months. Normal cytogenetics was associated to better survival (p-value = 0.03). There was a slightly worse trend of survival for patients with complex karyotypes (p-value = 0.057). Abnormal karyotype was an independent risk factor for poor survival (p-value = 0.012). CONCLUSION: This study enhances the importance of cytogenetic analysis of patients at the time of diagnosis of secondary myeloid neoplasms.","['Tanizawa, Roberta Sandra da Silva', 'Kumeda, Cristina Aiko', 'de Azevedo Neto, Raymundo Soares', 'Leal, Aline de Medeiros', 'Ferreira, Patricia de Barros', 'Velloso, Elvira Deolinda Rodrigues Pereira']","['Tanizawa RS', 'Kumeda CA', 'de Azevedo Neto RS', 'Leal Ade M', 'Ferreira Pde B', 'Velloso ED']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory, Servico de Hematologia do Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20110117 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2011;33(6):425-31. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20110117.,10.5581/1516-8484.20110117 [doi],,,,PMC3459367,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytogenetic analysis', 'Leukemia, myeloid', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,,,,,

According to these theories, the mutation plays either a primary or secondary role in disease development.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of the -398C/T polymorphism in the perforin gene in oncohematological patients. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with hematological malignancies treated at the teaching hospital of the Universidade Federal do Triangulo Mineiro were invited to participate in this study. The identification of the polymorphism was achieved by amplification using polymerase chain reaction, digestion using the TaqI enzyme and electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. RESULTS: The heterozygous -398C/T polymorphism was identified in 16.7% patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 40% with multiple myeloma, 50% with essential thrombocythemia, 14.3% with Hodgkin's disease, 7.7% with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 33.3% with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

In chronic myeloid leukemia a proliferation of malignant myeloid cells occurs in the bone marrow due to excessive tyrosine kinase activity. In order to maintain homeostasis, natural killer cells, by means of receptors, identify the major histocompatibility complex on the surface of tumor cells and subsequently induce apoptosis. The NKG2D receptor in the natural killer cells recognizes the transmembrane proteins related to major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related genes A and B (MICA and MICB), and it is by the interaction between NKG2D and MICA that natural killer cells exert cytotoxic activity against chronic myeloid leukemia tumor cells. However, in the case of chronic exposure of the NKG2D receptor, the MICA ligand releases soluble proteins called sMICA from the tumor cell surface, which negatively modulate NKG2D and enable the tumor cells to avoid lysis mediated by the natural killer cells. Blocking the formation of sMICA may be an important antitumor strategy. Treatment using tyrosine kinase inhibitors induces modulation of NKG2DL expression, which could favor the activity of the natural killer cells.

The aim of this study was to evaluate BCR-ABL levels of chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with imatinib in the chronic phase and correlate the response to therapy and event-free survival. METHODS: BCR-ABL levels were measured in peripheral blood cell samples using Real time PCR at diagnosis and then every 3 months after starting therapy with imatinib. Major molecular response was defined as a three-log reduction from the standardized baseline value. Major molecular response values were adjusted to international scale using a conversion factor of 1.19. The results are reported as a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio (%). RESULTS: Hematological, major cytogenetic and complete cytogenetic responses were achieved by 57 (95%), 45 (75%) and 38 (63%) patients, respectively. Twenty-four out of sixty patients achieved a major molecular response (40%) in a median time of 8.5 months. Overall survival and event free survival were higher for patients with (100%) versus patients without (77%) a complete cytogenetic response (p-value = 0.01) at 48 months. Patients with complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response had a higher event free survival compared to patients with complete cytogenetic response but without major molecular response (p-value = 0.007).

The importance of validating new prognostic parameters in acute leukemias was the reason to investigate the CD56 expression in blast cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: A cohort of 48 patients treated at Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre and diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia as classified by the French-American-British group (FAB) criteria using cell morphology, cytochemistry and flow cytometry were evaluated. RESULTS: Eight cases (16.7%) were CD56 positive without correlation to age or gender. The highest incidence of CD56 positivity was in FAB subtypes M4 and M5. The death rate during induction was not significantly different between patients with and without CD56 expression (62.5% vs. 27.5%; p-value = 0.097). However, patients that expressed CD56 had significantly lower overall survival than those who did not (mean 4.0 months vs. 14.5 months; p-value = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that expression of CD56 in acute myeloid leukemia may be indicative of poor prognosis because it is associated with a shorter overall survival.

Thus, other reasons are needed, in addition to biological characteristics of the leukemic cells themselves, to explain the unfavorable evolution of patients living in unfavorable socioeconomic and cultural conditions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate compliance to an acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment protocol. METHODS: MAIN ABSTRACTED DATA WERE: total duration and reasons for interruption of chemotherapy, prescribed doses of 6-mercaptopurine, and median white blood cell and neutrophil counts during the maintenance phase. Interruptions of chemotherapy were considered inappropriate if they did not follow predetermined criteria established in the protocol. RESULTS: Fourteen of 73 patients (19.2%) unduly interrupted chemotherapy by determination of their physicians. The median white blood cell count was higher when compared with the protocol recommendations; the median 6-MP dose was lower than the standard recommended dose. The estimated probability of event-free survival was higher for patients with lower median leukocyte counts and close to those predetermined by the protocol. Event-free survival was also higher for children with a higher percentage of days without chemotherapy due to bone marrow or liver toxicity excluding undue interruptions. In multivariate analysis, both factors remained statistically significant. These results suggest that the intensity of maintenance chemotherapy may not have been enough in some children, to achieve adequate myelosuppression, hence the observation of higher leukocyte counts and none or rare episodes of therapy interruption. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance to the therapeutic protocol by both doctors and patients should always be considered in the evaluation of therapeutic failure in acute lymphoblastic leukemia; strict adherence to treatment protocols contributes to better treatment results in acute lymphoblastic leukemia children.","['de Oliveira, Benigna Maria', 'Valadares, Maria Thereza Macedo', 'Silva, Marcilene Rezende', 'Viana, Marcos Borato']","['de Oliveira BM', 'Valadares MT', 'Silva MR', 'Viana MB']","['Pediatrics Department, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2010/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20110051 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2011;33(3):185-9. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20110051.,10.5581/1516-8484.20110051 [doi],,,,PMC3415741,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antineoplastic combined chemotherapy protocols', 'Chemotherapy', 'Guideline adherence', 'Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma']",,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the overall survival of patients and identify factors that influence the outcomes of this type of transplant in patients in 1st complete remission who received a busulfan and melphalan combination as conditioning regimen. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukemia were enrolled between 2003 and 2008. The median age was 34 years old (Range: 16 - 57 years). All patients received cyclosporine and methotrexate for prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease. Median neutrophil engraftment time was 16 days (Range: 7 - 22 days) and 17 days (Range: 7 - 46 days) for platelets. Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome was observed in three patients, seven had grade II acute graft-versus-host disease and one extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease. RESULTS: The overall survival by the Kaplan-Meier method was 48% after 36 months with a plateau at 36 months after transplantation. Intensive consolidation with high-dose arabinoside resulted in an improved survival (p-value = 0.0001), as did grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (p-value = 0.0377) and mild chronic graft-versus-host disease (p-value < 0.0001). Thirteen patients died, five due to infection within 100 days of transplant, two due to hemorrhages, one to infection and graftversus-host disease and three relapses followed by renal failure (one) and infection (two). The cause of death could not be determined for two patients. CONCLUSION: The busulfan and melphalan conditioning regimen is as good as other conditioning regimens providing an excellent survival rate.","['Bueno, Nadjanara Dorna', 'Dulley, Frederico Luiz', 'Saboya, Rosaura', 'Amigo Filho, Jose Ulysses', 'Coracin, Fabio Luiz', 'Chamone, Dalton de Alencar Fischer']","['Bueno ND', 'Dulley FL', 'Saboya R', 'Amigo Filho JU', 'Coracin FL', 'Chamone Dde A']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20110050 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2011;33(3):179-84. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20110050.,10.5581/1516-8484.20110050 [doi],,,,PMC3415735,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Combined modality therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug toxicity', 'Graft vs. Host disease', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Prognosis', 'Stem cell transplantation', 'Survival analysis']",,,,,,,

RESULTS: HB9 binds to the PTGER2 promoter, down-regulates PTGER2 gene expression and subsequently represses cAMP synthesis in hematopoietic cells. CONCLUSION: Expression of HLXB9 represses PTGER2 mediated signaling. SIGNIFICANCE: First molecular report of HB9-dependent target gene regulation in hematopoietic cells. The transcription factor HB9, encoded by the homeobox gene B9 (HLXB9), is involved in the development of pancreatic beta- and motor neuronal cells. In addition, HLXB9 is recurrently rearranged in young children with acute myeloid leukemia characterized by a chromosomal translocation t(7;12)-HLXB9/TEL and concomitant high expression of the unrearranged, wild-type HLXB9 allele. However, target genes of HB9 in hematopoietic cells are not known to date. In this study, we used ChIP-on-chip analysis together with expression profiling and identified PTGER2 (prostaglandin E receptor 2) as a target gene of HB9 in a hematopoietic cell line. The functional HB9 homeodomain as well as the HB9 binding domain within the PTGER2 promoter are essential for binding of HB9 to the PTGER2 promoter region and down-regulation of PTGER2 expression. Functionally, HB9 conducted down-regulation of PTGER2 results in a reduced content of intracellular cAMP mobilization and furthermore the decreased PTGER2 gene expression is valid in bone marrow cells from translocation t(7;12) positive patients. Among the primary and secondary target genes of HB9 in the myeloid cell line HL60, 78% of significantly regulated genes are down-regulated, indicating an overall repressive function of HB9. Differentially regulated genes were preferentially confined to pathways involved in cell-adhesion and cell-cell interactions, similar to the gene expression footprint of HLXB9-expressing cells from t(7;12) positive patients.","['Wildenhain, Sarah', 'Ingenhag, Deborah', 'Ruckert, Christian', 'Degistirici, Ozer', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Hauer, Julia', 'Borkhardt, Arndt']","['Wildenhain S', 'Ingenhag D', 'Ruckert C', 'Degistirici O', 'Dugas M', 'Meisel R', 'Hauer J', 'Borkhardt A']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich Heine University, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP2 Subtype)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP2 Subtype/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)62211-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.308965 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Nov 23;287(48):40703-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.308965.

As the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has a key role in signal transduction, we investigated its role in the pathogenesis and evolution of myelodysplastic syndromes. Expressions of HSP90 and signalling proteins clients (phosphorylated-AKT (pAKT), Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated-FAK (pFAK)), were assessed in bone marrow mononuclear and CD34-positive (CD34+) cells from 177 patients with myelodysplasia. Effects of HSP90 inhibition were also evaluated in 39 samples. The levels of all proteins studied were significantly higher in patients with high grade disease, than those with low grade myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. High levels of HSP90, FAK, pFAK and pAKT were associated with shorter survival and increased risk of progression into acute leukaemia. A down regulation of pFAK and pAKT and increased apoptosis was observed in mononuclear and CD34+ cells after 12 hours of incubation with 17-AAG.

We intend to study the pathways downstream RhoA controlling amoeboid motility. Mouse prolymphoblastic cells (Ba/F3 cell line) expressing different forms of Bcr-Abl were embedded in 3-dimensional (3D) Matrigel to study motility and explore the effects of inhibiting Rho pathway (inhibitors and siRNAs). The phosphorylation levels of cofilin-1 and destrin were analyzed by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Composition of Bcr-Abl signalplex in different conditions was determined by coimmunoprecipitation. Ba/F3p190 and Ba/F3 expressing a mutant form of p210(bcr-abl) (unable to activate RhoA) cells presented a spontaneous motility, but not an amoeboid type. p210(bcr-abl)-induced amoeboid motility in a 3D matrix requires isoform-specific RhoA/ROCK-1/destrin signaling. Next to the conventional Rho/ROCK/MLC/myosin pathway, this pathway is a crucial determinant for amoeboid motility, specific for the destrin isoform (and not its coexpressed homologue cofilin-1). Also, the presence of destrin (and not cofilin-1) in the p210(bcr-abl) complex is dependent on ROCK1, and this signalplex is required for amoeboid motility. This underscores isoform-specific function within the ADF/cofilin family and provides new insight into Bcr-Abl signaling to amoeboid motility and possible impact on understanding chronic myeloid leukemia progression.","['Rochelle, Tristan', 'Daubon, Thomas', 'Van Troys, Marleen', 'Harnois, Thomas', 'Waterschoot, Davy', 'Ampe, Christophe', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Bourmeyster, Nicolas', 'Constantin, Bruno']","['Rochelle T', 'Daubon T', 'Van Troys M', 'Harnois T', 'Waterschoot D', 'Ampe C', 'Roy L', 'Bourmeyster N', 'Constantin B']","['Institut de Physiologie et Biologie Cellulaires, Unite Mixte de Recherche Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) 6187, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Destrin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Rock1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Amoeba/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Destrin/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.12-205112 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.12-205112 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2013 Jan;27(1):123-34. doi: 10.1096/fj.12-205112.

The lack of other options underscores the urgent need to develop new therapy. The prevailing model suggests that genetic and/or epigenetic alterations that occur in HSCs or HSC niche compromise HSC function, resulting in MDS; therefore, MDS HSCs are likely the ideal targets for MDS treatment.

Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) gene has been reported to be a potential candidate for calcium influx. The present study aimed to investigate the possible role of TRPM7 channels in apoptosis in rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line (RBL-2H3), which is widely used in mast cell-associated studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A recombinant retrovirus vector siRNA targeting rat TRPM7 gene was constructed and identified. Cellular survival was assessed by MTT. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and TUNEL-FITC/Hoechst 33258 staining. RESULTS: The transfection efficiency by retrovirus vector was about 60%-70%. Transfection with TRPM7 siRNA significantly reduced TRPM7 expression both at mRNA and protein levels. Suppression of TRPM7 expression by siRNA led to significantly decreased cellular survival rates and increased apoptosis rates in RBL-2H3 cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of 10-acetylirciformonin B and its possible mechanism of action against leukemia HL 60 cells. We found that 10-acetylirciformonin B decreased cell viability through the inhibition of cell growth as well as the induction of DNA damage and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of DNA damage was mediated by the increase of p-CHK2 and gamma-H2A.X, which was suggested from the increase of tail movement in the neutral Comet assay. Induction of apoptosis was mediated with the increase in caspases 8, 9 and 3 activation as well as PARP cleavage.

Here we provide a detailed overview of the genetic pathways that interact with these B-lineage specification factors, and describe how mutations affecting these master regulators together with cooperating lesions drive leukemia development.","['Tijchon, E', 'Havinga, J', 'van Leeuwen, F N', 'Scheijen, B']","['Tijchon E', 'Havinga J', 'van Leeuwen FN', 'Scheijen B']","['Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012293 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.293 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):541-52. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.293.

Unfortunately, 25% of TKI-naive patients and 50-90% of patients developing TKI-resistance carry CML clones expressing TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 kinase mutants. We reported that CML-CP leukemia stem and progenitor cell populations accumulate high amounts of reactive oxygen species, which may result in accumulation of uracil derivatives in genomic DNA. Unfaithful and/or inefficient repair of these lesions generates TKI-resistant point mutations in BCR-ABL1 kinase. Using an array of specific substrates and inhibitors/blocking antibodies we found that uracil DNA glycosylase UNG2 were inhibited in BCR-ABL1-transformed cell lines and CD34(+) CML cells. The inhibitory effect was not accompanied by downregulation of nuclear expression and/or chromatin association of UNG2. The effect was BCR-ABL1 kinase-specific because several other fusion tyrosine kinases did not reduce UNG2 activity. Using UNG2-specific inhibitor UGI, we found that reduction of UNG2 activity increased the number of uracil derivatives in genomic DNA detected by modified comet assay and facilitated accumulation of ouabain-resistant point mutations in reporter gene Na(+)/K(+)ATPase. In conclusion, we postulate that BCR-ABL1 kinase-mediated inhibition of UNG2 contributes to accumulation of point mutations responsible for TKI resistance causing the disease relapse, and perhaps also other point mutations facilitating malignant progression of CML.","['Slupianek, A', 'Falinski, R', 'Znojek, P', 'Stoklosa, T', 'Flis, S', 'Doneddu, V', 'Pytel, D', 'Synowiec, E', 'Blasiak, J', 'Bellacosa, A', 'Skorski, T']","['Slupianek A', 'Falinski R', 'Znojek P', 'Stoklosa T', 'Flis S', 'Doneddu V', 'Pytel D', 'Synowiec E', 'Blasiak J', 'Bellacosa A', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. aslupian@temple.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (Uracil-DNA Glycosidase)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uracil-DNA Glycosidase/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012294 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.294 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):629-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.294.

This compound is a derivative of palmitic acid that incorporates the putative reactive functional group (diynone) of the peyssonenyne natural products. Other analogues containing the diynone or an acetoxyenediyne did not show the same biological profile. In U937 human leukemia cells, diynone 8 induced cell differentiation and apoptosis, which correlated with the expression of Fas protein. Very surprisingly, diynone 8 was toxic to normal human fibroblasts (BJ) and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF), but not to immortalized human fibroblasts (BJEL); this unique effect was not observed with the classical DNMT inhibitor 5-azacytidine. Therefore, compound 8 interferes in a very specific manner with signaling pathways, the activities of which differ between normal and immortalized cell types. This toxicity is reminiscent of the effects of Dnmt1 ablation on mouse fibroblasts.

METHODS: In the current study, this strategy was expanded to the in-vitro genome-wide association approach, using 516 LCLs derived from a White cohort to assess the cytotoxic response to temozolomide. RESULTS: Genome-wide association analysis using approximately 2.1 million quality-controlled single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified a statistically significant association (P<10(-8)) with SNPs in the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. We also show that the primary SNP in this region is significantly associated with the differential gene expression of MGMT (P<10(-26)) in LCLs and differential methylation in glioblastoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. CONCLUSION: The previously documented clinical and functional relationships between MGMT and temozolomide response highlight the potential of well-powered genome-wide association studies of the LCL model system to identify meaningful genetic associations.","['Brown, Chad C', 'Havener, Tammy M', 'Medina, Marisa W', 'Auman, J Todd', 'Mangravite, Lara M', 'Krauss, Ronald M', 'McLeod, Howard L', 'Motsinger-Reif, Alison A']","['Brown CC', 'Havener TM', 'Medina MW', 'Auman JT', 'Mangravite LM', 'Krauss RM', 'McLeod HL', 'Motsinger-Reif AA']","['Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7566, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (MGMT protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*genetics', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283589c50 [doi]', '01213011-201211000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2012 Nov;22(11):796-802. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283589c50.,10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283589c50 [doi],,"['U19 HL69757-10/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM081057/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 HL069757/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM081057/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM063340/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA161608-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL104133/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA161608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM63340/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007329/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3691078,,,,,,,['NIHMS476871'],,,,,,

HTLV infection affects host's ocular tolerance and causes various diseases in the eye. Here we discuss the manifestations, mechanisms, treatments, and future directions of HTLV-related ocular diseases. RECENT FININGS: Recent serological researches showed that the number of HTLV-1 carriers in metropolitan area was increasing, although seroprevalence of HTLV-1 in general population was decreased after screening serological tests in blood donors started. The most common clinical entity of uveitis was still HTLV-1 uveitis in HTLV-1 highly endemic area, but prevalence of HTLV-1 uveitis varies in different parts of the world. As for treatment of inflammation, tacrolimus and 5-azacytidine were reported to be effective for autoimmune manifestations in HTLV-1-related overlap syndrome (deratomyositis/Sjogren's syndrome) and HTLV-1-related myelodysplastic syndrome. Interleukin-2 receptor targeted therapies improved scleritis in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma caused by HTLV-1. Basic researches identified that HTLV-1 tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor play critical roles in the HTLV-1-related disease and are now being investigated as targeted therapies. SUMMARY: Development of modern molecular biology makes it possible to reveal deep insights of HTLV-1-related ocular diseases. Although effective therapies based on basic researches have been reported, further endeavor is necessary to establish much more specific treatments of the ocular diseases.","['Kamoi, Koju', 'Mochizuki, Manabu']","['Kamoi K', 'Mochizuki M']","['Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Ophthalmol,Current opinion in ophthalmology,9011108,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use', 'Uveitis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/ICU.0b013e328358b9ec [doi]', '00055735-201211000-00019 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2012 Nov;23(6):557-61. doi: 10.1097/ICU.0b013e328358b9ec.,10.1097/ICU.0b013e328358b9ec [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the strategies to prevent BLV dissemination, a control plan based on the selective segregation of animals according to their proviral load (PVL) is promising for our dairy productive system. The objective of this work was to study the relationship between the blood PVL and the antibody level, in order to identify whether the individual humoral response, i.e. the anti-p24 or anti-whole-BLV particle, could be used as a marker of the blood level of infection and thus help to recruit animals that may pose a lower risk of dissemination under natural conditions. RESULTS: The prevalence of p24 antibodies on the 15 farms studied was over 66%. The prevalence of p24 and whole-BLV antibodies and PVL quantification were analyzed in all the samples (n = 196) taken from herds T1 and 51. ROC analysis showed a higher AUC for p24 antibodies than whole-BLV antibodies (Z(reactivity): 3.55, P < 0.001; Z(titer): 2.88, P < 0.01), and as consequence a better performance to predict the proviral load status in herd 51. No significant differences were found between the performance of p24 and whole-BLV antibodies in herd T1. A significant positive correlation was observed between PVL values and p24 antibody reactivity in both farms (r (T1) = 0.7, P < 0.001, r (51) = 0.71, P < 0.0001). The analysis was extended to the whole number of weak p24 antibody reactors (n = 311) of the other 13 farms. The mean of high PVL reactors within weak p24 reactors was 17.38% (SD = 8.92). In 5/15 farms, the number of weak p24 reactors with high PVL was lower than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the humoral response reflected the level of in vivo infection, and may therefore have useful epidemiological applications. Whereas the quantitative evaluation of blood proviral load using real-time PCR is expensive and technically demanding, the measurement of antibodies in blood by ELISA is relatively straightforward and could therefore constitute a cost-effective tool in a BLV control intervention strategy, especially in highly infected herds such as Argentinean dairy ones.","['Gutierrez, Geronimo', 'Carignano, Hugo', 'Alvarez, Irene', 'Martinez, Cecilia', 'Porta, Natalia', 'Politzki, Romina', 'Gammella, Mariela', 'Lomonaco, Marina', 'Fondevila, Norberto', 'Poli, Mario', 'Trono, Karina']","['Gutierrez G', 'Carignano H', 'Alvarez I', 'Martinez C', 'Porta N', 'Politzki R', 'Gammella M', 'Lomonaco M', 'Fondevila N', 'Poli M', 'Trono K']","['Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, INTA, C.C. 1712, Castelar, Argentina. ggutierrez@cnia.inta.gov.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/immunology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Viral Load/*veterinary']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1746-6148-8-187 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-6148-8-187 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2012 Oct 9;8:187. doi: 10.1186/1746-6148-8-187.,10.1186/1746-6148-8-187 [doi],20121009,,,PMC3526540,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their prevalence, DNA repeats are largely ignored. The vast majority of our genome is transcribed to produce non protein-coding RNAs. Among these, long non protein-coding RNAs represent the most prevalent and functionally diverse class. The relevance of the non protein-coding genome to human disease has mainly been studied regarding the altered microRNA expression and function in human cancer. On the contrary, the elucidation of the involvement of long non-coding RNAs in disease is only in its infancy. We have recently found that a chromatin associated, long non protein-coding RNA regulates a Polycomb/Trithorax epigenetic switch at the basis of the repeat associated facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a common muscle disorder. Based on this, we propose that long non-coding RNAs produced by repetitive sequences contribute in shaping the epigenetic landscape in normal human physiology and in disease.","['Cabianca, Daphne S', 'Casa, Valentina', 'Gabellini, Davide']","['Cabianca DS', 'Casa V', 'Gabellini D']","['Dulbecco Telethon Institute and Division of Regenerative Medicine, Stem cells, and Gene therapy, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genome, Human', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism/pathology', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['21922 [pii]', '10.4161/rna.21922 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA Biol. 2012 Oct;9(10):1211-7. doi: 10.4161/rna.21922.

In this study, we observed that XMRV was highly sensitive to the inhibition by human BST-2. We were able to determine the structural domains of BST-2 that are essential to restrict XMRV, including the transmembrane domain, the coiled-coil ectodomain, the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, the two putative N-linked glycosylation sites, and the three extracellular cysteine residues. Protease treatment effectively released XMRV particles into the supernatant, supporting the notion that BST-2 tethered nascent particles to the cell surface.

Researchers have recently observed that the C-terminus of the LIFRalpha cytoplasmic domain contains as many conserved YXXQ motifs as gp130 (C-terminal triple YXXQ motifs, LIFRalpha-CT3), whose free structure has been shown to be capable of activating STAT3 phosphorylation in the cytoplasm and consequently activating STAT3-related downstream molecules in the nucleus. This process can induce pathological acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute promyeloid leukemia (APL) cells to differentiate into mature granulocytes, simulating the LIF-related differential cascade. This process reduces or inhibits the side effects caused by toxic all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA), which has long been used as a fundamental medication for treating AML/APL in clinical practice despite its related high relapse rate. Therefore, we believe that it is possible to maximize the beneficial effects of LIF by enriching LIFRalpha-CT3 in AML/APL cell cytoplasm. The aims of this work were to enrich LIFRalpha-specific motifs in leukemia cells using molecular biological methods and evaluate the use of membrane-permeable polypeptides as a novel possible AML/APL therapy in combination with or independent of ATRA-based chemotherapy.","['Sun, Qing', 'Gao, Guangkai', 'Xiong, Jun', 'Wu, Qingtao', 'Liu, Houqi']","['Sun Q', 'Gao G', 'Xiong J', 'Wu Q', 'Liu H']","[""Department of Hyperbaric Medicine, Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Qingdao, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*therapy', 'Models, Theoretical']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(12)00421-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2012.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2012 Dec;79(6):864-6. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2012.09.008.

The aim of our review was to evaluate the accuracy of a day 14 BM biopsy in determining the need for re-induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML treated with induction chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed for the purpose of evaluating treatment decisions and outcomes based on their day 14 BM biopsy. Response to therapy in this analysis was based on morphology alone. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients undergoing standard induction, 45 patients (61%) had no evidence of leukemia on their day 14 BM biopsy. Eighteen patients (24%) had definitive residual disease (RD), and 11 patient's (15%) were classified as indeterminate response (IR). Fifteen patients with RD and one with IR underwent re-induction chemotherapy. However, thirteen patients (3 RD and 10 IR) were observed until count recovery without any re-induction therapy. Eleven of these 13 patients who were observed eventually attained a morphologic complete remission (CR), including two patients with RD. CONCLUSIONS: A day 14 BM biopsy may have suboptimal sensitivity for the detection of residual leukemia. Some patients with an IR on day 14 may not require re-induction chemotherapy, but instead, may benefit from careful observation until count recovery to avoid the mortality and morbidity associated with re-induction chemotherapy.","['Morris, Tod A', 'DeCastro, Carlos M', 'Diehl, Louis F', 'Gockerman, Jon P', 'Lagoo, Anand S', 'Li, Zhiguo', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Rao, Arati V']","['Morris TA', 'DeCastro CM', 'Diehl LF', 'Gockerman JP', 'Lagoo AS', 'Li Z', 'Moore JO', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Rao AV']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Duke University Health System, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00389-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jan;37(1):28-31. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.016.

Here, we study the action of a clinically approved DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor - decitabine (DAC) - in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. At low doses, DAC treatment induced apoptosis of NB4 Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) cells, which was associated with the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Expression studies of the members of the Death Receptor family demonstrated that DAC induces the expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Upregulation of TRAIL, upon DAC treatment, was associated with specific epigenetic modifications induced by DAC in the proximity of the TRAIL promoter, as demonstrated by DNA demethylation, increased DNaseI sensitivity and histone acetylation of a non-CpG island, CpG-rich region located 2kb upstream to the transcription start site. Luciferase assay experiments showed that this region behave as a DNA methylation sensitive transcriptional regulatory element. The CpG regulatory element was also found methylated in samples derived from APL patients. These findings have been confirmed in the non-APL, AML Kasumi cell line, suggesting that this regulatory mechanism may be extended to other AMLs. Our study suggests that DNA methylation is a regulatory mechanism relevant for silencing of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway in leukemic cells, and further elucidates the mechanism by which epigenetic drugs mediate their anti-leukemic effects.","['Soncini, Matias', 'Santoro, Fabio', 'Gutierrez, Arantxa', 'Frige, Gianmaria', 'Romanenghi, Mauro', 'Botrugno, Oronza A', 'Pallavicini, Isabella', 'Pelicci, PierGiuseppe', 'Di Croce, Luciano', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Soncini M', 'Santoro F', 'Gutierrez A', 'Frige G', 'Romanenghi M', 'Botrugno OA', 'Pallavicini I', 'Pelicci P', 'Di Croce L', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4439(12)00223-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Jan;1832(1):114-20. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.10.001.

Arsenic is a carcinogen and a causative agent of numerous human diseases. Paradoxically arsenic is used as a chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Inorganic arsenic has two biological important oxidation states: As(V) (arsenate) and As(III) (arsenite). Arsenic uptake is adventitious because the arsenate and arsenite are chemically similar to required nutrients. Arsenate resembles phosphate and is a competitive inhibitor of many phosphate-utilizing enzymes. Arsenate is taken up by phosphate transport systems. In contrast, at physiological pH, the form of arsenite is As(OH)(3), which resembles organic molecules such as glycerol. Consequently, arsenite is taken into cells by aquaglyceroporin channels. Arsenic efflux systems are found in nearly every organism and evolved to rid cells of this toxic metalloid. These efflux systems include members of the multidrug resistance protein family and the bacterial exchangers Acr3 and ArsB. ArsB can also be a subunit of the ArsAB As(III)-translocating ATPase, an ATP-driven efflux pump. The ArsD metallochaperone binds cytosolic As(III) and transfers it to the ArsA subunit of the efflux pump. Knowledge of the pathways and transporters for arsenic uptake and efflux is essential for understanding its toxicity and carcinogenicity and for rational design of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Yang, Hung-Chi', 'Fu, Hsueh-Liang', 'Lin, Yung-Feng', 'Rosen, Barry P']","['Yang HC', 'Fu HL', 'Lin YF', 'Rosen BP']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology and Laboratory Sciences, Chang-Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Curr Top Membr,Current topics in membranes,9212591,"['0 (Aquaglyceroporins)', '0 (Arsenates)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Metallochaperones)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'N7CIZ75ZPN (arsenic acid)']",IM,"['Aquaglyceroporins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Arsenates/chemistry/metabolism', 'Arsenic/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Arsenites/chemistry/metabolism', 'Bacteria/metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Eukaryota/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Metallochaperones/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-394390-3.00012-4 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-394390-3.00012-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Top Membr. 2012;69:325-58. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-394390-3.00012-4.,10.1016/B978-0-12-394390-3.00012-4 [doi] B978-0-12-394390-3.00012-4 [pii],,"['R01 GM055425/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM055425/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM55425/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC4578627,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Our hypothesis explains that a better choice of features could improve the classification of the diseased and normal stage samples, and the potential application of feature screening to produce feature sets, with better accuracies and lowest number of embedded features. The observed results suggest that feature selection proves to be an essential and affirmative step in the biomedical data mining models based on gene expression profiles.","['Li, Kaishi', 'Yang, Meixue', 'Sablok, Gaurav', 'Fan, Jianping', 'Zhou, Fengfeng']","['Li K', 'Yang M', 'Sablok G', 'Fan J', 'Zhou F']","['Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and Health Informatics Key Laboratory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518055, P.R.

Defects in the establishment or the maintenance of the correct chromatin configuration have been associated with diseases ranging from leukemia to muscular dystrophy. The heart expresses many chromatin factors, and we are only beginning to understand their roles in heart development and function. We have previously shown that the chromatin regulator Asxl2 is highly expressed in the murine heart both during development and adulthood. In the absence of Asxl2, there is a significant reduction in trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), a histone mark associated with lineage-specific silencing of developmental genes. Here we present evidence that Asxl2 is required for the long-term maintenance of ventricular function and for the maintenance of normal cardiac gene expression. Asxl2(-/-) hearts displayed progressive deterioration of ventricular function. By 10 months of age, there was ~37% reduction in fractional shortening in Asxl2(-/-) hearts compared to wild-type. Analysis of the expression of myofibril proteins suggests that Asxl2 is required for the repression of beta-MHC. Asxl2(-/-) hearts did not exhibit hypertrophy, suggesting that the de-repression of beta-MHC was not the result of hypertrophic response. Instead, Asxl2 and the histone methyltansferase Ezh2 co-localize to beta-MHC promoter, suggesting that Asxl2 directly represses beta-MHC. Interrogation of the CardioGenomics database revealed that ASXL2 is down-regulated in the hearts of patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We propose that chromatin factors like Asxl2 function in the adult heart to regulate cell type- and stage-specific patterns of gene expression, and the disruption of such regulation may be involved in the etiology and/or development of certain forms of human heart disease.","['Lai, Hsiao-Lei', 'Grachoff, Milana', 'McGinley, Andrea L', 'Khan, Farida F', 'Warren, Chad M', 'Chowdhury, Shamim A K', 'Wolska, Beata M', 'Solaro, R John', 'Geenen, David L', 'Wang, Q Tian']","['Lai HL', 'Grachoff M', 'McGinley AL', 'Khan FF', 'Warren CM', 'Chowdhury SA', 'Wolska BM', 'Solaro RJ', 'Geenen DL', 'Wang QT']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA. hlai4@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Mol Cell Cardiol,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,0262322,"['0 (ASXL2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myh7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Troponin I)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Size', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardium/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/enzymology/metabolism/physiology', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke Volume', 'Troponin I/metabolism', '*Ventricular Function']",2012/10/11 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2828(12)00303-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2012 Nov;53(5):734-41. doi: 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.014.

A small proportion of newborns are asymptomatic and only manifest circulating blast cells, with or without leukocytosis, while others present with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serous effusions, and liver fibrosis. Few cases in the literature also have skin manifestations, described as crusted, erythematous, vesiculopustular eruptions occurring mainly on the face, with spreading to the trunk and extremities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with DS and TMD were studied due to the presence of cutaneous eruptions. Systemic involvement, work-up, and follow-up were documented for each patient. Our results were compared with the previously reported cases. RESULTS: All patients were males, with ages ranging from 1 to 20 days at the time of diagnosis. In three patients, the eruption was papulopustular, and two of them also had vesicles. In one patient, lesions resembled bullous impetigo. In all, the lesions involved the face, followed by the extremities in three and the trunk in two patients. Pathergy phenomena was present in one patient. Hepatomegaly and a leukemoid reaction were present in all patients. Bone marrow showed an M7 immunophenotype in three patients and normal cellularity in one. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 11 months, during which the patients were healthy. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the cutaneous eruptions associated with TMD in neonate patients with DS may lead to early diagnosis and avoidance of unnecessary chemotherapy. However, because leukemia may develop later, careful follow-up is mandatory in all cases.","['Narvaez-Rosales, Veronica', 'de-Ocariz, Marimar Saez', 'Carrasco-Daza, Daniel', 'Ramirez-Davila, Brenda', 'Orozco-Covarrubias, Luz', 'Duran-McKinster, Carola', 'Palacios-Lopez, Carolina']","['Narvaez-Rosales V', 'de-Ocariz MS', 'Carrasco-Daza D', 'Ramirez-Davila B', 'Orozco-Covarrubias L', 'Duran-McKinster C', 'Palacios-Lopez C']","['Department of Dermatology, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City, Mexico Department of Pathology, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,['Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder of Down Syndrome'],IM,"['Down Syndrome/complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Newborn, Diseases/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*pathology', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases, Vesiculobullous/etiology/*pathology']",2012/10/11 06:00,2014/05/28 06:00,['2012/10/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-4632.2012.05501.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2013 Oct;52(10):1202-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2012.05501.x.

We analyzed the constitutive AML cell release of 31 cytokines for all the patients and performed a hierarchical cluster analysis of the cytokine profile which identified two major patient subsets that differed in their ability to enhance capillary-like networks; increased capillary-like networks was then associated with high constitutive release of several cytokines and especially high levels of several pro-angiogenic chemokines. Significantly increased network formation was not seen for any of the 11 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients investigated. The cytokine response by activated normal T cells inhibited endothelial network formation in our in vitro model of angiogenesis and activated normal monocytes had only a minor influence on tube formation.

However, in certain cases, the overexpression of these cytokines or their receptors can lead to excessive or aberrant initiation of signaling resulting in pathological conditions, with chronic inflammatory diseases and myeloid leukemias the most notable examples. Recent crystal structures of the GM-CSF receptor ternary complex and the IL-5 binary complex have revealed new paradigms of cytokine receptor activation. Together with a wealth of associated structure-function studies, they have significantly enhanced our understanding of how these receptors recognize cytokines and initiate signals across cell membranes. Importantly, these structures provide opportunities for structure-based approaches for the discovery of novel and disease-specific therapeutics. In addition, recent biochemical evidence has suggested that the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor family is capable of interacting productively with other membrane proteins at the cell surface.

MLL genes are frequently mutated in human cancers. Unlike MLL1, MLL2 (also known as ALR/MLL4) and its homolog MLL3 are not well-understood. Specifically, little is known regarding the extent of global MLL2 involvement in the regulation of gene expression and the mechanism underlying its alterations in driving tumorigenesis. Here we profile the global loci targeted by MLL2. A combinatorial analysis of the MLL2 binding profile and gene expression in MLL2 wild-type versus MLL2-null isogenic cell lines identified direct transcriptional target genes and revealed the connection of MLL2 to multiple cellular signaling pathways, including the p53 pathway, cAMP-mediated signaling, and cholestasis signaling. In particular, we demonstrate that MLL2 participates in retinoic acid receptor signaling by promoting retinoic acid-responsive gene transcription. Our results present a genome-wide integrative analysis of the MLL2 target loci and suggest potential mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis driven by MLL2 alterations.","['Guo, Changcun', 'Chang, Chun-Chi', 'Wortham, Matthew', 'Chen, Lee H', 'Kernagis, Dawn N', 'Qin, Xiaoxia', 'Cho, Young-Wook', 'Chi, Jen-Tsan', 'Grant, Gerald A', 'McLendon, Roger E', 'Yan, Hai', 'Ge, Kai', 'Papadopoulos, Nickolas', 'Bigner, Darell D', 'He, Yiping']","['Guo C', 'Chang CC', 'Wortham M', 'Chen LH', 'Kernagis DN', 'Qin X', 'Cho YW', 'Chi JT', 'Grant GA', 'McLendon RE', 'Yan H', 'Ge K', 'Papadopoulos N', 'Bigner DD', 'He Y']","['The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke, Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation Institute, cDepartment of Pathology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ASB2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100A1 protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'S100 Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics']",2012/10/10 06:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2012/10/10 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1208807109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1208807109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Oct 23;109(43):17603-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1208807109.

However, the majority of patients do not present with known mutations, and the limited access to primary patient leukemic cells impedes the efficient development of novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, using a xenotransplantation approach, we have modeled human pediatric AMKL in immunodeficient mice. Analysis of high-throughput RNA sequencing identified recurrent fusion genes defining new molecular subgroups. One subgroup of patients presented with MLL or NUP98 fusion genes leading to up-regulation of the HOX A cluster genes. A novel CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene resulting from a cryptic inversion of chromosome 16 was identified in another subgroup of 31% of non-Down syndrome AMKL and strongly associated with a gene expression signature of Hedgehog pathway activation. These molecular data provide useful markers for the diagnosis and follow up of patients.

We evaluated ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a small-molecule irreversible inhibitor of BTK, in patients with B-cell malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia received escalating oral doses of ibrutinib. Two schedules were evaluated: one, 28 days on, 7 days off; and two, once-daily continuous dosing. Occupancy of BTK by ibrutinib in peripheral blood was monitored using a fluorescent affinity probe. Dose escalation proceeded until either the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was achieved or, in the absence of MTD, until three dose levels above full BTK occupancy by ibrutinib. Response was evaluated every two cycles. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with a variety of B-cell malignancies were treated over seven cohorts. Most adverse events were grade 1 and 2 in severity and self-limited. Dose-limiting events were not observed, even with prolonged dosing. Full occupancy of the BTK active site occurred at 2.5 mg/kg per day, and dose escalation continued to 12.5 mg/kg per day without reaching MTD. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination, yet BTK occupancy was maintained for at least 24 hours, consistent with the irreversible mechanism. Objective response rate in 50 evaluable patients was 60%, including complete response of 16%. Median progression-free survival in all patients was 13.6 months.

Whether HLA-mismatched stem-cell microtransplantation as a novel postremission therapy in these patients will improve survival and avoid graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is still unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred one patients with AML-CR1 (9 to 65 years old) from four treatment centers received programmed infusions of G-CSF-mobilized HLA-mismatched donor peripheral-blood stem cells after each of three cycles of high-dose cytarabine conditioning without GVHD prophylaxis. Donor chimerism and microchimerism and WT1+CD8+ T cells were analyzed. RESULTS: The 6-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 84.4% and 89.5%, respectively, in the low-risk group, which were similar to the rates in the intermediate-risk group (59.2% and 65.2%, respectively; P=.272 and P=.308). The 6-year LFS and OS were 76.4% and 82.1%, respectively, in patients who received a high dose of donor CD3+ T cells (>/=1.1x10(8)/kg) in each infusion, which were significantly higher than the LFS and OS in patients who received a lower dose (<1.1x10(8)/kg) of donor CD3+ T cells (49.5% and 55.3%, respectively; P=.091 and P=.041). No GVHD was observed in any of the patients. Donor microchimerism (2 to 1,020 days) was detected in 20 of the 23 female patients who were available for Y chromosome analysis. A significant increase in WT1+CD8+ T cells (from 0.2% to 4.56%) was observed in 33 of 39 patients with positive HLA-A*02:01 antigen by a pentamer analysis.

Minimal residual disease eradication was feasible only with fludarabine-based combinations in 60% of these cases. The ratio of minimal residual disease was 0.5% on average. During a median follow-up period lasting 30 months, the overall survival of patients with fludarabine-resistant disease proved to be significantly shorter (p = 0.04), while complete remission without minimal residual disease was associated with significantly longer progression free survival (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Only fludarabine-based combinations were able to eradicate minimal residual disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Complete remission without minimal residual disease may predict longer progression free survival in these patients.","['Plander, Mark', 'Skrapits, Judit', 'Bozso, Tunde', 'Szendrei, Tamas', 'Ivanyi, Janos Laszlo']","['Plander M', 'Skrapits J', 'Bozso T', 'Szendrei T', 'Ivanyi JL']","['Vas Megyei Markusovszky Korhaz, Egyetemi Oktatokorhaz Nonprofit Zrt.

HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), the viral gene transcribed from the antisense strand, is consistently expressed in ATL cells and promotes their proliferation. In this study, we found that a Wnt pathway-related protein, disheveled-associating protein with a high frequency of leucine residues (DAPLE), interacts with both HTLV-1 Tax and HBZ. In the presence of DAPLE, Tax activated canonical Wnt signaling. Conversely, HBZ markedly suppressed canonical Wnt activation induced by either Tax/DAPLE or beta-catenin. As a mechanism of HBZ-mediated Wnt suppression, we found that HBZ targets lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1, one of the key transcription factors of the pathway, and impairs its DNA-binding ability. We also observed that the canonical Wnt pathway was not activated in HTLV-1-infected cells, whereas the representative of noncanonical Wnt ligand, Wnt5a, which antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling, was overexpressed. HBZ was able to induce Wnt5a transcription by enhancing its promoter activity through the TGF-beta pathway. Importantly, knocking down of Wnt5a in ATL cells repressed cellular proliferation and migration. Our results implicate novel roles of HBZ in ATL leukemogenesis through dysregulation of both the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.","['Ma, G', 'Yasunaga, J', 'Fan, J', 'Yanagawa, S', 'Matsuoka, M']","['Ma G', 'Yasunaga J', 'Fan J', 'Yanagawa S', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Wnt-5a Protein']",2012/10/10 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2012/10/10 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012450 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.450 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Sep 5;32(36):4222-30. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.450.

We investigated the 2p gain and its relationship with common prognostic biomarkers in a prospective series of 69 clinical monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (cMBL) and 218 early stage (Binet A) CLL patients. The 2p gain was detected by FISH in 17 patients (6%, 16 CLL, and 1 cMBL) and further characterized by single nucleotide polymorphism-array. Overall, unfavorable cytogenetic deletions, i.e., del(11)(q23) and del(17)(p13) (P = 0.002), were significantly more frequent in 2p gain cases, as well as unmutated status of IGHV (P < 1 x 10(-4) ) and CD38 (P < 1 x 10(-4) ) and ZAP-70 positive expression (P = 0.003). Furthermore, 2p gain patients had significantly higher utilization of stereotyped B-cell receptors compared with 2p negative patients (P = 0.009), and the incidence of stereotyped subset #1 in 2p gain patients was significantly higher than that found in the remaining CLLs (P = 0.031). Transcriptional profiling analysis identified several genes significantly upregulated in 2p gain CLLs, most of which mapped to 2p. Among these, NCOA1 and ROCK2 are known for their involvement in tumor progression in several human cancers, whereas among those located in different chromosomes, CAV1 at 7q31.1 has been recently identified to play a critical role in CLL progression. Thus, 2p gain can be present since the early stages of the disease, particularly in those cases characterized by other poor prognosis markers. The finding of genes upregulated in the cells with 2p gain provides new insights to define the pathogenic role of this lesion.","['Fabris, Sonia', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Ciceri, Gabriella', 'Barbieri, Marzia', 'Maura, Francesco', 'Matis, Serena', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Anna Pesce, Emanuela', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Brugiatelli, Maura', 'Ilariucci, Fiorella', 'Lipari, Maria Grazia', 'Angrilli, Francesco', 'Consoli, Ugo', 'Fragasso, Alberto', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Festini, Gianluca', 'Vincelli, Iolanda', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Federico, Massimo', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Fabris S', 'Mosca L', 'Cutrona G', 'Lionetti M', 'Agnelli L', 'Ciceri G', 'Barbieri M', 'Maura F', 'Matis S', 'Colombo M', 'Gentile M', 'Recchia AG', 'Anna Pesce E', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Musolino C', 'Gobbi M', 'Di Renzo N', 'Mauro FR', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Ilariucci F', 'Lipari MG', 'Angrilli F', 'Consoli U', 'Fragasso A', 'Molica S', 'Festini G', 'Vincelli I', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Federico M', 'Morabito F', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e di Comunita, Universita degli Studi di Milano e Ematologia 1 CTMO, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2012/10/10 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/10/10 06:00'],"['2012/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23340 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Jan;88(1):24-31. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23340.

IGH@ translocations were identified in 87% of pPCL cases, with prevalence of t(11;14) (40%) and t(14;16) (30.5%), whereas the most frequent numerical alterations involved 1p (38%), 1q (48%), 6q (29%), 8p (42%), 13q (74%), 14q (71%), 16q (53%), and 17p (35%).

Mutations of TP53 were identified in four cases, all but one associated with a monoallelic deletion of the gene, whereas activating mutations of the BRAF oncogene occurred in one case and were absent in N- and K-RAS. To evaluate the influence of allelic imbalances in transcriptional expression we performed an integrated genomic analysis with GEP data, showing a significant dosage effect of genes involved in transcription, translation, methyltransferase activity, apoptosis as well as Wnt and NF-kB signaling pathways.

Furthermore, the activity profile of ponatinib and DCC-2036 against a panel of 24 clinically relevant BCR/ABL mutants is presented and compared to the other TKIs. The IC50 values for each TKI against the mutants and the IC50 increase over wild type BCR/ABL (relative resistance, RR) were calculated to define four resistance levels: sensitive (RR </= 2), moderately resistant (2 < RR </= 4), resistant (4 < RR </= 10), or highly resistant (RR > 10). L248R and T315V showed high resistance to imatinib, bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, intermediate resistance to ponatinib, but were sensitive to DCC-2036. Interestingly, F317R showed a moderate resistance to imatinib and nilotinib, but is resistant/highly resistant to dasatinib, bosutinib, ponatinib, and DCC-2036.

E2A-PBX1 can promote cell transformation both in vitro and in vivo; however, the mechanisms by which E2A-PBX1 contributes to malignancy merit further investigation. In the current work we report, for the first time, a physical and functional interaction between the SPT3-TAFII31-GCN5L acetylase (STAGA) complex and E2A-PBX1. STAGA, and its acetyltransferase subunit GCN5, directly interacted with the E2A portion of E2A-PBX1. GCN5 acetylated E2A-PBX1 and increased the stability of E2A-PBX1 protein in cells. Moreover, the GCN5 inhibitor alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone 3 (MB-3) decreased E2A-PBX1 acetylation and E2A-PBX1 protein levels in leukemic cells, indicating that GCN5 inhibitors have potential value as therapeutic agents for ALL. In addition, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 potentiates the degradation of E2A-PBX1. We suggest that dynamic regulation of E2A-PBX1 protein levels in vivo has a fundamental role in ALL.","['Holmlund, T', 'Lindberg, M J', 'Grander, D', 'Wallberg, A E']","['Holmlund T', 'Lindberg MJ', 'Grander D', 'Wallberg AE']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Propiophenones)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '42207-96-5 (MB 3)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Propiophenones/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/10 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/10 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012265 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.265 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):578-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.265.

DATA SOURCES: The data in this article were collected from PubMed and CHKD database with relevant English and Chinese articles published from 1957 to 2011, with key words including acute promyelocytic leukemia, arsenic trioxide, treatment, and mechanism. STUDY SELECTION: Articles including any information about ATO in the treatment of APL were selected. RESULTS: APL is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia, with dismal prognosis under treatment with traditional chemotherapy. ATO impressively increases the complete remission rate and prolongs survival of patients with APL, with only mild and transient adverse effects. The advances in the understanding of multiple mechanisms involved in ATO treatment will benefit more cancers in future. CONCLUSION: Deeper understanding of mechanisms involved in ATO treatment may provide rationales for future clinical applications in a number of human malignancies.","['Zhou, Jin']",['Zhou J'],"['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China. zhoujin1111@126.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Oxides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2012/10/10 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/10/10 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2012 Oct;125(19):3556-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that MSC infusions early after haplo-HSCT prevent GVHD in a haploidentical-HSCT mouse model. Now, we investigated the impact that MSCs' immunosuppressive properties have on the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. First, to mimic a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) relapse after a haploidentical HSCT, lethally irradiated mice were coinfused with haploidentical donor bone marrow cells plus syngenic hematopoietic progenitors transduced with a retroviral vector encoding both the BCR/ABL oncogene and the DeltaNGFR marker gene. As expected, a CML-like myeloproliferative syndrome developed in all the recipient animals. The addition of haploidentical splenocytes to the transplanted graft prevented CML development by a GVL effect, and all transplanted recipients died of GVHD. This GVL mouse model allowed us to investigate the impact of MSCs infused to prevent GVHD on days 0, 7, and 14 after HSCT, on the GVL effect, expecting an increase in leukemic relapse. Strikingly, a high mortality of the recipients was observed, caused by GVHD, and only few leukemic cells were detected in the recipient animals. In contrast, GVHD prevention by MSCs in the absence of BCR/ABL leukemic cells resulted in a significant survival of the recipients. In vitro data pointed to an inability of MSCs to control strong CTLs responses against BCR/ABL. Our results show that, although an evident increase in leukemic relapses induced by MSCs could not be detected, they showed a reduced efficacy in preventing GVHD that precluded us to draw clear conclusions on MSCs' impact over GVL effect.","['Oviedo, Alberto', 'Yanez, Rosa', 'Colmenero, Isabel', 'Aldea, Montserrat', 'Rubio, Antonio', 'Bueren, Juan Antonio', 'Lamana, Maria Luisa']","['Oviedo A', 'Yanez R', 'Colmenero I', 'Aldea M', 'Rubio A', 'Bueren JA', 'Lamana ML']","['Hematopoiesis and Gene Therapy Division, Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas Medioambientales y Tecnologicas (CIEMAT), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Haploidy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Leukemia/blood/*therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recurrence', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/10 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2012/10/10 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ct0557oviedo [pii]', '10.3727/096368912X657666 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2013;22(8):1381-94. doi: 10.3727/096368912X657666.

Herein, we used the side population (SP) phenomenon to enrich for these progenitors, which made up to 0.01-0.64% of the total cell count. Microarray analysis revealed an expression profile of SP cells, which clearly differed from that of non-SP cells. However, a promising adrenal specific stem cell marker could not be identified. In vitro, SP cells could be maintained in long-term culture, whereas non-SP cells did not proliferate. After 4 weeks of culturing, immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of steroidogenic enzymes such as 3beta-HSD, StAR, and P450SCC, suggesting spontaneous differentiation. Interestingly, the quantity of SP cells was significantly diminished in Pbx1 haploinsufficient mice, suggesting a stem cell deficit. By contrast, the subcapsular zone of ACTH-deficient Tpit(-/-) mice was significantly wider compared with wild-type adrenals (Tpit(-/-) 259+/-10.7 vs Tpit(+/-) 100+/-12.3%; P<0.01). Accordingly, the number of SP cells in these mice was significantly higher (Tpit(-/-) 0.45+/-0.16 vs Tpit(+/-) 0.13+/-0.04%; P<0.004). ACTH treatment of these animals reverted the subcapsular zone width and the SP fraction back to normal (130+/-10.2%; P=0.33 and 0.09%), providing indirect evidence for a stem cell 'arrest' in Tpit(-/-) mice and the role of ACTH in adrenocortical stem cell modulation and differentiation.","['Lichtenauer, Urs', 'Shapiro, Igor', 'Sackmann, Simone', 'Drouin, Jacques', 'Scheele, Jurgen', 'Maneck, Matthias', 'Klein, Christoph', 'Beuschlein, Felix']","['Lichtenauer U', 'Shapiro I', 'Sackmann S', 'Drouin J', 'Scheele J', 'Maneck M', 'Klein C', 'Beuschlein F']","['Endocrine Research Unit, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Ziemssenstrasse 1, D-80336 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Tbx19 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex/*cytology', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JOE-12-0393 [pii]', '10.1530/JOE-12-0393 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2012 Dec;215(3):383-91. doi: 10.1530/JOE-12-0393.

Prolonged exposure to high-dose glucocorticoids may cause insulin resistance and facilitate development of this phenotype. PROCEDURE: Body mass indices (BMI) and insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment [HOMA]-IR) were prospectively measured among on- (n = 31) and off-therapy participants (n = 29). On-therapy participants were assessed prior to and while on glucocorticoids (5 days of prednisone 40 mg m(-2) or dexamethasone 6 mg m(-2)) given as part of routine maintenance chemotherapy, with a subset (n = 10) receiving an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) while on glucocorticoids. RESULTS: Baseline HOMA-IR values among on- and off-therapy participants were similar, but among on-therapy participants, HOMA-IR increased significantly with glucocorticoid exposure (median 3.39 vs. 1.26; P < 0.01) with 45.2% of participants having values >4.39 (upper 2.5th percentile among normal weight adolescents). Although baseline HOMA-IR was significantly correlated with current BMI (r = 0.48, P < 0.01), change in HOMA-IR following steroid exposure was not correlated with any demographic or treatment characteristic including current BMI. Among those with IVGTT data, HOMA estimates in general correlated with values derived from a minimal model analysis (r ~ 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose glucocorticoids given as part of routine chemotherapy were associated with a significantly increased insulin resistant state. Given the amount and duration of glucocorticoids children with ALL experience, these physiologic changes could be an important contributor to the development of therapy-related obesity.","['Chow, Eric J', 'Pihoker, Catherine', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'McCune, Jeannine S', 'Wharton, Claire', 'Roth, Christian L', 'Baker, K Scott']","['Chow EJ', 'Pihoker C', 'Friedman DL', 'Lee SJ', 'McCune JS', 'Wharton C', 'Roth CL', 'Baker KS']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. ericchow@u.washington.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hyperinsulinism/*chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/04/19 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24364 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Apr;60(4):621-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24364.

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 90 recipients who received HSCT between 2007 and 2011 in our institution, and evaluated the predictive value of the baseline serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels just before the initiation of conditioning for transplant-related complications after allogeneic HSCT. A receiver-operating characteristic curve revealed that the baseline serum CRP levels had an excellent predictive value for non-relapse mortality (NRM), with an area under the curve of 0.83. The sensitivity and specificity for NRM were 80% and 87%, respectively, with a cutoff of 0.6 mg/dL. With this cutoff value, multivariate analyses revealed that a higher baseline CRP level was an independent risk factor for NRM (HR 6.21, P<0.01), grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR 3.91, P=0.03) and poor overall survival (HR 3.27, P=0.0018).

The control group consisted of 22 healthy children. Serum concentrations of TAS, glucose, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen and insulin were measured. In cancer survivors, independently of diagnosis and kind of treatment (radiotherapy anthracyclines administration),the mean serum TAS did not differ significantly from the control group. No correlations were observed with age at the time of diagnosis or interval after the end of treatment. TAS values did not correlate with traits of the metabolic syndrome. In a group of eight patients with ALL at diagnosis and after induction of remission,TAS values were lower than in the control and cancer survivor groups. Antioxidant status was not found to be deteriorated in children after anticancer treatment, irrespective of diagnosis or kind of treatment, which might indicate sufficient antioxidant prevention. However, the possibility of the development of MS and cardiovascular disease in adulthood indicates the need for future studies.","['Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Panasiuk, Anna', 'Czygier, Malgorzata', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Wysocka, Jolanta', 'Szmitkowski, Maciej']","['Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Panasiuk A', 'Czygier M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Wysocka J', 'Szmitkowski M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland. rybak@umwb.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,['0 (Antioxidants)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/therapy', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['VM/OJS/J/19759 [pii]', '10.5603/19759 [doi]']",epublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2012 Oct 8;50(3):468-72. doi: 10.5603/19759.,10.5603/19759 [doi],20121008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phytanic acid, a saturated fatty acid obtained primarily through the consumption of ruminant meat and dairy products, may offer a potential underlying mechanism for these associations. In a population-based case-control study of 336 cases and 460 controls conducted in Nebraska during 1999-2002, we examined whether phytanic acid-containing foods or total phytanic acid intake, estimated from a food frequency questionnaire and the published phytanic acid values of 151 food items, were associated with increased NHL risk. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for overall NHL and the common NHL histologic subtypes. In multivariable models, higher intakes of density-adjusted beef [OR(T3 vs. T1) = 1.5 (1.1-2.2); P(trend) = 0.02], total dairy products [OR = 1.5 (1.1-2.2); P(trend) = 0.02) and milk [OR = 1.6 (1.1-2.3); P(trend) = 0.01] were associated with an increased risk of NHL. Intake of total phytanic acid was positively associated with NHL risk [OR = 1.5 (1.0-2.1); P(trend) = 0.04]. In analyses stratified by NHL subtype, greater consumption of beef was associated with an increased risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and greater consumption of milk was associated with an increased risk of follicular lymphoma (FL). Total phytanic acid intake was associated with an increased risk of FL and small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our results provide support that total phytanic acid and phytanic acid-containing foods may increase NHL risk.","['Ollberding, Nicholas J', 'Aschebrook-Kilfoy, Briseis', 'Caces, Donne Bennett D', 'Wright, Margaret E', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Smith, Sonali M', 'Chiu, Brian C-H']","['Ollberding NJ', 'Aschebrook-Kilfoy B', 'Caces DB', 'Wright ME', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Smith SM', 'Chiu BC']","['Department of Health Studies, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. nollberding@uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['14721-66-5 (Phytanic Acid)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diet Records', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced', 'Meat Products/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Nebraska', 'Phytanic Acid/administration & dosage/analysis/*toxicity', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs315 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs315 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Jan;34(1):170-5. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs315.

Several studies have been performed to minimize the toxicity of HSCT in children without impairing the efficacy. We report our long-term results of HSCT in pediatric AML patients using non-total body irradiation conditioning regimen. PROCEDURE: From May 1991 to June 2010, 133 pediatric patients with AML (age<15 y) who were referred to our institute underwent autologous (auto-) or allogeneic (allo-) HSCT. The conditioning regimen consisted of oral busulfan plus etoposide in auto-HSCT patients and oral busulfan plus cyclophosphamide in allo-HSCT patients. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), probability of relapse, and transplantation-related mortality at 3 years were 67.6%, 62.2.5%, 27.3%, and 10.1%, respectively. There was no significant difference between allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT groups. In multivariable analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression model, male sex was associated with significantly improved OS (P<0.001) and LFS (P=0.022). An age </=3 years was associated with higher relapse (P=0.034) and worse OS (P=0.001) and LFS (P=0.014).

RESULTS: Thirteen patients were diagnosed with PTCL during the 10-year period. All presented with advanced disease. According to the WHO PTCL classification, 7 patients had PTCL not otherwise specified, 3 had hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and 3 had T-cell posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Six of the patients had previously received or were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the time of their diagnosis. Patients were treated with various chemotherapeutic regimens, including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like therapy. Patients who had refractory or recurrent disease were changed to alternative therapy. Eight patients underwent stem cell transplantation, 7 allogeneic and 1 autologous. Of the 13 patients, 7 died.

Relative to control diet, dietary resveratrol did not delay the engraftment of the leukemia cells. To determine if dietary resveratrol could increase efficacy of a chemotherapeutic agent, vincristine was injected intraperitoneally into leukemic mice fed the control or supplemented diet. Survival curves and monitoring the percentage of human leukemia cells in peripheral blood showed that resveratrol did not inhibit leukemia cell growth or influence the activity of vincristine. Mass spectrometric analysis of mouse serum revealed that the majority of resveratrol was present as glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites. These data do not support the concept that dietary resveratrol has potential as a preventative agent against the growth of high-risk t(4;11) ALL.","['Zunino, Susan J', 'Storms, David H', 'Newman, John W', 'Pedersen, Theresa L', 'Keen, Carl L', 'Ducore, Jonathan M']","['Zunino SJ', 'Storms DH', 'Newman JW', 'Pedersen TL', 'Keen CL', 'Ducore JM']","['United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Western Human Nutrition Research Center, Davis, CA 95616, USA. susan.zunino@ars.usda.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Glucuronides)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Sulfates)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Glucuronides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diet therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1650 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Dec;41(6):2207-12. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1650.

The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic implicated in matrix remodeling, on dermal and lung fibroblasts obtained from SSc patients. Dermal and lung fibroblasts from SSc patients and healthy subjects were treated with ciprofloxacin. Western blotting was used to analyze protein levels and RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression. The pharmacologic inhibitor UO126 was used to block Erk1/2 signaling. SSc dermal fibroblasts demonstrated a significant decrease in collagen type I mRNA and protein levels after antibiotic treatment, while healthy dermal fibroblasts were less sensitive to ciprofloxacin, downregulating collagen only at the protein levels. Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) gene expression was significantly reduced and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) levels were enhanced after ciprofloxacin treatment to a similar extent in healthy and SSc fibroblasts. Ciprofloxacin induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation, and Erk1/2 blockade completely prevented MMP1 upregulation. However, Smad1 and Smad3 activation in response to TGFbeta was not affected. The expression of friend leukemia integration factor 1 (Fli1), a transcriptional repressor of collagen, was increased after treatment with ciprofloxacin only in SSc fibroblasts, and this was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1). Similar effects were observed in SSc-interstitial lung disease (ILD) lung fibroblasts. In summary, our study demonstrates that ciprofloxacin has antifibrotic actions in SSc dermal and lung fibroblasts via the downregulation of Dnmt1, the upregulation of Fli1 and induction of MMP1 gene expression via an Erk1/2-dependent mechanism. Thus, our data suggest that ciprofloxacin may be an attractive therapy for SSc skin and lung fibrosis.","['Bujor, Andreea M', 'Haines, Paul', 'Padilla, Cristina', 'Christmann, Romy B', 'Junie, Monica', 'Sampaio-Barros, Percival D', 'Lafyatis, Robert', 'Trojanowska, Maria']","['Bujor AM', 'Haines P', 'Padilla C', 'Christmann RB', 'Junie M', 'Sampaio-Barros PD', 'Lafyatis R', 'Trojanowska M']","['Arthritis Center, Rheumatology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA. andabujor@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Matrilin Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (TSP5 protein, human)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.7 (MMP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.7 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1)']",IM,"['Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciprofloxacin/*pharmacology', 'Collagen Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Matrilin Proteins', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2012.1150 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2012 Dec;30(6):1473-80. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2012.1150.

An internationally harmonised four-colour (CLR) flow cytometry MRD assay is widely used but has limitations. The aim of this study was to improve MRD analysis by identifying situations where a less time-consuming CD19/CD5/kappa/lambda analysis would be sufficient for detecting residual CLL, and develop a six-CLR antibody panel that is more efficient for cases requiring full MRD analysis. In 784 samples from CLL patients after treatment, it was possible to determine CD19/CD5/kappa/lambda thresholds that identified cases with detectable MRD with 100% positive predictive value (PPV). However, CD19/CD5/kappa/lambda analysis was unsuitable for predicting iwCLL/NCI response status or identifying cases with no detectable MRD. For the latter cases requiring a full MRD assessment, a six-CLR assay was designed comprising CD19/CD5/CD20 with (1) CD3/CD38/CD79b and (2) CD81/CD22/CD43. There was good correlation between four-CLR and six-CLR panels in dilution studies and clinical samples, with 100% concordance for detection of residual disease at the 0.01% (10(-4)) level (n=59) and good linearity even at the 0.001-0.01% (10(-5)-10(-4)) level. A six-CLR panel therefore provides equivalent results to the four-CLR panel but it requires fewer reagents, fewer cells and a much simpler analysis approach.","['Rawstron, A C', 'Bottcher, S', 'Letestu, R', 'Villamor, N', 'Fazi, C', 'Kartsios, H', 'de Tute, R M', 'Shingles, J', 'Ritgen, M', 'Moreno, C', 'Lin, K', 'Pettitt, A R', 'Kneba, M', 'Montserrat, E', 'Cymbalista, F', 'Hallek, M', 'Hillmen, P', 'Ghia, P']","['Rawstron AC', 'Bottcher S', 'Letestu R', 'Villamor N', 'Fazi C', 'Kartsios H', 'de Tute RM', 'Shingles J', 'Ritgen M', 'Moreno C', 'Lin K', 'Pettitt AR', 'Kneba M', 'Montserrat E', 'Cymbalista F', 'Hallek M', 'Hillmen P', 'Ghia P']","[""HMDS, St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, UK. andy.rawstron@hmds.org.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Europe', 'Flow Cytometry/*standards', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012216 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.216 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jan;27(1):142-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.216.

For several decades, this possibility was hampered by the inefficient and/or short-term engrafment of CLL cells into available animals. The development of new generations of immunocompromised mice has allowed to partially overcome these constraints. Novel humanized animal models have been created that allow to recapitulate the pathogenesis of the disease and the complex in vivo relationships between leukemic cells and the microenvironment. In this review we discuss the development of xenograft models of CLL, how they may help elucidating the mechanisms that account for the natural history of the disease and facilitating the design of novel therapeutic approaches.","['Bertilaccio, M T S', 'Scielzo, C', 'Simonetti, G', 'Ten Hacken, E', 'Apollonio, B', 'Ghia, P', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Bertilaccio MT', 'Scielzo C', 'Simonetti G', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Apollonio B', 'Ghia P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012268 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.268 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):534-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.268.

Although 1200 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) is the standard conditioning regimen, attempts to reduce relapse have led to the addition of a second chemotherapeutic agent and/or higher dose of TBI. We examined HSCT outcomes in patients age <18 years with ALL, in second or subsequent remission or in relapse at transplantation. Most transplantations were performed with the patient in remission. Patients received grafts from an HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor. Four treatment groups were created: (1) Cy + TBI </= 1200 cGy (n = 304), (2) Cy + etoposide + TBI </= 1200 cGy (n = 108), (3) Cy + TBI >/= 1300 cGy (n = 327), and (4) Cy + etoposide + TBI >/= 1300 cGy (n = 26). Neither TBI > 1200 cGy nor the addition of etoposide resulted in fewer relapses. The 5-year probability of relapse was 30% for group 1, 28% for group 2, 35% for group 3, and 31% for group 4. However, transplantation-related mortality was higher (35% versus 25%, P = .02) and overall survival lower (36% versus 48%, P = .03) in group 4 compared with group 3.

However, limited data exist regarding the role of FLIPI in the era of routine first-line rituximab (R) and R-chemotherapy regimens and in the setting of community oncology practices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the outcome data from the National LymphoCare Study (NLCS), a prospective, observational cohort study, which collects data on patients with FL in the United States (US) community practices. RESULTS: Among 1068 male and 1124 female patients with FLIPI data, most were treated in US community practices (79%); 35% were FLIPI good risk, 30% intermediate risk, and 35% poor risk. FLIPI risk groups were significant predictors of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients who undergo watchful waiting (WW), and those who receive non-R-containing regimens, R-alone, and R-chemotherapy combinations. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of contemporary practice with routine R use, stratifying patients into good, intermediate, and poor FLIPI risk groups predicts distinct outcomes in terms of OS and PFS. FLIPI remains an important prognostic index in the R era and should be used in clinical practices to support discussions about prognosis.","['Nooka, A K', 'Nabhan, C', 'Zhou, X', 'Taylor, M D', 'Byrtek, M', 'Miller, T P', 'Friedberg, J W', 'Zelenetz, A D', 'Link, B K', 'Cerhan, J R', 'Dillon, H', 'Sinha, R', 'Shenoy, P J', 'Levy, D', 'Dawson, K', 'Hirata, J H', 'Flowers, C R']","['Nooka AK', 'Nabhan C', 'Zhou X', 'Taylor MD', 'Byrtek M', 'Miller TP', 'Friedberg JW', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Link BK', 'Cerhan JR', 'Dillon H', 'Sinha R', 'Shenoy PJ', 'Levy D', 'Dawson K', 'Hirata JH', 'Flowers CR']","['Winship Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Emory University-School of Medicine, Atlanta.

Here we profile chromatin state maps, transcription factor occupancy, and gene expression profiles during human erythroid development at fetal and adult stages. Comparative analyses of human erythropoiesis identify developmental stage-specific enhancers as primary determinants of stage-specific gene expression programs. We find that erythroid master regulators GATA1 and TAL1 act cooperatively within active enhancers but confer little predictive value for stage specificity. Instead, a set of stage-specific coregulators collaborates with master regulators and contributes to differential gene expression. We further identify and validate IRF2, IRF6, and MYB as effectors of an adult-stage expression program. Thus, the combinatorial assembly of lineage-specific master regulators and transcriptional coregulators within developmental stage-specific enhancers determines gene expression programs and temporal regulation of transcriptional networks in a mammalian genome.","['Xu, Jian', 'Shao, Zhen', 'Glass, Kimberly', 'Bauer, Daniel E', 'Pinello, Luca', 'Van Handel, Ben', 'Hou, Serena', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, John A', 'Mikkola, Hanna K A', 'Yuan, Guo-Cheng', 'Orkin, Stuart H']","['Xu J', 'Shao Z', 'Glass K', 'Bauer DE', 'Pinello L', 'Van Handel B', 'Hou S', 'Stamatoyannopoulos JA', 'Mikkola HK', 'Yuan GC', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston and Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Cell,Developmental cell,101120028,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (IRF6 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2/metabolism', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1534-5807(12)00414-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.devcel.2012.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Cell. 2012 Oct 16;23(4):796-811. doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2012.09.003.

Dovitinib is a benzimidazole-quinolinone compound that structurally resembles the bisbenzimidazole minor groove binding dye Hoechst 33258. Dovitinib bound to DNA as shown by its ability to increase the DNA melting temperature and by increases in its fluorescence spectrum that occurred upon the addition of DNA. Molecular modeling studies of the docking of dovitinib into an X-ray structure of a Hoechst 33258-DNA complex showed that dovitinib could reasonably be accommodated in the DNA minor groove. Because DNA binders are often topoisomerase I (EC 5.99.1.2) and topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitors, the ability of dovitinib to inhibit these DNA processing enzymes was also investigated. Dovitinib inhibited the catalytic decatenation activity of topoisomerase IIalpha. It also inhibited the DNA-independent ATPase activity of yeast topoisomerase II which suggested that it interacted with the ATP binding site. Using isolated human topoisomerase IIalpha, dovitinib stabilized the enzyme-cleavage complex and acted as a topoisomerase IIalpha poison. Dovitinib was also found to be a cellular topoisomerase II poison in human leukemia K562 cells and induced double-strand DNA breaks in K562 cells as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of H2AX. Finally, dovitinib inhibited the topoisomerase I-catalyzed relaxation of plasmid DNA and acted as a cellular topoisomerase I poison. In conclusion, the cell growth inhibitory activity and the anticancer activity of dovitinib may result not only from its ability to inhibit multiple kinases, but also, in part, from its ability to target topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II.","['Hasinoff, Brian B', 'Wu, Xing', 'Nitiss, John L', 'Kanagasabai, Ragu', 'Yalowich, Jack C']","['Hasinoff BB', 'Wu X', 'Nitiss JL', 'Kanagasabai R', 'Yalowich JC']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Apotex Centre, University of Manitoba, 750 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3E 0T5, Canada.

We here demonstrate that 2-10 mM 2-DG cooperates with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and other antitumor drugs to induce apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Using ATO and HL60 as drug and cell models, respectively, we observed that 2-DG/ATO combination activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by Bid-, and Bax-regulated cytochrome c and Omi/HtrA2 release, XIAP down-regulation, and caspase-9/-3 pathway activation. 2-DG neither causes oxidative stress nor increases ATO uptake, but causes inner mitochondria membrane permeabilization as well as moderate ATP depletion, which nevertheless do not satisfactorily explain the pro-apoptotic response. Surprisingly 2-DG causes cell line-specific decrease in LKB-1/AMPK phosphorylation/activation, and also causes Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and MEK/ERK activation, which is prevented by co-treatment with ATO. The use of kinase-specific pharmacologic inhibitors and/or siRNAs reveals that apoptosis is facilitated by AMPK inactivation and restrained by Akt and ERK activation, and that Akt and ERK activation mediates AMPK inhibition. Finally, 2-DG stimulates IGF-1R phosphorylation/activation, and co-treatment with IGF-1R inhibitor prevents 2-DG effects on Akt, ERK and AMPK, and facilitates 2-DG-provoked apoptosis. In summary 2-DG elicits IGF-1R-mediated AMPK inactivation and Akt and ERK activation, which facilitates or restrain apoptosis, respectively. 2-DG-provoked AMPK inactivation increases the apoptotic efficacy of ATO, while in turn ATO-provoked Akt and ERK inactivation may increase the efficacy of 2-DG as anti-tumor drug.","['Estan, Maria Cristina', 'Calvino, Eva', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Boyano-Adanez, Maria del Carmen', 'Mena, Maria Luz', 'Gomez-Gomez, Milagros', 'Rial, Eduardo', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Estan MC', 'Calvino E', 'de Blas E', 'Boyano-Adanez Mdel C', 'Mena ML', 'Gomez-Gomez M', 'Rial E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain. mcri.estan@cib.csic.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxyglucose/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00653-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Dec 15;84(12):1604-16. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.022.

Here we describe a technique to quantify protein kinase activity in a global fashion and without preconception of the kinases that may be active in the cell or tissue under investigation. In Global Kinase Activity Profiling (GKAP), protein kinases present in experimental cell lysates phosphorylate endogenous substrates, also present in the lysate, under defined conditions. Reaction products are then quantified using standard phosphoproteomic techniques based on LC-MS/MS. The technique thus allows measuring the combined activities of kinases targeting common substrates, which are detected as phosphopeptides by LC-MS/MS. Almost four hundred kinase reactions could be quantified in a human epithelial cell line, 177 of which increased in response to EGF treatment while others decreased in cells exposed to the kinase inhibitors LY294002 or U0126. GKAP also detected marked differences in the patterns of kinase activities in human leukemia cell lines with different sensitivities to kinase inhibitors. These results reveal that GKAP detects and quantifies hundreds of kinase activities modulated by growth factors or pharmacological inhibitors, and that these activities correlate with the phenotypes of cancer cells and their responses to kinase inhibitors.","['Beltran, Luisa', 'Casado, Pedro', 'Rodriguez-Prados, Juan-Carlos', 'Cutillas, Pedro R']","['Beltran L', 'Casado P', 'Rodriguez-Prados JC', 'Cutillas PR']","['Analytical Signaling Group, Centre for Cell Signaling, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (U 0126)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteome/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(12)00673-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2012.09.029 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2012 Dec 21;77:492-503. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.09.029.

METHODS: We investigated a 3-month outbreak of Bcc bacteremia among hospitalized hematology patients. Environmental investigation and infection control measures were implemented. A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted to identify risk factors. RESULTS: Bcc was repeatedly isolated from the blood of 9 patients without central venous catheter who did not easily respond to targeted antibiotic treatment and 3 died of the infection. A point source was not identified and horizontal spread was suspected. Strict infection control measures terminated the outbreak. Interestingly, diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia but not neutropenia or prior chemotherapy was a risk factor for infection acquisition. Neutropenia was positively correlated with infection duration. CONCLUSIONS: Bcc is not only a serious threat among immunocompromized hematology patients, but is also transmissible in clinical settings. Acute myeloid leukemia appears to confer additional risk for infection acquisition.","['Vardi, Anna', 'Sirigou, Antonia', 'Lalayanni, Chrysavgi', 'Kachrimanidou, Melina', 'Kaloyannidis, Panayiotis', 'Saloum, Riad', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Sotiropoulos, Damianos']","['Vardi A', 'Sirigou A', 'Lalayanni C', 'Kachrimanidou M', 'Kaloyannidis P', 'Saloum R', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Sotiropoulos D']","['Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Unit, G.

In vitro, HB22.7-SAP effectively bound to CD22 on the surface of pre-B ALL cell lines and exhibited potent and specific cytotoxicity. In a NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model of pre-B ALL, when compared to the vehicle-treated control, HB22.7-SAP increased the median survival time from 20 days to over 50 days without significant toxicity.","['Kato, Jason', 'Satake, Noriko', ""O'Donnell, Robert T"", 'Abuhay, Mastewal', 'Lewis, Carly', 'Tuscano, Joseph M']","['Kato J', 'Satake N', ""O'Donnell RT"", 'Abuhay M', 'Lewis C', 'Tuscano JM']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, Davis, Cancer Center, Sacramento, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1/*therapeutic use', 'Saporins', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00383-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jan;37(1):83-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.09.010.

We analyzed the intersection between genome localization and transcriptome data sets to identify genes repressed by Tcf3. Among these, manipulations of Esrrb gave distinctive phenotypes in functional assays. Knockdown and knockout eliminated response to Gsk3 inhibition, causing extinction of pluripotency markers and loss of colony forming capability. Conversely, forced expression phenocopied Gsk3 inhibition or Tcf3 deletion by suppressing differentiation and sustaining self-renewal. Thus the nuclear receptor Esrrb is necessary and sufficient to mediate self-renewal downstream of Gsk3 inhibition. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) regulates ESCs through Stat3, independently of Gsk3 inhibition. Consistent with parallel operation, ESCs in LIF accommodated Esrrb deletion and remained pluripotent. These findings highlight a key role for Esrrb in regulating the naive pluripotent state and illustrate compensation among the core pluripotency factors.","['Martello, Graziano', 'Sugimoto, Toshimi', 'Diamanti, Evangelia', 'Joshi, Anagha', 'Hannah, Rebecca', 'Ohtsuka, Satoshi', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Niwa, Hitoshi', 'Smith, Austin']","['Martello G', 'Sugimoto T', 'Diamanti E', 'Joshi A', 'Hannah R', 'Ohtsuka S', 'Gottgens B', 'Niwa H', 'Smith A']","['Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Esrrb protein, mouse)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Genome', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2011/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(12)00370-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2012.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Oct 5;11(4):491-504. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.06.008.,10.1016/j.stem.2012.06.008 [doi] S1934-5909(12)00370-0 [pii],,"['G1100526/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/H531527/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', '079249/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0900729/1/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of', 'Animals in Research/United Kingdom', 'G0800784/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '12765/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100140/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,PMC3465555,['Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Oct 5;11(4):441-2.

Importantly, tumors that lack this enzyme have been shown to be more sensitive to inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis (6-thioguanine, methotrexate). BACKGROUND: T-cell lymphomas, in particular peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), have only limited and noncurative treatment options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report here that a high percentage of PTCL, AITL, and ALCL lack the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), as do T-cell leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. MTAP-deficient cells cannot cleave endogenous methylthioadenosine to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, a precursor of methionine, and as a result have enhanced sensitivity to inhibitors of de novo purine biosynthesis. A recently introduced antifolate, pralatrexate, which has been shown to inhibit de novo purine biosynthesis, has been approved for treatment of PTCL and may have an increasing role in therapy. An alternative strategy involving coadministration of methylthioadenosine and high-dose 6-thioguanine has been proposed and may prove to be selectively toxic to MTAP-deficient uncommon lymphomas. CONCLUSION: Thus the consequences of MTAP deficiency suggest that new therapeutic interventions for T-cell lymphoma may be feasible.","['Bertino, Joseph R', 'Lubin, Martin', 'Johnson-Farley, Nadine', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Goodell, Lauri', 'Bhagavathi, Sharathkumar']","['Bertino JR', 'Lubin M', 'Johnson-Farley N', 'Chan WC', 'Goodell L', 'Bhagavathi S']","['Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 18901, USA. bertinoj@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)']",IM,"['Adenine/metabolism', 'Aminopterin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/metabolism', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00130-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Oct;12(5):306-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.07.001.,10.1016/j.clml.2012.07.001 [doi] S2152-2650(12)00130-9 [pii],,['P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In total we have detected nine mutations, which have not been previously described by others. Eight of them were found in NOTCH1 and one in BCL11B gene. Observed frequencies of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 are in line with previous reports, thus confirming postulated participation of these two genes in T-ALL pathomechanism.

Of the 21 cytokine investigated in 10 pairs of samples, only beta-NGF was absent in both colostrum and milk, while INF-alpha2, SCF and TNF-beta were present in colostrum but not in human milk. As a general rule, colostrum contained higher concentrations of cytokines and chemokines with respect to breast milk. The majority of cytokines, detected in colostrum alone or in colostrum and human milk (IL-1alpha, IL-2Ralpha, IL-3, IL-16, IL-18, GRO-alpha, HGF, IFN-alpha2, M-CSF, MIF, MIG, TNF-beta, SDF-1alpha, TRAIL) have been described in previous studies, while for the first time we describe the presence of additional cytokines either in colostrum alone (SCF) or in both colostrum and breast milk (CTAK/CCL27, MCP-3/CCL7, LIF).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression levels of some of the molecules involved in the signaling cascade originating from the BCR (Syk, Lyn, PLCgamma2, ERK) and analyze possible correlations of mRNA levels with biological/clinical features. Our study population consisted of 92 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CLL. Several genes of BCR signaling (Lyn, Syk, PLCgamma2 and ERK) and ZAP-70 were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The signaling molecules of BCR were strongly associated with each other, and ZAP-70 correlated well with Lyn, Syk, PLCgamma2 and ERK. Associations between treatment response and Lyn, Syk, PLCgamma2 and ERK were not found. Moreover, a higher level of Lyn mRNA was associated with a shorter treatment-free survival (TFS) (univariate analysis only; multivariate Cox analysis showed that only ZAP-70 and Binet stage were independent prognostic factors and associated with TFS). Though Lyn was not an independent prognostic factor, it still might be a new therapy target of CLL. BCR signaling provides perspectives for future development of an exciting new class of kinase inhibitors.","['Wang, Yin-Hua', 'Fan, Lei', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhang, Run', 'Zou, Zhi-Jian', 'Fang, Cheng', 'Zhang, Li-Na', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Xu, Wei']","['Wang YH', 'Fan L', 'Wang L', 'Zhang R', 'Zou ZJ', 'Fang C', 'Zhang LN', 'Li JY', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affi liated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Syk Kinase', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/09 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.736983 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jun;54(6):1165-70. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.736983.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Complex clinical, hematological and radionuclide studies were conducted in 63 patients divided into 3 groups: 1) 7 healthy volunteers (a control group); 2) 37 patients with AL; 3) 19 patients with LSA. RESULTS: Changes were found in the deposition of labeled DPs used to prevent and treat hemorrhagic syndrome in myelosuppressive TP in patients with AL or LSA. In AL, this function was established to be virtually completely suppressed whereas in LSA, some functional activity of mononuclear phagocytes was preserved. Different degrees of suppression of this function were probably related to the nature of these diseases and particularly due to varying degrees of leukemic infiltration of depot organs. A mechanism for increased consumption of transfused DP in profound TP, one of the causes of which is the myelosuppression as a result of programmed polychemotherapy, cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSION: By and large, the radionuclide labeling technique for DP may be useful in specifying a number of uncertain mechanisms for derangements of the thrombocytic component of hemostasis in oncohematologic diseases.","['Migunova, E V', 'Sagdieva, N Sh', 'Sakhibov, Ia D', 'Ryzhko, V V', 'Sorkina, O M', 'Gemdzhian, E G']","['Migunova EV', 'Sagdieva NSh', 'Sakhibov IaD', 'Ryzhko VV', 'Sorkina OM', 'Gemdzhian EG']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phagocytes/metabolism', 'Platelet Transfusion/*methods', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/09 06:00,2012/10/24 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2012;84(7):61-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on 356 patients after allo-HSCT (n = 237) and auto-HSCT (n = 119) from 2000 to 2010 were analyzed. The diagnosis of IM was established according to the EORTC/MSG 2008 criteria. RESULTS: The incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) was 19.1%; that was 23.2 and 10.9% in allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT recipients, respectively. The incidence of MI following allo-HSCT was significantly higher than that after auto-HSCT. Aspergillus spp. (82.3%), Candida spp. (11.8%), zygomycetes (Mucor spp., Rhizopus spp.) (4.4%), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1.5%) are involved in the etiology of MI. Its risk factors are acute lymphoblastic leukemia; non-myeloablative conditioning regimen; use of fludarabine and antilymphocyte globulin; peripheral blood stem cells as a source for grafting; long-term lymphopenia, neutropenia; use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); acute graft-versus-host reaction; grade 3-4 mucositis; infections, such as cytomegalovirus, sepsis. The development of MI in HSCT recipients did not significantly reduce one-year OS after allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT--53.6 and 55% and 86.7 and 90.3% (with and without MI, respectively). In patients with invasive aspergillosis, OS (12 weeks after IM being diagnosed) was significantly longer in those with other invasive mycoses (91.3 and 50%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The incidence of MI after allo-HSCT was higher than that after auto-HSCT. MI induced by the fungal genus Aspergillus spp. was most common. Along with known risk factors, there was a poor prognostic factor, such as G-CSF. The development of MI failed to affect one-year OS, which was indicative of the adequate quality of its early diagnosis and therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of examination and treatment were analyzed in 20 patients with BL (14 men and 6 women aged 15 to 57 years (median age 24 years)) who had been followed up for renal lesion at the Hematology Research Center (HRC) in 2003 to 2011. When admitted to hospital, all the patients were found to have ureteric compression, renal parenchymal tumor infiltration, massive tumor cytolysis syndrome (MTCS). Polychemotherapy (PCT) was performed in accordance with the original intensive BL-M-04 protocol. The extent of the process was estimated according to the classification developed by S.B.Murphy: L3 variant B of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 10 cases; Stage IV in 2; Stage III in 8. Acute renal failure (ARF) was identified in 13 patients. A control group comprised 36 patients with BL without ARF who had been followed up at the HRC in 2003 to 2011 and included into the BL-M-04 protocol. The ratio of patients with bone marrow lesion was 7:13 and 9:36 in the BL + ARF and BL-ARF groups, respectively. RESULTS: Decreased urine specific gravity and proteinuria (0.4 to 1.3 g/l) were the first manifestations of renal lesion and were seen in approximately 50% of all cases both on admission to hospital and in the first stages of PCT (10 and 9, 8 and 7 of the 20 cases, respectively). Microhematuria more commonly developed after initiation of PCT (7 and 3 of the 20 cases, respectively). ARF was diagnosed in 13 patients (24% of the 55 BL patients followed up at HRC in 2003 to 2011). One female patient developed ARF after the start of PCT. Twelve patients developed this condition at the onset of disease; in 4 patients, ARF existing prior to PCT began progressing after drug administration. The etiology of ARF was generally mixed. At the onset of disease, MTCS (n = 6) and specific renal parenchymal infiltration (n=6) were more common causes of ARF. Postrenal anuria was present in 2 cases. ARF after PCT initiation resulted from the toxic effects of methotrexate and MTCS (3 and 4 cases, respectively). ARF regressed in the early periods: in the prophase (n = 4) and during or the first PCT block A (n = 9). The BL patients with ARF, as compared to those without the latter, showed a statistically significant earlier onset of myelotoxic agranulocytosis (MTA): on day 3 of an intercourse interval (95 CI from 0 to 3 days) versus its day 5 (95% CI from 2 to 5 days) and a statistically significant longer duration of MTA--12 days (95% CI from 7 to 16 days) versus 7 days (95% Cl from 3 to 10 days); they were observed to have more severe mucositis. Despite the longer intercourse interval, 10 patients with ARF achieved remission; 4 patients died from therapy-refractory sepsis and 1 patient from thrombocytopenia. In the patients with ARF, mortality rates were significantly higher than in those without ARF (33% versus 10%; p = 0.04).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with different types of acute leukemia (AL), 30 with anaplastic anemia (AA), 24 with thrombocytopenic purpura, and 20 healthy volunteers were examined during their 40-day stay at 3200 m above sea level. beta-Endorphin and HIF-la were measured by a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay using the Abcam antibodies. Cytokines (interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were estimated by enzyme immunoassay applying the Pro Con kits (Saint Petersburg). RESULTS: Serum beta-endorphin concentrations were 1.5-2-fold above the normal values in the majority of patients with AL. The patients with initial leukocytosis at onset of disease were noted to have elevated white blood cell beta-endorphin concentrations up to 85.9 +/- 22.4 pg/ml; moreover, during chemotherapy this index increased about two times (170.74 +/- 33.8 pg/ml). There was a direct correlation between the concentrations of beta-endorphin and HIF-1alpha (r = 0.9) and an inverse correlation between the levels of IL-6 and beta-endorphin (r = -0.7). On ascending to 3200 m, under the conditions of hypoxic hypoxia the patients with AA or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura showed a considerable increase in serum beta-endorphin concentrations, mainly in the acute period of being at high altitudes. CONCLUSION: Stress factors (tumor, use of cytostatics, pain, anemia, hypoxia, high environment temperature) stimulate the elaboration of beta-endorphin, particularly in the white blood cells of patients with AL during chemotherapy. The highest elevation in the index was seen during acute adaptation to hypoxic hypoxia.","['Makeshova, A B', 'Mamukova, Iu I', 'Levina, A A', 'Sysoeva, E P', 'Eralieva, M O', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Makeshova AB', 'Mamukova IuI', 'Levina AA', 'Sysoeva EP', 'Eralieva MO', 'Savchenko VG']",,['rus'],['Journal Article'],Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '60617-12-1 (beta-Endorphin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Altitude', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'beta-Endorphin/*metabolism']",2012/10/09 06:00,2012/10/24 06:00,['2012/10/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2012;84(7):22-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-four (50.7%) patients received standard induction courses; 19 (28.4%) patients had low-intensity therapy. Restraining therapy was used to treat 14 (20.9%) patients. The length of follow-up was 1.5 to 171 months. RESULTS: Irrespective of the type of disease, the median OS was 6 months. A difference in OS was found when the patients were divided into 4 age groups: those who were under 40 years of age (n = 11 ), 41-60 years (n = 21), 61-69 years (n = 21), and > or = 70 years (n = 14). With age, the median OS decreased from 9.5 to 4 months (p = 0.041). Multivariate analysis revealed that the intensity of induction courses was the cause that affected OS.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: By December 2011, 145 patients with AML had been randomized from 18 hematology centers of 15 cities and towns of the Russian Federation; the median age of all the patients was 44 years. Seventy-one patients were analyzed in August 2011 (a 1.5-year follow-up). RESULTS: The efficiency of 2 courses 7+3 using high-dose daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 per administration) and continuous infusion of cytarabine during the second course was high and comparable with that in the use of a high-dose HAM protocol as a second induction course and can achieve a complete remission in 74.6%. The protocol toxicity evaluated from its early mortality (11.3%) and its death in complete remission (16.6%) was permissible, particularly by taking into consideration the multicenter pattern of the trial.

Herein, we report that this methylation is regulated by p53 and death-associated protein 6 (DAXX) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We found that p53 bound to the RASSF1A promoter, recruiting DAXX as well as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) for DNA methylation, which subsequently resulted in inactivation of RASSF1A in wild-type p53 ALL cells. Although the presence of p53 was required for the recruitment of DAXX and DNMT1 to the RASSF1A promoter, fluctuation in p53 protein levels did not affect the rates of RASSF1A methylation. Conversely, methylation of RASSF1A promoter was critically controlled by DAXX, as the enforced overexpression of DAXX led to enhanced RASSF1A promoter methylation, whereas inhibition of DAXX reduced RASSF1A methylation. Interestingly, we found that the p53/DAXX-mediated RASSF1A methylation regulated murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein stability in ALL. Our results reveal a novel function for p53 in the methylation of RASSF1A promoter by its interaction with DAXX. Discovery of this mechanism provides new insight into the interactions among the tumor-related factors p53, RASSF1A, DAXX, and MDM2 in cancer pathogenesis.","['Zhang, Hailong', 'He, Jing', 'Li, Jiansha', 'Tian, Dan', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Zhou, Muxiang']","['Zhang H', 'He J', 'Li J', 'Tian D', 'Gu L', 'Zhou M']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RASSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.12-215491 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.12-215491 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2013 Jan;27(1):232-42. doi: 10.1096/fj.12-215491.

Proteases act in an irreversible manner and therefore have to be strictly regulated. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a major pathway for the proteolytic degradation of cellular proteins. As dysregulation of the UPS is observed in most cancers including leukemia, the UPS is a valid target for therapeutic intervention strategies. Ubiquitin-ligases selectively bind substrates to target them for poly-ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. Therefore, pharmacological modulation of these proteins could allow a specific level of control. Increasing evidence accumulates that ubiquitin-ligases termed mammalian seven in absentia homologs (SIAHs) are not only critical for the pathogenesis of solid tumors but also for leukemogenesis. However, the relevance and therapeutic potential of SIAH-dependent processes has not been fully elucidated. Here, we summarize functions of SIAH ubiquitin-ligases in leukemias, how they select leukemia-relevant substrates for proteasomal degradation, and how the expression and activity of SIAH1 and SIAH2 can be modulated in vivo. We also discuss that epigenetic drugs belonging to the group of histone deacetylase inhibitors induce SIAH-dependent proteasomal degradation to accelerate the turnover of leukemogenic proteins. In addition, our review highlights potential areas for future research on SIAH proteins.","['Kramer, O H', 'Stauber, R H', 'Bug, G', 'Hartkamp, J', 'Knauer, S K']","['Kramer OH', 'Stauber RH', 'Bug G', 'Hartkamp J', 'Knauer SK']","['Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB), Department of Biochemistry, University of Jena, Jena, Germany.

Blockade of PI3K and mTOR with the dual inhibitor PI-103 decreased proliferation in all 15 T-ALL cell lines tested, inducing cell death in three. Combined PI3K/mTOR/NOTCH inhibition (with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI)) led to enhanced cell-cycle arrest and to subsequent cell death in 7/11 remaining NOTCH mutant cell lines. Commitment to cell death occurred within 48-72 h and was maximal when PI3K, mTOR and NOTCH activities were inhibited. PI-103 addition led to upregulation of c-MYC, which was blocked by coincubation with a GSI, indicating that PI3K/mTOR inhibition resulted in activation of the NOTCH-MYC pathway. Microarray studies showed a global increase in NOTCH target gene expression upon PI3K/mTOR inhibition. NOTCH-MYC-induced resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibition was supported by synergistic cell death induction by PI-103 and a small molecule c-MYC inhibitor, and by reduction of the cytotoxic effect of PI-103+GSI by c-MYC overexpression. These results show that drugs targeting PI3K/mTOR can upregulate NOTCH-MYC activity, have implications for the use of PI3K inhibitors for the treatment of other malignancies with activated NOTCH, and provide a rational basis for the use of drug combinations that target both the pathways.","['Shepherd, C', 'Banerjee, L', 'Cheung, C W', 'Mansour, M R', 'Jenkinson, S', 'Gale, R E', 'Khwaja, A']","['Shepherd C', 'Banerjee L', 'Cheung CW', 'Mansour MR', 'Jenkinson S', 'Gale RE', 'Khwaja A']","['Department of Haematology, University College, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (PI103)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Notch/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012285 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.285 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):650-60. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.285.

Previously, we found that FGF2 and CDX4 are direct target genes of HoxA10 and that HOXA10 is a Cdx4 target gene. We also found that increased production of fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2) by HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells results in activation of beta-catenin in an autocrine manner. In this study, we identify novel cis elements in the CDX4 and HOXA10 genes that are activated by beta-catenin in myeloid progenitor cells. We determine that beta-catenin interacts with these cis elements, identifying both CDX4 and HOXA10 as beta-catenin target genes in this context. We demonstrate that HoxA10-induced CDX4 transcription is influenced by Fgf2-dependent beta-catenin activation. Similarly, Cdx4-induced HOXA10 transcription is influenced by beta-catenin in an Fgf2-dependent manner. Increased expression of a set of Hox proteins, including HoxA10, is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. Cdx4 contributes to leukemogenesis in Hox-overexpressing acute myeloid leukemia, and increased beta-catenin activity is also associated with poor prognosis. The current studies identify a molecular mechanisms through which increased expression of HoxA10 increases Cdx4 expression by direct CDX4 activation and by Fgf2-induced beta-catenin activity. This results in Cdx4-induced HoxA10-expression, creating a positive feedback mechanism.","['Bei, Ling', 'Shah, Chirag', 'Wang, Hao', 'Huang, Weiqi', 'Roy, Rupali', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Bei L', 'Shah C', 'Wang H', 'Huang W', 'Roy R', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and the Robert H.

The identification of factors that potentially influence the patient outcome can help ICU professionals make appropriate decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 90 adult patients with hematological malignancy (leukemia 47.8%, high-grade lymphoma 50%) admitted to the ICU were analyzed retrospectively in this single-center study considering numerous variables with regard to their influence on ICU and day-100 mortality. RESULTS: The median simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II at ICU admission was 55 (ICU survivors 47 vs. 60.5 for non-survivors). The overall ICU mortality rate was 45.6%. With multivariate regression analysis, patients admitted with sepsis and acute respiratory failure had a significantly increased ICU mortality (sepsis odds ratio (OR) 9.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1- 99.7, p = 0.04; respiratory failure OR 13.72, 95% CI 1.39-136.15, p = 0.025). Additional factors associated with an increased mortality were: high doses of catecholamines (ICU: OR 7.37, p = 0.005; day 100: hazard ratio (HR) 2.96, p < 0.0001), renal replacement therapy (day 100: HR 1.93, p = 0.026), and high SAPS II (ICU: HR 1.05, p = 0.038; day 100: HR 1.2, p = 0.027).

The information about malignant haematological disease was verified with the Cancer Registry. RESULTS: We found malignant haematological disease in close relatives of 42 of the 236 included patients (18%). CLL and lymphoma were the most common diagnoses. On average, 16 family members were identified in each family. The relative risk of developing CLL was six times higher in those who had close relatives with the disease (16 of a total of 3,776 family members) than among those who did not have close relatives who were affected (76 cases among 107,223 family members of 38,159 control subjects). The increased risk of disease was also associated with other lymphoproliferative diseases. With patrilinear, but not matrilinear inheritance, we found a birth order effect, with affection of younger men in a group of siblings, while the eldest escaped. INTERPRETATION: Malignant haematological disease is common in the family members of patients with CLL.

Biological markers that provide good prognostic information at the time of diagnosis are available. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of these markers in a population-based material. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Biological markers were examined using standard laboratory methods after obtaining an informed consent statement from patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the period 1.10.2007-31.12.2009. RESULTS: There were 388 new cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia during the study period, and 236 patients (61%) were included in the study. Of 222 patients, 178 (80%) were in Binet's stage A, 26 (12%) in stage B and 18 (8%) in stage C. The V(H) gene was mutated in 69% and unmutated in 31% of cases.

However, how their expression is regulated in the tumors and whether they play a role in prostate development remains unclear. METHODS: Prostate tissue from different developmental stages of mouse and human were examined by IHC, qRT-PCR and Western for expression of ANCCA, EZH2, and Ki-67. Animals were castrated and T-implanted for the expression response in normal prostate and tumors. siRNA knockdown and ChIP were performed for the mechanism of ANCCA regulation of EZH2. RESULTS: In contrast to their very low level expression in adult prostate, ANCCA and EZH2 are strongly expressed in the epithelium and mesenchyme of mouse and human UGS. Their expression becomes more restricted to epithelial cells during later development and displays a second peak during puberty, which correlates with the proliferative status of the epithelium. Importantly, their expression in normal prostate and tumors is strongly suppressed by castration and markedly induced by testosterone replacement. While androgen suppresses EZH2 in CRPC cells, in LNCaP cells, physiological concentrations of androgen stimulate expression of PRC2 genes (EZH2, SUZ12, and EED), which is mediated by androgen-induced ANCCA and involves E2F and histone H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 complex. CONCLUSION: EZH2 and ANCCA are androgen regulated and strongly expressed in early prostate morphogenesis and during puberty, suggesting their important role in prostate development. Regulation of EZH2 by ANCCA emphasizes bromodomain protein ANCCA as a potential therapeutic target against prostate cancer.","['Duan, Zhijian', 'Zou, June X', 'Yang, Ping', 'Wang, Yuzhuo', 'Borowsky, Alexander D', 'Gao, Allen C', 'Chen, Hong-Wu']","['Duan Z', 'Zou JX', 'Yang P', 'Wang Y', 'Borowsky AD', 'Gao AC', 'Chen HW']","['Cancer Center/Basic Sciences, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (ATAD2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (ATAD2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)']",IM,"['ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Androgens/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/enzymology/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', '*Prostate/embryology/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sexual Maturation/physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pros.22587 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2013 Apr;73(5):455-66. doi: 10.1002/pros.22587.

However, few studies have measured vitamin D in pediatric patients with malignancy. Our aim was to assess vitamin D status in a large cohort of pediatric patients with cancer and to define risk factors for deficiency. METHODS: Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels were measured in 211 patients. Calcium intake and sun exposure habits were assessed in 142 patients (age 12.1 +/- 5.8 y; number of male patients, 69; mean time from diagnosis, 4.4 +/- 3.8 y). RESULTS: Daily calcium intake was 66.2 +/- 39.3% of the recommended daily allowance. Mean 25OHD levels were 20.6 +/- 7.9 ng/ml. Vitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/ml) was found in 24.6% of the patients and insufficiency (15-20 ng/ml) in 23.2%. Younger age and amount of sun exposure were associated with higher serum 25OHD. No association was found with calcium intake, disease type, gender, BMI SD score, years since diagnosis, or stem cell transplantation. The 25OHD levels during winter were significantly lower than the summer levels. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in pediatric patients with a history of malignancy was high, whereas calcium intake was low. These findings are concerning, given the risk for osteoporosis in this population and the possible role of vitamin D in the context of malignancy.","['Modan-Moses, Dalit', 'Pinhas-Hamiel, Orit', 'Munitz-Shenkar, Dafna', 'Temam, Vered', 'Kanety, Hannah', 'Toren, Amos']","['Modan-Moses D', 'Pinhas-Hamiel O', 'Munitz-Shenkar D', 'Temam V', 'Kanety H', 'Toren A']","[""Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel. dmodan@sheba.health.gov.il""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)'],IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Vitamin D/*blood', 'Wilms Tumor/blood']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['pr2012131 [pii]', '10.1038/pr.2012.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2012 Dec;72(6):620-4. doi: 10.1038/pr.2012.131.

Through the evaluation of FL, the cells that were morphologically suspected of having undergone transformation were found in the bone marrow, and flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses detected the transformed population that suggested concomitant t(8;22) with typical t(14;18) FL cells. Repeated analyses of the lymph nodes demonstrated the typical morphological, phenotypic, and cytogenetic features of FL. The patient received several multiagent chemotherapy regimens, but the disease gradually became resistant, and the patient died of leukemic progression. In B-cell malignancies, cases involving both BCL2 and MYC translocations simultaneously, so-called ""double-hit leukemia/lymphoma (DHL)"", have occasionally been reported. Patients with this type of translocation have a very poor clinical outcome, and no standard therapy has been established.

The response to available treatments is frequently unsatisfactory. Cidofovir is a nucleoside analog of the deoxycytidine antiviral drug approved for the intravenous treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients. We report four cases of children, 5-8 years old, who developed extensive MC in the context of chemotherapy for acute lymphoid leukemia and who were treated with a cream containing cidofovir 1%. In all patients, the lesions began to regress within 2 to 4 months. For three patients, complete regression was observed in 7 to 9 months, and the children remained clear of recurrence. For one patient, partial regression was obtained after 17 months of treatment. No side effects have been observed. Treatment of MC in immunocompromised children is difficult because the usual treatments are inappropriate. Successful use of either topically or intralesionally administered cidofovir in several virally induced cutaneous diseases has been demonstrated and recently documented in the treatment of MC in immunocompromised adults. Conversely, its use in children is not documented. Although intravenous use of cidofovir may lead to severe adverse effects, one single case of a systemic side effect has been reported after topical use at a greater concentration, but no changes in laboratory data were observed. Topical cidofovir offers an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic alternative option for the treatment of MC in immunosuppressed children.","['Guerin, M', 'Lepecheur, V', 'Rachieru-Sourisseau, P', 'Reguerre, Y', 'Pellier, I', 'Martin, L']","['Guerin M', 'Lepecheur V', 'Rachieru-Sourisseau P', 'Reguerre Y', 'Pellier I', 'Martin L']","[""Service de dermatologie, CHU d'Angers, 4, rue Larrey, 49933 Angers cedex 9, France. guerinmorgane@gmail.com""]",['fre'],['Journal Article'],France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'JIL713Q00N (Cidofovir)']",IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cidofovir', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cryosurgery', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molluscum Contagiosum/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Organophosphonates/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0929-693X(12)00371-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcped.2012.08.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2012 Nov;19(11):1157-63. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2012.08.017.

Patients understand, appreciate and profit from evidence-based patient information (EBPI). While these processes are well known, long-term risk awareness and risk processing of patients has not been studied. Mitoxantrone treatment in MS is associated with long-term major potential harms - leukaemia (LK) and cardiotoxicity (CT). The risk knowledge and perception among patients currently or previously treated with mitoxantrone is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to conduct a retrospective cohort study in greater Hamburg, Germany, to estimate risk awareness and perception in MS patients treated with mitoxantrone. METHODS: MS patients with at least one dose of mitoxantrone between 1991 and 2010 from six major MS centres in greater Hamburg received a questionnaire assessing risk awareness and perception as well as a written EBPI about mitoxantrone-associated LK and CT. RESULTS: Fifty-one per cent in the cohort of n = 575 patients returned the questionnaire. Forty per cent correctly estimated the risk of LK (CT 16%); 56% underestimated the risk (CT 82%). Reading the information increased the accuracy of LK risk estimation, and patients did not report an increase of worries. The EBPI was appreciated and recommended by 85%. CONCLUSION: Risk awareness of mitoxantrone-treated patients is insufficient, but can be increased by EBPI without increasing worries. Continued patient information during and after treatment should be implemented in management algorithms.","['Hofmann, A', 'Stellmann, J P', 'Kasper, J', 'Ufer, F', 'Elias, W G', 'Pauly, I', 'Repenthin, J', 'Rosenkranz, T', 'Weber, T', 'Kopke, S', 'Heesen, C']","['Hofmann A', 'Stellmann JP', 'Kasper J', 'Ufer F', 'Elias WG', 'Pauly I', 'Repenthin J', 'Rosenkranz T', 'Weber T', 'Kopke S', 'Heesen C']","['Institute for Neuroimmunology and Clinical MS Research and Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mult Scler,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",9509185,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*adverse effects']",2012/10/06 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1352458512461967 [pii]', '10.1177/1352458512461967 [doi]']",ppublish,Mult Scler. 2013 Jun;19(7):920-5. doi: 10.1177/1352458512461967.

In this study, we utilized both methods to analyze the Raman spectra measured from live cells, apoptotic and necrotic leukemia cells. The comparison indicates that two methods yield comparable accuracy in sample classification when the numbers of basic components are equal. The changes in the contributions of biochemical components in BCA can be interpreted by cell biology principles in apoptosis and necrosis. In contrast, the contributions of most principle components in PCA are difficult to interpret except the first one.

Patients newly diagnosed with CML are routinely treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, the clinical course of the disease can vary, and this variance may be associated with genetic heterogeneity. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technology is a powerful tool for identifying subtle genomic segmental alterations, which can result from either losses or gains of chromosomal material. These changes may reveal the presence of genes that play important roles in disease initiation or progression or in treatment outcomes. To investigate whether subtle somatic copy number changes (CNCs) are commonly present in CML patients, a pilot study of 19 patients with the Ph(+) chromosome, but who were negative for common secondary chromosomal anomalies [+der(22), +8, i(17q), and +19], was conducted using a high-density whole genomic oligonucleotide array CGH analysis. Four of the 19 cases had somatic segmental CNCs, including the loss of 9q34, 15q25.3, and 15q13 and a gain of 7p21.1-p15.3. The findings demonstrate that subtle genomic changes are relatively common in CML patients with a Ph(+) chromosome and that the clinical significance of these findings, especially the newly discovered regions, must be determined in large patient population studies.","['Lu, Xianglan', 'Wang, Xianfu', 'Kim, Yougmi', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Li, Shibo', 'Lee, Ji-Yun']","['Lu X', 'Wang X', 'Kim Y', 'Zhang R', 'Li S', 'Lee JY']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(12)00230-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2012 Oct;205(10):513-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.08.004.

The explosion of cell death research that followed the recognition of apoptosis by Kerr and colleagues in the late 1960s completely obscured the fact that apoptosis is not the only form of cell death. Apoptosis manifests itself by cell shrinkage followed by breakup; another form (oncosis) is almost the opposite: it involves cell swelling and coagulation of the cytoplasm. The name oncosis was chosen over a century ago by von Recklinghausen, a top collaborator of Rudolph Virchow and thereby one of the founders of cellular pathology. Nevertheless, oncosis was forgotten, largely because a satisfactory technique for preparing tissue sections did not exist at the time. Also confusion developed regarding the distinction between oncosis as a mode of cell injury and cell death, and necrosis as a degradation process following cell death. In this review we have described the many characteristics of oncosis from a morphological and biochemical standpoint, and we briefly examine the application of oncosis in disease processes.","['Weerasinghe, Priya', 'Buja, L Maximilian']","['Weerasinghe P', 'Buja LM']","['University of Texas Health Sciences Center Houston (UT Health), Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Houston TX 77030, USA.

The identification of novel molecular mechanisms leading to sarcoma formation and the establishment of new therapies has been hampered by several critical factors. First, this type of cancer is rarely observed in the clinic with fewer than 15,000 newly cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Another complicating factor is that sarcomas are extremely heterogeneous as they arise in a multitude of tissues from many different cell lineages (e.g. bone (osteosarcoma), fat (liposarcoma), and muscle (myosarcoma)). The scarcity of clinical samples coupled with its inherent heterogeneity creates a challenging experimental environment for clinicians and scientists. Faced with these challenges, there has been extremely limited advancement in treatment options available to patients as compared to other cancers. In order to glean insight into the pathobiology of sarcomas, scientists are now using in vivo mouse models whose genomes have been specifically tailored to carry gene deletions, gene amplifications, and point mutations commonly observed in human sarcomas. The use of these model organisms has been successful in increasing our knowledge and understanding of how alterations in relevant oncogenic, tumor suppressive, and signaling pathways directly impact sarcomagenesis. It is the goal of many in the biological community that the use of these mouse models will serve as powerful in vivo tools to further our understanding of sarcomagenesis and potentially identify new therapeutic strategies.","['Post, Sean M']",['Post SM'],"['Department of Leukemia, M,D, Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. spost@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Sarcoma Res,Clinical sarcoma research,101577890,,,,2012/10/06 06:00,2012/10/06 06:01,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/06 06:01 [medline]']","['2045-3329-2-20 [pii]', '10.1186/2045-3329-2-20 [doi]']",epublish,Clin Sarcoma Res. 2012 Oct 4;2(1):20. doi: 10.1186/2045-3329-2-20.,10.1186/2045-3329-2-20 [doi],20121004,,,PMC3499229,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to its role during the late stages of infection, p12 has an essential, but undefined, function during early post-entry events. As these stages of retroviral infection remain poorly understood, we set out to investigate the function of p12. RESULTS: Examination of the infectivity of Mo-MLV virus-like particles containing a mixture of wild type and mutant p12 revealed that the N- and C-terminal regions of p12 are sequentially acting domains, both required for p12 function, and that the N-terminal activity precedes the C-terminal activity in the viral life cycle. By creating a panel of p12 mutants in other gammaretroviruses, we showed that these domains are conserved in this retroviral genus. We also undertook a detailed mutational analysis of each domain, identifying residues essential for function. These data show that different regions of the N-terminal domain are necessary for infectivity in different gammaretroviruses, in stark contrast to the C-terminal domain where the same region is essential for all viruses. Moreover, chimeras between the p12 proteins of Mo-MLV and gibbon ape leukaemia virus revealed that the C-terminal domains are interchangeable whereas the N-terminal domains are not. Finally, we identified potential functions for each domain. We observed that particles with defects in the N-terminus of p12 were unable to abrogate restriction factors, implying that their cores were impaired. We further showed that defects in the C-terminal domain of p12 could be overcome by introducing a chromatin binding motif into the protein. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, we propose a model for p12 function where the N-terminus of p12 interacts with, and stabilizes, the viral core, allowing the C-terminus of p12 to tether the preintegration complex to host chromatin during mitosis, facilitating integration.","['Wight, Darren J', 'Boucherit, Virginie C', 'Nader, Mirella', 'Allen, David J', 'Taylor, Ian A', 'Bishop, Kate N']","['Wight DJ', 'Boucherit VC', 'Nader M', 'Allen DJ', 'Taylor IA', 'Bishop KN']","['Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gag protein p12, moloney murine leukemia virus)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-83 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-83 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Oct 4;9:83. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-83.,10.1186/1742-4690-9-83 [doi],20121004,"['MC_U117592729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'IAT U117581331/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117565647/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U117592729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '084955/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,PMC3492146,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the significance of the MAML2 gene split has not been fully clarified. In the present study, 95 mucoepidermoid carcinomas (paraffin-embedded materials) were analyzed for CRTC1-MAML2 and CRTC3-MAML2 fusions by RT-PCR and for the MAML2 gene split by FISH. Quantitative RT-PCR for the CRTC1-MAML2 transcript was performed in selected cases. MLL gene involvement, which has been reported in some leukemia cases, was examined by FISH in fusion partner-unknown cases. CRTC1-MAML2 and CRTC3-MAML2 fusions were detected in 37 and 6 cases, respectively. The MAML2 gene split was detected in 62 cases, which included all CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusion-positive cases. The level of CRTC1-MAML2 transcript expression was highly variable, and its clinicopathological impact was unclear. The MLL gene split was not detected. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas negative for CRTC1/3-MAML2 and positive for the MAML2 gene split (n = 19) showed favorable clinicopathological tumor features similar to those positive for CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusions. Compared with negative cases (n = 33), mucoepidermoid carcinomas positive for the MAML2 split (n = 62) were associated with lower patient age, a mild female predilection, a smaller tumor size, less frequent nodal metastasis, a lower clinical stage, a lower histological grade, and longer overall and disease-free survival. The MAML2 gene split emerged as an independent prognostic factor for both overall and disease-free survival in multivariate prognostic analysis. The presence of the MAML2 gene split defines a distinct mucoepidermoid carcinoma subset that is associated clinicopathologically with favorable tumor features.","['Noda, Haruna', 'Okumura, Yoshihide', 'Nakayama, Takahisa', 'Miyabe, Satoru', 'Fujiyoshi, Yukio', 'Hattori, Hideo', 'Shimozato, Kazuo', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi']","['Noda H', 'Okumura Y', 'Nakayama T', 'Miyabe S', 'Fujiyoshi Y', 'Hattori H', 'Shimozato K', 'Inagaki H']","['Department of Anatomic Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (CRTC1 protein, human)', '0 (CRTC3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MAML2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Fusion', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12039 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Jan;104(1):85-92. doi: 10.1111/cas.12039.

This study was done to assess various items listed in domains of QOL (physical, emotional, social and school health domains) of children with ALL during maintenance therapy, and compare the same with those of their siblings and other healthy children. Forty children on maintenance therapy of ALL, 40 siblings and 40 healthy children were assessed for QOL by child self-report using PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core in the local language. Means were computed and compared for each domain with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), wherein higher values reflected better QOL. Overall QOL of children with ALL in maintenance therapy (77.16 +/- 10.98) was significantly poorer than that of siblings (93.56 +/- 4.41) and healthy children (93.02 +/- 3.76) (p < 0.001), but their abilities of self-care, household work, exercise, attentiveness, memory and homework were unaffected. There was significantly higher absenteeism due to sickness and hospital visits, and increased emotional problems (fear, anger, sleeping problems) among children with ALL. In the social health domain, children with ALL reported difficulty in maintaining friendships and competing. QOL of siblings was as good as that of healthy children in physical, social and school health domains, but they had increased emotional problems such as anger and sadness. Healthy children reported significantly higher future worries and bullying than children with ALL and siblings. This study validated that the QOL of children with ALL during maintenance therapy was significantly poorer than that of siblings and healthy children. The study identified various items in each domain of QOL that were affected in these children, and thus would assist in guiding healthcare professionals to focus on these specific items so as to improve their overall QOL.","['Bansal, Minakshi', 'Sharma, Kamlesh K', 'Vatsa, Manju', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Bansal M', 'Sharma KK', 'Vatsa M', 'Bakhshi S']","['College of Nursing, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Self Care', 'Siblings/*psychology', 'Social Behavior']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.736985 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 May;54(5):1036-41. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.736985.

The pig has increasingly become an important large animal model for preclinical tests and studies of human diseases; thus, the generation of porcine iPSCs will facilitate research into the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy. A current major problem facing the generation of porcine iPSCs is the failure to silence exogenous transgenes. We hypothesized that this problem can be resolved by reducing the number of transcriptional factors used for porcine iPSCs induction. Here, we report the successful generation of porcine iPSCs using the porcine factors Oct4 and Klf4 in combination with specific small molecules. In comparison with high oxygen conditions (20%), the efficiency of porcine iPSC generation was higher under low oxygen conditions (5%). Porcine iPSCs exhibited a normal karyotype and morphology, like mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and could proliferate in the absence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and in the presence of human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) and mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells. These iPSCs also expressed ESC-like markers (Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-Myc, Bmp4, bFgf). Importantly, the porcine iPSCs showed pluripotency, as evidenced by differentiation into three germ layers in vitro following embryoid body formation, as well as by efficiently forming teratomas containing three germ layers in immunodeficient mice. Thus, pluripotent porcine iPSCs can be generated from somatic stem cells by using only two porcine transcription factors in combination with small molecules. These attempts represent the first step toward generating truly pluripotent porcine iPSCs with fewer exogenous genes and less integration.","['Liu, Kai', 'Ji, Guangzhen', 'Mao, Jian', 'Liu, Mengyuan', 'Wang, Lei', 'Chen, Chengbin', 'Liu, Lin']","['Liu K', 'Ji G', 'Mao J', 'Liu M', 'Wang L', 'Chen C', 'Liu L']","['State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Reprogram,Cellular reprogramming,101528176,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Swine', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/10/06 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/10/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cell.2012.0047 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Reprogram. 2012 Dec;14(6):505-13. doi: 10.1089/cell.2012.0047.

In human leukemia HL-60 cells, amino acid deprivation (AA(-)) caused autophagy with an increase in acid sphingomyleinase (SMase) activity and ceramide, which serves as an autophagy inducing lipid. Knockdown of acid SMase significantly suppressed the autophagy induction. S1P treatment counteracted autophagy induction by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. AA(-) treatment promoted mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dephosphorylation/inactivation, inducing autophagy. S1P treatment suppressed mTOR inactivation and autophagy induction by AA(-). S1P exerts biological actions via cell surface receptors, and S1P(3) among five S1P receptors was predominantly expressed in HL-60 cells. We evaluated the involvement of S1P(3) in suppressing autophagy induction. S1P treatment of CHO cells had no effects on mTOR inactivation and autophagy induction by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. Whereas S1P treatment of S1P(3) overexpressing CHO cells resulted in activation of the mTOR pathway, preventing cells from undergoing autophagy induced by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. These results indicate that S1P-S1P(3) plays a role in counteracting ceramide signals that mediate mTOR-controlled autophagy. In addition, we evaluated the involvement of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases (CAPPs) in ceramide-dependent inactivation of the mTOR pathway.

In this study, we report on the biological significance of the Siglec-15-mediated interaction between monocytes/macrophages and cancer cells. Siglec-15 is expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in various human tumor tissues. We further demonstrated that its expression is substantially elevated in macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced M2-like macrophages, which produced more transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in response to sTn-positive cells than to negative cells. We designed a co-culture model of THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia) cells and H157 (human lung carcinoma) cells mimicking the interaction between monocytes/macrophages and cancer cells that recapitulated the enhanced TGF-beta production in Siglec-15 expressing THP-1 cells by the cellular interaction with sTn expressing H157 cells. The enhanced TGF-beta production required a direct interaction between the two cell lines through sialic acids. Siglec-15 associates with adaptor protein DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) at the binding determinant Lys(274) in the transmembrane domain and transduces a signal to spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). The enhanced TGF-beta secretion was significantly attenuated by Syk inhibitor treatment of THP-1 cells or by substitution of the Siglec-15 Lys(274) to Ala, which disrupts the molecular interaction between Siglec15 and DAP12. These findings indicate that Siglec-15 recognizes the tumoral sTn antigen and transduces a signal for enhanced TGF-beta secretion in TAMs and further suggest that Siglec-15 on macrophages may contribute to tumor progression by the TGF-beta-mediated modulation of intratumoral microenvironments.","['Takamiya, Rina', 'Ohtsubo, Kazuaki', 'Takamatsu, Shinji', 'Taniguchi, Naoyuki', 'Angata, Takashi']","['Takamiya R', 'Ohtsubo K', 'Takamatsu S', 'Taniguchi N', 'Angata T']","['Systems Glycobiology Research Group, RIKEN Advanced Science Institute, Wako, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SIGLEC15 protein, human)', '0 (TYROBP protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (sialosyl-Tn antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cws139 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cws139 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2013 Feb;23(2):178-87. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cws139.

We provide net survival estimates at 1, 3, 5 and 10-year postdiagnosis on 37,549 hematological malignancy (HM) patients whose ages were >15 years, diagnosed between 1989 and 2004 and actively followed until 2008 by French population-based cancer registries. These are, to our knowledge, the first unbiased estimates of 10-year net survival in HMs detailed by subtypes. HMs were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases-Oncology 3. Net survival was estimated with the unbiased Pohar-Perme method. The results are reported by sex and age classes. The changes of these indicators by periods of diagnosis were tabulated and the trends of the net mortality rates over time since diagnosis graphed. In all, 5- and 10-year age-standardized net survivals after HMs varied widely from 81 and 76% for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) to 18 and 14% for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Even in HMs with the most favorable prognoses, the net survival decreased between 5- and 10-year postdiagnosis. Women had better prognoses than men and age at diagnosis was an unfavorable prognostic factor for most HMs. In patients <55 years old, the net mortality rate decreased to null values 5-year postdiagnosis in AML and 10-year postdiagnosis in CHL, precursor non-HL, chronic myelogenous leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The prognoses improved for various HMs over the study period.

The race is on to identify unique pathways to specifically target the cancer, while sparing normal SCs. Here, we uncover the transcription factor Runx1/AML1, a known haematopoietic and leukaemia factor, albeit dispensable for normal adult SC homeostasis, as being important for some mouse and human epithelial cancers. We implicate Runx1 as a SC-intrinsic gene in mouse hair follicle and oral epithelia by genetic lineage tracing in adulthood. Runx1-expressing SCs, but not other cells that ectopically upregulate Runx1 by injury and inflammation, are at the skin tumour origin. Runx1 loss impairs tumour initiation and maintenance and the growth of oral, skin, and ovarian epithelial human cancer cells. Runx1 stimulates Stat3 signalling via direct transcriptional repression of SOCS3 and SOCS4 and this is essential for cancer cell growth. Thus, Runx1 is a broader epithelial SC and cancer factor than previously recognized, and qualifies as an attractive potential target for both prevention and therapy of several epithelial cancers.","['Scheitz, Cornelia Johanna Franziska', 'Lee, Tae Seung', 'McDermitt, David James', 'Tumbar, Tudorita']","['Scheitz CJ', 'Lee TS', 'McDermitt DJ', 'Tumbar T']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOCS4 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mouth Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2012270 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2012.270 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2012 Nov 5;31(21):4124-39. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2012.270.

Here, we show that CXCR4 expression at the surface of leukemic cells allowed distinguishing CXCR4 (high) from CXCR4(neg/low) AML patients. When high levels of CXCR4 are expressed at the surface of AML cells, blocking the receptor function with small molecule inhibitors could promote leukemic cell death and reduce NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgamma(null) (NOG) leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). Conversely, these drugs had no efficacy when AML cells do not express CXCR4 or when they do not respond to chemokine CXC motif ligand 12 (CXCL12). Functional analysis showed a greater mobilization of leukemic cells and LICs in response to drugs, suggesting that they target the interaction between leukemic cells and their supportive bone marrow microenvironment. In addition, increased apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo was observed. CXCR4 expression level on AML blast cells and their migratory response to CXCL12 are therefore predictive of the response to the inhibitors and could be used as biomarkers to select patients that could potentially benefit from the drugs.","['Zhang, Y', 'Patel, S', 'Abdelouahab, H', 'Wittner, M', 'Willekens, C', 'Shen, S', 'Betems, A', 'Joulin, V', 'Opolon, P', 'Bawa, O', 'Pasquier, F', 'Ito, M', 'Fujii, N', 'Gonin, P', 'Solary, E', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Coppo, P', 'De Botton, S', 'Louache, F']","['Zhang Y', 'Patel S', 'Abdelouahab H', 'Wittner M', 'Willekens C', 'Shen S', 'Betems A', 'Joulin V', 'Opolon P', 'Bawa O', 'Pasquier F', 'Ito M', 'Fujii N', 'Gonin P', 'Solary E', 'Vainchenker W', 'Coppo P', 'De Botton S', 'Louache F']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1009, 114 rue Edouard Vaillant, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylamines', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclams', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012137 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.137 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Oct 4;3:e396. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.137.,10.1038/cddis.2012.137 [doi],20121004,,,PMC3481125,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing XPO1-targeting agents lack selectivity and have been associated with significant toxicity. Small molecule selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) were designed that specifically inhibit XPO1. Genetic experiments and X-ray structures demonstrate that SINE covalently bind to a cysteine residue in the cargo-binding groove of XPO1, thereby inhibiting nuclear export of cargo proteins. The clinical relevance of SINEs was explored in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease associated with recurrent XPO1 mutations. Evidence is presented that SINEs can restore normal regulation to the majority of the dysregulated pathways in CLL both in vitro and in vivo and induce apoptosis of CLL cells with a favorable therapeutic index, with enhanced killing of genomically high-risk CLL cells that are typically unresponsive to traditional therapies. More importantly, SINE slows disease progression, and improves overall survival in the Emu-TCL1-SCID mouse model of CLL with minimal weight loss or other toxicities. Together, these findings demonstrate that XPO1 is a valid target in CLL with minimal effects on normal cells and provide a basis for the development of SINEs in CLL and related hematologic malignancies.","['Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Sun, Qingxiang', 'Williams, Katie', 'Tangeman, Larissa', 'Jha, Shruti', 'Zhong, Yiming', 'Goettl, Virginia', 'Mahoney, Emilia', 'Berglund, Caroline', 'Gupta, Sneha', 'Farmer, Alicia', 'Mani, Rajeswaran', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lucas, David', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Daelemans, Dirk', 'Sandanayaka, Vincent', 'Shechter, Sharon', 'McCauley, Dilara', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Kauffman, Michael', 'Chook, Yuh Min', 'Byrd, John C']","['Lapalombella R', 'Sun Q', 'Williams K', 'Tangeman L', 'Jha S', 'Zhong Y', 'Goettl V', 'Mahoney E', 'Berglund C', 'Gupta S', 'Farmer A', 'Mani R', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lucas D', 'Mo X', 'Daelemans D', 'Sandanayaka V', 'Shechter S', 'McCauley D', 'Shacham S', 'Kauffman M', 'Chook YM', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (KPT-185)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Acrylates/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Karyopherins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Triazoles/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51609-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-429506 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 29;120(23):4621-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-429506.

A single miRNA concurrently downregulates hundreds of target mRNAs designated ""targetome"", and thereby fine-tunes gene expression involved in diverse cellular functions, such as development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. Recently, we characterized the molecular network of the whole human miRNA targetome by using bioinformatics tools for analyzing molecular interactions on the comprehensive knowledgebase. We found that the miRNA targetome regulated by an individual miRNA generally constitutes the biological network of functionally-associated molecules in human cells, closely linked to pathological events involved in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We also identified a collaborative regulation of gene expression by transcription factors and miRNAs in cancer-associated miRNA targetome networks. This review focuses on the workflow of molecular network analysis of miRNA targetome in silico. We applied the workflow to two representative datasets, composed of miRNA expression profiling of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. The results supported the view that miRNAs act as a central regulator of both oncogenesis and neurodegeneration.","['Satoh, Jun-Ichi']",['Satoh J'],"['Department of Bioinformatics and Molecular Neuropathology, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo, 204-8588, Japan. satoj@my-pharm.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BioData Min,BioData mining,101319161,,,,2012/10/05 06:00,2012/10/05 06:01,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/05 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-0381-5-17 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0381-5-17 [doi]']",epublish,BioData Min. 2012 Oct 3;5(1):17. doi: 10.1186/1756-0381-5-17.,10.1186/1756-0381-5-17 [doi],20121003,,,PMC3492042,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed prospectively the efficacy of mobilization in pediatric patients and risk factors associated with its failure. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients, aged 0 to 17 years, needing a first collection of PBSCs for autologous stem cell transplantation were eligible. The study period was from July 2008 to September 2010. A blood peak of fewer than 20 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/L was used as the cutoff to define a poor mobilizer. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients, 57% male (82) and 43% female (63), with a median age of 7 years, affected by solid tumor, 79% (114), and acute leukemia or lymphoma, 21% (31), were enrolled. Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor used was filgrastim in 69%, lenograstim in 26%, and pegfilgrastim in 5% of patients. A total of 83% (121) of patients mobilized successfully, the median CD34+ count being 120 x 10(6) /L (range, 23 x 10(6) -1840 x 10(6) /L). A single leukapheresis procedure was sufficient to achieve the target CD34+ cell dose in 82% (99/121) of patients. Among 24 poor mobilizer patients, 15 underwent a second mobilizing course and nine required a marrow harvest. Factors associated with poor mobilization were metastatic disease and relapse. Among 99 patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation, the median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment and of hospitalization were longer by 2, 12, and 6 days in poor versus good mobilizer group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients undergoing a first mobilization, the incidence of poor mobilization was 17%. Failure of mobilization resulted in an increase in health costs and a longer hospitalization for those who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Tintori, Veronica', 'Nesi, Francesca', 'Schiavello, Elisabetta', 'Calore, Elisabetta', 'Dallorso, Sandro', 'Migliavacca, Maddalena', 'Capolsini, Ilaria', 'Desantis, Raffaella', 'Caselli, Desiree', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Luksch, Roberto', 'Panizzolo, Irene', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Prete, Arcangelo']","['Cesaro S', 'Tintori V', 'Nesi F', 'Schiavello E', 'Calore E', 'Dallorso S', 'Migliavacca M', 'Capolsini I', 'Desantis R', 'Caselli D', 'Fagioli F', 'Luksch R', 'Panizzolo I', 'Tridello G', 'Prete A']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy. simone.cesaro@ospedaleuniverona.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03911.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2013 Jul;53(7):1501-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03911.x.

PATIENT: A 41-year-old male with a large mediastinal mass, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy was diagnosed as having T-LBL. Lymphoma cells were positive for CD4, CD8, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, and TdT. RESULTS: G-banding and spectral karyotyping of pleural effusion cells showed 47,XY,dup(1)(q21q32),t(7;9)(q34;q34),+20. Genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that the 5' end of TRB@ J1-5 was connected with the middle of NOTCH1 exon 25 (434 bp downstream from its 5' end) in a 'head-to-head' configuration on the der(9)t(7;9), although nine extra bases were inserted between the two genes. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed expression of the TRB@/NOTCH1 fusion transcripts. Similarly, the 5' end of J1-5 was fused to the shortened exon 25 with nine extra bases. The NOTCH1 breakpoint in exon 25 was very close to transcription start sites of deleted Notch1 in murine T-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The TRB@/NOTCH1 fusion gene with a NOTCH1 breakpoint in exon 25, which has not previously been detected in four other reported cases with t(7;9), could lead to aberrant expression of the truncated NOTCH1 by TRB@ enhancer elements. The resultant NOTCH1 receptor deleting most of the extracellular domain may be implicated in the pathogenesis of T-LBL by ligand-independent, constitutive activation of the NOTCH1 pathway, suggesting avenues for future therapy with gamma-secretase inhibitors.","['Yamamoto, Katsuya', 'Nakamachi, Yuji', 'Yakushijin, Kimikazu', 'Miyata, Yoshiharu', 'Okamura, Atsuo', 'Kawano, Seiji', 'Matsuoka, Hiroshi', 'Minami, Hironobu']","['Yamamoto K', 'Nakamachi Y', 'Yakushijin K', 'Miyata Y', 'Okamura A', 'Kawano S', 'Matsuoka H', 'Minami H']","['Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan. kyamamo@med.kobe-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12019 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Jan;90(1):68-75. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12019.

In two cases of acute myeloid leukemia with t(6;11)(q27;q23) abnormality presented here, flow cytometry analysis showed a lack of HLA-A unshared between recipients and donors in relapsing leukemic cells after HLA-haploidentical transplantation. However, high-resolution HLA genotyping showed that one case lacked a corresponding HLA haplotype, whereas the other preserved it. These cases suggest that leukemic cells, which lacked mismatched HLA expression, might have an advantage in selective expansion under donor T-cell immune surveillance after HLA-haploidentical transplantation. Most importantly, down-regulation of unshared HLA expression potentially occurs by genetic alterations other than loss of HLA alleles.","['Tamaki, Hiroya', 'Fujioka, Tatsuya', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Yoshihara, Satoshi', 'Kaida, Katsuji', 'Taniguchi, Kyoko', 'Kato, Ruri', 'Tokugawa, Taduko', 'Nakata, Jun', 'Inoue, Takayuki', 'Yano, Aya', 'Eguchi, Ryoji', 'Okada, Masaya', 'Maruya, Etsuko', 'Saji, Hiroh', 'Ogawa, Hiroyasu']","['Tamaki H', 'Fujioka T', 'Ikegame K', 'Yoshihara S', 'Kaida K', 'Taniguchi K', 'Kato R', 'Tokugawa T', 'Nakata J', 'Inoue T', 'Yano A', 'Eguchi R', 'Okada M', 'Maruya E', 'Saji H', 'Ogawa H']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan. tamakhi@hyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/immunology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Translocation, Genetic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/01/19 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12017 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Dec;89(6):497-500. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12017.

Most of the literature, however, consists of isolated case reports or small case series. The aim of this retrospective study was to review the national experience with insect-bite-like reaction in a large group of patients with CLL. The study cohort of patients with these skin reactions consisted of 48 patients (25 males, 23 females) of mean age 64.8 yr (range 33-89) at skin eruption. Data on clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic characteristics, treatment, and outcome were collected from the medical files. Mean time between diagnosis of CLL and appearance of the skin lesions was 3.1 yr (range -4 to 14 yr). The eruption was not related to disease activity or the course of the hematological disease. The eruption preceded the diagnosis of CLL in 10 patients (by 0-4 yr); and followed the diagnosis in 36; in 11 patients, it occurred during therapy for CLL and in nine after therapy. Mean duration of the skin findings was 21.5 months (range 0.3-132). The eruption usually presented in summer, although it occurred also at other times of the year, and predominantly affected the upper and lower limbs, although it also appeared on unexposed areas. Treatment included local ointments, antihistaminics, oral steroids, antibiotics, phototherapy, and dapsone with varying responses. Insect-bite-like reactions is a relatively common and disturbing skin reaction in CLL patients, it may be related to the immune dysregulation accompanying CLL and further exacerbated by external factors, including actual insect bites, chemoimmunotherapy, and pyogenic infection.","['Bairey, Osnat', 'Goldschmidt, Neta', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Rahimi-Levene, Neomi', 'Yuklea, Mona', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Herishanu, Yair']","['Bairey O', 'Goldschmidt N', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Tadmor T', 'Rahimi-Levene N', 'Yuklea M', 'Shvidel L', 'Berrebi A', 'Polliack A', 'Herishanu Y']","['Hematology Institute, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel. obairey@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Exanthema/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Histamine Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Insect Bites and Stings/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pruritus/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Steroids/therapeutic use']",2012/10/05 06:00,2013/01/19 06:00,['2012/10/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12015 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Dec;89(6):491-6. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12015.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are classified as another major type of proteoglycans. Here, we examined the effect of four types of chondroitin sulfate (CS) on HTLV-1 infection. Accordingly, a human T cell line, MOLT-4, was inoculated with cell-free HTLV-1 in the presence or absence of soluble CS, and the synthesis of reverse-transcribed HTLV-1 DNA within cells 20 h after inoculation was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the four types of CS (A, C, D, and E), the E type (CSE), which was derived from the squid cartilage, exhibited anti-HTLV-1 activity. Furthermore, we observed that CSE directly interacted with recombinant HTLV-1 envelope (Env) proteins and inhibited the binding of HTLV-1 virions to MOLT-4 cells, indicating that the interaction between Env and CSE plays a significant role in its anti-HTLV-1 activity. In addition, CSE inhibited syncytium formation that was induced by HTLV-1-producing cells. When CSE was mixed with the synthetic fusion inhibitor peptide corresponding to the ectodomain of the Env transmembrane subunit (TM) gp21, the HTLV-1 infection was further inhibited when compared with the inhibitory effect of each compound alone.

METHODS: The aberrations were investigated in 48 CML patients receiving imatinib therapy and a group of 15 healthy controls, by using the MLPA method between 2000 and 2009. The obtained results were compared both between patient and control groups and with clinical parameters. RESULTS: Duplication was detected in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene of 2 patients, inosine 5' monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1) gene of 4, postmeiotic segregation increased S. Cerevisiae 2 (PMS2) gene of 1, nuclear factor kappa beta (NFKB) of 5 and T-cell translocation 2 (LMO2) gene of 1 patient. Univariate analysis showed that splenomegaly, advanced age, Sokal risk score (SRS) and the duplications in IMPDH1 and FGFR1 genes significantly shortened 7-year event-free survival (EFS); multivariate analysis showed that only the duplications in IMPDH1 and FGFR1 genes were the factors that significantly affected EFS. No statistically significant correlations were detected between duplications and other clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: Duplications in 4 genes (FGFR1, IMPDH1, PMS2, LMO2) in addition to Ph+ chromosome in CML patients were detected for the first time. This study indicates that chromosomes 7 and 8 should be particularly investigated in more detail in addition to the Ph+ chromosome for better determination of disease prognosis and selection of alternative treatments.","['Sever, T', 'Kilicarslan, C', 'Pehlivan, M', 'Kaynar, L', 'Yilmaz, M', 'Eser, B', 'Okan, V', 'Kurnaz, F', 'Cetin, M', 'Pehlivan, S']","['Sever T', 'Kilicarslan C', 'Pehlivan M', 'Kaynar L', 'Yilmaz M', 'Eser B', 'Okan V', 'Kurnaz F', 'Cetin M', 'Pehlivan S']","['Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Gaziantep University Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMPDH1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (PMS2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (Mismatch Repair Endonuclease PMS2)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Duplication', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mismatch Repair Endonuclease PMS2', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics']",2012/10/04 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2012 Jul-Sep;17(3):490-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocyte trafficking is controlled by homing signals provided by stromal cell-derived chemokines and egress signals provided by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). In the present study, we show that expression of S1P1, the S1P receptor responsible for lymphocyte egress, is selectively reduced in CLL B cells with unmutated IGHV. Expression of S1P2, which controls B-cell homeostasis, is also impaired in CLL B cells but independently of the IGHV mutational status. We provide evidence herein that p66Shc, a Shc adaptor family member the deficiency of which is implicated in the apoptosis defects of CLL B cells, controls S1P1 expression through its pro-oxidant activity. p66Shc also controls the expression of the homing receptor CCR7, which opposes S1P1 by promoting lymphocyte retention in peripheral lymphoid organs. The results of the present study provide insights into the regulation of S1P1 expression in B cells and suggest that defective egress caused by impaired S1P1 expression contributes to the extended survival of CLL B cells by prolonging their residency in the prosurvival niche of peripheral lymphoid organs.","['Capitani, Nagaja', 'Patrussi, Laura', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Lucherini, Orso Maria', 'Cannizzaro, Enrica', 'Migliaccio, Enrica', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Gattazzo, Cristina', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Pelicci, Piergiuseppe', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Baldari, Cosima T']","['Capitani N', 'Patrussi L', 'Trentin L', 'Lucherini OM', 'Cannizzaro E', 'Migliaccio E', 'Frezzato F', 'Gattazzo C', 'Forconi F', 'Pelicci P', 'Semenzato G', 'Baldari CT']","['Department of Evolutionary Biology, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oxidants/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*genetics/physiology', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/10/04 06:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51635-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-425959 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 22;120(22):4391-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-425959.

For a better comparability of MRD data, there are ongoing efforts to standardize MRD quantification using real-time quantitative PCR of clonal immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, real-time quantitative-based detection of fusion gene transcripts or breakpoints, and multiparameter flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Several studies have demonstrated that MRD assessment in childhood and adult ALL significantly correlates with clinical outcome. MRD detection is particularly useful for evaluation of treatment response, but also for early assessment of an impending relapse. Therefore, MRD has gained a prominent position in many ALL treatment studies as a tool for tailoring therapy with growing evidence that MRD supersedes most conventional stratification criteria at least for Ph-negative ALL. Most study protocols on adult ALL follow a 2-step approach with a first classic pretherapeutic and a second MRD-based risk stratification. Here we discuss whether and how MRD is ready to be used as main decisive marker and whether pretherapeutic factors and MRD are really competing or complementary tools to individualize treatment.","['Bruggemann, Monika', 'Raff, Thorsten', 'Kneba, Michael']","['Bruggemann M', 'Raff T', 'Kneba M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Chemnitzstrasse 33, Kiel, Germany. m.brueggemann@med2.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/04 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51591-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-379040 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 29;120(23):4470-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-379040.

We aimed to identify prognostic indicators of 30-day hospital mortality in adult patients who had acute leukemia and respiratory failure, who had received invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU but who had not received blood and marrow transplantation, were not admitted due to cardiopulmonary arrest or myocardial infarction and, had not recently undergone surgery. METHODS: In this case-control study, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of relevant patients >16 year old who had been admitted to the ICU at our institution over a 4-year period. The main outcome measure was 30-day hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine significant predictors of death. RESULTS: For the 167 patients meeting our eligibility criteria, the median age was 61 years. The majority was admitted due to respiratory insufficiency/failure (69%). The 30-day hospital mortality rate was 62%. Independent predictors of 30-day hospital mortality were advanced disease status (odds ratio [OR]=3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-6.77) and increased organ failure at the time of intubation (OR=1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33) per point increase in the SOFA score. Patients who had received endotracheal intubation within the first 24 h of ICU admission were less likely than others to die (OR=0.46, 95% CI, 0.23-0.91) within the next 30 days after admission to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Advanced disease status and elevated SOFA scores at intubation are strong predictors of 30-day mortality in patients with acute leukemia and respiratory failure. The protective effect of early endotracheal intubation warrants further investigation.","['Price, K J', 'Cardenas-Turanzas, M', 'Lin, H', 'Roden, L', 'Nigam, R', 'Nates, J L']","['Price KJ', 'Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Lin H', 'Roden L', 'Nigam R', 'Nates JL']","['Department of Critical Care, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. kjprice@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Italy,Minerva Anestesiol,Minerva anestesiologica,0375272,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Critical Care', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/*mortality/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Respiration, Artificial/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/04 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['R02127860 [pii]'],ppublish,Minerva Anestesiol. 2013 Feb;79(2):147-55.

Astronauts and other exposed groups are classified as never-smokers (NS), defined as lifetime use of less than 100 cigarettes. In the past, radiation risk estimates have been made using average U.S. population rates for cancer and all causes of death, which may lead to overestimation of radiation risks for NS. In this report, age- and gender-specific radiation carcinogenesis risk calculations for NS and the average U.S. population are compared. Lung is the major tissue site for smoking and radiation-related cancer. However, other radiogenic cancers where tobacco has been shown to increase population cancer rates are esophagus, oral cavity, salivary gland, bladder, stomach, liver, colorectal, and leukemia. After adjusting U.S. cancer rates to remove smoking effects, radiation risks for lung and other cancers were estimated using the multiplicative risk model and a mixture model, with weighted contributions for additive and multiplicative risk transfer. Radiation mortality risks for NS were reduced compared to the average U.S. population by more than 20% and 50% in the mixture model and multiplicative transfer models, respectively. The authors discuss possible mechanisms of cancer risks from radiation and tobacco that suggest multiplicative effects could occur. These results suggest that improved understanding of possible synergisms between cancer initiators and promoters, such as radiation and tobacco, would greatly improve risk estimates and reduce uncertainties for differentially exposed groups, including NS.","['Cucinotta, Francis A', 'Chappell, Lori J', 'Kim, Myung-Hee Y', 'Wang, Minli']","['Cucinotta FA', 'Chappell LJ', 'Kim MH', 'Wang M']","['NASA, Lyndon B.

The authors have performed a review of charged particle carcinogenesis in animals with the following observations. A limited number of animal studies with carcinogenesis endpoints have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of HZE ions. These include the induction of skin and mammary tumors in the rat and Harderian gland tumors, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and hepatocellular carcinomas in the mouse. In general, high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) has been reported for solid tumor induction. RBE dependence on HZE radiation quality has been most extensively characterized in studies of mouse Harderian gland tumorigenesis. In this model, the RBE increases with LET and plateaus in the 193-953 keV mum(-1) range. Unlike the results of solid tumor studies, a leukemogenesis study found 1 GeV nucleon(-1) 56Fe ions no more efficient than gamma-rays for AML induction. No novel tumor types have been observed in HZE irradiated animals as compared with those that occur spontaneously or following low-LET radiation exposures. Genetic background of the irradiated animals is critical; the tumor types induced in HZE irradiated mice depend on their strain background, and the incidence of HZE ion-induced mammary carcinogenesis in the rat is also strain dependent.","['Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle', 'Genik, Paula C', 'Fallgren, Christina M', 'Ullrich, Robert L', 'Weil, Michael M']","['Bielefeldt-Ohmann H', 'Genik PC', 'Fallgren CM', 'Ullrich RL', 'Weil MM']","['School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Elementary Particles/*adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced']",2012/10/04 06:00,2012/12/14 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0b013e318265a257 [doi]', '00004032-201211000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2012 Nov;103(5):568-76. doi: 10.1097/HP.0b013e318265a257.,10.1097/HP.0b013e318265a257 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of all patients diagnosed or suspected to have CML who had interphase FISH analysis at presentation on peripheral blood/bone marrow using a commercially available BCR/ABL1 dual colour, dual fusion probe. The study was performed at a tertiary hospital in India between 2004 and 2010. RESULTS: There were 1076 diagnostic samples which were positive for BCR/ABL1 fusion. Typical dual fusion signals (two fusions, one red and one green, 2F1R1G) were seen in 801 cases (74 %). Atypical signal patterns were seen in 275 cases (26%). These were: 1F1R2G (4%), 1F2R1G (2.5%) and 1F1R1G (11%) representing deletions of the derivative 9 involving chromosome 9 sequences, chromosome 22 sequences, or both respectively; 3F1R1G (6.5%) usually representing gain of an additional Philadelphia chromosome and 1F2R2G (1%) representing a three- or four-way variant translocation. More than one signal pattern was seen in 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were similar to the literature with respect to the distribution of signal patterns except that we had a lower number of patients with variant translocations. While each signal pattern is typically associated with a particular abnormality, there can be more than one explanation for each pattern. Hence, metaphase FISH analysis is the ""gold standard"" for the interpretation of signal patterns.","['Jain, Poonam P', 'Parihar, Mayur', 'Ahmed, Rayaz', 'Abraham, Aby', 'Vishwabandya, Auro', 'George, Biju', 'Mathews, Vikram', 'Srivastava, Alok', 'Srivastava, Vivi M']","['Jain PP', 'Parihar M', 'Ahmed R', 'Abraham A', 'Vishwabandya A', 'George B', 'Mathews V', 'Srivastava A', 'Srivastava VM']","['Cytogenetics Unit, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamilnadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry/genetics', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/04 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2012_55_3_347_101742 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.101742 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2012 Jul-Sep;55(3):347-51. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.101742.,10.4103/0377-4929.101742 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that hematopoietic stem cells have an absolute requirement for THOC5 for survival and that THOC5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 225 as a consequence of leukemogenic protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) action. We have investigated pathways for THOC5 phosphorylation to develop an understanding of THO complex modulation by tyrosine kinase (TK) oncogenes in leukemias. We demonstrate that THOC5 phosphorylation is mediated by Src PTK and CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase action and that this event is sensitive to oxidative status. We show that THOC5 phosphorylation is elevated in stem cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and that this phosphorylation is sensitive to the frontline drugs used in CML treatment. Further we show that THOC5 Y225 phosphorylation governs mRNA binding. In addition, CXCL12 is shown to induce THOC5 Y225 phosphorylation, and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that this modulates motile response. In conclusion, we delineate a signaling pathway stimulated by leukemogenic PTKs, chemokines and oxidative stress that can affect THO complex mediation of gene expression describing mechanisms for post-transcriptional regulation of protein levels.","['Griaud, F', 'Pierce, A', 'Gonzalez Sanchez, M B', 'Scott, M', 'Abraham, S A', 'Holyoake, T L', 'Tran, D D H', 'Tamura, T', 'Whetton, A D']","['Griaud F', 'Pierce A', 'Gonzalez Sanchez MB', 'Scott M', 'Abraham SA', 'Holyoake TL', 'Tran DD', 'Tamura T', 'Whetton AD']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Withington, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (THOC5 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphorylation', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2012/10/04 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012283 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.283 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):932-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.283.

Chronic infections are uncommon and have been reported in immunosuppressed patients, patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and patients with hematological malignancies. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the gastroenterology clinic with a history of increasing transaminases, persistent exhaustion, and occasional right-side abdominal pain over the course of a 6-month period. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia had been diagnosed several years earlier, and the patient was treated with rituximab, pentostatin, and cyclophosphamide. A diagnostic workup ruled out autoimmune and metabolic liver disease, hepatitis A-C, and herpes virus infection. A physical examination revealed enlarged axillary lymph nodes. The results of an abdominal ultrasound examination were otherwise unremarkable. Hepatitis E virus infection was diagnosed by detection of hepatitis E virus-specific antibodies. Blood samples were positive for hepatitis E virus ribonucleic acid with high viral loads for at least 8 months, demonstrating a rare chronic hepatitis E virus infection. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed hepatitis E virus genotype 3c with homologies to other European isolates from humans and swine, indicating an autochthonous infection. CONCLUSIONS: Usually, hepatitis E virus infection appears as an acute infection; rare chronic infections have been reported for transplant patients, patients with human immunodeficiency virus, and patients with hematological malignancies. The chronic nature of hepatitis E infection in our patient was most likely induced by the immunosuppressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment.

The current clinical staging criteria fail to differentiate patients with occult metastasis from patients without metastasis. Identifying molecular markers of the disease might improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and development of laryngeal carcinoma and may help improve clinical staging and treatment. METHODS: Sixty-four previously untreated patients who underwent surgical excision of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with neck dissection were included in this study. The expression of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) was examined immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tissue specimens. RESULTS: Nuclear expression of BMI-1 (nBMI-1) was detected in 32 of the 64 tumors (50%), cytoplasmic expression of BMI-1 (cBMI-1) was detected in 22 (34.4%), and 10 tumors (15.6%) showed no BMI-1 immunoreactivity. High nBMI-1 expression levels (>/= 10) were detected in 28 of the 32 (87.5%) nBMI-1-positive patients. Multivariate analysis including age at diagnosis, grade, tumor location, TNM status, and nBMI-1 expression showed that a high nBMI-1 expression level was an independent prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSION: The expression of BMI-1 in patients with laryngeal carcinoma seems to correlate with lymph node metastasis.","['Allegra, Eugenia', 'Puzzo, Lidia', 'Zuccala, Valeria', 'Trapasso, Serena', 'Vasquez, Enrico', 'Garozzo, Aldo', 'Caltabiano, Rosario']","['Allegra E', 'Puzzo L', 'Zuccala V', 'Trapasso S', 'Vasquez E', 'Garozzo A', 'Caltabiano R']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy. eualle@unicz.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*analysis/physiology']",2012/10/04 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7819-10-206 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7819-10-206 [doi]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2012 Oct 2;10:206. doi: 10.1186/1477-7819-10-206.,10.1186/1477-7819-10-206 [doi],20121002,,,PMC3500717,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutations of DNMT3A gene, including recurrent mutations in its Arg-882, were recently reported in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), strongly suggesting its role in development of AML. To see whether DNMT3A mutation occurs in other malignancies as well, we analyzed DNMT3A in 916 cancer tissues from 401 hematologic malignancies (AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), multiple myelomas and lymphomas) and 515 carcinomas (lung, breast, prostate, colorectal and gastric carcinomas) using a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. We identified DNMT3A mutations, especially the Arg-882 mutations, in adulthood AML (9.4%). In addition, we found DNMT3A mutations in pre-B-ALL and three lung cancers at lower frequencies. Allelic loss of DNMT3A was frequently observed in most cancer types analyzed, including lymphomas (48.1%), gastric cancers (23.5%) and lung cancers (18.3%) irrespective of DNMT3A mutation. Also, loss of DNMT3A expression was common in lung cancers (46.4%), and was associated with the allelic loss. Our data indicate that DNMT3A gene is mutated mainly in AML, but it occurs in other cancers, such as ALL and lung cancer, despite the lower incidences. Also, the data suggest that DNMT3A is altered in many cancer types by various ways, including somatic mutations, allelic loss and loss of expression that might play roles in tumorigenesis.","['Kim, Min S', 'Kim, Yoo R', 'Yoo, Nam J', 'Lee, Sug H']","['Kim MS', 'Kim YR', 'Yoo NJ', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Asians/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Child', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Republic of Korea', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics']",2012/10/04 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0463.2012.02940.x [doi]'],ppublish,APMIS. 2013 Feb;121(2):85-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0463.2012.02940.x.

Using an array of sample preparation techniques including gel-eluted liquid fraction entrapment electrophoresis (GELFrEE), filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), and microwave-assisted on-filter enzymatic digestion, we identified 2 090 proteins from the membrane fraction of a leukemia cell line (K562). Of these, 37% are annotated as membrane proteins according to gene ontology analysis, resulting in the largest membrane proteome of leukemia cells reported to date. Our approach combines the advantages of GELFrEE high-loading capacity, gel-free separation, efficient depletion of detergents, and microwave-assisted on-filter digestion, minimizing sample losses and maximizing MS-detectable sequence coverage of individual proteins.

VTT is rich in polyphenols, especially quercetin and resveratrol derivatives, which were demonstrated to exhibit inhibitory activities against carcinogenesis and prevent some neurodegenerative diseases. (-)-Vitisin B is one of the resveratrol tetramers extracted from VTT. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of (-)-vitisin B on the induction of apoptosis in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. First, (-)-vitisin B significantly inhibited cell proliferation through inducing cell apoptosis. This effect appeared to occur in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell-cycle distribution was also examined, and we found that (-)-vitisin B significantly induced a sub-G1 population in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, (-)-vitisin B exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on cell proliferation than resveratrol. Second, (-)-vitisin B dose dependently induced apoptosis-related protein expressions, such as the cleavage form of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase, and the proapoptotic Bax protein. Third, (-)-vitisin B treatment also resulted in increases in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and Fas ligand (FasL) expression. Moreover, the (-)-vitisin B-induced FasL expression and caspase-3 activation could be reversed by a JNK inhibitor.

Therefore, stable lipid drug conjugate (LDC) of Cyt with stearic acid was prepared. LDC was characterized by NMR, FTIR, DSC and XRD studies. Polysorbate 80 stabilized nanoparticles of this LDC (LDC-NP) were prepared using solvent injection method and characterized for size, zeta potential and loading efficiency. The LDC-NPs were loaded with appreciable amount (considering hydrophilic nature of drug, prior to conjugation) of drug conjugate (58.39 +/- 4.69%). The prepared LDC-NPs had smooth surface, particle size of 136.80 +/- 3.24 nm, were non-aggregated and had almost spherical and uniform shapes. In vitro release pattern showed initial fast release (14.89 +/- 0.056% in 1 h) followed by sustained release up to 72 h (76.26 +/- 0.156%). The blank stearic acid nanoparticles showed no significant cytotoxic effect on leukemic EL-4 cells and LDC-NPs were more cytotoxic than Cyt solution at 48 h. The lyophilized LDC-NPs were found to be physically stable with respect to size and zeta potential at refrigerated condition for 90 days. These results suggest that Polysorbate 80 stabilized LDC-NPs can be explored for treatment of meningeal leukemia owing to their ability of providing sustained drug release, stability and improved cytotoxicity in leukemic EL-4 cell line.","['Sharma, Pravin', 'Dube, Brahmanand', 'Sawant, Krutika']","['Sharma P', 'Dube B', 'Sawant K']","['Pharmacy Department, Centre for PG Studies and Research, TIFAC Centre of Relevance and Excellence in NDDS, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Fatehgunj, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,101230869,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Polysorbates)', '0 (Stearic Acids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4ELV7Z65AP (stearic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics', 'Delayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Particle Size', 'Polysorbates/administration & dosage', 'Stearic Acids/chemistry']",2012/10/04 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/10/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jbn.2012.1464 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Nanotechnol. 2012 Dec;8(6):928-37. doi: 10.1166/jbn.2012.1464.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several end-points related to toxicity, viz., viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular free calcium (Ca(2+)) and Ca(2+)-Mg(2+) -ATPase activity were measured. The results obtained in un-exposed and sham-exposed control cells were compared with those exposed to RF alone, DOX alone and RF+DOX. The results indicated no significant differences between un-exposed, sham-exposed control cells and those exposed to RF alone while treatment with DOX alone showed a significant decrease in viability, increased apoptosis, decreased MMP, increased Ca(2+) and decreased Ca(2+)-Mg(2+-)ATPase activity. When the latter results were compared with cells exposed RF+DOX, the data showed increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, increased MMP, decreased Ca(2+) and increased Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase activity. Thus, RF pre-exposure appear to protect the HL-60 cells from the toxic effects of subsequent treatment with DOX.

The purpose of this meta-analysis is to define the effect of p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism on hematological malignancies risk. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Through searching PubMed databases (or hand searching) up to April 2012 using the following MeSH terms and keywords: ""p53"", ""codon 72"" ""polymorphism"" and ""leukemia"", or ""lymphoma"", or ""myeloma"", thirteen were identified as eligible articles in this meta-analysis for p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism (2,731 cases and 7, 356 controls), including nine studies on leukemia (1,266 cases and 4, 474 controls), three studies on lymphoma (1,359 cases and 2,652 controls), and one study on myeloma. The overall results suggested that p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism was not associated with hematological malignancies risk. In stratified analyses, significantly increased non-Hodgkin lymphomas risk was found in p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism heterozygote model (Arg/Pro vs. Arg/Arg: OR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.02-1.35) and dominant model (Arg/Pro+Pro/Pro vs. Arg/Arg: OR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.03-1.34), but no significant association was found between leukemia risk and p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism. Further studies showed no association between leukemia risk and p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism when stratified in subtypes of leukemias, ethnicities and sources of controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This meta-analysis indicates that the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism may contribute to susceptibility to non-Hodgkin lymphomas.","['Weng, Yu', 'Lu, Liqin', 'Yuan, Guorong', 'Guo, Jing', 'Zhang, Zhizhong', 'Xie, Xinyou', 'Chen, Guangdi', 'Zhang, Jun']","['Weng Y', 'Lu L', 'Yuan G', 'Guo J', 'Zhang Z', 'Xie X', 'Chen G', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Univerisity School of Medicine, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Publication Bias', 'Risk', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0045820 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-10696 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45820. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045820.

Development of novel agents that address these challenges would therefore be of the upmost importance in the fight against cancer. In this regard, studies show that the antiapoptotic protein survivin is a central molecule involved in both hurdles. Using cancer cell-based survivin-reporter systems (US 7,569,221 B2) via high throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries, followed by in vitro and in vivo analyses of HTS-derived hit-lead compounds, we identified a novel anticancer compound (designated FL118). FL118 shows structural similarity to irinotecan. However, while the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase 1 activity by FL118 was no better than the active form of irinotecan, SN-38 at 1 microM, FL118 effectively inhibited cancer cell growth at less than nM levels in a p53 status-independent manner. Moreover, FL118 selectively inhibited survivin promoter activity and gene expression also in a p53 status-independent manner. Although the survivin promoter-reporter system was used for the identification of FL118, our studies revealed that FL118 not only inhibits survivin expression but also selectively and independently inhibits three additional cancer-associated survival genes (Mcl-1, XIAP and cIAP2) in a p53 status-independent manner, while showing no inhibitory effects on control genes. Genetic silencing or overexpression of FL118 targets demonstrated a role for these targets in FL118's effects. Follow-up in vivo studies revealed that FL118 exhibits superior antitumor efficacy in human tumor xenograft models in comparison with irinotecan, topotecan, doxorubicin, 5-FU, gemcitabine, docetaxel, oxaliplatin, cytoxan and cisplatin, and a majority of mice treated with FL118 showed tumor regression with a weekly x 4 schedule. FL118 induced favorable body-weight-loss profiles (temporary and reversible) and was able to eliminate large tumors. Together, the molecular targeting features of FL118 plus its superior antitumor activity warrant its further development toward clinical trials.","['Ling, Xiang', 'Cao, Shousong', 'Cheng, Qiuying', 'Keefe, James T', 'Rustum, Youcef M', 'Li, Fengzhi']","['Ling X', 'Cao S', 'Cheng Q', 'Keefe JT', 'Rustum YM', 'Li F']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0', ""(7-ethyl-7-hydroxy-10H-1,3-Dioxolo(4,5-g)pyrano(3',4':6,7)indolizino(1,2-b)quinol"", 'ine-8,11(7H,12H)-dione)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzodioxoles/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/*metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0045571 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-12340 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45571. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045571.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) represent one such class of anti-neoplastic agents. Despite great interest for clinical use, little is known regarding the molecular targets important for response to HDACi-based cancer therapy. We had previously shown that interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-8, originally discovered as a leukemia suppressor gene by regulating apoptosis, also regulates Fas-mediated killing in non-hematologic tumor models. Furthermore, we and others have shown that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in repression of IRF-8 in tumors. Therefore, in our preclinical tumor model, we tested the hypothesis that IRF-8 expression is important for response to HDACi-based antitumor activity. In the majority of experiments, we selected the pan-HDACi, Trichostatin A (TSA), because it was previously shown to restore Fas sensitivity to tumor cells. Overall, we found that: 1) TSA alone and more so in combination with IFN-gamma enhanced both IRF-8 expression and Fas-mediated death of tumor cells in vitro; 2) TSA treatment enhanced IRF-8 promoter activity via a STAT1-dependent pathway; and 3) IRF-8 was required for this death response, as tumor cells rendered IRF-8 incompetent were significantly less susceptible to Fas-mediated killing in vitro and to HDACi-mediated antitumor activity in vivo. Thus, IRF-8 status may underlie a novel molecular basis for response to HDACi-based antitumor treatment.","['Banik, Debarati', 'Khan, A Nazmul H', 'Walseng, Even', 'Segal, Brahm H', 'Abrams, Scott I']","['Banik D', 'Khan AN', 'Walseng E', 'Segal BH', 'Abrams SI']","['Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0045422 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-11725 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45422. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045422.

Mutations or deletions of SHOX in humans cause short stature in Turner, Langer and Leri-Weill syndrome as well as idiopathic short stature. During embryonic development, SHOX is expressed in a complex spatio-temporal pattern that requires the presence of specific regulatory mechanisms. Up to now, it was known that SHOX is regulated by two upstream promoters and several enhancers on either side of the gene, but no regulators have been identified that can activate or repress the transcription of SHOX by binding to these regulatory elements. We have now identified the homeodomain protein HOXA9 as a positive regulator of SHOX expression in U2OS cells. Using luciferase assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we could narrow down the HOXA9 binding site to two AT-rich sequences of 31 bp within the SHOX promoter 2. Virus-induced Hoxa9 overexpression in a chicken micromass model validated the regulation of Shox by Hoxa9 (negative regulation).

We and others could confirm that CF as well as various other PPs can induce apoptosis in a variety of cells, including human liver, breast and lung cancer cell lines. The present study was aimed at investigating the cytotoxic action of CF on a neoplastic line of different origin, the human T leukemia Jurkat cells. We observed that CF rapidly triggers an extensive and morphologically typical apoptotic process on Jurkat cells, though not in primary T cells, which is completely prevented by the polycaspase inhibitor zVADfmk. Gene silencing studies demonstrated that CF-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells is partially dependent on activation of caspase 2. Looking for a possible trigger of caspase 2 activation, we observed increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha and JNK in CF-treated cells. Moreover, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis was perturbed. Together, these findings are suggestive for the occurrence of ER stress, an event that is known to have the potential to activate caspase 2. The present observations demonstrate that CF induces in Jurkat cells a very fast and extensive apoptosis, that involves induction of ER stress and activation of caspases 2 and 3. Since apoptosis in Jurkat cells occurs at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of CF, the present findings encourage further in depth analysis in order to work out the potential implications of CF cytotoxcity on leukemic cells.","['Penna, Fabio', 'Pin, Fabrizio', 'Costamagna, Domiziana', 'Reffo, Patrizia', 'Baccino, Francesco Maria', 'Bonelli, Gabriella', 'Costelli, Paola']","['Penna F', 'Pin F', 'Costamagna D', 'Reffo P', 'Baccino FM', 'Bonelli G', 'Costelli P']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'HPN91K7FU3 (Clofibrate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Clofibrate/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2010/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0045327 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-05563 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45327. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045327.

Latexin caused growth inhibition of lymphoma cells by significantly increasing apoptosis through the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Pim-2.

However, a large number of subsequent studies failed to confirm a link between XMRV infection and CFS or prostate cancer. On the contrary, recent evidence indicates that XMRV is a contaminant originating from the recombination of two mouse endogenous retroviruses during passaging of a prostate tumor xenograft (CWR22) in mice, generating laboratory-derived cell lines that are XMRV-infected. To confirm or refute an association between XMRV and prostate cancer, we analyzed prostate cancer tissues and plasma from a prospectively collected cohort of 39 patients as well as archival RNA and prostate tissue from the original 2006 study. Despite comprehensive microarray, PCR, FISH, and serological testing, XMRV was not detected in any of the newly collected samples or in archival tissue, although archival RNA remained XMRV-positive. Notably, archival VP62 prostate tissue, from which the prototype XMRV strain was derived, tested negative for XMRV on re-analysis. Analysis of viral genomic and human mitochondrial sequences revealed that all previously characterized XMRV strains are identical and that the archival RNA had been contaminated by an XMRV-infected laboratory cell line.

This variability is important for the function of the different PML isoforms. PML NB formation requires the covalent linkage of SUMO to PML. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) enhances PML SUMOylation leading to an increase in PML NB size and promotes its interaction with RNF4, a poly-SUMO-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for proteasome-mediated PML degradation. Furthermore, the presence of a bona fide SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM) within the C-terminal region of PML seems to be required for recruitment of other SUMOylated proteins within PML NBs. This motif is present in all PML isoforms, except in the nuclear PMLVI and in the cytoplasmic PMLVII. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay in living cells, we found that As(2)O(3) enhanced the SUMOylation and interaction with RNF4 of nuclear PML isoforms (I to VI). In addition, among the nuclear PML isoforms, only the one lacking the SIM sequence, PMLVI, was resistant to As(2)O(3)-induced PML degradation. Similarly, mutation of the SIM in PMLIII abrogated its sensitivity to As(2)O(3)-induced degradation. PMLVI and PMLIII-SIM mutant still interacted with RNF4. However, their resistance to the degradation process was due to their inability to be polyubiquitinated and to recruit efficiently the 20S core and the beta regulatory subunit of the 11S complex of the proteasome in PML NBs. Such resistance of PMLVI to As(2)O(3)-induced degradation was alleviated by overexpression of RNF4. Our results demonstrate that the SIM of PML is dispensable for PML SUMOylation and interaction with RNF4 but is required for efficient PML ubiquitination, recruitment of proteasome components within NBs and proteasome-dependent degradation of PML in response to As(2)O(3).","['Maroui, Mohamed Ali', 'Kheddache-Atmane, Sabrina', 'El Asmi, Faten', 'Dianoux, Laurent', 'Aubry, Muriel', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K']","['Maroui MA', 'Kheddache-Atmane S', 'El Asmi F', 'Dianoux L', 'Aubry M', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['CNRS, FRE 3235, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0044949 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-00976 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44949. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0044949.

Advances in nanotechnology have proven beneficial in therapeutic fields such as drug-delivery and gene/protein delivery. Antigen delivery systems are important for inducing and modifying immune responses. In cellular immunity, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are important in the host defense against tumors. Key to the development of CTL-inducible vaccines is the ability to deliver antigens to antigen-presenting cells efficiently and to induce the subsequent activation of T cell-mediated immunity without adjuvants, as they can induce excessive inflammation leading to systemic febrile disease. Since expression and cloning methods for tumor-associated antigens have been reported, cancer vaccines that induce effective cell immunity may be promising therapeutic candidates, but Th2 cells are undesirable for use in cancer immunotherapy. Peptide vaccines have immunological and economic advantages as cancer vaccines because CTL epitope peptides from tumor-associated antigens have high antigen-specificity. However, cancer vaccines have had limited effectiveness in clinical responses due to the ability of cancer cells to ""escape"" from cancer immunity and a low efficiency of antigen-specific CTL induction due to immunogenic-free synthetic peptides. In contrast, carbohydrate-decorated particles such as carbohydrate-coated liposomes with encapsulated antigens might be more suitable as antigen delivery vehicles to antigen-presenting cells. Oligomannose-coated liposomes (OML) can eliminate established tumors in mouse cancer models. In addition, OMLs with an encased antigen can induce antigen-specific CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients. Feasibility studies of OML-based vaccines have revealed their potential for clinical use as vaccines for diseases where CTLs act as effector cells. Furthermore, use of the hepatitis B core particle, in which tumor-antigen epitopes are set, has consistently been shown to induce strong CTL responses without the use of an adjuvant. Thus, nanoparticles may provide a new prophylactic strategy for infectious disease and therapeutic approaches for cancer via the induction of T-cell immunity.","['Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Honda, Shin-Ichro', 'Soeda, Shinji']","['Kozako T', 'Arima N', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Honda SI', 'Soeda S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan. kozako@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Nanocapsules)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/*chemistry', 'Nanocapsules/*administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S30726 [doi]', 'ijn-7-4943 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2012;7:4943-51. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S30726.

However, persistence of HIV in reservoirs has necessitated lifelong treatment that can be complicated by cumulative toxicities, incomplete immune restoration, and the emergence of drug-resistant escape mutants. Cell and gene therapies offer the promise of preventing progressive HIV infection by interfering with HIV replication in the absence of chronic antiviral therapy. Individuals homozygous for a deletion in the CCR5 gene (CCR5Delta32) are largely resistant to infection from R5-topic HIV-1 strains, which are most commonly transmitted. A recent report that an HIV-infected patient with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia was effectively cured from HIV infection after transplantation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) from a CCR5Delta32 homozygous donor has generated renewed interest in developing treatment strategies that target viral reservoirs and generate HIV resistance in a patient's own cells. Although the development of cell-based and gene transfer therapies has been slow, progress in a number of areas is evident. Advances in the fields of gene-targeting strategies, T-cell-based approaches, and HSCs have been encouraging, and a series of ongoing and planned trials to establish proof of concept for strategies that could lead to successful cell and gene therapies for HIV are under way. The eventual goal of these studies is to eliminate latent viral reservoirs and the need for lifelong antiretroviral therapy.","['Hoxie, James A', 'June, Carl H']","['Hoxie JA', 'June CH']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. hoxie@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine,101571139,"['0 (Receptors, CCR5)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'HIV Infections/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, CCR5/*genetics', 'Virus Latency']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/04/02 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['2/10/a007179 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a007179 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2012 Oct 1;2(10). pii: 2/10/a007179. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a007179.,10.1101/cshperspect.a007179 [doi] a007179 [pii],20121001,,,PMC3475401,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3) is an immune inhibitory receptor expressed by myelomonocytic cells and at high levels by tolerogenic dendritic cells. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we analyzed the expression of ILT3 in 37 patients with AML and 20 patients with no detectable disease. RESULTS: We showed that ILT3 was expressed in all cases of AML displaying monocytic differentiation (FAB M4/M5; N = 18), but not in AML M1/M2 and M3 (N = 19; P < 0.0001). Co-expression of ILT3 and immature cell markers, such as CD34 and CD117, was observed in monoblastic leukemia. ILT3 expression was preserved after treatment in M4/M5 patients with refractory or relapsed disease. ILT3 expression was associated with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities linked to an intermediate prognosis (P = 0.001). Rare CD45dimCD34+CD117+ILT3+ cells were identified in noninvolved bone marrow, suggesting that ILT3 expression is acquired at an early stage by normal myelomonocytic precursors. CONCLUSIONS: ILT3 is a highly sensitive and specific marker which distinguishes AML with monocytic differentiation from other types of AML. Testing of ILT3 expression should be incorporated into the initial diagnostic work-up and monitoring of patients with AML.","['Dobrowolska, Hanna', 'Gill, Kamraan Z', 'Serban, Geo', 'Ivan, Elena', 'Li, Qing', 'Qiao, Pengyuan', 'Suciu-Foca, Nicole', 'Savage, David', 'Alobeid, Bachir', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Colovai, Adriana I']","['Dobrowolska H', 'Gill KZ', 'Serban G', 'Ivan E', 'Li Q', 'Qiao P', 'Suciu-Foca N', 'Savage D', 'Alobeid B', 'Bhagat G', 'Colovai AI']","['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

We analysed clinical-biological characteristics of 131 CLL patients carrying 11q deletion documented before therapy (de novo 11q deleted CLL). De novo 11q deleted CLL were characterized by high frequencies of unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy genes, multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization aberrations and lymph node involvement. Factors significantly associated with shorter time to first treatment (TTFT) were advanced Binet stages, high white blood cell count, increased beta2 -microglobulin levels, 17p in addition, splenomegaly and more extensive lymphadenopathy. We found that patients with <25% 11q deleted nuclei (n = 22) experienced longer TTFT compared with patients with >/=25% 11q deleted nuclei (n = 87; median TTFT, 40 vs. 14 months, p = 0.011) and also showed better response to treatments (complete response, 50% vs. 21%, p = 0.016).

Because most cases of mucormycosis are associated with contiguous rhinocerebral infection, only 5 cases of isolated musculoskeletal Rhizopus infection have been reported in the literature. One patient underwent hematopoietic cell transplant, which resulted in a fatal outcome.This article describes the successful treatment of isolated Rhizopus osteomyelitis in a patient who underwent hematopoietic cell transplant using a combined surgical and medical approach. A 33-year-old woman with pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent hematopoietic cell transplant with few complications but developed chronic graft-versus-host disease 8 months posttransplant. She was treated with high-dose steroids for 6 weeks before she was admitted for severe right tibial pain in the absence of trauma. Early detection, aggressive therapies, and a multidisciplinary surgical and medical team allowed for the microbiologically confirmed resolution of the infection. Treatment included multiagent antimicrobial therapy with amphotericin B, daptomycin, and ertapenem. Several surgical irrigation and debridement procedures were also performed, with the eventual placement of amphotericin-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate cement beads and small fragment titanium screws. The patient continued taking postoperative antifungal treatment for 7 months after discharge. Six months following the discontinuation of antifungal therapy, the team's multidisciplinary approach achieved a continued resolution of the patient's infection and a return to a fully ambulatory and radiographically proven recovery without limb loss.","['Vashi, Nikita', 'Avedian, Raffi', 'Brown, Janice', 'Arai, Sally']","['Vashi N', 'Avedian R', 'Brown J', 'Arai S']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California 94305, USA']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,7806107,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Debridement/*methods', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mucormycosis/*etiology/*surgery', 'Osteomyelitis/*etiology/*therapy', '*Rhizopus', 'Therapeutic Irrigation/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/01477447-20120919-30 [doi]'],ppublish,Orthopedics. 2012 Oct;35(10):e1556-61. doi: 10.3928/01477447-20120919-30.,10.3928/01477447-20120919-30 [doi],,,,,,,"['Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.']",,,,,,,,,,

The patient experienced right knee pain and swelling shortly after the initiation of chemotherapy. The radiological studies obtained showed subchondral collapse of the lateral femoral condyle. After a course of nonoperative management failed to improve symptoms, she underwent bone impaction allografting of the lateral femoral condyle using a physis-sparing approach. More than 5 years postoperatively, she has achieved excellent clinical results. Postoperative imaging of the knee has also confirmed good integration of the bone graft, an open physis, and preservation of the articular surface.

In 40 patients treated prophylactically with posaconazole for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between February 2009 and August 2010, PPCs were measured at day 7 of treatment and then twice weekly. Demographic data, clinical data (including gastrointestinal disorders, comedications, and treatment compliance), caloric and fat intake, and biological data were collected and evaluated. We obtained 275 measurements of PPCs, with a median of 430 ng/ml. PPCs were significantly lower in patients with mucositis (P < 0.001), nausea (P = 0.03), diarrhea (P = 0.03), or vomiting (P = 0.05). PPCs were higher in patients with a higher caloric intake (P = 0.02), while the proportion of fat intake had no influence on PPCs (P = 0.84). The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors decreased the PPCs (P = 0.02), while the use of tacrolimus increased the PPC (P = 0.03). In the multivariate analysis, the factors influencing the PPCs independently were the concomitant use of tacrolimus (P < 0.001), the presence of mucositis (P = 0.01), and food intake (P = 0.02). Our study confirmed the high variability of posaconazole bioavailability and showed the significant influence of gastrointestinal disorders, food intake, and concomitant medication on the PPCs.

Therefore, the current recommendation may be modified.","['Sanchez-Ortega, Isabel', 'Vazquez, Lourdes', 'Montes, Carmen', 'Patino, Beatriz', 'Arnan, Montserrat', 'Bermudez, Arancha', 'Yanez, Lucrecia', 'Caballero, Teresa', 'Duarte, Rafael F']","['Sanchez-Ortega I', 'Vazquez L', 'Montes C', 'Patino B', 'Arnan M', 'Bermudez A', 'Yanez L', 'Caballero T', 'Duarte RF']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cyclosporine/*blood', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/therapy', 'Triazoles/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.01489-12 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01489-12 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Dec;56(12):6422-4. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01489-12.

We did a systematic review of information about the distribution, determinants, and consequences of time to diagnosis of paediatric malignancies and compared these findings with those of court-appointed expert witnesses in malpractice claims in Canada and France. Time to diagnosis varied widely between tumour types in the 98 relevant studies (medians ranged from 2-260 weeks) without any significant decrease with time. Determinants of a long delay in diagnosis included older age, qualification of the first physician contacted, non-specific symptoms, histological type, and tumour localisation. Delayed diagnosis was associated with poor outcome for retinoblastoma and possibly for leukaemia, nephroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (data were insufficient for definitive conclusions). It was not associated with an adverse outcome for most CNS tumours, osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma, and, paradoxically, was frequently associated with better outcomes than was short time to diagnosis in these cancers. A third of the court-appointed experts provided testimony concordant with the medical literature. The relations between delay in diagnosis and outcome are complex and probably depend more on tumour biology than on parental or medical factors.","['Brasme, Jean-Francois', 'Morfouace, Michele', 'Grill, Jacques', 'Martinot, Alain', 'Amalberti, Rene', 'Bons-Letouzey, Catherine', 'Chalumeau, Martin']","['Brasme JF', 'Morfouace M', 'Grill J', 'Martinot A', 'Amalberti R', 'Bons-Letouzey C', 'Chalumeau M']","[""INSERM U953, Epidemiological Research Unit on Perinatal Health and Women's and Children's Health, Hopital Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris, France. jfbrasme@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

Because telomerase gene expression has been associated with worse outcome in non-small cell lung cancer, we hypothesized that identification of cells obtained from pleural lavage that express telomerase would identify patients at risk for recurrent disease. METHODS: Patients with presumed non-small cell lung cancer underwent thoracotomy with curative intent. Cells obtained by lavage of the pleural surfaces were analyzed for telomerase catalytic subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA expression using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients with stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer had adequate samples, and median follow-up was 60 months (17-91 months). By using Cox models, no statistical differences were found between human telomerase reverse transcriptase-negative and positive patients in disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.94; log-rank test, P = .2349) or overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.79; log-rank test, P = .5912) CONCLUSIONS: Detection of human telomerase reverse transcriptase in cells obtained from pleural lavage of patients with stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer does not identify patients at risk for recurrent disease.","['Boylan, Alice M', 'Wang, Xiaofei F', 'Ko, Richard', 'Watson, Patricia M', 'Gu, Lin', 'Harpole, David', 'Bueno, Raphael', 'Kelly, Rosemary', 'Kohman, Leslie', 'Kratzke, Robert']","['Boylan AM', 'Wang XF', 'Ko R', 'Watson PM', 'Gu L', 'Harpole D', 'Bueno R', 'Kelly R', 'Kohman L', 'Kratzke R']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. boylana@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pleura', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Therapeutic Irrigation']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5223(12)01074-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.08.059 [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2013 Jul;146(1):206-11. doi: 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.08.059.

With an established epidemiological link between CLL/SLL and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), there has been some interest in investigating a possible leukemogenic role of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), which is found in 80% of MCC cases. Recent studies have shown that MCPyV is present in lymphocytes in a small percentage of CLL/SLL cases, but the specific tropism for lymphocytes has not been well-established. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to investigate the presence of MCPyV in fluorescence activated cell sorted purified B- and T-cells from 23 CLL/SLL cases. Three of 23 cases (13%) had detectable MCPyV in T-cells, and none of the cases had detectable MCPyV in B-cells.

METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified 7,670 patients from 1973 to 1988 with primary pediatric malignancies. The relative risk of thyroid cancer in irradiated patients was calculated using the Poisson regression model, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for survival rates. RESULTS: The relative risk (RR) of thyroid cancer for children who received radiation was 2.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.29). It was highest for central nervous system cancer (RR = 4.47) and lowest for those with leukemia (RR = 1.75). Mortality was significantly reduced for patients who received radiation as children; the hazard ratio was .80 (95% CI, .75-.86). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation for pediatric malignancies increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer as a secondary malignancy; however, these patients had localized disease and lower 20-year mortality.","['Rose, Jessica', 'Wertheim, Betsy C', 'Guerrero, Marlon A']","['Rose J', 'Wertheim BC', 'Guerrero MA']","['Department of Surgery, University of Arizona School of Medicine, 1501 N Campbell Avenue, Office 4327, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg,American journal of surgery,0370473,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/mortality', 'Odds Ratio', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'SEER Program', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*etiology/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9610(12)00465-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.07.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Surg. 2012 Dec;204(6):881-6; discussion 886-7. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.07.030.

Successful detection and removal of positive LNs are crucial in the treatment of this disease. Current evaluation methods still have their limitations in detecting the presence of tumor cells in the LNs, where up to a third of clinically diagnosed metastasis-negative (N0) patients actually have metastasis-positive LNs in the neck. We developed a molecular signature in the primary tumor that could predict LN metastasis in OSCC. A total of 211 cores from 55 individuals were included in the study. Eleven proteins were evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis in a tissue microarray. Of the 11 biomarkers evaluated using receiver operating curve analysis, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (HER-2/neu), laminin, gamma 2 (LAMC2), and ras homolog family member C (RHOC) were found to be significantly associated with the presence of LN metastasis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering-demonstrated expression patterns of these 4 proteins could be used to differentiate specimens that have positive LN metastasis from those that are negative for LN metastasis. Collectively, EGFR, HER-2/neu, LAMC2, and RHOC have a specificity of 87.5% and a sensitivity of 70%, with a prognostic accuracy of 83.4% for LN metastasis. We also demonstrated that the LN signature could independently predict disease-specific survival (P = .036). The 4-protein LN signature validated in an independent set of samples strongly suggests that it could reliably distinguish patients with LN metastasis from those who were metastasis-free and therefore could be a prognostic tool for the management of patients with OSCC.","['Zanaruddin, Sharifah Nurain Syed', 'Saleh, Amyza', 'Yang, Yi-Hsin', 'Hamid, Sharifah', 'Mustafa, Wan Mahadzir Wan', 'Khairul Bariah, A A N', 'Zain, Rosnah Binti', 'Lau, Shin Hin', 'Cheong, Sok Ching']","['Zanaruddin SN', 'Saleh A', 'Yang YH', 'Hamid S', 'Mustafa WM', 'Khairul Bariah AA', 'Zain RB', 'Lau SH', 'Cheong SC']","['Oral Cancer Research Team, Cancer Research Initiatives Foundation, 2nd Floor Outpatient Centre, Sime Darby Medical Centre, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LAMC2 protein, human)', '0 (Laminin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RHOC protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoC GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Neck', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'rhoC GTP-Binding Protein']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/04/17 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(12)00226-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2012.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2013 Mar;44(3):417-26. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2012.06.007.

We developed a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method combined with liquid bead array cytometry for the rapid detection of genetic alterations associated with leukemia. Fusion transcripts corresponding to the most common recurrent chromosomal translocations were reproducibly detected in as low as 0.1-10 ng of total RNA with an analytical sensitivity of 0.01-1%. Multiday, multilot, multioperator, and multi-instrument precision studies, for a total of 678 independent measures in 46 runs, showed a very high reproducibility with 100% agreement among replicates. Using multiplex panels for four to 20 independent targets, we demonstrate the flexibility of the method to codetect rare splicing isoforms, discriminate among multiple variants generated by unique cytogenetic abnormalities, identify distinct chromosomal partners involved with 11q23 or 17q21 rearrangements, and assess cryptic abnormalities not detectable by standard cytogenetics such as the t(12;21), del(1p32), or NPM1 mutations. Overall, three different internal control transcripts and 34 variants resulting from 18 abnormal chromosomal sites were evaluated.

In the incorporation of dTTP into poly(rA)-p(dT)(45), the reaction rates of K4pol(L329A) and M1pol(WT) exhibited a saturated profile of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics for dTTP concentrations but a substrate inhibition profile for poly(rA)-p(dT)(45) concentrations. In contrast, the reaction rates of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) RT exhibited saturated profiles for both dTTP and poly(rA)-p(dT)(45) concentrations. This suggests that high concentrations of DNA-primed RNA template decrease the efficiency of cDNA synthesis with bacterial family A DNA polymerases.","['Yasukawa, Kiyoshi', 'Konishi, Atsushi', 'Shinomura, Mayu', 'Nagaoka, Eriko', 'Fujiwara, Shinsuke']","['Yasukawa K', 'Konishi A', 'Shinomura M', 'Nagaoka E', 'Fujiwara S']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. yasukawa@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Thermus thermophilus/*enzymology', 'Thymine Nucleotides/chemistry']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)01875-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.09.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Oct 26;427(3):654-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.09.116.

One family member, MCL-1, is unique because its expression is tightly regulated and it is essential for promoting the survival of myriad cellular lineages. Additionally, MCL-1 promotes the maintenance of normal mitochondrial morphology and energy production. Dissection of these functions revealed recently that they depend on separate mitochondrial sublocalizations. MCL-1's antiapoptotic activity is restricted to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), whereas its function in mitochondrial physiology requires localization to the matrix. These findings provide an attractive model for how MCL-1's diverse functions may contribute to normal cell homeostasis and function. MCL-1 is highly amplified in human cancer, suggesting that these functions may contribute to malignant cell growth and evasion of apoptosis.","['Perciavalle, Rhonda M', 'Opferman, Joseph T']","['Perciavalle RM', 'Opferman JT']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Trends Cell Biol,Trends in cell biology,9200566,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Humans', '*Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0962-8924(12)00163-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tcb.2012.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Cell Biol. 2013 Jan;23(1):22-9. doi: 10.1016/j.tcb.2012.08.011.

We have previously isolated an allorestricted MHC class I-restricted TCR with specificity for Formin-like protein 1 (FMNL1) with potent activity against chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells. CD4(+) T cells have been described to be highly important for tumour elimination although TCR derived from CD4(+) T cells with anti-tumour reactivity have been only rarely described. In this study we aimed to isolate MHC class-II-restricted CD4(+) T cells and TCR with specificity for leukaemia antigens. We used professional antigen-presenting cells pulsed with the leukaemia-associated and tumour-associated antigen FMNL1 for stimulation of autologous T cells in vitro. We isolated two CD4(+) HLA-DR-restricted T-cell clones and T-cell-derived TCR with so far unknown specificity but high reactivity against lymphoma cells and native malignant cells derived from HLA-matched patients with diverse leukaemias. Moreover, characterization of the TCR after TCR gene transfer revealed that specific characteristics of isolated TCR as reactivity in response to Toll-like receptors were transferable on effector cells. Our results have a major impact on the development of novel immunotherapies. They demonstrate that TCR with potent HLA-DR-restricted anti-leukaemic reactivity against so far undefined self-restricted antigens can be isolated from the healthy autorestricted CD4(+) T-cell repertoire and these TCR are highly interesting candidate tools for novel immunotherapies.","['Weigand, Luise U', 'Liang, Xiaoling', 'Schmied, Sabine', 'Mall, Sabine', 'Klar, Richard', 'Stotzer, Oliver J', 'Salat, Christoph', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Mautner, Josef', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Krackhardt, Angela M']","['Weigand LU', 'Liang X', 'Schmied S', 'Mall S', 'Klar R', 'Stotzer OJ', 'Salat C', 'Gotze K', 'Mautner J', 'Peschel C', 'Krackhardt AM']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Innere Medizin mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie und Onkologie, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology']",2012/10/03 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imm.12000 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2012 Nov;137(3):226-38. doi: 10.1111/imm.12000.,10.1111/imm.12000 [doi],,,,PMC3482680,,,['(c) 2012 The Authors.

We studied the clinical importance of retinoic acid early transcript-1 (RAET1) polymorphism in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) by determining the frequency of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individual RAET1 alleles in 371 patient-donor pairs and relating this to clinical outcome. A strong association was observed between the presence of five SNPs within the patient RAET1L (ULBP6) gene and relapse-free survival and overall survival. Two common alleles of RAET1L were determined and the presence of the protective RAET1L*02 allele in the patient was associated with a relapse-free survival of 44% at 8 years compared with just 25% in patients who lacked a RAET1L*02 allele (P < 0.001). Overall survival at this time was 55% in those with RAET1L*02 allele compared to 39% in patients who lacked a RAET1L*02 allele (P = 0.003). These novel findings indicate a critical role for NKG2D-RAET1L interactions in determining SCT clinical outcome and show RAET1L may have an important influence on regulating the strength of the alloreactive immune response.

Approximately 80% of them were B-cell lymphomas with a predominance of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in both nodal and extranodal sites. Our results were compatible with those in a previous study that was conducted in the central part of Japan. OBJECTIVES: This analysis was performed to describe the anatomic distribution of hematolymphoid malignancies that were diagnosed by biopsy in our department. METHODS: Clinical medical records of 122 patients with hematolymphoid malignancies in the head and neck from January 2004 to December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The anatomic site of origin according to the histopathology of each malignancy was analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence ratio of hematolymphoid malignancies was 15.1%. The male:female ratio was 2.3:1. Ages ranged from 17 to 89 years (median, 66). Of the 122 cases, 121 were lymphoid neoplasms (4 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 117 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and the remaining 1 was myeloid. The most common histopathology was DLBCL (54.9%), followed by follicular lymphoma (8.2%), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (8.2%). Most commonly, the oropharynx (36.1%) and the cervical lymph node (34.4%) were affected.","['Iguchi, Hiroyoshi', 'Wada, Tadashi', 'Matsushita, Naoki', 'Oishi, Masahiro', 'Yamane, Hideo']","['Iguchi H', 'Wada T', 'Matsushita N', 'Oishi M', 'Yamane H']","['Department of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. h-iguchi@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Otolaryngol,Acta oto-laryngologica,0370354,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth/pathology', 'Neck', 'Nose/pathology', 'Pharynx/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/03 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2012/10/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00016489.2012.694474 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Otolaryngol. 2012 Nov;132(11):1224-31. doi: 10.3109/00016489.2012.694474.

A relationship between alemtuzumab plasma levels, response and duration of lymphocytopenia was evident. We hypothesize that following combination therapy, the response may not be a function of the alemtuzumab levels, but the opposite, that plasma alemtuzumab levels are a function of the efficacy of the entire treatment, and the fewer leukemic target cells that are remaining, the higher are the levels of plasma alemtuzumab.

It has some unusual properties compared to other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and its expression and function are dynamically regulated by a variety of post-transcriptional and post-translational processes. Of note, Mcl-1 protein has a very short half life, and its stability and function may be regulated by reversible phosphorylation. There is also evidence to suggest that it may be localized to different subcellular compartments. The aim of this work was to determine whether residues within the PEST region of Mcl-1 that may undergo reversible phosphorylation, also regulate its subcellular distribution. We show that EGFP:Mcl-1 localizes mainly to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, with some additional cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. The mutations, S64A, S64E, S121A, S159A, T163A and T163E did not significantly affect the localization of Mcl-1. However, mutation of Ser162 to the phospho-null residue, Alanine resulted in an essentially nuclear localization, with some cytoplasmic but no mitochondrial localization. This mutant Mcl-1 protein, S162A, showed significantly decreased stability and it decreased the ability to protect against Bak-induced apoptosis. These data identify a new molecular determinant of Mcl-1 function, localization and stability that may be important for understanding the role of this protein in disease.","['Thomas, Luke W', 'Lam, Connie', 'Clark, Richard E', 'White, Michael R H', 'Spiller, David G', 'Moots, Robert J', 'Edwards, Steven W']","['Thomas LW', 'Lam C', 'Clark RE', 'White MR', 'Spiller DG', 'Moots RJ', 'Edwards SW']","['Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Codon', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/02/16 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0045088 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-07905 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45088. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045088.

The cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor and nitric oxide are both known to stimulate neuronal progenitor cell proliferation in the olfactory epithelium after injury. Our aim here was to determine whether these observations are independent, specifically, whether leukaemia inhibitory factor triggers neural precursor proliferation via the inducible nitric oxide synthase pathway. We evaluated the effects of leukaemia inhibitory factor on inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and cell proliferation in olfactory epithelial cell cultures and olfactory neurosphere-derived cells. Leukaemia inhibitory factor induced expression of iNOS and increased cell proliferation. An iNOS inhibitor and an anti-leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor blocking antibody inhibited leukaemia inhibitory factor-induced cell proliferation, an effect that was reversed by a NO donor. Altogether, the results strongly suggest that leukaemia inhibitory factor induces iNOS expression, increasing nitric oxide levels, to stimulate proliferation of olfactory neural precursor cells. This finding sheds light on neuronal regeneration occurring after injury of the olfactory epithelium.","['Lopez-Arenas, Estefania', 'Mackay-Sim, Alan', 'Bacigalupo, Juan', 'Sulz, Lorena']","['Lopez-Arenas E', 'Mackay-Sim A', 'Bacigalupo J', 'Sulz L']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/*genetics/metabolism', 'Olfactory Mucosa/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/02/16 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0045018 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-08039 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45018. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0045018.

B4GALT1 gene plays important roles in physiological process and disease development. In this study, we investigate the possible role and mechanism of B4GALT1 gene in multidrug resistance of human leukemia cell line. Significantly, higher expression of B4GALT1 was observed in adriamycin-resistant (ADR) K562 cell line (K562/ADR) than that in K562 cell line by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The activity of beta1, 4-Gal-T1 enzyme, and Galbeta-1,4GlcNAc structures on cell membrane glycoproteins was found at higher levels in K562/ADR cells than those in K562 cells. Further analysis of the B4GALT1 deregulation after using RNA interference approach showed that the silencing of B4GALT1 in K562/ADR cells resulted in increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs both in vitro and in vivo. The activity of the hedgehog signaling pathway affected the chemosensitivity of K562/ADR cells and was downregulated in K562/ADR cells with suppression of B4GALT1 gene. We hypothesize that B4GALT1 is responsible for the overcoming multidrug resistance in human leukemia therapy via regulating the activity of the hedgehog signaling pathway.","['Zhou, Huimin', 'Zhang, Zhaohai', 'Liu, Chunqing', 'Jin, Changgong', 'Zhang, Jianing', 'Miao, Xiaoyan', 'Jia, Li']","['Zhou H', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu C', 'Jin C', 'Zhang J', 'Miao X', 'Jia L']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galactosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/04/17 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/iub.1080 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2012 Nov;64(11):889-900. doi: 10.1002/iub.1080.

Quantitative real-time fluorescent PCR and western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of PHB. Flow cytometry and detection of enzymatic activity of caspase-3 by western blotting were employed to examine cell apoptosis. Our results provide evidence that the lentiviral vector pGCSIL-GFP-PHB was constructed successfully, and the PHB mRNA and the protein expression inhibitory rates were 90.3 and 95.8%, respectively. When compared to the control group, the activity of caspase-3 decreased significantly, which showed a 57.3% downregulation, and the apoptosis rate was reduced by 44.6% (P<0.05). In conclusion, downregulation of the PHB gene may inhibit apoptosis of NB4-R1 cells, and it is speculated that this was at least partly due to the downregulation of caspase-3, and PHB may be a novel target for gene therapy for retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Liu, Yanfeng', 'He, Pengcheng', 'Zhang, Mei', 'Wu, Di']","['Liu Y', 'He P', 'Zhang M', 'Wu D']","[""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, P.R.

Patients with WAS typically demonstrate micro-thrombocytopenia. PROCEDURES: The report describes seven male infants with WAS that initially presented with leukocytosis, monocytosis, and myeloid and erythroid precursors in the peripheral blood (PB) and dysplasia in the bone marrow (BM), which was initially indistinguishable from juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). RESULTS: The median age of affected patients was 1 month (range, 1-4 months). Splenomegaly was absent in four of these patients, which was unusual for JMML. A mutation analysis of genes in the RAS-signalling pathway did not support a diagnosis of JMML. Non-haematological features, such as eczema (n = 7) and bloody stools (n = 6), ultimately led to the diagnosis of WAS at a median age of 4 months (range, 3-8 months), which was confirmed by absent (n = 6) or reduced (n = 1) WASP expression in lymphocytes by flow cytometry (FCM) and a WASP gene mutation. Interestingly, mean platelet volume (MPV) was normal in three of five patients and six of seven patients demonstrated occasional giant platelets, which was not compatible with WAS. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that WAS should be considered in male infants presenting with JMML-like features if no molecular markers of JMML can be detected.","['Yoshimi, Ayami', 'Kamachi, Yoshiro', 'Imai, Kosuke', 'Watanabe, Nobuhiro', 'Nakadate, Hisaya', 'Kanazawa, Takashi', 'Ozono, Shuichi', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Yoshida, Misa', 'Kobayashi, Chie', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Sasahara, Yoji', 'Jakob, Marcus', 'Morio, Tomohiro', 'Ehl, Stephan', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte', 'Kojima, Seiji']","['Yoshimi A', 'Kamachi Y', 'Imai K', 'Watanabe N', 'Nakadate H', 'Kanazawa T', 'Ozono S', 'Kobayashi R', 'Yoshida M', 'Kobayashi C', 'Hama A', 'Muramatsu H', 'Sasahara Y', 'Jakob M', 'Morio T', 'Ehl S', 'Manabe A', 'Niemeyer C', 'Kojima S']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. ayami.yoshimi@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukocytosis/complications', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein/genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24359 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 May;60(5):836-41. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24359.

Here, we highlight important genetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis, clinical progression, and chemorefractoriness of CLL. All CLLs share a common gene expression profile that suggests derivation from antigen-experienced B cells, a model supported by frequent B cell receptor repertoire skewing and stereotypy. Many CLL patients carry mutated immuno-globulin heavy-chain variable genes, while approximately 35% harbor unmutated IgV genes, which are associated with an inferior outcome. Deletion of chromosome 13q14, which is the most common genetic mutation at diagnosis, is considered an initiating lesion that frequently results in disruption of the tumor suppressor locus DLEU2/MIR15A/MIR16A.

Testing combinations of such kinase inhibitors identified a strong synergy between danusertib and bosutinib that exclusively affected CML cells harboring BCR-ABL(T315I). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we applied a systems-level approach comprising phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and chemical proteomics. Data integration revealed that both compounds targeted Mapk pathways downstream of BCR-ABL, resulting in impaired activity of c-Myc. Using pharmacological validation, we assessed that the relative contributions of danusertib and bosutinib could be mimicked individually by Mapk inhibitors and collectively by downregulation of c-Myc through Brd4 inhibition.

In general, chromatin structure and function are mostly dictated by histone post-translational modifications. Thus, we have analyzed the histone signature in apoptotic cells, characterized by pronounced chromatin condensation. Here, H2B mono-acetylation, and H3K9 and H4 acetylation was significantly decreased in apoptotic cells, which maintained a high level of H3K9 methylation. This phenotype was independent of p53 function and distinct levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein. Interestingly, after etoposide treatment of leukemia and multiple myeloma cells, H3K9 and H4 hypoacetylation was accompanied by increased H3K9me2, but not H3K9me1 or H3K9me3. In adherent mouse fibroblasts, a high level of H3K9me3 and histone deacetylation in apoptotic bodies was likely responsible for the pronounced ( approximately 40%) recovery of GFP-HP1alpha and GFP-HP1beta after photobleaching. HP1 mobility in apoptotic cells appeared to be unique because limited exchange after photobleaching was observed for other epigenetically important proteins, including GFP-JMJD2b histone demethylase ( approximately 10% fluorescence recovery) or Polycomb group-related GFP-BMI1 protein ( approximately 20% fluorescence recovery).

However, it also shows substantial anti-cancer activity in individuals with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Unfortunately, As(2)O(3)-treated leukemia patients suffer hepatotoxicity. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to have efficient antioxidant and antineoplastic activities. The study that how As(2)O(3) in combination with resveratrol affects hepatotoxicity and arsenic accumulation in the liver is lacking, and the present study tackles this question. Wistar rats were injected with 3mg/kg As(2)O(3) on alternate days; resveratrol (8mg/kg) was administered 1h before As(2)O(3). Rats were killed on the 8th day to determine histological liver damage, the antioxidant enzymes in serum, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and arsenic accumulation in the liver. In the resveratrol+As(2)O(3) group, activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase in serum and GSH/GSSG were significantly increased, histopathological effects were reduced, and arsenic accumulation markedly decreased in the liver, compared with the As(2)O(3)-treated group. Thus, resveratrol attenuated As(2)O(3)-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and arsenic accumulation in the liver. These data suggest that use of resveratrol as post-remission therapy of APL and adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic exposure to arsenic may decrease arsenic hepatotoxicity.","['Zhang, Weiqian', 'Xue, Jiangdong', 'Ge, Ming', 'Yu, Meiling', 'Liu, Lian', 'Zhang, Zhigang']","['Zhang W', 'Xue J', 'Ge M', 'Yu M', 'Liu L', 'Zhang Z']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ULW86O013H (Glutathione Disulfide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Arsenic/pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects', 'Catalase/blood', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Disulfide/metabolism', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/*adverse effects/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/blood']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(12)00696-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2012.09.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2013 Jan;51:87-92. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2012.09.023.

We analyzed 670 microRNAs in seven patients with t(8;16) AML and 113 with other AML subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that all t(8;16) AML patients grouped in an independent cluster. Supervised analysis revealed a distinctive signature of 94-microRNAs, most of which were downregulated, including miR-21 and cluster miR-17-92. The mRNA expression analysis of two known transcription factors of these microRNAs (STAT3 and c-Myc, respectively) showed significant downregulation of STAT3 (P=0.04). A bioinformatic analysis showed that 29 of the downregulated microRNAs might be regulated by methylation; we treated a t(8;16) AML sample with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC) and trichostatin A and found that 27 microRNAs were re-expressed after treatment. However, there was no difference in methylation status between t(8;16) and other AML subtypes, either overall or in the microRNA promoter. Cross-correlation of mRNA and microRNA expression identified RET as a potential target of several microRNAs.

Now, we present the results of the proteomic analysis of SAHA effects on leukemic cell lines using 2-DE and ProteomLab PF2D system. Histone acetylation at all studied acetylation sites reached the maximal level after 5 to 10 h of SAHA treatment. No difference in histone acetylation between subtoxic and toxic SAHA doses was observed. SAHA treatment induced cofilin phosphorylation at Ser3, an increase in vimentin and paxillin expression and a decrease in stathmin expression as confirmed by western-blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. The interaction of cofilin with 14-3-3 epsilon was documented using both Duolink system and coimmunoprecipitation. However, this interaction was independent of cofilin Ser3 phosphorylation and the amount of 14-3-3-epsilon-bound cofilin did not rise following SAHA treatment. SAHA-induced increase in the cell adhesivity was associated with an increase in PAK phosphorylation in CML-T1 cells and was abrogated by simultaneous treatment with IPA-3, a PAK inhibitor. The effects of SAHA on JURL-MK1 cells were similar to those of other histone deacetylase inhibitors, tubastatin A and sodium butyrate. The proteome analysis also revealed several potential non-histone targets of histone deacetylases.","['Grebenova, D', 'Roselova, P', 'Pluskalova, M', 'Halada, P', 'Rosel, D', 'Suttnar, J', 'Brodska, B', 'Otevrelova, P', 'Kuzelova, K']","['Grebenova D', 'Roselova P', 'Pluskalova M', 'Halada P', 'Rosel D', 'Suttnar J', 'Brodska B', 'Otevrelova P', 'Kuzelova K']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vorinostat']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(12)00658-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2012.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2012 Dec 21;77:406-22. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.09.014.

Despite important advances in our understanding of Notch signal transduction, the regulation of Notch functions in the nucleus remains unclear. Using immunoaffinity purification, we identified NOTCH1 nuclear partners in T-ALL cells and showed that, beyond the well-characterized core activation complex (ICN1-CSL-MAML1), NOTCH1 assembles a multifunctional complex containing the transcription coactivator AF4p12, the PBAF nucleosome remodeling complex, and the histone demethylases LSD1 and PHF8 acting through their demethylase activity to promote epigenetic modifications at Notch-target genes. Remarkably, LSD1 functions as a corepressor when associated with CSL-repressor complex and as a NOTCH1 coactivator upon Notch activation. Our work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern Notch transcriptional activity and represents glimpse into NOTCH1 interaction landscape, which will help in deciphering mechanisms of NOTCH1 functions and regulation.","['Yatim, Ahmad', 'Benne, Clarisse', 'Sobhian, Bijan', 'Laurent-Chabalier, Sabine', 'Deas, Olivier', 'Judde, Jean-Gabriel', 'Lelievre, Jean-Daniel', 'Levy, Yves', 'Benkirane, Monsef']","['Yatim A', 'Benne C', 'Sobhian B', 'Laurent-Chabalier S', 'Deas O', 'Judde JG', 'Lelievre JD', 'Levy Y', 'Benkirane M']","['INSERM U955, Creteil, France. ahmad.yatim@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAML1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (PHF8 protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1097-2765(12)00740-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2012.08.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2012 Nov 9;48(3):445-58. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2012.08.022.

DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation unit within a tertiary referral-based cancer center. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with BMT (131) who were admitted a total of 147 times to inpatient rehabilitation between January 1, 2002, and April 30, 2010. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analyzed RTP service and demographic information, cancer characteristics, medications, hospital admission characteristics, and laboratory values. RESULTS: A total of 61 (41%) of 147 of BMT admissions were transferred from the inpatient rehabilitation unit back to the primary service. Of those transferred back, 23 (38%) of 61 died after being transferred back to the primary service. Significant or near-significant relationships were found for a platelet count of <43,000 per microliter (P<.01); a creatinine level of >0.9 milligrams/deciliter (P<.01); the presence of an antiviral agent (P=.0501); the presence of an antibacterial agent (P=.0519); the presence of an antifungal agent (P<.05); and leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma diagnosis (P<.05). Using 5 of these factors, the RTP-BMT index was formulated to determine the likelihood of return to the primary team. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BMT have a high rate of transfer from the inpatient rehabilitation unit back to the primary service. The RTP-BMT index score can be a useful tool to help clinicians predict the likelihood of return to the primary acute care service.","['Fu, Jack B', 'Lee, Jay', 'Smith, Dennis W', 'Guo, Ying', 'Bruera, Eduardo']","['Fu JB', 'Lee J', 'Smith DW', 'Guo Y', 'Bruera E']","['Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jfu@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2985158R,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*rehabilitation', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Creatinine/analysis', 'Female', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', '*Patient Transfer', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/04/09 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-9993(12)00927-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.apmr.2012.08.219 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2013 Feb;94(2):356-61. doi: 10.1016/j.apmr.2012.08.219.

(P)RR function involves signalling via the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) as well as the furin-mediated generation of vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase)-associated and soluble (P)RR isoforms. Recently, the (P)RR was described as adaptor protein of Wnt (co)receptors. The aim of this study was to analyse the contribution of these distinct (P)RR functions to Wnt signalling. Using Tcf/Lef reporter gene systems in HEK293T and HepG2 cells and quantification of endogenous axin2 mRNA and protein levels in HEK293T cells we were able to demonstrate that full-length (P)RR acts as a repressor of Wnt signalling in a system preactivated either by Wnt3a stimulation or by constitutively active beta-catenin. These repressive effects are mediated by Dvl but are independent of the mutation status of beta-catenin. Furthermore, the V-ATPase complex, but not PLZF translocation or renin enzymatic activity, is necessary for the induction of Tcf/Lef-responsive genes by Wnt3a. Our data indicate interference of (P)RR and Wnt cascades, a fact that has to be considered concerning pathophysiology of cardio-renal and oncological entities as well as in drug development programs targeting (P)RR or Wnt pathways.","['Bernhard, Sarah M', 'Seidel, Kerstin', 'Schmitz, Jennifer', 'Klare, Sabrina', 'Kirsch, Sebastian', 'Schrezenmeier, Eva', 'Zaade, Daniela', 'Meyborg, Heike', 'Goldin-Lang, Petra', 'Stawowy, Philipp', 'Zollmann, Frank S', 'Unger, Thomas', 'Funke-Kaiser, Heiko']","['Bernhard SM', 'Seidel K', 'Schmitz J', 'Klare S', 'Kirsch S', 'Schrezenmeier E', 'Zaade D', 'Meyborg H', 'Goldin-Lang P', 'Stawowy P', 'Zollmann FS', 'Unger T', 'Funke-Kaiser H']","['Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (prorenin receptor)', '88899-55-2 (bafilomycin A1)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00651-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Dec 15;84(12):1643-50. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.020.

Myeloid cells are known to manifest a wide spectrum of activities such as immune surveillance and tissue remodeling. Irregularities in myeloid cell development and their function are known to associate with the onset and the progression of a variety of human disorders such as leukemia. In the past decades, extensive studies have been carried out in various model organisms to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying myelopoiesis with the hope that these efforts will yield knowledge translatable into therapies for related diseases. Zebrafish has recently emerged as a prominent animal model for studying myelopoiesis, especially during early embryogenesis, largely owing to its unique properties such as transparent embryonic body and external development. This review introduces the methodologies used in zebrafish research and focuses on the recent research progresses of zebrafish myelopoiesis.","['Xu, Jin', 'Du, Linsen', 'Wen, Zilong']","['Xu J', 'Du L', 'Wen Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",China,J Genet Genomics,Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,101304616,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', '*Embryonic Development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Monocytes/cytology', '*Myelopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Zebrafish/*embryology']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1673-8527(12)00132-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jgg.2012.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Genet Genomics. 2012 Sep 20;39(9):435-42. doi: 10.1016/j.jgg.2012.06.005.

METHODS: The results were evaluated with traditional statistical methods and with our newly developed Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA) method. We collected genomic DNA and clinical data from 543 children, who underwent chemotherapy due to ALL, and 529 healthy controls. Altogether 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 candidate genes were genotyped. RESULTS: With logistic regression, we identified 6 SNPs in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes associated with increased risk to B-cell ALL, and two SNPs in the STAT3 gene, which decreased the risk to hyperdiploid ALL. Because the associated SNPs were in linkage in each gene, these associations corresponded to one signal per gene. The odds ratio (OR) associated with the tag SNPs were: OR = 1.69, P = 2.22x10(-7) for rs4132601 (IKZF1), OR = 1.53, P = 1.95x10(-5) for rs10821936 (ARID5B) and OR = 0.64, P = 2.32x10(-4) for rs12949918 (STAT3). With the BN-BMLA we confirmed the findings of the frequentist-based method and received additional information about the nature of the relations between the SNPs and the disease. E.g. the rs10821936 in ARID5B and rs17405722 in STAT3 showed a weak interaction, and in case of T-cell lineage sample group, the gender showed a weak interaction with three SNPs in three genes. In the hyperdiploid patient group the BN-BMLA detected a strong interaction among SNPs in the NOTCH1, STAT1, STAT3 and BCL2 genes. Evaluating the survival rate of the patients with ALL, the BN-BMLA showed that besides risk groups and subtypes, genetic variations in the BAX and CEBPA genes might also influence the probability of survival of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we confirmed the roles of genetic variations in ARID5B and IKZF1 in the susceptibility to B-cell ALL. With the newly developed BN-BMLA method several gene-gene, gene-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype connections were revealed. We showed several advantageous features of the new method, and suggested that in gene association studies the BN-BMLA might be a useful supplementary to the traditional frequentist-based statistical method.","['Lautner-Csorba, Orsolya', 'Gezsi, Andras', 'Semsei, Agnes F', 'Antal, Peter', 'Erdelyi, Daniel J', 'Schermann, Geza', 'Kutszegi, Nora', 'Csordas, Katalin', 'Hegyi, Marta', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Falus, Andras', 'Szalai, Csaba']","['Lautner-Csorba O', 'Gezsi A', 'Semsei AF', 'Antal P', 'Erdelyi DJ', 'Schermann G', 'Kutszegi N', 'Csordas K', 'Hegyi M', 'Kovacs G', 'Falus A', 'Szalai C']","['Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linkage Disequilibrium/genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', '*Multilevel Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-5-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-5-42 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2012 Sep 28;5:42. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-5-42.,10.1186/1755-8794-5-42 [doi],20120928,,,PMC3542204,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, NPM1 mutations were analyzed using the highly sensitive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) method on fluorescence-activated cell-sorted (FACS) purified different circulating mature cell populations in patients with NPM1-mutated CN-AML. As expected, NPM1 mutations were found in myeloid blood cells, including CD14(+) monocytes and CD66b(+) granulocytes. However, we were also able to detect NPM1 mutations in CD19(+) B cells and CD3(-)14(-)16(+)56(+) natural killer (NK) cells, albeit at lower levels.

Low serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) concentration may represent a risk factor for infection in leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy. This study evaluates the relationship between serum levels of MASP-2 with neutropenic febrile attacks in children with leukemia. METHOD: This prospective cohort study conducted between 2009-2010, we measured baseline serum MASP-2 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) prior to chemotherapy in leukemia patients less than 14 years of age. The relationship of febrile neutropenia (FN) episodes and duration of hospitalization with MASP-2 concentration was analyzed. RESULTS: We evaluated 75 children [38 girls (51%), 37 boys (49%); mean age, 61.6 +/- 43.7 months]. There were 8 (10.7%) children with MASP-2 deficiency (< 200 ng/mL). Mean MASP-2 was 673.2 +/- 288.7 ng/mL (range: 116-1112). Eight patients had no FN episodes. Of the 129 FN episodes recorded, 19 (average 2.4 times) were from the MASP-2deficient group and 110 (average 1.6 times) were in the normal group. There was a significant difference between the mean MASP-2 concentration and FN episodes (P = 0.043). There was an inverse relationship between FN episodes (r = -0.332, P = 0.004) and the duration of hospitalization (r = -0.334, P = 0.005) with MASP-2 concentration. MASP-2 deficient patients were hospitalized longer than the normal group, which was strongly significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the results of several previous studies. MASP-2 de fi ciency in leukemic children treated with chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of FN episodes, prolonged cumulative duration of hospitalization, and intravenous antimicrobial therapy.","['Nazari, Shiva', 'Ebrahimi, Mohsen', 'Abdollah Gorji, Fatemeh', 'Abadi, Alireza', 'Fahimzad, Alireza']","['Nazari S', 'Ebrahimi M', 'Abdollah Gorji F', 'Abadi A', 'Fahimzad A']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Pediatric Infectious Research Center (PIRC), Mofid Children's Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shnazari2000@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['EC 3.4.21.- (MASP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fever/*enzymology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases/*analysis', 'Neutropenia/*enzymology/etiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['009 [pii]', '0121510/AIM.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2012 Oct;15(10):625-8. doi: 0121510/AIM.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to lower the risk of such complications, patients should take special care of their oral hygiene. The aim of this study was to assess the oral hygiene status in children with ALL during anti-cancer treatment protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 78 children with ALL who were examined in 3 stages, and 78 generally healthy children, who constituted the control group, participated in the study. In the group of patients were 55 children from the rural environment and 23 children living in towns. Oral hygiene status was assessed with the use of the Oral Hygiene Simplified Index, Plaque Index, and Gingival Index. RESULTS: The average value of OHI-S index in children with ALL before the chemotherapy was 0.64 +/- 0.85, the value of the Pl.I index was 0.59 +/- 0.74, GI index value was 0.08 +/- 0.34. In the period from 0.5-1.5 years, the anti-cancer therapy value indicators of oral hygiene in children with ALL developed as follows: OHI-S--0.49 +/- 0.69, Pl.I--0.49 +/- 0.67, GI--0.02 +/- 0.13. CONCLUSIONS: Oral hygiene was significantly better in children with ALL than in children in the control group. The better condition of oral hygiene in children with ALL than children in the control group is the result of the oral hygiene regime that the children were following during cancer treatment protocols. Significantly higher GI in children with ALL, compared to children from the control group, was observed despite the better oral hygiene.","['Pels, Elzbieta', 'Mielnik-Blaszczak, Maria']","['Pels E', 'Mielnik-Blaszczak M']","['Department of Paedodontics, Medical University, Lublin, Poland. elzbieta.pels@umlub.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Ann Agric Environ Med,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,9500166,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dental Plaque Index', 'Humans', '*Oral Health', 'Oral Hygiene Index', 'Periodontal Index', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Rural Population', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors', 'Urban Population']",2012/10/02 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/10/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['1011076 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Agric Environ Med. 2012;19(3):529-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The RAL subjects, who were completely released after one standard chemotherapeutic course of the National Support Scheme (Chinese medicine interventions and standard chemotherapy of Western medicine in the peri-chemotherapy) were followed-up to get knowledge of the sustained remission time, the survival time, the relapse rate, and the morbidity. RESULTS: Totally 41 patients were finally accounted into the statistics, 20 in the treatment group and 21 in the control group. The sustained remission time was 172 days in the treatment group and 115 days in the control group, the median survival time was 363 days and 201 days respectively. The relapse rate of the treatment group within 3 months, 6 months,1 year, and the total relapse rate was 30.0%, 50.0%, 70.0%, and 90.0%, respectively, lower than that of the control group (being 42.8%, 76.2%, 90.5%, 90.5%, respectively). The mortality rate of the treatment group was 80.0%, 5.7% lower than that of the control group (85.7%).

The Mcl-1 promoter activators (TPA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) enhanced neoplastic transformation of JB6 cells and this response was accompanied by enhanced expression of Mcl-1, and knockdown of Mcl-1 by RNA interference (RNAi) decreased JB6 cell transformation. In the same cell line, we also demonstrated that mithramycin A (Mith) decreased TPA-induced JB6 cell transformation and Mcl-1 expression. Mcl-1 was overexpressed in human oral tumors compared with normal oral mucosa and also in several OSCC cell lines including HN22 and HSC-4 cells. Treatment of these cells with Mith also decreased Mcl-1 expression and neoplastic cell transformation, and this was accompanied by induction of several markers of apoptosis. Knockdown of Mcl-1 by RNAi also induced apoptotic cell death. The downregulation of Mcl-1 by Mith and RNAi increased pro-apoptotic protein Bax, resulting in the Bax translocation into mitochondria and its oligomerization. Mith also suppressed tumor growth in vivo and induced apoptosis in tumor by also regulating expression of Mcl-1 and Bax proteins. These indicate a critical role for Mcl-1 in the growth and survival of OSCC and demonstrate that Mith may be a potential anticancer drug candidate for clinical treatment of OSCC.","['Shin, Ji-Ae', 'Jung, Ji-Youn', 'Ryu, Mi Heon', 'Safe, Stephen', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Shin JA', 'Jung JY', 'Ryu MH', 'Safe S', 'Cho SD']","['Assistant Professor, Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, 561-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '97666-60-9 (mithramycin A)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mouth Mucosa/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Plicamycin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polymerization', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*agonists/metabolism']",2012/09/29 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/09/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.081364 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.081364 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Jan;83(1):33-41. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.081364.

The monocytes can be separated by their bright expression of either CD33 or CD64. This paper compares the utility of CD33- vs CD64-based monocyte gating in flow cytometric testing for PNH. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen cases tested for PNH by flow cytometry were included in the study. Both the total number of monocytes and the number of GPI-deficient monocytes gated with CD33 or CD64 were compared. The clustering pattern and any other unusual patterns were noted and investigated. RESULTS: CD64 staining showed more distinct separation of the monocyte cluster than did CD33 staining. The difference between the number of monocytes gated by CD33 and CD64 staining ranged from -26 to +32% (median 1.60%, average 1.69%). Six patients had GPI-deficient monocytes by both CD33- and CD64-based gating, ranging from 0.02 to 83.23%. There were no patients who showed GPI-deficient monocytes by one but not the other gating. The presence of blasts in patients with acute leukemia resulted in abnormal cluster patterns, both by CD33- and CD64-based gating. CONCLUSIONS: CD64-based gating showed more distinct clustering of monocytes than CD33-based gating, allowing for objective separation. The number of monocytes in total and GPI-deficient monocytes derived from both gating strategies was comparable.","['Dalal, Bakul I', 'Khare, Nikisha S']","['Dalal BI', 'Khare NS']","['Division of Laboratory Hematology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Published data in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes have shown that the development of monocytosis in the course of myelodysplastic syndromes is associated with a poor prognosis. A similar occurrence has been only sporadically reported in patients with primary myelofibrosis. Over a period of four years we identified 10 out of 237 cases of primary myelofibrosis who developed persistent absolute monocytosis (>1 x 10(9)/l) during the course of disease (5 men and 5 women; median age/range: 68 years/52-82). Monocytosis developed at a median interval of 42 months from diagnosis (range: 1-180) and persisted for a median period of 23 months (range: 2-57). Five patients died after developing monocytosis (range: 20-188 months) and two experienced worsening disease and became transfusion dependent. Monocytosis was associated with increased white blood cells, decreased hemoglobin, decreased platelet count, and the presence of circulating blasts. In three cases, bone marrow biopsies after the onset of monocytosis showed marked myelomonocytic proliferation with morphological shifting from a typical primary myelofibrosis marrow appearance to aspects compatible with an overt 'secondary' chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Before the development of monocytosis, 5 of 10 patients carried the JAK2V617F mutation; five patients showed karyotypic alterations. No change in JAK2 mutational status or cytogenetic evolution were associated with the development of monocytosis.

Amyloidosis can be localized or systemic and may affect any organ. Breast involvement by amyloidosis has rarely been reported. In this study, we described the characteristics of 40 cases of breast amyloidosis that were reviewed at the Division of Anatomic Pathology at Mayo Clinic from 1995 to 2011. The cohort included 39 women and 1 man with a mean age of 60 years. The type of amyloidosis, determined by immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry-based proteomics in 26 patients, was immunoglobulin-associated in all cases (AL-kappa type in 15 (58%) cases, AL-lambda in 10 (38%) and mixed heavy and light chains (AH/AL) in 1 (4%) case). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was able to determine the type of amyloidosis in 95% of cases tested compared with 69% of cases by immunohistochemistry. In addition to amyloidosis, the breast biopsy showed a hematologic disorder in 55% of cases, most commonly MALT lymphoma. One patient had concurrent intraductal carcinoma, but none had invasive carcinoma. Of the 15 patients seen in our institution, 53% had localized amyloidosis and 47% had extramammary amyloid involvement, which was diagnosed before breast amyloidosis in most patients. M-spike was detected in the blood in 62%. After a median follow-up of 33.5 months in 12 patients, 5 died, mostly of complications of lymphoma or leukemia. In conclusion, our findings indicate that breast amyloidosis is of the AL type in the vast majority of patients (usually kappa). It is associated with systemic amyloidosis in close to half of patients and with hematologic malignancy in the breast in over half of patients. Therefore, further work up to rule out hematologic malignancy and/or systemic amyloidosis is recommended. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is superior to immunohistochemistry for typing of breast amyloidosis.","['Said, Samar M', 'Reynolds, Carol', 'Jimenez, Rafael E', 'Chen, Beiyun', 'Vrana, Julie A', 'Theis, Jason D', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Shah, Sejal S']","['Said SM', 'Reynolds C', 'Jimenez RE', 'Chen B', 'Vrana JA', 'Theis JD', 'Dogan A', 'Shah SS']","['Division of Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. said.samar@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amyloidosis/complications/*pathology', 'Breast/*pathology', 'Breast Diseases/complications/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/09/29 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2012/09/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2012167 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2012.167 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2013 Feb;26(2):232-8. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2012.167.

Five hundred fifty-three cases had a normal karyotype (NK) and 187 had intermediate risk aberrant cytogenetics. Overall, ASXL1mut were detected in 127/740 patients (17.2%). ASXL1mut were more frequent in males than in females (23.5% vs 9.9%, P<0.001). They were associated with higher age (median: 71.8 vs 61.8, P<0.001), a history of preceding myelodysplastic syndromes, and with a more immature immunophenotype compared with patients with wild-type ASXL1 (ASXL1wt). ASXL1mut were more frequent in patients with aberrant karyotype (58/187; 31.0%), especially in cases with trisomy 8 (39/74; 52.7%), than in those with NK (69/553; 12.5%; P<0.001). ASXL1mut were observed more frequent in RUNX1mut (P<0.001), and less frequent in NPM1mut (P<0.001), FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (P<0.001), FLT3-TKD (P=0.001) and DNMT3Amut (P<0.001). Patients with ASXL1mut had a shorter overall survival (OS) (P<0.001) and event free survival (P=0.012) compared with ASXL1wt. In multivariable analysis, ASXL1mut was an independent adverse factor for OS (P=0.032, relative risk: 1.70).

Molecular targeting success of this magnitude has yet to be repeated for most solid tumors. To answer why imatinib remains an exception of cancer research, we summarize key features and patterns of evolution that contrast CML-CP from prostate cancer, an example of a solid tumor that also shares a signature fusion gene. Distinctive properties of CML-CP include: a large cell population size that is not geographically constrained, a highly penetrant dominant oncogene that sweeps the entire cell population, subsequent progressive and ordered clonal genetic changes, and the effectiveness of molecular targeting within the chronic phase, which is comparable to the benign phase of solid tumors. CML-CP progression resembles a clonal, stepwise model of evolution, whereas the pattern of solid tumor evolution is highly dynamic and stochastic. The distinguishing features and evolutionary pattern of CML-CP support why the success of imatinib does not carry over to most solid tumors. Changing the focus of cancer research from a gene-based view to a genome-based theory will provide insight into solid tumor evolutionary dynamics.","['Horne, Steven D', 'Stevens, Joshua B', 'Abdallah, Batoul Y', 'Liu, Guo', 'Bremer, Steven W', 'Ye, Christine J', 'Heng, Henry H Q']","['Horne SD', 'Stevens JB', 'Abdallah BY', 'Liu G', 'Bremer SW', 'Ye CJ', 'Heng HH']","['Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2012/09/29 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24233 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2013 Apr;228(4):665-70. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24233.,10.1002/jcp.24233 [doi],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Silencing of pre-B cell leukemia transcription factors (PBXs) expression in P19 cells (AS cells) results in a failure of these cells to differentiate to endodermal cells upon RA treatment. Chicken Ovalbumin Upstream Promoter Transcription Factor I (COUP-TFI) is an orphan member of the steroid-thyroid hormone superfamily. RA treatment of wild type P19 cells results in a dramatic increase in the expression of COUP-TFI; however, COUP-TFI mRNA levels fail to be elevated upon RA treatment of AS cells indicating that PBX expression is required for elevation in COUP-TFI expression. To study the role of COUP-TFI during RA-dependent differentiation of P19 cells, AS cells that inducibly express various levels of COUP-TFI were prepared. Exogenous expression of COUP-TFI in AS cells, in a dose-dependent fashion, leads to growth inhibition, modest cell cycle disruption, and early apoptosis. Furthermore, AS cells can overcome the blockage in RA-dependent differentiation to endodermal cells when either pharmacological levels of COUP-TFI are expressed or a combination of both the expression of physiological levels of COUP-TFI and RA treatment. Additionally, the mRNA level of several pluripotency associated genes including OCT-4, DAX-1, and SF-1 in the COUP-TFI expressing AS cells are reduced. Moreover, analysis of the expression of primary RA response genes indicates that COUP-TFI is involved in the regulatory modulation of the expression of at least two genes, CYP26A1 and HoxA1. These studies demonstrate that COUP-TFI functions as a physiologically relevant regulator during RA-mediated endodermal differentiation of P19 cells.","['Pickens, Brandy S', 'Teets, Bryan W', 'Soprano, Kenneth J', 'Soprano, Dianne Robert']","['Pickens BS', 'Teets BW', 'Soprano KJ', 'Soprano DR']","['Departments of Biochemistry, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (COUP Transcription Factor I)', '0 (COUP Transcription Factor II)', '0 (DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nr0b1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nr2f2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Steroidogenic Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cyp26a1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'COUP Transcription Factor I/*genetics/metabolism', 'COUP Transcription Factor II/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism', 'DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoderm/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Steroidogenic Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2012/09/29 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24228 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2013 Apr;228(4):791-800. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24228.,10.1002/jcp.24228 [doi],,"['R01 DK070650/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK070650/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3657553,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,['NIHMS471629'],,,,,,

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway may increase PGP activity. However, p38-mediated drug resistance associated with PGP is unclear. Here, we investigated p38-mediated doxorubicin-induced drug resistance in human leukemia K562 cells. MATERIAL/METHODS: The expression of PGP was detected by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. Cell viability and half-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined by CCK-8 assay. The intracellular concentration of drugs was measured by HPLC. RESULTS: A doxorubicin-induced PGP overexpression cell line, K562/Dox, was generated. The p38 inhibitor SB202190 significantly decreased MDR1 mRNA expression, as well as PGP, in K562/Dox cells. The IC50 of phenytoin sodium and doxorubicin in K562/Dox cells was significantly higher than that in wild-type K562 cells, indicating the drug resistance of K562/Dox cells. During the blocking of p38 activity in the presence of SB202190, cell number was significantly reduced after the phenytoin sodium and doxorubicin treatment, and the IC50 of phenytoin sodium and doxorubicin was decreased in K562/Dox cells. HPLC showed that the intracellular levels of phenytoin sodium and doxorubicin were significantly lower in K562/Dox cells than those in K562 cells. The decrease of the intracellular level of these drugs was significantly abolished in the presence of SB202190. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that p38 is, at least in part, involved in doxorubicin-induced drug resistance. The mechanistic study of MAPK-mediated PGP and the action of SB202190 need further investigation.","['Chen, Yinghui', 'Zhao, Yongbo', 'Wang, Cuicui', 'Xiao, Xia', 'Zhou, Xiaoyong', 'Xu, Guoxiong']","['Chen Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Wang C', 'Xiao X', 'Zhou X', 'Xu G']","['Department of Neurology, Jinshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China. cyh1973131@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phenytoin/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2012/09/29 06:00,2013/02/21 06:00,['2012/09/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/21 06:00 [medline]']","['883477 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.883477 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2012 Oct;18(10):BR383-8. doi: 10.12659/msm.883477.,,,,,PMC3560559,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of EMH involving the entire upper genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. A 43-yr-old African American woman presented with a tender pelvic mass and a markedly elevated white blood cell count. Imaging was consistent with bilateral tuboovarian abscesses. Laparotomy and removal of uterus, tubes, and ovaries and bone marrow biopsy confirmed chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase and EMH in the cervix, endometrium, and ovaries, and no evidence of infection. We believe this to be the first reported case of EMH involving all organs of the upper genital tract presenting in a patient who has chronic myelogenous leukemia but not in blast crisis.

To get a relevant model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiopathological role of Flt3 on monocytic lineage development, we used the IL-3 dependent murine myeloid progenitors FDC-P1 cell line to generate cells stably co-expressing murine Fms (M-CSF receptor) and human Flt3.

Over 5 years, we treated 16 elderly patients with AML with GO and cytarabine. A high response rate, prolonged survival, and low toxicity were observed in the favorable and intermediate-I genetic groups of AML. Our study raises the issue about the optimal protocol for these patients. BACKGROUND: The benefit of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in combination with chemotherapy as frontline therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still debated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of low-dose GO with cytarabine in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. Over the past 5 years, we have treated 16 elderly patients with AML (64-82 years) with GO (3 mg/m(2)) followed by continuous infusion of cytarabine (100 mg/m(2)) for 7 days. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 68.8% of patients; however, this was true only in patients in the favorable or intermediate-I cytogenetic risk groups. Of the 12 patients with AML in the favorable and intermediate-I genetic groups, 11 (91.7%) achieved CR. By comparison, of all 4 patients in the intermediate-II or adverse genetic groups, none of the patients achieved CR (P = .003). The median disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) was 10.9 and 18.8 months, respectively, for patients who achieved CR. The estimated median survival was 15 months in the favorable and intermediate-I cytogenetic groups and only 4.4 months in the intermediate-II and unfavorable risk groups (P = .008). The toxicity profile was also manageable in patients with AML who were mainly older than 70 years with good performance status (PS). The 8-week mortality rate was 6.25%, which is relatively low in this high-risk group of patients. These data are in line with results from 2 randomized trials suggesting that the addition of low-dose GO should be further investigated to reevaluate its role in selected elderly patients with AML and raises the issue of the optimal protocol.","['Tavor, Sigal', 'Rahamim, Einam', 'Sarid, Nadav', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'Gibstein, Lili', 'Aviv, Freddy', 'Kirsner, Ilya', 'Naparstek, Elizabeth']","['Tavor S', 'Rahamim E', 'Sarid N', 'Rozovski U', 'Gibstein L', 'Aviv F', 'Kirsner I', 'Naparstek E']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. tavorsigal@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2012/09/29 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/09/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00134-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Dec;12(6):438-43. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.05.007.

Here, we report the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from adult canine fibroblasts by retroviral OKSM transduction. The isolated canine iPSCs (ciPSCs) were expanded in 3 different culture media [fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or FGF2 plus LIF]. Cells cultured in both FGF2 and LIF expressed pluripotency markers [POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28] and embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific genes (PODXL, DPPA5, FGF5, REX1, and LAMP1) and showed strong levels of alkaline phosphatase expression. In vitro differentiation by formation of embryoid bodies and by directed differentiation generated cell derivatives of all 3 germ layers as confirmed by mRNA and protein expression. In vivo, the ciPSCs created solid tumors, which failed to reach epithelial structure formation, but expressed markers for all 3 germ layers. Array comparative genomic hybridization and chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that while retroviral transduction per se did not result in significant DNA copy number imbalance, there was evidence for the emergence of low-level aneuploidy during prolonged culture or tumor formation. In summary, we were able to derive ciPSCs from adult fibroblasts by using 4 transcription factors. The isolated iPSCs have similar characteristics to ESCs from other species, but the exact cellular mechanisms behind their unique co-dependency on both FGF2 and LIF are still unknown.","['Koh, Sehwon', 'Thomas, Rachael', 'Tsai, Shengdar', 'Bischoff, Steve', 'Lim, Ji-Hey', 'Breen, Matthew', 'Olby, Natasha J', 'Piedrahita, Jorge A']","['Koh S', 'Thomas R', 'Tsai S', 'Bischoff S', 'Lim JH', 'Breen M', 'Olby NJ', 'Piedrahita JA']","['Genomics Program, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Dogs', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/enzymology/*pathology/transplantation', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Teratoma/genetics/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics']",2012/09/29 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2012/09/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0393 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Mar 15;22(6):951-63. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0393.

In dogs and cats, erythrophagia has been reported to occur in mast cell and plasma cell tumors, lymphoma, megakaryocytic leukemia, and hemophagocytic histiocytic sarcoma. On the basis of clinical experience, we believed this to be an incomplete list that might bias veterinarians toward a diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma when erythrophagia is observed in neoplastic spindle-shaped cells. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective study was to identify neoplasms in dogs that exhibit erythrophagia within the neoplastic cell population. METHODS: Reports of cytologic samples collected from dogs and submitted to the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory between January 2003 and May 2011 were searched for a description of erythrophagia. Only cases with a diagnosis confirmed by histopathologic examination using immunohistochemical analysis or by cytochemical staining were included. Slides were reviewed by one pathologist to confirm the presence of erythrophagocytic neoplastic cells. RESULTS: Of 20,016 reports searched, 897 contained the term ""erythrophagia."" In 55 reports, neoplastic cells exhibiting erythrophagia were identified. Of these, 21 cases were excluded because the cytologic diagnosis was not confirmed, and the remaining 34 cases included 12 hemangiosarcomas, 11 hemophagocytic histiocytic sarcomas, 9 osteosarcomas, one mast cell tumor, and one T-cell lymphoma.

We hereby present an interim analysis of a prospective observational study of ovarian function during cancer treatment of young females in relation to clinical factors. PROCEDURE: Thirty-four consecutive female cancer patients aged 0-18 year were included after informed consent. Serum/Plasma levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, FSH, LH, and oestradiol (E2) were measured at diagnosis and every 3-4 months during and after treatment. RESULTS: All patients had detectable AMH levels at diagnosis. Eleven patients had reached menarche (mean age 14(1/2) years) and the remaining patients had a mean age of 6(1/2) years. They all showed a rapid decline in AMH after 3 months of treatment, regardless of AMH at diagnosis, age, menarche, or treatment given. Those given radiotherapy below the diaphragm and/or stem cell transplantation (SCT) (n = 9) had no ovarian recovery during or 1(1/2)-year after treatment. However, recovery was observed in those given standard treatment for acute lymphatic leukemia (n = 7) already during maintenance chemotherapy. For the remaining patients, longer follow-up is required for analysis of ovarian recovery after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid ovarian dysfunction is observed in all females after initiation of cancer treatment as measured by AMH and inhibin B. Our data regarding those who require abdominal radiotherapy and/or SCT confirms the recommendations in the Nordic countries where these patients are eligible for cryopreservation of ovarian cortical tissue before start of cancer treatment.","['Morse, Helena', 'Elfving, Maria', 'Lindgren, Anna', 'Wolner-Hanssen, Pal', 'Andersen, Claus Yding', 'Ora, Ingrid']","['Morse H', 'Elfving M', 'Lindgren A', 'Wolner-Hanssen P', 'Andersen CY', 'Ora I']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (inhibin B)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Mullerian Hormone/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/*blood', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/*chemically induced']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/04/19 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24327 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Apr;60(4):676-81. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24327.

These mutations occur in genes known, or suspected, to play a role in modifying cytosine nucleotides on DNA and/or altering the state of histone modifications. Genes such as ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, IDH1/2, MLL1, and TET2 all have been shown to be mutated and/or translocated in patients with myeloid malignancies. Intriguingly, many of the alterations affecting DNA cytosine modifications in myeloid malignancies (mutations in DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and TET2) have also been found in patients with T-cell lymphomas, and EZH2 mutations appear to be critical in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia development as well. In addition, the discovery of frequent mutations in CREBBP, EP300, EZH2, and MLL2 in B-cell lymphomas suggests that epigenetic alterations play a critical role in lymphomagenesis. The purpose of this review is to present functional evidence of how alterations in these epigenetic modifiers promote hematopoietic transformation.

Natural killer (NK) cell therapy is a potential treatment, but leukemia cells may be resistant. Here, we sought to determine the susceptibility of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells to NK cell lysis and to develop a novel immunotherapeutic approach to optimize NK cell therapy, including the use of an antibody against leukemia-associated antigen and the elimination of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-mediated inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines (RS4;11, SEM, and MV4-11) and primary leukemia blasts were assessed for surface phenotype and susceptibility to NK cell lysis with or without antibodies against CD19 (XmAb5574), CD33 (lintuzumab), or KIR ligands. RESULTS: All three cell lines were resistant to NK cell lysis, had some inhibitory KIR ligands and protease inhibitor-9, and expressed low levels of NKG2D activating ligands and adhesion molecules. After treatment with XmAb5574 or lintuzumab, MLL-rearranged leukemia cells were efficiently killed by NK cells. The addition of pan-major histocompatibility complex class I antibody, which blocked inhibitory KIR-HLA interaction, further augmented degranulation in all three KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/3, and KIR3DL1 subsets of NK cells based on the rule of missing-self recognition. A mouse model showed a decreased rate of leukemia progression in vivo as monitored by bioluminescence imaging and longer survival after antibody treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data support the use of a triple immunotherapy approach, including an antibody directed against tumor-associated antigen, KIR-mismatched NK cell transplantation, and inhibitory KIR blockade, for the treatment of NK cell-resistant MLL-rearranged leukemias.","['Chan, Wing Keung', 'Kung Sutherland, May', 'Li, Ying', 'Zalevsky, Jonathan', 'Schell, Sarah', 'Leung, Wing']","['Chan WK', 'Kung Sutherland M', 'Li Y', 'Zalevsky J', 'Schell S', 'Leung W']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-3678, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FCGR3A protein, human)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'V00Y10W60W (lintuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'HLA-B Antigens/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*transplantation', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics', 'Receptors, KIR/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/04/27 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-0668 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0668 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Nov 15;18(22):6296-305. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0668.

DESIGN: A nationwide epidemiological study was conducted to evaluate the incidence and clinical outcomes of NADHMs. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 429 regional AIDS centers and 497 educational hospitals certified by the Japanese Society of Hematology. Data from 511 institutes were obtained. RESULTS: From 1991 to 2010, 47 patients with NADHMs were detected (median age, 42.0 years; male, 93.6%). The median CD4-positive T-cell count was 255/mul, and the median duration from the diagnosis of HIV infection to development of hematological malignancy was 28.0 months. Most patients with acute leukemia were treated with standard induction chemotherapy. Complete remission rates and median overall survival periods for acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were 70.0 and 85.7% and 13 and 16 months, respectively. Three of four patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) were well controlled with imatinib. Five patients (2 AML, 1 ALL, 1 accelerated-phase CML, and 1 myeloma) were treated with autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Comparison of patients over the two periods (1991-2000 and 2001-2009) revealed a 4.5-fold increase in the incidence of hematological malignancies. CONCLUSION: The incidence of NADHMs has increased in the past decade. The prognosis of these patients was similar to that of HIV-negative patients; therefore, standard chemotherapy may be a feasible treatment option for HIV-infected patients with hematological malignancies.","['Hagiwara, Shotaro', 'Yotsumoto, Mihoko', 'Odawara, Takashi', 'Ajisawa, Atsushi', 'Uehira, Tomoko', 'Nagai, Hirokazu', 'Tanuma, Junko', 'Okada, Seiji']","['Hagiwara S', 'Yotsumoto M', 'Odawara T', 'Ajisawa A', 'Uehira T', 'Nagai H', 'Tanuma J', 'Okada S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal medicine, National Medical Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan. shagiwar@hosp.ncgm.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/complications/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/06/14 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QAD.0b013e32835a5a7a [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2013 Jan 14;27(2):279-83. doi: 10.1097/QAD.0b013e32835a5a7a.,10.1097/QAD.0b013e32835a5a7a [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In >70% of patients, morbidity and mortality in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is caused by infections. The aim of this study was to determine the association between this polymorphism and the frequency of septic shock from the time of diagnosis until completion of treatment. METHODS: This cohort study was conducted in 57 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At the end of follow-up, children were stratified according to their IL1RN polymorphism (ILRN*1/ILRN*2), evaluating the impact of genotype on the severity of febrile neutropenic events during their treatment. RESULTS: Overall survival was 80% at 55 months after treatment. The average number of febrile neutropenic events in this cohort was 2.82 per patient. Genotype distribution was 50.9% for homozygote IL-1RN*1, 38.6% for heterozygote ILRN*1/ILRN*2 and 10.5% for homozygote IL-1RN*2. The risk of presenting septic shock for homozygote IL1RN*2/IL1RN*2 and heterozygote ILRN*1/ILRN*2 patients was significantly greater (odds ratio, 45; P = 0.001) adjusted for age, gender, risk of leukemia and presence of pathogenic bacteria. Genotype IL-1RN*2 is associated with the risk of development of septic shock in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Further research in larger population-based studies is needed to replicate these findings. CONCLUSIONS: This information would allow us to identify more predictive factors in this group of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients in whom this information is lacking to establish an earlier and more aggressive approach.","['Zapata-Tarres, Marta', 'Arredondo-Garcia, Jose Luis', 'Rivera-Luna, Roberto', 'Klunder-Klunder, Miguel', 'Mancilla-Ramirez, Javier', 'Sanchez-Urbina, Rocio', 'Vazquez-Cruz, Margarita Yolanda', 'Juarez-Villegas, Luis Enrique', 'Palomo-Colli, Miguel Angel']","['Zapata-Tarres M', 'Arredondo-Garcia JL', 'Rivera-Luna R', 'Klunder-Klunder M', 'Mancilla-Ramirez J', 'Sanchez-Urbina R', 'Vazquez-Cruz MY', 'Juarez-Villegas LE', 'Palomo-Colli MA']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,['0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/genetics/immunology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/*genetics/immunology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Shock, Septic/*genetics/immunology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e31827566dd [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013 Feb;32(2):136-9. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e31827566dd.,10.1097/INF.0b013e31827566dd [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Hematologic malignancies are associated with a high risk of thrombotic complications. The incidence of these events is greatly variable and is influenced by many factors, including the type and the stage of disease, antitumor therapies, and the use of central venous device (CVD). Epidemiological data allow an estimate of the incidence of VTE in acute leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. The effect of chemotherapy on the incidence of thrombosis is particularly evident in acute leukemia as it causes the exacerbation of the clotting/bleeding syndrome typical of this disease. The role of chemotherapy is also relevant in lymphoma, and in multiple myeloma, in which the use of immunomodulating agents, in combination with chemotherapy and steroids significantly increases the risk of VTE. SUMMARY: Thrombotic complications have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality of hematological cancer patients, therefore, in this setting, the issue of thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE is important. However, no clear recommendation in these conditions is available, with the exception of multiple myeloma. Large prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the best practice for prevention and treatment of VTE in these types of malignant diseases.","['Falanga, Anna', 'Marchetti, Marina', 'Russo, Laura']","['Falanga A', 'Marchetti M', 'Russo L']","['Division of Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy. annafalanga@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*complications/epidemiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/epidemiology', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Venous Thromboembolism/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Vitamin K/antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283592331 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2012 Nov;24(6):702-10. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283592331.,10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283592331 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Most adults with AML die from their disease. The standard treatment paradigm for AML is remission induction chemotherapy with an anthracycline/cytarabine combination, followed by either consolidation chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, depending on the patient's ability to tolerate intensive treatment and the likelihood of cure with chemotherapy alone. Although this approach has changed little in the last three decades, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AML and improvements in molecular genomic technologies are leading to novel drug targets and the development of personalized, risk-adapted treatment strategies. Recent findings related to prognostically relevant and potentially 'druggable' molecular targets are reviewed.

To examine whether TP53 polymorphisms may be involved with in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure and endometriosis (END), we have assessed the associations between TP53 polymorphism in intron 2 (PIN2; G/C, intron 2), PIN3 (one (N, non-duplicated) or two (D, duplicated) repeats of a 16-bp motif, intron 3) and polymorphism in exon 4 (PEX4; C/G, p.P72R, exon 4) in 98 women with END and 115 women with post-IVF failure. In addition, 134 fertile women and 300 women unselected with respect to fertility-related features were assessed. TP53 polymorphisms and haplotypes were identified by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. TP53 PIN3 and PEX4 were associated with both END (P=0.042 and P=0.007, respectively) and IVF (P=0.004 and P=0.009, respectively) when compared with women both selected and unselected for fertility-related features. Haplotypes D-C and N-C were related to higher risk for END (P=0.002, P=0.001, respectively) and failure of IVF (P=0.018 and P=0.002, respectively) when compared with the Fertile group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: average annual population of the cities under study in 2003-2008 was 439 600 persons. Total and specific cancer incidence was investigated. Site specific incidence was analyzed for malignancies proved to be radiosensitive in previous studies: trachea, bronchus and lung, breast, kidney, thyroid cancer and leukemia. Data on cancer cases were received in National Cancer Registry of Ukraine (National Cancer Institute). There was used the data of the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine on the size of the studied population by gender - age groups. Standardized incidence ratio of cancer at a whole and for each of five specific forms of malignancies were calculated for the population of each city and group of cities depending on the nature of industrial activity. RESULTS: During the observed period there were registered 9 381 cancer cases in inhabitants of Ukrainian cities with radiation hazardous facilities. There was stated that cancer incidence rate in population of 5 cities significantly exceeded national and regional levels. Among specific forms of malignancy there were observed excess of lung, trachea, bronchus, breast, kidney cancer and leukemia in population of extractive, processing uranium ore cities. No excess of thyroid cancer was identified. In cities with nuclear power station there were registered excess of kidney cancer.

METHODS: A retrospective chart study was performed of pH1N1 cases diagnosed between October 2009 to January 2010 in the hemato-oncologic unit of the University Children's Hospital of Dusseldorf, Germany. FINDINGS: In total, 21 children were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed pH1N1; in 16 patients with malignancies (acute leukemia 7, lymphoma 4, solid tumors 2, others 3) and in 5 with benign hematologic disorders. Five patients had undergone prior HSCT, although 1 patient was diagnosed during conditioning therapy with high-dose chemotherapy in preparation for haploidentical HSCT. Most frequent symptoms were fever (>38.5 degrees C) and cough (in 100%), and rhinorrhea (57%). The 2 patients acquiring pH1N1 infection under high-dose or intensive chemotherapy did not require intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and both recovered under antiviral therapy. Oseltamivir was administered to 11 patients; in 1 patient, therapy was switched, on a compassionate-use basis, to intravenous zanamivir because of lack of clinical improvement after oseltamivir therapy. Complications were hospitalization (19%), demand of oxygen supplementation, delay/interruption of antineoplastic therapy, and prolonged administration of antibiotics and antipyretics. CONCLUSION: In the investigated patient population, pH1N1 was mild in most cases, but was associated with substantial morbidity in a proportion of patients and led to interruption and delay in anticancer treatment.","['Babor, F', 'Grund, S', 'Siepermann, M', 'Oommen, P T', 'Kuhlen, M', 'Schuster, F R', 'Laws, H-J', 'Wessalowski, R', 'Bienemann, K', 'Janssen, G', 'Adams, O', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Meisel, R']","['Babor F', 'Grund S', 'Siepermann M', 'Oommen PT', 'Kuhlen M', 'Schuster FR', 'Laws HJ', 'Wessalowski R', 'Bienemann K', 'Janssen G', 'Adams O', 'Borkhardt A', 'Meisel R']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine University, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany. florian.babor@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '20O93L6F9H (Oseltamivir)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*isolation & purification', 'Influenza, Human/drug therapy/*virology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Oseltamivir/therapeutic use', '*Pandemics', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/05/28 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12013 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2012 Dec;14(6):589-94. doi: 10.1111/tid.12013.

The DNA damage response was measured using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Using a previously validated in vitro minimal residual disease model, we now show that the combination of GO (10 ng/ml) and tipifarnib (5 muM) targets the CD34+CD38- subset resulting in 65% median cell loss compared to 28% and 13% CD34+CD38- cell loss in GO-treated and tipifarnib-treated cells, respectively. Using phosphokinome profiling and immunofluorescence in the TF-1a cell line, we demonstrate that the drug combination is characterised by the activation of a DNA damage response (induction of gammaH2A.X and thr68 phosphorylation of chk2). Higher induction of gammaH2AX was found in CD34+CD38- than in CD34+CD38+ patient cells. In a model system, we show that dormancy impairs damage resolution, allowing accumulation of gammaH2AX foci. CONCLUSIONS: The chemosensitivity of the CD34+CD38- subset, combined with enhanced damage indicators, suggest that this subset is primed to favour programmed cell death as opposed to repairing damage. This interaction between tipifarnib and GO suggests a potential role in the treatment of AML.","['Jawad, Mays', 'Yu, Ning', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Tandon, Karuna', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Pallis, Monica']","['Jawad M', 'Yu N', 'Seedhouse C', 'Tandon K', 'Russell NH', 'Pallis M']","['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Aminoglycosides/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-431 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-431 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Sep 26;12:431. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-431.,10.1186/1471-2407-12-431 [doi],20120926,,,PMC3488582,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the PTEN mRNA (Pm) expression level in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and healthy controls, and its correlation with prognostic factors. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect Pm expression. Compared to controls, patients with CLL presented a lower expression level of Pm (p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, the expression level of Pm was significantly decreased in patients with Binet C (p < 0.001) and higher level of beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) (p = 0.036), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.019) and ZAP-70 (p = 0.008). Higher Pm expression level was found in favorable cytogenetic aberrations (p = 0.016) and the group without p53 aberration (p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis showed that advanced Binet stage (p = 0.027) and p53 aberration (p = 0.007) were associated with a low PTEN expression level. Survival analysis showed that low expression of PTEN was associated with shorter time to first treatment (TTFT) (p = 0.040).

We have designed and synthesized a bisMTX chemical dimerizer (bisMTX-NH(2)) that contains a third linker arm that can be conjugated to fluorophores, radiolabels, and drugs. Monovalent, divalent, and higher-order AntiCD3 CSANs were assembled with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled bis-methotrexate ligand (bisMTX-FITC) and found to undergo rapid internalization and trafficking by HPB-MLT, a CD3+ T-leukemia cell line, to the early and late endosome and lysosome. Because the fluorescence of bisMTX-FITC when incorporated into CSANs was found to be significantly greater than that of the free ligand, the stability of the endocytosed AntiCD3 CSANs could be monitored. The internalized CSANs were found to be stable for several hours, while treatment with the nontoxic DHFR inhibitor trimethoprim resulted in a rapid loss (>80%) of cellular fluorescence within minutes, consistent with efficient intracellular disassembly of the nanorings. Over longer time periods (24 h), cellular fluorescence decreased by 75-90%, regardless of whether cells had been treated with DMSO or trimethoprim. Although bisMTX is a potent inhibitor of DHFR, it was found to be nontoxic (GI(50) > 20 muM) to HPB-MLT cells. In contrast, AntiCD3 CSANs prepared with bisMTX were found to be at least 13-fold more cytotoxic (GI(50) = 0.5-1.5 muM) than bisMTX at 72 h. Consistent with our findings from CSAN stability studies, no increase in cytotoxicity was observed upon treatment with trimethoprim. Taken together, our results suggest that cell receptor targeting CSANs prepared with trifunctional bisMTX could be used as potential tissue selective drug carriers.","['Fegan, Adrian', 'Kumarapperuma, Sidath C', 'Wagner, Carston R']","['Fegan A', 'Kumarapperuma SC', 'Wagner CR']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatography, Gel', '*Drug Carriers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', '*Nanostructures', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/immunology/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*immunology/metabolism']",2012/09/28 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/09/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp300303k [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2012 Nov 5;9(11):3218-27. doi: 10.1021/mp300303k.

Internal tandem duplication mutations of the FLT3 kinase (FLT3/ITD) occur commonly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor survival, leading to efforts to develop FLT3 kinase inhibitors. However, FLT3 inhibitors have thus far met with limited success, inducing only a clearance of peripheral blasts with minimal BM responses. Quizartinib is a novel potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor currently being studied in clinical trials. In 13 of 14 FLT3/ITD AML patients with normal karyotype treated with quizartinib, we observed terminal myeloid differentiation of BM blasts in association with a clinical differentiation syndrome. The single patient whose blasts failed to differentiate had a preexisting C/EBPalpha mutation and another developed a C/EBPalpha mutation at disease progression, suggesting a mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibition. In vitro, in primary blasts cocultured with human BM stroma, FLT3 inhibition with quizartinib induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation rather than apoptosis.

They differ markedly from adult cancers in their nature, distribution and prognosis. The patterns of childhood cancers in America and Europe are almost the same, with leukemia and central nervous system tumors accounting for over one-half of the new cases. In contrast, lymphoma is the most common prevailing cancer of this age group in Africa. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the patterns of childhood cancers in Gezira State, Central Sudan. It is a retrospective study using hospital records. All children with cancer, aged 1 - 15 years diagnosed by means of histological or cytological examination admitted to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Molecular Biology and Oncology from May 1999 - December 2004 were included in the study. RESULTS: The results showed a pattern of childhood lymphoma as the most common cancer (42.8%) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (19.8%) and kidney tumor (12.8%). The prevalence of cancer was found to be higher among boys (64.7%) than girls (35.3%) with a rate of 1.8:1. Most of the children admitted with cancer were from rural areas (66.1%) compared to (33.9%) from urban areas. CONCLUSION: Lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and bone tumor commonly occurred in children above 5 years in contradistinction to kidney tumor and retinoblastoma which was prevalent in children less than 5 years of age.","['Haroun, Huda M', 'Mahfouz, Mohamed S', 'Elhaj, Ahmed M']","['Haroun HM', 'Mahfouz MS', 'Elhaj AM']","['University of Gezira, Wad-Medani, Sudan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Family Community Med,Journal of family & community medicine,100911100,,,,2006/05/01 00:00,2006/05/01 00:01,['2012/09/27 06:00'],"['2012/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Family Community Med. 2006 May;13(2):71-4.,,,,,PMC3410067,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence']",,,,,,,

These antibodies bind through their Fc fragment to high affinity receptors (FcepsilonRI) present in the membrane of mast cells and basophils. The cross-linking of the receptor initiates a coordinated sequence of biochemical and morphological events that results in exocytosis of secretory granules containing pre-formed inflammatory mediators, secretion of newly formed lipid mediators, and secretion of cytokines. Previously, several studies have investigated the role of reaginic antibodies in the pathogenesis of Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO). However, whereas the immunological aspects of RAO have been extensively studied, the precise sequence of events involved in the pathogenesis remains not completely understood, and the role of IgE in this disease remains controversial. Therefore, in this study, several bioassays were conducted to determine whether reaginic antibodies from RAO-affected horses have the ability to activate mast cells. These bioassays involved measuring degranulation of rat peritoneal mast cells, activation of NF-kappaB and morphological changes in basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) following incubation with horse serum from RAO-affected horses that were sensitive and insensitive to Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) or from unaffected horses. Our results show that reaginic antibodies from horses sensitive to A. fumigatus were able to degranulate rat peritoneal mast cells.

Recent studies have shown that IM inhibits the growth of several non-malignant hematopoietic and fibroblast cells from bone marrow (BM). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of IM on stromal and hematopoietic progenitor cells, specifically in the colony-forming units of granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), using BM cultures from 108 1.5- to 2-month-old healthy Swiss mice. The results showed that low concentrations of IM (1.25 microM) reduced the growth of CFU-GM in clonogenic assays. In culture assays with stromal cells, fibroblast proliferation and alpha-SMA expression by immunocytochemistry analysis were also reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, with a survival rate of approximately 50% with a dose of 2.5 microM. Cell viability and morphology were analyzed using MTT and staining with acrydine orange/ethidium bromide. Most cells were found to be viable after treatment with 5 microM IM, although there was gradual growth inhibition of fibroblastic cells while the number of round cells (macrophage-like cells) increased. At higher concentrations (15 microM), the majority of cells were apoptotic and cell growth ceased completely. Oil red staining revealed the presence of adipocytes only in untreated cells (control). Cell cycle analysis of stromal cells by flow cytometry showed a blockade at the G0/G1 phases in groups treated with 5-15 microM. These results suggest that IM differentially inhibits the survival of different types of BM cells since toxic effects were achieved.","['Soares, P B', 'Jeremias, T S', 'Alvarez-Silva, M', 'Licinio, M A', 'Santos-Silva, M C', 'Vituri, C L']","['Soares PB', 'Jeremias TS', 'Alvarez-Silva M', 'Licinio MA', 'Santos-Silva MC', 'Vituri CL']","['Laboratorio de Analises Clinicas, Hospital Universitario de Santa Maria, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brasil. pamisoares@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fibroblasts', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2012/09/27 06:00,2014/09/01 06:00,['2012/09/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2012007500157 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2012007500157 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2013 Jan;46(1):39-51. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2012007500157.

We identified a chiral VPA derivative, (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid, previously characterized as HDAC inhibitor that induced massive programmed cell death in a strongly enantioselective manner in U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells and NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. By performing fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Western blotting analyses, we established that enantiomer (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid has higher apoptosis-inducing potential than VPA itself. The optic antipode (R)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid and VPA caused under the same conditions only a weak growth inhibition without inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis. (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid is more apoptogenic than VPA and displays enantioselective anti-cancer properties that warrant further research regarding the mechanistic basis of its activity and its potential use in cancer therapy.","['Ivanova, Diana', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich', 'Steinberg, Pablo', 'Nau, Heinz']","['Ivanova D', 'Gronemeyer H', 'Steinberg P', 'Nau H']","['Institute of Genetics and Molecular Biology of the Cell, 1 rue Laurent Fries, BP 10142, 67404 Illkirch Cedex, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (pentyl-4-pentynoic acid)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'U937 Cells', 'Valproic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",2012/09/27 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/09/27 06:00'],"['2012/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-012-0930-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2013 Feb;87(2):303-10. doi: 10.1007/s00204-012-0930-3.

In this study, the direct-labeling method with (6)(4)Cu-pyruvaldehyde-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((6)(4)Cu-PTSM), indirect cell-labeling methods with herpes simplex virus type 1-thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk)-mediated (1)(2)(4)I-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodouracil ((1)(2)(4)I-FIAU) were comparatively investigated in vitro and in vivo for tracking of human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. K562-TL was established by retroviral transduction of the HSV1-tk and firefly luciferase gene in the K562 cell. K562-TL cells were labeled with (6)(4)Cu-PTSM or (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU. Cell labeling efficiency, viability, and radiolabels retention were compared in vitro. The biodistribution of radiolabeled K562-TL cells with each radiolabel and small-animal positron emission tomography imaging were performed. Additionally, in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and tissue reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis were used for confirming those results. K562-TL cells were efficiently labeled with both radiolabels. The radiolabel retention (%) of (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU (95.2%+/-1.1%) was fourfold higher than (6)(4)Cu-PTSM (23.6%+/-0.7%) at 24 hours postlabeling. Viability of radiolabeled cells was statistically nonsignificant between (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU and (6)(4)Cu-PTSM. The radioactivity of each radiolabeled cells was predominantly accumulated in the lungs and liver at 2 hours. Both the radioactivity of (6)(4)Cu-PTSM- and (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU-labeled cells was highly accumulated in the liver at 24 hours. However, the radioactivity of (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU-labeled cells was markedly decreased from the body at 24 hours. The K562-TL cells were dominantly localized in the lungs and liver, which also verified by BLI and RT-PCR analysis at 2 and 24 hours postinjection. The (6)(4)Cu-PTSM-labeled cell-tracking method is more efficient than (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU-labeled cell tracking, because of markedly decrease of radioactivity and fast efflux of (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU in vivo. In spite of a high labeling yield and radiolabel retention of (1)(2)(4)I-FIAU in vitro, the in vivo cell-tracking method using (6)(4)Cu-PTSM could be a useful method to evaluate the distribution and targeting of various cell types, especially, stem cells and immune cells.","['Park, Jae-Jun', 'Lee, Tae-Sup', 'Son, Jin-Ju', 'Chun, Kwon-Soo', 'Song, In-Ho', 'Park, Yong-Serk', 'Kim, Kwang-Il', 'Lee, Yong-Jin', 'Kang, Joo-Hyun']","['Park JJ', 'Lee TS', 'Son JJ', 'Chun KS', 'Song IH', 'Park YS', 'Kim KI', 'Lee YJ', 'Kang JH']","['Molecular Imaging Research Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences-KIRAMS, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Copper Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '19976-14-8 (copper pyruvaldehyde bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) complex)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', '53T7IN77LC (fialuridine)', 'EC 1.13.12.7 (Luciferases, Firefly)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Tracking/methods', 'Copper Radioisotopes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*chemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnostic imaging/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases, Firefly/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Organometallic Compounds/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/methods', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Thiosemicarbazones/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/09/27 06:00,2013/08/16 06:00,['2012/09/27 06:00'],"['2012/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cbr.2012.1225 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2012 Dec;27(10):719-28. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2012.1225.

In this study, we analyzed peripheral blood samples from 185 Jordanian CML patients for ABL mutations, who were on imatinib for a minimum of 6 months regardless of their disease status and over a period of 5 years. Mutations were detected by nested RT-polymerase chain reaction, followed by direct sequencing of the ABL kinase domain. Twelve different point mutations were detected 25 times in 21 patients. The resultant mutations were as follows: four patients have T315I, three of each of the following: L248V, F317L, and G250E, two of each of the following: H396R, M244V, and T277A, and one of each of the following: F311I, M318T, Q252H, F359A, F359I, and Y326H.

The increase in absolute Treg count is more significant than the increase in percentage Tregs. The absolute Treg count appears to be more important in disease pathogenesis. The absolute Treg count was significantly higher in those patients having autoimmune cytopenias. There was an inverse correlation between lymphocyte doubling time and absolute Treg count (p = 0.03).

The purpose of this study was to identify downstream targets of NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived ROS signalling in acute myeloid leukaemia cells, by performing a proteomic analysis utilizing two-dimensional phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The majority of the targets identified were cytoskeletal-associated proteins including Ezrin, a known regulator of the cytoskeleton, which was examined further. The study demonstrated that inhibition of Nox enzymes, using diphenyleneiodonium chloride in the acute myeloid leukaemia cell line MOLM-13, resulted in a decrease in Ezrin tyrosine phosphorylation and also triggered a shift in Ezrin sub-cellular localization as detected by immunofluorescence. The change in Ezrin localization coincided with altered cell morphology, observed using scanning electron microscopy and a decreased ability to migrate through a polycarbonate transwell membrane. Similar effects were observed upon inhibition of the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 using the staurosporine derivate PKC412, implicating a role for FLT3 as an upstream regulator of Ezrin. Our results indicate that FLT3 drives production of ROS by Nox, which stimulates changes in Ezrin tyrosine phosphorylation and localization via redox regulation of Src. Furthermore, inhibition of FLT3 signalling leads to alterations in MOLM-13 cell morphology and has a significant influence on cell motility.","['Corcoran, Aoife', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Corcoran A', 'Cotter TG']","['Tumour Biology Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Biosciences Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (ezrin)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/09/27 06:00,2013/05/07 06:00,['2012/09/27 06:00'],"['2012/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10715762.2012.733385 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2013 Jan;47(1):20-34. doi: 10.3109/10715762.2012.733385.

With the induction of therapy in APL using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), DIC can be controlled in most cases as ATRA usually shows immediate improvement of the APL. However, arsenic trioxide (ATO) which has been used for the treatment of relapse in APL patients has shown to take time to suppress APL cells, therefore the control of DIC in APL with ATO treatment is a major problem. Recently, the recombinant soluble thrombomodulin fragment has received a lot of attention as the novel drug for the treatment of DIC with high efficacy. Here, we present a relapsed patient with APL in whom DIC was successfully and safely controlled by rTM during treatment with ATO.","['Shindo, Motohiro', 'Ikuta, Katsuya', 'Addo, Lynda', 'Ito, Satoshi', 'Fujiya, Mikihiro', 'Torimoto, Yoshihiro', 'Kohgo, Yutaka']","['Shindo M', 'Ikuta K', 'Addo L', 'Ito S', 'Fujiya M', 'Torimoto Y', 'Kohgo Y']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa 078-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2012/09/26 06:00,2012/09/26 06:01,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2012/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/908196 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2012;2012:908196. doi: 10.1155/2012/908196.

Although anti-cancer drugs induce apoptosis in cancerous cells, drug resistance is the significant problem mainly due to over-expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) such as survivin. In this content, it has been reported that an anti-inflammatory drug, Carbenoxolone (CBX), could induce apoptosis and growth inhibition in several types of cancerous cells. In the present study, effects of CBX on apoptosis and level of the expression of survivin gene and its DeltaEx3 splicing variant have were evaluated in K562 cells. METHODS: K562 cells were cultured and treated with different concentrations of CBX (50-300 microM) at different time intervals (12-48 hrs). Trypan blue exclusion test was used to evaluate cell viability. Fluorescent microscopy (Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide double staining) and DNA fragmentation assay were used to study apoptosis. The expression level of survivin and its DeltaEx3 splice variant were studied by RT-PCR. RESULTS AND MAJOR CONCLUSION: It was found that both growth inhibition and apoptosis occurred in K562 cells. In addition, down-regulation of survivin and survin-DeltaEx3 were observed, after 2-4 hrs treatment with 150 microM of CBX. However, the expression level of survivin and its DeltaEx3 splice variant increased in subsequent time (6-12 hrs) nearly to the level of control cells. From the results of this study, it may be concluded that CBX can be considered as a candidate for further studies in CML treatment, especially in the case of drug-resistant leukemia cells.","['Moosavi, M A', 'Moasses Ghafary, S', 'Asvadi-Kermani, I', 'Hamzeiy, H', 'Rahmati, M', 'Ahmadi, A H', 'Nikanfar, A', 'Sanaat, Z', 'Asadi-Khiavi, M']","['Moosavi MA', 'Moasses Ghafary S', 'Asvadi-Kermani I', 'Hamzeiy H', 'Rahmati M', 'Ahmadi AH', 'Nikanfar A', 'Sanaat Z', 'Asadi-Khiavi M']","['Department of Zoology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Daru,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",101125969,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Daru. 2011;19(6):455-61.,,,,,PMC3436083,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Carbenoxolone', 'Leukemia', 'Survivin']",,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 286 patients with AML with t(11q23) enrolled onto German-Austrian Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study Group and Dutch-Belgian-Swiss Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group prospective treatment trials. Material was available from 177 AML patients for EVI1 expression analysis. RESULTS: We divided 286 MLL-rearranged AMLs into three subgroups: t(9;11)(p22;q23) (44.8%), t(6;11)(q27;q23) (14.7%), and t(v;11q23) (40.5%). EVI1 overexpression (EVI1(+)) was found in 45.8% of all patients with t(11q23), with t(6;11) showing the highest frequency (83.9%), followed by t(9;11) at 40.0%, and t(v;11q23) at 34.8%. Concurrent gene mutations were rare or absent in all three subgroups. Within all t(11q23) AMLs, EVI1(+) was the sole prognostic factor, predicting for inferior overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 2.06; P = .003), relapse-free survival (HR, 2.28; P = .002), and event-free survival (HR, 1.79; P = .009). EVI1(+) AMLs with t(11q23) in first complete remission (CR) had a significantly better outcome after allogeneic transplantation compared with other consolidation therapies (5-year OS, 54.7% v 0%; Mantel-Byar, P = .0006). EVI1(-) t(9;11) AMLs had lower WBC counts, more commonly FAB M5 morphology, and frequently had additional trisomy 8 (39.6%; P < .001). Among t(9;11) AMLs, EVI1(+) again was the sole independent adverse prognostic factor for survival. CONCLUSION: Deregulated EVI1 expression defines poor prognostic subsets among AML with t(11q23) and AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23). Patients with EVI1(+) MLL-rearranged AML seem to benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first CR.","['Groschel, Stefan', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Engelmann, Jan', 'Rockova, Veronika', 'Teleanu, Veronica', 'Kuhn, Michael W M', 'Eiwen, Karina', 'Erpelinck, Claudia', 'Havermans, Marije', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Schmidt-Wolf, Ingo G H', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Verhoef, Gregor', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Bargetzi, Mario', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Groschel S', 'Schlenk RF', 'Engelmann J', 'Rockova V', 'Teleanu V', 'Kuhn MW', 'Eiwen K', 'Erpelinck C', 'Havermans M', 'Lubbert M', 'Germing U', 'Schmidt-Wolf IG', 'Beverloo HB', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Verdonck LF', 'Vellenga E', 'Verhoef G', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Pabst T', 'Bargetzi M', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Delwel R']","['University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/genetics/*mortality', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/26 06:00,2013/02/22 06:00,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.41.5505 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.41.5505 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jan 1;31(1):95-103. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.41.5505.

MRI detects early osteonecrosis, but multiple focused MR images are required to capture all lesions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined whether whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) could (1) assist in diagnosing long-bone epiphyseal and other osteonecroses, (2) characterize articular surface involvement, and (3) detect preferential sites for osteonecrosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data on all 11 pediatric patients newly diagnosed with leukemia who had musculoskeletal pain develop that persisted 4 weeks or more during leukemia treatment. All were screened for osteonecrosis by WB-MRI, which consisted of a one-time scan of the entire body. Osteonecrosis was defined as circumscribed lesions with a distinct rim of low signal intensity in the normally high-intensity marrow on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity in the normally low-intensity marrow on short-tau inversion recovery images. RESULTS: WB-MRI confirmed osteonecrosis in nine of 11 patients. All patients had multisite lesions; eight had long-bone epiphyseal lesions, which comprised 66 of 129 (51%) of all lesions. Osteonecrosis involving greater than 50% of the epiphyseal surface was present in 57% of distal femoral and proximal tibial lesions. All humeral and femoral head lesions involved more than 1/3 of the medial surface volume but were asymptomatic. No articular collapse was present. All osteonecrotic lesions were more common in the lower extremities. CONCLUSIONS: WB-MRI confirmed early epiphyseal osteonecrosis, with quantification of articular surface involvement. Lower limbs were preferentially affected, but asymptomatic humeral head osteonecrosis was present in five of nine patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, diagnostic study.

Four weeks later, the mice were sacrificed and their tumors were excised, weighed and processed for histological analysis. NM inhibited the growth of OHSU-974 tumors by 47% and tumor burden by 50%. At lower concentrations, NM demonstrated no effect on proliferation, but at 1,000 microg/ml a 40% toxicity was observed. Zymography revealed the MMP-2 and PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion. NM suppressed the secretion of both MMPs in a dose-dependent manner, with a virtual inhibition at 500 microg/ml. NM inhibited OHSU-974 cell invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner with a complete block at 1,000 microg/ml. H&E staining showed no morphological changes below 500 microg/ml. These results suggest that NM has potential therapeutic use in the treatment of human FA HNSCC.","['Roomi, M W', 'Kalinovsky, T', 'Roomi, N W', 'Niedzwiecki, A', 'Rath, M']","['Roomi MW', 'Kalinovsky T', 'Roomi NW', 'Niedzwiecki A', 'Rath M']","['Dr Rath Research Institute, Santa Clara, CA 95050, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,['EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications/diet therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications', 'Gelatinases/metabolism', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/complications/diet therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck', 'Tumor Burden', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/26 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2012/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1639 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Dec;41(6):1996-2004. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1639.

In this paper, we have explored potential links between PML and interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced MHC class II expression. IFN-gamma induced a substantial increase in the spatial proximity between PML bodies and the MHC class II gene cluster in different human cell types. Knockdown experiments show that PML is required for efficient IFN-gamma-induced MHC II gene transcription through regulation of the class II transactivator (CIITA). PML mediates this function through protection of CIITA from proteasomal degradation. We also show that PML isoform II specifically forms a stable complex with CIITA at PML bodies. These observations establish PML as a coregulator of IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression.","['Ulbricht, Tobias', 'Alzrigat, Mohammad', 'Horch, Almut', 'Reuter, Nina', 'von Mikecz, Anna', 'Steimle, Viktor', 'Schmitt, Eberhard', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Stamminger, Thomas', 'Hemmerich, Peter']","['Ulbricht T', 'Alzrigat M', 'Horch A', 'Reuter N', 'von Mikecz A', 'Steimle V', 'Schmitt E', 'Kramer OH', 'Stamminger T', 'Hemmerich P']","['Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Fritz-Lipmann Institute, 07745 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, MHC Class II/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/09/26 06:00,2013/02/09 06:00,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jcb.201112015 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.201112015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2012 Oct 1;199(1):49-63. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201112015.

No hyperthyroidism in a child with thyroiditis due to mucormycosis has been reported in the literature so far. We describe a clinical course of generalized mucormycosis with thyroid involvement in a 12-year-old girl treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The child underwent a hyperthyroidism connected with thyroid involvement due to a fungal process. The diagnosis was based on the clinical signs, laboratory findings and typical ultrasound scan; however, later attempt to amplify the fungi DNA from the tissue block has failed. The child died because of multiorgan failure due to general fungal infection 49 days after the invasive fungal infection was diagnosed.

A bioluminescent imaging-based leukemia animal model has been established by direct injection of a bioluminescent leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM/fLuc) into NOD/SCID mouse tibia bone marrow and compared with models established by IP and IV routes. The comparison revealed that a bioluminescent in vivo leukemia model established via IBMT could recapitulate leukemia more faithfully and facilitate improved quantification of leukemia engraftment kinetics with a wider range of bioluminescent intensity than IP or IV. IBMT of bioluminescent leukemic cells allowed quantification of dose-dependent responses to anti-leukemic drugs, thus validating this model as a potential preclinical anti-leukemic drug screening system. IBMT-leukemia cells isolated from peripheral blood of the model mice and then injected into new recipients successfully established a second generation IBMT in vivo model and demonstrated the reproducibility of the model.

However, a substantial portion of patients, many of whom have no known risk factors, experience relapse. Taking a genome-wide approach, in the present study, we evaluated the relationships between genotypes at 444 044 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of relapse in 2535 children with newly diagnosed ALL after adjusting for genetic ancestry and treatment regimen. We identified 134 SNPs that were reproducibly associated with ALL relapse. Of 134 relapse SNPs, 133 remained prognostic after adjusting for all known relapse risk factors, including minimal residual disease, and 111 were significant even among patients who were negative for minimal residual disease after remission induction therapy. The C allele at rs7142143 in the PYGL gene was associated with 3.6-fold higher risk of relapse than the T allele (P = 6.7 x 10(-9)). Fourteen of the 134 relapse SNPs, including variants in PDE4B and ABCB1, were also associated with antileukemic drug pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics. In the present study, we systematically identified host genetic variations related to treatment outcome of childhood ALL, most of which were prognostic independent of known risk factors for relapse, and some of which also influenced outcome by affecting host dis-position of antileukemic drugs.

Lymphoblastic lymphoma is rare, accounting for 1% to 2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is of T-cell phenotype in 90% of cases. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is morphologically indistinct from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Both express their lineage-specific markers as well as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The differences are often made on clinical grounds. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is characterized by a predominantly nodal distribution of disease, often with a large mediastinal mass. Patients with less than 25% bone marrow involvement have typically been categorized as LBL rather than ALL, although this has not been applied consistently in the literature. Gene expression studies have identified differences in gene expression, with LBL expressing higher levels of genes associated with cytoskeleton, adhesion, angiogenesis, and chemotaxis than ALL. Although LBL and ALL can be distinct clinically, chemotherapy strategies are often very similar. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimens, which incorporate intensive multidrug induction, consolidation, delayed intensification, and maintenance, have been shown to be superior to standard lymphoma regimens. As central nervous system (CNS) relapse is common, CNS prophylaxis with high-dose chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy is also standard. The prophylactic use of CNS irradiation has declined with the introduction of chemotherapy regimens incorporating high doses of CNS-penetrating drugs such as cytarabine and methotrexate. The use of consolidative radiation to the mediastinum remains uncertain. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic transplantation as consolidation for patients in CR1 is controversial with modern intensive chemotherapy regimens, although transplantation has a proven role in the relapse setting.","['Portell, Craig A', 'Sweetenham, John W']","['Portell CA', 'Sweetenham JW']","['Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer J,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2012/09/26 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PPO.0b013e31826b1232 [doi]', '00130404-201209000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer J. 2012 Sep-Oct;18(5):432-8. doi: 10.1097/PPO.0b013e31826b1232.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells have a distinctive immunophenotype, and the disease has a characteristic pattern of histological infiltration in the lymph node and bone marrow. The clinical course of CLL is heterogeneous, with some patients presenting with very indolent disease and other patients having a more aggressive malignancy. It is known that genetic abnormalities underlie this difference in clinical presentation. Some patients may present solely with lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and presence of infiltrating monoclonal B cells with the same immunophenotype as CLL cells, but lacking peripheral blood lymphocytosis. This disease is called small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and has been considered for almost 2 decades to be the tissue equivalent of CLL. Both CLL and SLL are currently considered different manifestations of the same entity by the fourth edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. It is suspected that differential expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., reduced expression of R1 and CCR3 in SLL cells), integrins (e.g., CLL cells have lower expression of integrin alphaLbeta2), and genetic abnormalities (a higher incidence of trisomy 12 and lower incidence of del(13q) is found in SLL) may explain some of the clinical differences between these 2 disorders. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the precise biological basis underlying the different clinical presentations of CLL and SLL. It is expected that future studies will shed light on the pathophysiology of both disorders.","['Santos, Fabio P S', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Santos FP', ""O'Brien S""]","['Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer J,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,"['0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism', 'World Health Organization']",2012/09/26 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PPO.0b013e31826cda2d [doi]', '00130404-201209000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer J. 2012 Sep-Oct;18(5):396-403. doi: 10.1097/PPO.0b013e31826cda2d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testing this directly is problematic. Instead, we investigate whether geomagnetic field appears to be an effect modifier in studies of alternating magnetic fields.

In this study, we investigate the relationship between monocytes/macrophages and histamine in atherosclerosis and discover that histamine levels regulate various immunologically important molecules and influences atherosclerotic progression. Immunohistochemical analysis of human atherosclerotic lesions revealed that macrophages and DCs express CCL22. The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) adhered to culture plates and morphologically changed to macrophage-like cells when treated with tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Macrophage-like cells derived from THP-1 cells and cultivated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) show similar expression of CCL22. Gene expression of CCL22 was also detected in THP-1 cells treated with histamine and the expression of the protein produced by the CCL22 gene is similar in PBMCs and THP-1 cells. In addition, the histamine H2 receptor mediated these reactions. Our results suggest that CCL22 expression in monocytes is regulated by histamine, and that CCL22 is involved centrally in the development of human atherosclerotic lesions. In conclusion, CCL22 is a marker that is a characteristic of the monocytes/ macrophages migrating into atherosclerotic lesions and histamine plays a role in regulating its expression.","['Kimura, Satoshi', 'Tanimoto, Akihide', 'Wang, Ke-Yong', 'Shimajiri, Shohei', 'Guo, Xin', 'Tasaki, Takashi', 'Yamada, Sohsuke', 'Sasaguri, Yasuyuki']","['Kimura S', 'Tanimoto A', 'Wang KY', 'Shimajiri S', 'Guo X', 'Tasaki T', 'Yamada S', 'Sasaguri Y']","['Department of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyusyu, Japan. s-kimura@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (CCL22 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL22)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H2)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aorta/metabolism/pathology', 'Atherosclerosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CCL22/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chemokines/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Histamine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Myocardial Ischemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Histamine H2/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2012/09/26 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2012/09/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.2012.02854.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2012 Oct;62(10):675-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2012.02854.x.,10.1111/j.1440-1827.2012.02854.x [doi],,,,,,,"['(c) 2012 The Authors.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether 99mTc-DMSA static renal scintigraphy can be used to disclose kidney damage at the end of therapy for ALL in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 48 ALL patients aged 6.6-22.9 years, with a mean time of continuous complete remission of 51 months. Static renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Minor scars in the renal cortex were diagnosed with scintigraphy in 6 (13%) patients. A significant correlation was found between renal scarring and a history of urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: No clinically significant kidney damage was found after completion of treatment of ALL. Static renal scintigraphy may be a valuable noninvasive method for visualization of renal cortex pathology.","['Listewnik, Maria H', 'Peregud-Pogorzelski, Jaroslaw', 'Birkenfeld, Bozena', 'Matacz, Monika', 'Zorga, Piotr', 'Szychot, Elwira', 'Piwowarska-Bilska, Hanna', 'Brodkiewicz, Andrzej']","['Listewnik MH', 'Peregud-Pogorzelski J', 'Birkenfeld B', 'Matacz M', 'Zorga P', 'Szychot E', 'Piwowarska-Bilska H', 'Brodkiewicz A']","['Zaklad Medycyny Nuklearnej Pomorskiego Uniwersytetu Medycznego w Szczecinie ul.

A biological pathway can be represented through a graph where genes and their interactions are, respectively, nodes and edges of the graph. From a biological point of view only some portions of a pathway are expected to be altered; however, few methods using pathway topology have been proposed and none of them tries to identify the signal paths, within a pathway, mostly involved in the biological problem. Here, we present a novel algorithm for pathway analysis clipper, that tries to fill in this gap. clipper implements a two-step empirical approach based on the exploitation of graph decomposition into a junction tree to reconstruct the most relevant signal path. In the first step clipper selects significant pathways according to statistical tests on the means and the concentration matrices of the graphs derived from pathway topologies. Then, it identifies within these pathways the signal paths having the greatest association with a specific phenotype. We test our approach on simulated and two real expression datasets. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of clipper in the identification of signal transduction paths totally coherent with the biological problem.","['Martini, Paolo', 'Sales, Gabriele', 'Massa, M Sofia', 'Chiogna, Monica', 'Romualdi, Chiara']","['Martini P', 'Sales G', 'Massa MS', 'Chiogna M', 'Romualdi C']","['CRIBI Biotechnology Center, Department of Biology, University of Padova, via U Bassi 58/B, 35121 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', '*Transcriptome']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gks866 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gks866 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan 7;41(1):e19. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks866.

We have conducted a phase 1 study of IPH2101 in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission. Patients received escalating doses (0.0003-3 mg/kg) of IPH2101 following a 3 + 3 design. Safety, toxicity (primary end points), pharmacokinetics, outcome, and immunologic correlates were evaluated. Twenty-three patients (median age, 71 years), were enrolled. Adverse events were mild and transient, consisting mainly of infusion syndrome and erythema. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, although full KIR saturation (> 90%) was sustained for more than 2 weeks at 1 and 3 mg/kg. There was a clear correlation between mAb exposure and KIR occupancy. Neither hematologic toxicity nor significant changes in the numbers and distribution of lymphocyte subsets, NK cell receptor expression, or in vitro cytotoxicity were seen. At the highest dose levels (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg), transient increases in TNF-alpha and MIP-1beta serum concentrations and NK cell CD69 expression were observed. Overall and relapse-free survival in the present study compared favorably to reports in comparable patient populations.

Recent studies suggest that bisphosphonates might reduce pain and loss of motor function in patients with ON. We assessed the effects of pamidronate compared to standard care in patients with symptomatic ON (sON) and studied whether steroids might be continued after diagnosis of ON in some patients. METHODS: We evaluated 17 patients with sON as complication of primary ALL treatment between 2000 and 2008. Fourteen patients were treated with pamidronate. Mobility and pain control were monitored in all patients. Affected joints were classified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ON diagnosis and after 6-72 months. RESULTS: Out of 220 patients with ALL, 17 (7.7%) patients developed sON. The median age at ALL diagnosis was 11 years (range: 2.7-16.6 years) and sON occurred a median of 13.4 months (range: 2.5-34 months) after ALL diagnosis. Affected joints were hip, knee and ankle. MRI scans showed 7 severe, 4 moderate, and 6 mild ON lesions. Fourteen patients showed improvement in pain (77% of patients) and motor function (59% of patients), even though corticoids were reintroduced in 4 patients. MRI demonstrated improvement, stability or worsening in 6, 3, and 5 cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pamidronate seems to be effective in the management of pain and motor function recovery in sON. Further studies are needed to provide evidence as to whether bisphosphonates can be recommended for the treatment or the prevention of ON in childhood ALL patients.","['Leblicq, Coralie', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Decarie, Jean-Claude', 'Delisle, Jean-Francois', 'Isler, Marc H', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Chabot, Gilles', 'Alos, Nathalie']","['Leblicq C', 'Laverdiere C', 'Decarie JC', 'Delisle JF', 'Isler MH', 'Moghrabi A', 'Chabot G', 'Alos N']","['Endocrinology Service and Research Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arthralgia/drug therapy', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphosphonates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Joints/pathology', 'Knee Joint/pathology', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Osteonecrosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Pamidronate', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24313 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 May;60(5):741-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24313.

We have shown that 25 mum 10-(octyloxy) decyl-2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl phosphate (ODPC), an alkylphospholipid, targets high cholesterol domains in model membranes and induces apoptosis in leukemia cells but spares normal hematopoietic and epithelial cells under the same conditions. We performed a quantitative (SILAC) proteomic screening of ODPC targets in a lipid-raft-enriched fraction of leukemic cells to identify early events prior to the initiation of apoptosis. Six proteins, three with demonstrated palmitoylation sites, were reduced in abundance. One, the linker for activation of T-cell family member 2 (LAT2), is an adaptor protein associated with lipid rafts in its palmitoylated form and is specifically expressed in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Interestingly, LAT2 is not expressed in K562, a cell line more resistant to ODPC-induced apoptosis. There was an early loss of LAT2 in the lipid-raft-enriched fraction of NB4 cells within 3 h following treatment with 25 mum ODPC. Subsequent degradation of LAT2 by proteasomes was observed. Twenty-five mum ODPC inhibited AKT activation via myeloid growth factors, and LAT2 knockdown in NB4 cells by shRNA reproduced this effect. LAT2 knockdown in NB4 cells also decreased cell proliferation and increased cell sensitivity to ODPC (7.5x), perifosine (3x), and arsenic trioxide (8.5x). Taken together, these data indicate that LAT2 is an early mediator of the anti-leukemic activity of alkylphospholipids and arsenic trioxide. Thus, LAT2 may be used as a target for the design of drugs for cancer therapy.","['Thome, Carolina H', 'dos Santos, Guilherme A', 'Ferreira, Germano A', 'Scheucher, Priscila S', 'Izumi, Clarice', 'Leopoldino, Andreia M', 'Simao, Ana Maria', 'Ciancaglini, Pietro', 'de Oliveira, Kleber T', 'Chin, Alice', 'Hanash, Samir M', 'Falcao, Roberto P', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Greene, Lewis J', 'Faca, Vitor M']","['Thome CH', 'dos Santos GA', 'Ferreira GA', 'Scheucher PS', 'Izumi C', 'Leopoldino AM', 'Simao AM', 'Ciancaglini P', 'de Oliveira KT', 'Chin A', 'Hanash SM', 'Falcao RP', 'Rego EM', 'Greene LJ', 'Faca VM']","['Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia em Celulas-Tronco e Terapia Celular, Fundacao Hemocentro de Ribeirao Preto, 14051-140, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (10-(octyloxy)decyl-2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl phosphate)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (LAT2 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/drug effects', 'Phospholipids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylcholine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteome/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33479-4 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M112.019661 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012 Dec;11(12):1898-912. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M112.019661.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The administration of calcitonin could improve the efficiency of implantation by increasing the expression of several receptivity-related genes in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Calcitonin is one of the biomarkers of uterine receptivity, which is transiently produced in the uterine epithelia during the period of implantation both in humans and mouse. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Hormone-replaced mice were used for in vivo experiments. To evaluate the effect of calcitonin on uterine receptivity, the expression of endometrial genes was analyzed 36 h after i.p. injection of 0.5 IU calcitonin in a treatment group versus saline in the control. To evaluate the effect of calcitonin on implantation efficiency in vivo, two groups received 0.5 IU or 2 IU calcitonin (i.p.) 24 h before embryo transfer, and a control group received saline (i.p.) (n = 18 mice per group). Implantation sites were counted 7 days after embryo transfer. The RL95-2 human endometrial carcinoma cell line was used to study the mechanisms underlying the effect of calcitonin on gene expression in the endometria. Using an in vitro model of endometrium-trophoblast interaction, established with RL95-2 cells and JAR (human choriocarcinoma cell line) trophoblast, endometrial receptivity was evaluated by comparing attachment and outgrowth of JAR spheroids in control and treatment groups. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Uterine receptivity in ovariectomized mice was induced by injection of estradiol and progesterone. Expression of eight genes in murine endometrium and RL95-2 cells was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemical analysis, flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We tested the effects of a protein kinase C inhibitor, matrigel and an antibody against integrin alphavbeta3 using RL95-2 cells and performed attachment and outgrowth assays using the in vitro model of endometrium-trophoblast interaction. Implantation efficiency was evaluated by counting the implantation sites after embryo transfer. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Calcitonin up-regulated alphavbeta3 in RL95 cells, which in turn resulted in increased levels of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) mRNA (both P < 0.01 versus control) and protein (both P < 0.05 versus control). The attachment and expansion of JAR spheroids was promoted by pretreatment of EECs with calcitonin (P < 0.05 versus control) together with significantly increased expression of alphavbeta3, LIF and HB-EGF. Moreover, the injection of calcitonin in the preimplantation phase increased the total number of implantation sites in treatment groups (55 in control versus 78 and 85 in 0.5 and 2 IU groups, respectively). Compared with the control group (3.11 +/- 2.14), the average number of implantation sites in the 2 IU calcitonin treatment group increased (4.72 +/- 1.87, P = 0.022). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Experiments were performed in mice and human cell lines but not in primary cultures of human endometrial cells. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings presented here have important implications, in that calcitonin administration (currently used for treatment of hypercalcemia or osteoporosis) may have clinical benefits in assisted reproduction programs, by facilitating endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. However, further studies are required to confirm these findings. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was supported by National Science Foundation of China (No. 81170619).

GSI I (Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) induces apoptosis of some tumor cells by inhibiting proteasome and Notch activity. Alterations in these two cell survival regulators contribute to apoptosis resistance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Here, we investigated the mechanisms whereby GSI I increases apoptosis of primary CLL cells. Time-course studies indicate that initial apoptotic events are inhibition of proteasome activity, concomitant with an increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic signaling, and a consistent Noxa protein up-regulation. These events precede, and some of them contribute to, mitochondrial alterations, which occur notwithstanding Mcl-1 accumulation induced by GSI I. In CLL cells, GSI I inhibits Notch1 and Notch2 activation only in the late apoptotic phases, suggesting that this event does not initiate CLL cell apoptosis. However, Notch inhibition may contribute to amplify GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, given that Notch activation sustains the survival of these cells, as demonstrated by the evidence that both Notch1 and Notch2 down-regulation by small-interfering RNA accelerates spontaneous CLL cell apoptosis. Overall, our results show that GSI I triggers CLL cell apoptosis by inhibiting proteasome activity and enhancing ER stress, and amplifies it by blocking Notch activation. These findings suggest the potential relevance of simultaneously targeting these three important apoptosis regulators as a novel therapeutic strategy for CLL.","['Rosati, Emanuela', 'Sabatini, Rita', 'De Falco, Filomena', 'Del Papa, Beatrice', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Cavalli, Laura', 'Fettucciari, Katia', 'Bartoli, Andrea', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco']","['Rosati E', 'Sabatini R', 'De Falco F', 'Del Papa B', 'Falzetti F', 'Di Ianni M', 'Cavalli L', 'Fettucciari K', 'Bartoli A', 'Screpanti I', 'Marconi P']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, General Pathology and Immunology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. erosati@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27863 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Apr 15;132(8):1940-53. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27863.

Therefore, polymorphisms in the anthracycline metabolizing enzymes have been proposed as potential biomarkers of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC). METHODS: We have previously shown that 13 of the naturally occurring nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNP) in the aldo-keto reductases (AKR) and carbonyl reductases (CBR) reduce anthracycline metabolic rate in vitro. Here, we test these SNPs individually and jointly for association with daunorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Five of the 13 nsSNPs exhibiting an in vitro effect on anthracycline metabolism were detected among the 185 patients with AML. No association was found between the SNPs and daunorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in either individual or joint effect analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the shown in vitro effect of nsSNPs in reductase genes on anthracycline metabolic rate, on their own these SNPs do not explain enough variability in cardiotoxicity to be useful markers of this adverse event. IMPACT: The results of this study provide important information for biomarker studies on side effects of anthracycline chemotherapy.","['Lubieniecka, Joanna M', 'Liu, Jie', 'Heffner, Daniel', 'Graham, Jinko', 'Reid, Ronald', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Grigliatti, Tom A', 'Riggs, Wayne K']","['Lubieniecka JM', 'Liu J', 'Heffner D', 'Graham J', 'Reid R', 'Hogge D', 'Grigliatti TA', 'Riggs WK']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of British Columbia, 2405 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Aldo-Keto Reductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.21 (Aldehyde Reductase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Aldehyde Reductase', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/07/11 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-1037 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1037 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Nov;21(11):2118-20. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1037.

Combining high-throughput RNA sequencing, functional characterization, mechanistic studies and clinical validation, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor downstream of the microRNA miR-9 and upstream of Hippo signaling. Restoring LIFR expression in highly malignant tumor cells suppresses metastasis by triggering a Hippo kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention and functional inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator YES-associated protein (YAP). Conversely, loss of LIFR in nonmetastatic breast cancer cells induces migration, invasion and metastatic colonization through activation of YAP. LIFR is downregulated in human breast carcinomas and inversely correlates with metastasis. Notably, in approximately 1,000 nonmetastatic breast tumors, LIFR expression status correlated with metastasis-free, recurrence-free and overall survival outcomes in the patients. These findings identify LIFR as a metastasis suppressor that functions through the Hippo-YAP pathway and has significant prognostic power.","['Chen, Dahu', 'Sun, Yutong', 'Wei, Yongkun', 'Zhang, Peijing', 'Rezaeian, Abdol Hossein', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Gupta, Sumeet', 'Liang, Han', 'Lin, Hui-Kuan', 'Hung, Mien-Chie', 'Ma, Li']","['Chen D', 'Sun Y', 'Wei Y', 'Zhang P', 'Rezaeian AH', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Gupta S', 'Liang H', 'Lin HK', 'Hung MC', 'Ma L']","['Department of Experimental Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/01/10 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2940 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2940 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2012 Oct;18(10):1511-7. doi: 10.1038/nm.2940.

HCLS1 binds the transcription factor lymphoid-enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF-1), transporting LEF-1 into the nucleus upon G-CSF stimulation and inducing LEF-1 autoregulation. In patients with severe congenital neutropenia, inherited mutations in the gene encoding HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) lead to profound defects in G-CSF-triggered phosphorylation of HCLS1 and subsequently to reduced autoregulation and expression of LEF-1. Consistent with these results, HCLS1-deficient mice are neutropenic. In bone marrow biopsies of the majority of tested patients with acute myeloid leukemia, HCLS1 protein expression is substantially elevated, associated with high levels of G-CSF synthesis and, in some individuals, a four-residue insertion in a proline-rich region of HCLS1 protein known to accelerate intracellular signaling. These data demonstrate the importance of HCLS1 in myelopoiesis in vitro and in vivo.","['Skokowa, Julia', 'Klimiankou, Maxim', 'Klimenkova, Olga', 'Lan, Dan', 'Gupta, Kshama', 'Hussein, Kais', 'Carrizosa, Esteban', 'Kusnetsova, Inna', 'Li, Zhixiong', 'Sustmann, Claudio', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Kreipe, Hans-Heinrich', 'Burkhardt, Janis', 'Grosschedl, Rudolf', 'Welte, Karl']","['Skokowa J', 'Klimiankou M', 'Klimenkova O', 'Lan D', 'Gupta K', 'Hussein K', 'Carrizosa E', 'Kusnetsova I', 'Li Z', 'Sustmann C', 'Ganser A', 'Zeidler C', 'Kreipe HH', 'Burkhardt J', 'Grosschedl R', 'Welte K']","['Department of Molecular Hematopoiesis, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. skokowa.julia@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (HAX1 protein, human)', '0 (HCLS1 protein, human)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, Autosomal Recessive 3']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', '*Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/genetics/physiopathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/01/10 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2958 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2958 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2012 Oct;18(10):1550-9. doi: 10.1038/nm.2958.

CLL as a disease entity is defined by a relatively parsimonious set of diagnostic criteria and therefore likely constitutes an umbrella term for multiple related illnesses. Of the enduring fundamental biological processes that affect the biology and clinical behavior of CLL, few are as central to the pathogenesis of CLL as recurrent acquired genomic copy number aberrations (aCNA) and recurrent gene mutations. Here, a state-of-the-art overview of the pathological anatomy of the CLL genome is presented, including detailed descriptions of the anatomy of aCNA and gene mutations. Data from SNP array profiling and large-scale sequencing of large CLL cohorts, as well as stimulated karyotyping, are discussed. This review is organized by discussions of the anatomy, underlying pathomechanisms and clinical significance of individual genomic lesions and recurrent gene mutations. Finally, gaps in knowledge regarding the biological and clinical effects of recurrent genomic aberrations or gene mutations on CLL are outlined to provide critical stimuli for future research.","['Malek, S N']",['Malek SN'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0936, USA. smalek@med.umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trisomy']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012411 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.411 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Jun 6;32(23):2805-17. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.411.

METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control analysis of leukaemia mortality in a pooled cohort of US nuclear workers followed through 2005. Each case was matched to four controls on attained age. Exposures were estimated from available records. General relative risk models were used to estimate the excess relative risk (ERR) of leukaemia, excluding chronic lymphocytic (CLL), acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and CLL while controlling for potential confounders. Preferred exposure lags and time-windows of risks were calculated using joint maximum likelihood. Dose-response was also examined using linear, linear-quadratic, categorical and restricted cubic spline models. RESULTS: There were 369 leukaemia deaths in 105 245 US nuclear workers. The adjusted ERR for non-CLL leukaemia was 0.09 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.65) per 100 mGy. Elevated non-CLL risks were observed from exposures occurring 6-14 years prior to attained age of cases (ERR per 100 mGy=1.9; 95% CI <0 to 8.0). Lagged models indicated non-linearity of risk at very low (<10 mGy) and high (>100 mGy) doses, which contributed to the imprecision of results in linear models. Similar risk attenuation was not evident in time-windows-based models. CONCLUSIONS: Risk estimates were in reasonable agreement with previous estimates, with the temporality of non-CLL leukaemia risk as a dominant factor in dose-response analyses. Future research should focus on methods that improve evaluations of the dose-response, particularly in the low-dose range.","['Daniels, Robert D', 'Bertke, Stephen', 'Waters, Kathleen M', 'Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K']","['Daniels RD', 'Bertke S', 'Waters KM', 'Schubauer-Berigan MK']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies (DSHEFS), Industrywide Studies Branch (IWSB), Cincinnati, OH 45226, USA. rtd2@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', '*Industry', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/02/14 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2012-100906 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2012-100906 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2013 Jan;70(1):41-8. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2012-100906.

We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 127 patients with AML who received allo- (n=52) or auto-HSCT (n=75) after achieving CR1 at a single medical center. The disease-free and overall survival rates and complications were analyzed. During a median follow-up of 1215 days, all patients (100%) in allo-HSCT group and 94.7% of patients in the auto-HSCT group had successful outcomes. The disease-free survival rates were 65.3% and 50.6% for allo- and auto-HSCT groups, respectively (P=0.158), while the overall survival rates were 65.3% and 54.9%, respectively (P=0.486). The recurrence rate was higher with auto-HSCT, whereas the GVHD only happened with allo-HSCT. In conclusion, auto-HSCT was as effective as allo-HSCT for the treatment of patients with AML after CR1.

Of them, 346 patients developed aGVHD by NCC, in whom we also analyzed factors affecting aGVHD-specific survival. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD was 44.7%, consisting of classic aGVHD (n=320) and late-onset (n=26). Multivariate analyses revealed that younger age (P=0.015), unrelated donors (P=0.004) and acute leukemia compared with other hematologic malignancies (P=0.005) were significant risk factors for aGVHD, whereas PBSCs showed no association (P=0.720). Multivariate analyses, with only aGVHD patients, revealed that late-onset aGVHD had superior aGVHD-specific survival to classic aGVHD (P=0.044), and identified the association of visceral organ involvement (P=0.002), severity of aGVHD at onset (P=0.035) and advanced disease status (P<0.001) with inferior aGVHD-specific survival. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the risk and prognostic factors for aGVHD by NCC with some differences with the previous reports that were based on old criteria. The difference in the risk factors according to different criteria will give insights about the pathophysiology of GVHD.

Haematogenous spread is a pre-requisite but it is not clear how S. aureus survive the onslaught of macrophages. Acanthamoeba is a protozoan pathogen that is remarkably similar to macrophages, particularly in their cellular structure (morphological and ultra-structural features), molecular motility, biochemical physiology, ability to capture prey by phagocytosis and interactions with microbial pathogens. Thus, we hypothesize that S. aureus exhibit similarities in their interactions with Acanthamoeba and ThP1 macrophage-like cells. Here, we studied interactions of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) with Acanthamoeba castellanii belonging to the T4 genotype and macrophage-like cells (ThP1). The findings revealed that both MRSA and MSSA exhibited similarities in their binding/association and invasion of A. castellanii and ThP1 cells. Long-term incubation showed that MRSA and MSSA can survive intracellularly of both Acanthamoeba and ThP1 cells. Overall, these findings suggest that Acanthamoeba exhibit similar characteristics with ThP1 macrophage-like cells in their interaction with MRSA and MSSA. Additionally it was shown that bacteria survive inside Acanthamoeba during the encystment process as evidenced by bacterial recovery from mature cysts. Given that Acanthamoeba cysts are airborne, these findings suggest that cysts may act as ""Trojan horse"" to help spread MRSA to susceptible hosts.","['Cardas, Mihaela', 'Khan, Naveed Ahmed', 'Alsam, Selwa']","['Cardas M', 'Khan NA', 'Alsam S']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, Essex, England, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Parasitol,Experimental parasitology,0370713,,IM,"['Acanthamoeba castellanii/*microbiology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/*microbiology', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/physiology', 'Sepsis/microbiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/microbiology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*physiology', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4894(12)00255-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exppara.2012.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Parasitol. 2012 Dec;132(4):513-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exppara.2012.08.014.

However, the factors that regulate its expression are not well understood. Loss as well as gain-of-function p53 mutations up-regulate STMN1 and in acute myelogenous leukemia where p53 is predominantly wild-type, STMN1 is also over-expressed. Here we show regulatory control of STMN1 expression by the leucine zipper transcription factor (TF) CREB1 and the basic helix-loop-helix TF LYL1. By ChIP-chip experiments we demonstrate in vivo the presence of LYL1 and CREB1 in close proximity on the STMN1 promoter and using promoter assays we reveal co-regulation of STMN1 by CREB1 and LYL1. By contrast, TAL1, another suspected oncoprotein in leukemia and close relative of LYL1, exerts no regulatory effect on the STMN1 promoter. NLI, LMO2 and GATA2 are previously described co-activators of Tal1/Lyl1-E47 transcriptional complexes and potentiate Lyl1 activation of the STMN1 promoter while having no effect on TAL1 transactivation. Promoter mutations that abrogate CREB1 proximal binding or mutations of the DNA-binding domain of CREB1 abolish LYL1 transcriptional activation. These results show that CRE and Ebox sites function as coordinated units and support previous evidence of joint CREB1-and LYL1 transcription events activating an aberrant subset of promoters in leukemia.

Previous reports have revealed that the two drugs are topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors, and patients treated with these agents have developed unique types of secondary leukemia. A study published in 1984 by Camerman and colleagues proposed that the therapeutic effects of bimolane could be due to ICRF-154, an impurity present within the bimolane samples that may also be responsible for the toxic effects attributed to bimolane. To date, this hypothesis has not been evaluated. In addition, little is known about the potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of ICRF-154. In this study, a combination of in vitro tests in human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells has been used to characterize the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of ICRF-154 and bimolane as well as to compare the results for the two chemicals. ICRF-154 and bimolane were both cytotoxic, exhibiting very similar effects in three measures of cytotoxicity and cell proliferation. In the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay with CREST-antibody staining, the two agents similarly induced chromosome breakage and, to a lesser extent, chromosome loss. Intriguingly, both drugs resulted in the formation of binucleated cells, perhaps as a consequence of an interference with cytokinesis. To further investigate their aneugenic effects, flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that both compounds also produced similar levels of non-disjunction and polyploidy. In each of the cellular and cytogenetic assays employed, the responses of the ICRF-154-treated cells were very similar to those observed with the bimolane, and generally occurred at equimolar test concentrations. Our results, combined with those from previous studies, strongly suggest that bimolane degrades to ICRF-154, and that ICRF-154 is most likely the chemical species responsible for the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and leukemogenic effects exerted by bimolane.","['Vuong, Minh C', 'Hasegawa, Leslie S', 'Eastmond, David A']","['Vuong MC', 'Hasegawa LS', 'Eastmond DA']","['Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program and Department of Cell Biology & Neuroscience, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '25O7OKR315 (bimolane)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', 'QML51S42CD (1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazin-1-yl)ethane)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Cytokinesis', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Razoxane/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*toxicity']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/04/03 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(12)00283-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2012.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2013 Jan 20;750(1-2):63-71. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2012.09.005.

Here, we examined the critical role of Mith in apoptosis and its molecular mechanism in DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells and tumor xenografts. Mith decreased cell growth and induced apoptosis in DU145 and PC-3 cells. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was over-expressed in both cell lines compared to RWPE1 cells. Mith inhibited Mcl-1 protein expression in both cells, but only altered Mcl-1 mRNA levels in PC-3 cells. We also found that Mith reduced Mcl-1 protein levels through both proteasome-dependent protein degradation and the inhibition of protein synthesis in DU145 cells. Studies using siRNA confirmed that the knockdown of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis. Mith significantly suppressed TPA-induced neoplastic cell transformation through the down-regulation of the Mcl-1 protein in JB6 cells, and suppressed the transforming activity of both cell types. Mith also inhibited tumor growth and Mcl-1 levels, in addition to inducing apoptosis, in athymic nude mice bearing DU145 cell xenografts without affecting five normal organs. Therefore, Mith inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis by suppressing Mcl-1 in both prostate cancer cells and xenograft tumors, and thus is a potent anticancer drug candidate for prostate cancer.","['Choi, Eun-Sun', 'Jung, Ji-Youn', 'Lee, Jin-Seok', 'Park, Jong-Hwan', 'Cho, Nam-Pyo', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Choi ES', 'Jung JY', 'Lee JS', 'Park JH', 'Cho NP', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeon-ju 561-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '97666-60-9 (mithramycin A)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",IM,"['Androgens/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Plicamycin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(12)00558-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2012.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 Jan 1;328(1):65-72. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2012.09.009.

On the contrary, leukemia/lymphoma cells escape from the surveillance of the donor-derived GVL effect by losing the target HLA (mismatched HLA in GVH direction). This mechanism has been called loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the HLA gene region on chromosome 6 [4,5].

The present study aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative effect and the underlying mechanisms of E.hyemale extract on murine leukemia L1210 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory effect of Ehyemale extract on L1210cells was evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Cell cycle distribution was evaluated with flow cytometry following PI (propidium iodide) staining. Apoptotic cell death was determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI and nuclear DAPI (4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. DNA damage and changes of mitochondrial membrane potential were also detected with flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: E.hyemale extract exerted significant antiproliferative effects on L1210 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed that E.hyemale extract induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in L1210 cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure, chromatin condensation, DNA damage and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were observed clearly after treatment with Ehyemale extract.

Using a database of 2518 adult patients with AML in CR1, we conducted a 5-month landmark analysis and found that auto-HCT improves 3-year RFS but not OS compared with chemotherapy. INTRODUCTION: A number of randomized trials in patients with AML in CR1 have been conducted and they showed that auto-HCT improves RFS but not OS, compared with chemotherapy. However, because these trials have had compliance problems, the value of auto-HCT still has not been clearly established. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a database of 2518 adult patients with AML in CR1, we retrospectively analyzed the outcome of auto-HCT and compared it with intensive nonmyeloablative chemotherapy using landmark analyses. RESULTS: In 103 auto-HCT recipients, OS and RFS at 3 years from treatment were 65% and 57%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that unfavorable risk cytogenetics and entry into CR1 after 2 courses of induction treatment predicted a poor outcome. Because the median time interval between CR1 and auto-HCT was 153 days, landmark analyses at 5 months after CR1 were performed to compare 1290 patients who received chemotherapy alone (median age, 52 years; range, 16-70) with 103 who received auto-HCT (median age, 48 years; range, 16-67). Auto-HCT improves 3-year RFS (58% vs. 37%; P < .001) but not OS compared with chemotherapy alone. Among patients with unfavorable risk cytogenetics or those who required 2 courses to reach CR1, there was no significant difference in RFS between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Auto-HCT can be considered as a postremission therapy for AML patients with favorable or intermediate risk cytogenetics who achieve CR1 after a single course of induction treatment.","['Usuki, Kensuke', 'Kurosawa, Saiko', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Yakushiji, Kazuaki', 'Waki, Fusako', 'Matsuishi, Eijo', 'Kagawa, Kumiko', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Shimoyama, Manabu', 'Ago, Hiroatsu', 'Yamano, Yujiro', 'Yano, Shingo', 'Fujishima, Naohito', 'Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Matsuoka, Hitoshi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro']","['Usuki K', 'Kurosawa S', 'Uchida N', 'Yakushiji K', 'Waki F', 'Matsuishi E', 'Kagawa K', 'Furukawa T', 'Maeda Y', 'Shimoyama M', 'Ago H', 'Yamano Y', 'Yano S', 'Fujishima N', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Eto T', 'Hidaka M', 'Matsuoka H', 'Fukuda T']","['Division of Hematology, NTT Kanto Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00137-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Dec;12(6):444-51. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.07.004.

Together, these data extend our understanding of this conserved and essential signaling pathway and provide insight into the mechanisms by which extracellular stimuli may lead to the coordinated regulation of transcription.","['Dawson, Mark A', 'Foster, Samuel D', 'Bannister, Andrew J', 'Robson, Samuel C', 'Hannah, Rebecca', 'Wang, Xiaonan', 'Xhemalce, Blerta', 'Wood, Andrew D', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Kouzarides, Tony']","['Dawson MA', 'Foster SD', 'Bannister AJ', 'Robson SC', 'Hannah R', 'Wang X', 'Xhemalce B', 'Wood AD', 'Green AR', 'Gottgens B', 'Kouzarides T']","['Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(12)00241-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2012.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2012 Sep 27;2(3):470-7. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.08.016.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria had never been described in a patient suffering from eosinophilic fasciitis. We report an original case of a 59-year-old patient who developed a moderate aplastic pancytopenia while he was treated for a biopsy-proven eosinophilic fasciitis. A complete set of investigations was carried out and was found to be negative, including a first research of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Two years after disease onset, while pancytopenia remained stable, occurrence of morning dark urine led to found a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone. We discuss a potential link between the two conditions and hypothesize that paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria blood cells may pre-exist for a long time and take a survival advantage in the setting of marrow injury, as observed in eosinophilic fasciitis with hematological complications. We finally suggest that paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria should be included as a hematological complication of eosinophilic fasciitis.","['de Boysson, Hubert', 'Cheze, Stephane', 'Chapon, Francoise', 'Le Mauff, Brigitte', 'Auzary, Christophe', 'Geffray, Loik']","['de Boysson H', 'Cheze S', 'Chapon F', 'Le Mauff B', 'Auzary C', 'Geffray L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hopital Robert-Bisson, 4, rue Roger-Aini, 14100 Lisieux, France. hubertdeboysson@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Joint Bone Spine,Joint bone spine,100938016,['Eosinophilic Fasciitis'],IM,"['Eosinophilia/*complications/*pathology', 'Fascia/pathology', 'Fasciitis/*complications/*pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/*complications']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1297-319X(12)00180-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbspin.2012.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Joint Bone Spine. 2013 Mar;80(2):208-10. doi: 10.1016/j.jbspin.2012.07.008.

Antiapoptotic MCL-1 in particular has emerged as a ubiquitous resistance factor in cancer. Although targeting the BCL-2 antiapoptotic subclass effectively restores the death pathway in BCL-2-dependent cancer, the development of molecules tailored to the binding specificity of MCL-1 has lagged. We previously discovered that a hydrocarbon-stapled MCL-1 BH3 helix is an exquisitely selective MCL-1 antagonist. By deploying this unique reagent in a competitive screen, we identified an MCL-1 inhibitor molecule that selectively targets the BH3-binding groove of MCL-1, neutralizes its biochemical lock-hold on apoptosis, and induces caspase activation and leukemia cell death in the specific context of MCL-1 dependence.","['Cohen, Nicole A', 'Stewart, Michelle L', 'Gavathiotis, Evripidis', 'Tepper, Jared L', 'Bruekner, Susanne R', 'Koss, Brian', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Walensky, Loren D']","['Cohen NA', 'Stewart ML', 'Gavathiotis E', 'Tepper JL', 'Bruekner SR', 'Koss B', 'Opferman JT', 'Walensky LD']","[""Departments of Pediatric Oncology and the Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2012/09/25 06:00,2014/07/11 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1074-5521(12)00271-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.07.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 2012 Sep 21;19(9):1175-86. doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.07.018.,10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.07.018 [doi] S1074-5521(12)00271-2 [pii],,"['R00 HL095929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA92625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL102175/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA092625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL102175/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3582387,['Chem Biol. 2012 Sep 21;19(9):1082-3.

Instead, simultaneous stimulation of integrins alpha(5)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5), alpha(6)beta(1) and alpha(9)beta(1) within the 3D scaffold greatly increased Akt1 and Smad 1/5/8 activation, which resulted in prolonged self-renewal of the ES cells.

After suffering from BKV-associated late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) with long-term sustained BKV viremia, he died of rapidly progressive pneumonia. On autopsy, numerous viral intranuclear inclusions were seen in his lungs and bladder. An immunohistochemical examination of his lungs was positive for simian virus 40. Based on these pathological results and the high sustained BKV viral load in his blood, we reached a diagnosis of BKV pneumonia. Viral infection can occasionally become life threatening among HSCT recipients. It is widely known that BKV can cause late-onset HC, but BKV-associated pneumonia is rare. Because of its rapid progression and poor prognosis, it is difficult to make an antemortem diagnosis of BKV pneumonia. A treatment strategy for BKV pneumonia also needs to be formulated. Similar to other viral pathogens, BKV can cause pneumonia and the clinician should therefore be aware of it in immunocompromised patients.","['Akazawa, Y', 'Terada, Y', 'Yamane, T', 'Tanaka, S', 'Aimoto, M', 'Koh, H', 'Nakane, T', 'Koh, K-R', 'Nakamae, H', 'Ohsawa, M', 'Wakasa, K', 'Hino, M']","['Akazawa Y', 'Terada Y', 'Yamane T', 'Tanaka S', 'Aimoto M', 'Koh H', 'Nakane T', 'Koh KR', 'Nakamae H', 'Ohsawa M', 'Wakasa K', 'Hino M']","['Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'BK Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Pneumonia, Viral/drug therapy/pathology/*virology', 'Polyomavirus Infections/drug therapy/pathology/*virology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy/pathology/*virology']",2012/09/25 06:00,2013/05/28 06:00,['2012/09/25 06:00'],"['2011/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12011 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2012 Dec;14(6):E142-6. doi: 10.1111/tid.12011.

While the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of CML was first suggested over 30 years ago, recently CML-initiating cells beyond HSCs are also being investigated. METHODS: Here we isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1+) cells from CML patients and we tested their biological characteristics. In addition, endothelial and hematopoietic differentiation assays were also performed to test their cancer stem cell ability. RESULTS: We found these cells expressed the BCR/ABL specific CML oncogene. Co-culture assay also indicated they could promote HSC blast colonies. Further studies showed they could differentiate not only into endothelial lineages but also into erythroid cells at the single-cell level. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal bone marrow-derived Flk1+CD34- multipotent stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation even after being expanded for more than 50 cell doublings, they might be the cancer stem cells and a target source in the treatment of CML.","['Xishan, Zhu', 'Xu, Zhou', 'Lawei, Yang', 'Gang, Liu']","['Xishan Z', 'Xu Z', 'Lawei Y', 'Gang L']","['Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, Guangdong, P.R.

METHODS: The full length cDNA of Mxi1 gene obtained from fetal lymphocyte and KG1 cells were inserted into plasmid pDs-red2-N1 respectively to generate pDs-red2-N1/Mri1 (wild/mutation type). Then the recombinant vector was transfected into Cos-7 cells via liposome. 48 hours post transfection, mRNA of Mri1 gene was detected by RT-PCR and Mxi1 protein expression was detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope in the Cos-7 cells. RESULTS: The eukaryotic expression vector of Mxi1 was constructed and transfected into eukaryotic cells successfully. The expression of red fluorescence protein in the transfected Cos-7 cells was observed under fluorescence microscope which implied the expression of Mxi1. The transfect efficiency of both wild and mutation type were in a high level in 3 days after transfected, which lasted to 6 d. RT-PCR amplified the total RNA extracted from the transfected Cos-7 cells could find increased mRNA level of Mxi1 gene. CONCLUSION: We successfully constructed the eukaryote expression vector for Mri1 gene; Cos-7 cells transfected with the vector via liposome could express Mxi1 protein. These could be useful for the further study of the Myc gene modulation.","['Guo, Xiao-Ling', 'Niu, Zhi-Yun', 'Zhang, Gai-Ling', 'Yin, Feng-Lei', 'Yang, Ling', 'Ren, Jin-Hai', 'Dong, Zuo-Ren', 'Zhu, Ping', 'Pan, Ling']","['Guo XL', 'Niu ZY', 'Zhang GL', 'Yin FL', 'Yang L', 'Ren JH', 'Dong ZR', 'Zhu P', 'Pan L']","['Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Heibei Institute of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

However, controversies still exist regarding the impact of IKZF1 in current treatment protocols. PROCEDURE: We simultaneously detected IKZF1 gene deletions by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and gene expression of IKZF1 isoforms in 206 children with BCR/ABL-negative ALL treated with ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocol, in which risk stratification was not based on minimal residual disease (MRD), and validated the results on a cohort of 189 patients treated with MRD-directed ALL-BFM 2000 protocol. RESULTS: Deletion of IKZF1 was present in 14 of 206 (7%) ALL IC patients. Interestingly, gene expression did not completely correlate with the deletion status in either cohort. Deletions were not always reflected in the gene expression of dominant-negative isoforms, and conversely, 7 of 395 (2%) non-deleted cases overexpressed dominant-negative isoform Ik6. IKZF1 deletions significantly affected event-free survival (EFS) of the ALL IC cohort (41 +/- 14% vs. 86 +/- 3%, P < 0.0001). Regarding IKZF1 isoforms, only Ik6 overexpression had negative prognostic impact (EFS 50 +/- 16% vs. 85 +/- 3%, P = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, which included ALL IC risk criteria, flow-cytometric MRD and IKZF1 alterations, day 15 MRD and IKZF1 deletion status displayed an independent prognostic impact. CONCLUSIONS: We show that MRD-directed treatment diminishes prognostic impact of IKZF1 alterations. However, IKZF1 status alone or combined with day 15 flow cytometry can significantly improve risk stratification within BFM protocols at centers that do not perform antigen-receptor-based MRD monitoring.","['Volejnikova, Jana', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Dorge, Petra', 'Meissner, Barbara', 'Zimmermannova, Olga', 'Svojgr, Karel', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stary, Jan', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Trka, Jan', 'Fronkova, Eva']","['Volejnikova J', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Dorge P', 'Meissner B', 'Zimmermannova O', 'Svojgr K', 'Stanulla M', 'Cario G', 'Schrappe M', 'Stary J', 'Hrusak O', 'Trka J', 'Fronkova E']","['2nd Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcriptome']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24299 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Mar;60(3):420-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24299.

GATA2 encodes a master regulator of hematopoiesis that is also linked to endothelial biology. Though the disease-causing mutations commonly occur in the GATA-2 DNA binding domain, we identified a patient with mycobacterial infection and myelodysplasia who had an uncharacterized heterozygous deletion in a GATA2 cis-element consisting of an E-box and a GATA motif. Targeted deletion of the equivalent murine element to yield homozygous mutant mice revealed embryonic lethality later than occurred with global Gata2 knockout, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell depletion, and impaired vascular integrity. Heterozygous mutant mice were viable, but embryos exhibited deficits in definitive, but not primitive, hematopoietic stem/progenitor activity and reduced expression of Gata2 and its target genes. Mechanistic analysis revealed disruption of the endothelial cell transcriptome and loss of vascular integrity. Thus, the composite element disrupted in a human immunodeficiency is essential for establishment of the murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell compartment in the fetal liver and for essential vascular processes.","['Johnson, Kirby D', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Ryu, Myung-Jeom', 'Wang, Jinyong', 'Gao, Xin', 'Boyer, Meghan E', 'Liu, Yangang', 'Lee, Youngsook', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Keles, Sunduz', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Johnson KD', 'Hsu AP', 'Ryu MJ', 'Wang J', 'Gao X', 'Boyer ME', 'Liu Y', 'Lee Y', 'Calvo KR', 'Keles S', 'Zhang J', 'Holland SM', 'Bresnick EH']","['Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, UW Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Vessels/*embryology/pathology', '*E-Box Elements', 'Embryonic Development/genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Hemorrhage/embryology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mycobacterium Infections/etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics', '*Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Sequence Deletion']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['61623 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI61623 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Oct;122(10):3692-704. doi: 10.1172/JCI61623.

Here, we visualize the anti-leukemia effect of bortezomib in both human T-ALL cell line and animal models. In vitro study, a human T-ALL cell line bearing Notch1 mutations, MOLT-4, was treated with bortezomib. At clinically achievable concentrations, bortezomib inhibited cell growth by inducing G1 phase arrest and apoptosis with a dose-dependent manner. A murine tumor xenograft model was achieved by subcutaneous injection of MOLT-4 cells for in vivo study. Administration of bortezomib significantly reduced tumor mass volume when compared with controls. Of note, bortezomib inhibited growth of leukemia cells in a Notch1-induced murine T-ALL model, and the life span of leukemia-bearing mice was markedly increased. Further studies revealed that bortezomib led to inhibited expression of Notch1 target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that bortezomib shows significant anti-leukemia effect in T-ALL bearing Notch1 mutations in vitro and in vivo. The present study provides evidence that bortezomib might be a candidate therapeutic reagent in the treatment of T-ALL.","['Huang, Chongmei', 'Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Wang, Libing', 'Lu, Shuqing', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Yang, Jianmin']","['Huang C', 'Hu X', 'Wang L', 'Lu S', 'Cheng H', 'Song X', 'Wang J', 'Yang J']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, PLA, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-012-1953-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Dec;70(6):801-9. doi: 10.1007/s00280-012-1953-4.

We previously showed that macrophages protect myeloma cells, on a cell contact basis, from melphalan or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in vitro. In this study, we found that macrophage-mediated myeloma drug resistance was also seen with purified macrophages from myeloma patients' bone marrow (BM) in vitro and was confirmed in vivo using the human myeloma-SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mouse model. By profiling differentially regulated and paired plasma membrane protein genes, we showed that PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1)/selectins and ICAM-1/CD18 played an important role in macrophage-mediated myeloma cell drug resistance, as blocking antibodies against these molecules or genetic knockdown of PSGL-1 or ICAM-1 in myeloma cells repressed macrophages' ability to protect myeloma cells. Interaction of macrophages and myeloma cells via these molecules activated Src and Erk1/2 kinases and c-myc pathways and suppressed caspase activation induced by chemotherapy drugs.

Previously, we showed that HSCs use glycolytic metabolism to meet their energy demands. However, the mechanism of regulation of HSC metabolism, and the importance of maintaining this distinct metabolic phenotype on HSC function has not been determined. More importantly, the primary function of Meis1 in HSCs remains unknown. Here, we examined the effect of loss of Meis1 on HSC function and metabolism. Inducible Meis1 deletion in adult mouse HSCs resulted in loss of HSC quiescence, and failure of bone marrow repopulation after transplantation. While we previously showed that Meis1 regulates Hif-1alpha transcription in vitro, we demonstrate here that loss of Meis1 results in down-regulation of both Hif-1alpha and Hif-2alpha in HSCs. This resulted in a shift to mitochondrial metabolism, increased reactive oxygen species production, and apoptosis of HSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of Meis1 knockout on HSCs is entirely mediated through reactive oxygen species where treatment of the Meis1 knockout mice with the scavenger N-acetylcystein restored HSC quiescence and rescued HSC function. These results uncover an important transcriptional network that regulates metabolism, oxidant defense, and maintenance of HSCs.","['Kocabas, Fatih', 'Zheng, Junke', 'Thet, Suwannee', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'DeBerardinis, Ralph J', 'Zhang, Chengcheng', 'Sadek, Hesham A']","['Kocabas F', 'Zheng J', 'Thet S', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA', 'DeBerardinis RJ', 'Zhang C', 'Sadek HA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, 6000 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glycolysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49835-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-432260 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 13;120(25):4963-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-432260.

A 16 years study].,607-12,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The survival of haematologic patients admitted to Intensive Care units (ICU) is so poor, that it is debatable whether they should be admitted or not to them. We aimed to find out the survival of these patients in an ICU to know if their admission is justified. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective study of 600 haematologic patients (49.4 +/- 16.4 years, 58.3% male) representing a total of 660 different admissions to the ICU of a university hospital, with a 6 months follow-up. Haematologic diseases were: leukaemia (50.5%), lymphoma (18.7%), myeloma (10.0%), myelodysplasic syndromes (4.2%), aplastic anaemia or bone marrow aplasia (3.3%), thrombotic microangiopathies and HELLP syndrome (7.4%), and others. RESULTS: A total of 37.5% of patients survived. Survival of thrombotic microangiopathies and HELLP syndrome was higher (81.8% of patients) than that of leukaemias (26.6%) and lymphomas (49.1%). When the reason for ICU admission was respiratory failure with or without septic shock, the survival was lower (20 and 27% of admissions respectively) than when it was septic shock alone (58.7%). Survival of mechanically ventilated patients was 14.6%, that of those treated with any renal replacement therapy 32.4% and that of patients with both treatments 13.8%. From all mechanically ventilated leukaemia or lymphoma patients, 10.3% survived (93 days in the ICU per life saved) but only 7.7% were alive 6 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that the ICU survival was higher than 10% for all the groups studied, we conclude that admission of haematologic patients to the ICU is appropriate.","['Jannone Fores, Rosa', 'Botella de Maglia, Javier', 'Bonastre Mora, Juan']","['Jannone Fores R', 'Botella de Maglia J', 'Bonastre Mora J']","['Servicio de Medicina Intensiva, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Espana. rosa.jannone@gmail.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*mortality/therapy', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/04/30 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-7753(12)00612-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.medcli.2012.02.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2012 Dec 8;139(14):607-12. doi: 10.1016/j.medcli.2012.02.027.

A better understanding of the BCR-ABL signalling network may lead to better therapy. FINDINGS: Here we report the discovery of a novel downstream target of BCR-ABL signalling, PRL-3 (PTP4A3), an oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase. Analysis of CML cancer cell lines and CML patient samples reveals the upregulation of PRL-3. Inhibition of BCR-ABL signalling either by Imatinib or by RNAi silencing BCR-ABL reduces PRL-3 and increases cleavage of PARP. In contrast, the amount of PRL-3 protein remains constant or even increased in response to Imatinib treatment in drug resistant cells expressing P210 T315I. Finally, analysis with specific shRNA shows PRL-3 involvement in the proliferation and self-renewal of CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data support a role for PRL-3 in BCR-ABL signalling and CML biology and may be a potential therapeutic target downstream of BCR-ABL in TKI resistant mutant cells.","['Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Cheong, Lip-Lee', 'Liu, Shaw-Cheng', 'Chong, Phyllis S Y', 'Mahara, Sylvia', 'Bi, Chonglei', 'Ong, Kelly Ok', 'Zeng, Qi', 'Chng, Wee Joo']","['Zhou J', 'Cheong LL', 'Liu SC', 'Chong PS', 'Mahara S', 'Bi C', 'Ong KO', 'Zeng Q', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTP4A3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-11-72 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-11-72 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2012 Sep 21;11:72. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-11-72.,10.1186/1476-4598-11-72 [doi],20120921,,,PMC3537646,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV infects cattle worldwide, imposing a severe economic impact on the dairy cattle industry. Recently, we developed a new quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using Coordination of Common Motifs (CoCoMo) primers to measure the proviral load of known and novel BLV variants in BLV-infected animals. Indeed, the assay was highly effective in detecting BLV in cattle from a range of international locations. This assay enabled us to demonstrate that proviral load correlates not only with BLV infection capacity as assessed by syncytium formation, but also with BLV disease progression. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of our BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR method for detecting BLV proviruses with the sensitivities of two real-time PCR systems, and also determined the differences of proviral load with serotests. RESULTS: BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR was found to be highly sensitive when compared with the real-time PCR-based TaqMan MGB assay developed by Lew et al. and the commercial TaKaRa cycleave PCR system. The BLV copy number determined by BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR was only partially correlated with the positive rate for anti-BLV antibody as determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, passive hemagglutination reaction, or agar gel immunodiffusion. This result indicates that, although serotests are widely used for the diagnosis of BLV infection, it is difficult to detect BLV infection with confidence by using serological tests alone. Two cattle were experimentally infected with BLV. The kinetics of the provirus did not precisely correlate with the change in anti-BLV antibody production. Moreover, both reactions were different in cattle that carried different bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the quantitative measurement of proviral load by BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR is useful tool for evaluating the progression of BLV-induced disease. BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR allows us to monitor the spread of BLV infection in different viewpoint compared with classical serotest.","['Jimba, Mayuko', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Murakami, Hironobu', 'Kohara, Junko', 'Kobayashi, Naohiko', 'Matsuhashi, Tamako', 'Ohmori, Takashi', 'Nunoya, Tetsuo', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Jimba M', 'Takeshima SN', 'Murakami H', 'Kohara J', 'Kobayashi N', 'Matsuhashi T', 'Ohmori T', 'Nunoya T', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hemagglutination Tests/veterinary', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Load']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/03/26 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1746-6148-8-167 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-6148-8-167 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2012 Sep 21;8:167. doi: 10.1186/1746-6148-8-167.,10.1186/1746-6148-8-167 [doi],20120921,,,PMC3489618,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Exposure over a long period and on a daily basis to magnetic fields resulted in no changes in the levels or patterns of hematological and immune system variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that a long-term exposure to 50-Hz magnetic fields does not affect the hematological and immune system functions or their profile in healthy men, at least for the variables studied, and suggest that magnetic fields have no cumulative effects on these functions.","['Touitou, Yvan', 'Djeridane, Yasmina', 'Lambrozo, Jacques', 'Camus, Francoise', 'Selmaoui, Brahim']","['Touitou Y', 'Djeridane Y', 'Lambrozo J', 'Camus F', 'Selmaoui B']","['Chronobiology Unit, Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild, Paris, France. yvan.touitou@chronobiology.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Humans', '*Immune System', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Toxicity Tests, Chronic']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9120(12)00533-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2013 Jan;46(1-2):59-63. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.09.003.

Genetic studies have identified somatic JAK2(V617F) mutations and other mutant alleles that activate JAK-STAT signaling in most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). As a result, JAK inhibitors have been developed to treat various malignancies and have been shown to be efficacious in both preclinical and clinical settings. However, available ATP-competitive JAK (type I) inhibitors are associated with dose-dependent toxicities, and do not yet reduce disease burden in MPN patients. Recent studies suggest that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms can cause insensitivity to type I JAK inhibitors. Novel therapies include the development of type II JAK inhibitors and the use of alternative strategies to abrogate JAK-STAT signaling, perhaps with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors. These innovative therapies may translate to treatment of other diseases that are dependent on JAK signaling, including B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).","['LaFave, Lindsay M', 'Levine, Ross L']","['LaFave LM', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Trends Pharmacol Sci,Trends in pharmacological sciences,7906158,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/02/19 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-6147(12)00146-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tips.2012.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2012 Nov;33(11):574-82. doi: 10.1016/j.tips.2012.08.005.

In this study, we developed a novel small molecule screening strategy that utilizes HaloTag technology to identify several small molecules that disrupt binding of the JARID1A PHD finger to histone peptides. Small molecule inhibitors were validated biochemically through affinity pull downs, fluorescence polarization, and histone reader specificity studies.

RESULTS: The survival inhibition rate of combined application of 100 mug/ml TRAIL and 1 mug/ml oxaliplatin on OS-732 cells was significantly higher than that of either agent singly (p<0.01). Changes of cellular shape and apoptotic rates also indicated apoptosis-inducing effects of combined application to be much stronger than those of individual application.

METHODS: To clarify the roles of Bmi-1 in tumourigenesis and progression of gastric carcinomas, it was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time RT-PCR in gastric carcinomas, dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia (IM), and gastritis with a comparison of its expression with clinicopathological parameters of carcinomas. RESULTS: There was gradually increased Bmi-1 protein expression from gastritis, IM, dyplasia to carcinoma (p<0.001). Bmi-1 expression was positively linked to tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and worse prognosis of carcinomas (p<0.001), but not to age or sex of carcinoma patients (p>0.05). There was higher Bmi-1 protein expression in intestinal-type carcinomas than diffuse-type ones (p<0.001). At mRNA level, Bmi-1 protein expression was increased from gastritis, IM, dysplasia and carcinoma (p<0.001). Bmi-1 overexpression was observed in gastric carcinoma with larger diameter, deeper invasion, lymph node metastasis, and intestinal-type carcinoma (p<0.05).

Five major risk stratifying fusion genes in ALL are BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, ETV6-RUNX11, E2A-PBX1 and SIL-TAL1. This work aimed to detect common chromosomal translocations and associated fusion oncogenes in adult ALL patients and study their relationship with clinical features and treatment outcome. METHODS: We studied fusion oncogenes in 104 adult ALL patients using RT-PCR and interphase-FISH at diagnosis and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment outcome. RESULTS: Five most common fusion genes i.e. BCR-ABL (t 9; 22), TCF3-PBX1 (t 1; 19), ETV6-RUNX1 (t 12; 21), MLL-AF4 (t 4; 11) and SIL-TAL1 (Del 1p32) were found in 82/104 (79%) patients. TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene was associated with lymphadenopathy, SIL-TAL positive patients had frequent organomegaly and usually presented with a platelets count of less than 50 x10(9)/l. Survival of patients with fusion gene ETV6-RUNX1 was better when compared to patients harboring other genes. MLL-AF4 and BCR-ABL positivity characterized a subset of adult ALL patients with aggressive clinical behaviour and a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study from Pakistan which investigated the frequency of 5 fusion oncogenes in adult ALL patients, and their association with clinical features, treatment response and outcome. Frequencies of some of the oncogenes were different from those reported elsewhere and they appear to be associated with distinct clinical characteristics and treatment outcome. This information will help in the prognostic stratification and risk adapted management of adult ALL patients.","['Sabir, Noreen', 'Iqbal, Zafar', 'Aleem, Aamer', 'Awan, Tashfeen', 'Naeem, Tahir', 'Asad, Sultan', 'Tahir, Ammara H', 'Absar, Muhammad', 'Hasanato, Rana M W', 'Basit, Sulman', 'Chishti, Muhammad Azhar', 'Faiyaz Ul-Haque, Muhammad', 'Khalid, Ahmad Muktar', 'Sabar, Muhammad Farooq', 'Rasool, Mahmood', 'Karim, Sajjad', 'Khan, Mahwish', 'Samreen, Baila', 'Akram, Afia M', 'Siddiqi, Muhammad Hassan', 'Shahzadi, Saba', 'Shahbaz, Sana', 'Ali, Agha Shabbir', 'Mahmood, Amer', 'Akram, Muhammad', 'Saeed, Tariq', 'Saleem, Arsalan', 'Mohsin, Danish', 'Shah, Ijaz Hussain', 'Khalid, Muhammad', 'Asif, Muhammad', 'Iqbal, Mudassar', 'Akhtar, Tanveer']","['Sabir N', 'Iqbal Z', 'Aleem A', 'Awan T', 'Naeem T', 'Asad S', 'Tahir AH', 'Absar M', 'Hasanato RM', 'Basit S', 'Chishti MA', 'Faiyaz Ul-Haque M', 'Khalid AM', 'Sabar MF', 'Rasool M', 'Karim S', 'Khan M', 'Samreen B', 'Akram AM', 'Siddiqi MH', 'Shahzadi S', 'Shahbaz S', 'Ali AS', 'Mahmood A', 'Akram M', 'Saeed T', 'Saleem A', 'Mohsin D', 'Shah IH', 'Khalid M', 'Asif M', 'Iqbal M', 'Akhtar T']","['Faculty of Biological Sciences, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SIL-TAL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Diseases/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Pakistan', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.7.3349 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(7):3349-55. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.7.3349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study apoptogenic activity and mechanisms of cell death induced by terpinen-4-ol were investigated in the human leukemic MOLT-4 cell line. Terpinen-4-ol exhibited cytotoxicity in MOLT-4 cells, with characteristic morphological features of apoptosis by Wright's staining. The mode of cell death was confirmed to be apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis after staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. A sub-G1 peak in DNA histograms of cell cycle assays was observed. Terpinen-4-ol induced-MOLT-4 cell apoptosis mediated through an intrinsic pathway involving the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. In addition, terpinen-4-ol also induced apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway by caspase-8 activation resulting in the cleavage of cytosolic Bid. Truncated-Bid (tBid) translocated to mitochondria and activated the mitochondrial pathway in conjunction with down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. Caspase-3 activity also increased. In conclusion, terpinen-4-ol can induce human leukemic MOLT-4 cell apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.","['Khaw-on, Patompong', 'Banjerdpongchai, Ratana']","['Khaw-on P', 'Banjerdpongchai R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Terpenes)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '562-74-3 (terpinenol-4)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.7.3073 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(7):3073-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.7.3073.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several important observations related to other prognostic factors including lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG), and percent of smudge cell in peripheral blood smears, cytogenetic and molecular analysis have been made. The aim of this study was to evaluate a range of prognostic factors in our CLL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy patients with CLL were enrolled. Prognostic factors of disease including Binet staging, LDT, beta2-MG, ESR, LDH, percent of smudge cell in peripheral blood smear, absolute lymphocyte count, and conventional cytogenetic (CC) analysis were evaluated at diagnosis, and the patients were followed up to determine their outcome. We compared factors with each other and with Binet staging and prognosis. RESULTS: Enrolled patients aged 37-85 years at diagnosis or during follow up. There was no relationship between serum LDH level (P=0.3), ESR (P=0.11), percent of smudge cells in peripheral blood smear (P=0.94), and absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.18) with the stage of disease and prognosis, but the beta2 macroglobulin level (p<0.0001), LDT (p<0.001) had direct and significant relation with staging and outcome. In 19% of patients cytogenetic alteration were seen. CONCLUSION: The detection of cytogenetic alteration only using the CC method is not sufficient and we need to use FISH, but because FISH study is an expensive method not available in all areas, we believe that beta2 MG can be applied in its place as a good prognostic factor for CLL at diagnosis and during follow up. We suggest to add it to Binet staging for prognostic subgrouping of CLL.","['Mozaheb, Zahra', 'Hasanzadeh NazarAbadi, Mohamad Hasan', 'Aghaee, Monavar Afzal']","['Mozaheb Z', 'Hasanzadeh NazarAbadi MH', 'Aghaee MA']","['Department of hematology-oncology, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Iran. mozahebz@mums.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Lymphocyte Count/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Thymidine Kinase/blood', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.7.3009 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(7):3009-13. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.7.3009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of transient reporter gene assays are generally accepted to reflect transcriptional processes correctly, though these assays study regulatory sequences outside of the chromosomal environment and draw conclusions on transcription based on enzyme activity determination. For transient reporter gene assays, often more than one promoter is introduced into one cell. In addition to the one driving the primary reporter gene expression, a further one might serve to ensure the production of an internal control second reporter or/and a trans-acting factor. We demonstrate here by various examples that interference between physically unlinked promoters can profoundly affect reporter expression. Results of reporter gene assays performed by combinations of the cytomegalovirus promoter and various other promoter constructs (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type I (HTLV-I), NF-kappaB-responsive, and p53-responsive) and trans-activator factors (HIV-Tat and p53) in different host cell lines (U2OS, HeLa, and L929) prove that interference between active transcription units can modify transcription responses dramatically. Since the interference depends on the promoters used, on the amount of transfected DNA, on the host cells, and on other factors, extra caution is required in interpreting results of transient reporter gene assays.","['Huliak, Ildiko', 'Sike, Adam', 'Zencir, Sevil', 'Boros, Imre M']","['Huliak I', 'Sike A', 'Zencir S', 'Boros IM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements/methods', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/01/19 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2012.1711 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2012 Nov;31(11):1580-4. doi: 10.1089/dna.2012.1711.

Del(11q) and del(17p), routinely studied by conventional G-banding cytogenetics (CGC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), have been related to progression and shorter overall survival. Recently, array-based karyotyping has gained acceptance as a high-resolution new tool for detecting genomic imbalances. The aim of the present study was to compare genomic arrays with CGC and FISH to ascertain whether the current techniques could be substituted in routine procedures. We analyzed 70 patients with CLL using the Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7M Array and CytoScan HD Array (Affymetrix), CGC and FISH with the classical CLL panel. Whereas 31.4% and 68.6% of patients presented abnormalities when studied by CGC and FISH, respectively, these rates increased when arrays were also analyzed (78.6% and 80%). Although abnormality detection is higher when arrays are applied, one case with del(11q) and three with del(17p) were missed by genomic arrays due to their limited sensitivity. We consider that the complete substitution of CGC and FISH by genomic arrays in routine laboratories could negatively affect the management of some patients harboring 11q or 17p deletions. In conclusion, genomic arrays are valid to detect known and novel genomic imbalances in CLL, but should be maintained as a complementary tool to the current techniques.","['Puiggros, Anna', 'Puigdecanet, Eulalia', 'Salido, Marta', 'Ferrer, Ana', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Gimeno, Eva', 'Nonell, Lara', 'Herranz, Maria Jose', 'Galvan, Ana Belen', 'Rodriguez-Rivera, Maria', 'Melero, Carme', 'Pairet, Silvia', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Serrano, Sergi', 'Florensa, Lourdes', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Espinet, Blanca']","['Puiggros A', 'Puigdecanet E', 'Salido M', 'Ferrer A', 'Abella E', 'Gimeno E', 'Nonell L', 'Herranz MJ', 'Galvan AB', 'Rodriguez-Rivera M', 'Melero C', 'Pairet S', 'Bellosillo B', 'Serrano S', 'Florensa L', 'Sole F', 'Espinet B']","['Programa de Recerca en Cancer, Grup de Recerca Translacional en Neoplasies Hematologiques (GRETNHE), IMIM-Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', '*Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/09/22 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2012/09/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.731598 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 May;54(5):986-95. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.731598.

The presence of LSCs has been demonstrated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), of which ALL with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)). The use of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), as part of front-line treatment and in combination with cytotoxic agents, has greatly improved the proportions of complete response and molecular remission and the overall outcome in adults with newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL. New challenges have emerged with respect to induction of resistance to imatinib via Abelson tyrosine kinase mutations. An important recent addition to the arsenal against Ph(+) leukemias in general was the development of novel TKIs, such as nilotinib and dasatinib. However, in vitro experiments have suggested that TKIs have an antiproliferative but not an antiapoptotic or cytotoxic effect on the most primitive ALL stem cells. None of the TKIs in clinical use target the LSC. Second generation TKI dasatinib has been shown to have a more profound effect on the stem cell compartment but the drug was still unable to kill the most primitive LSCs. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) remains the only curative treatment available for these patients. Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the resistance of LSCs to TKIs in addition to mutations. Hence, TKIs may be used as a bridge to SCT rather than monotherapy or combination with standard chemotherapy. Better understanding the biology of Ph(+) ALL will open new avenues for effective management. In this review, we highlight recent findings relating to the question of LSCs in Ph(+) ALL.","['Thomas, Xavier']",['Thomas X'],"['Xavier Thomas, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69495 Pierre Benite, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,World J Stem Cells,World journal of stem cells,101535826,,,,2012/09/21 06:00,2012/09/21 06:01,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4252/wjsc.v4.i6.44 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Stem Cells. 2012 Jun 26;4(6):44-52. doi: 10.4252/wjsc.v4.i6.44.,,,,,PMC3443711,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Leukemia stem cells', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,

Excessive vascularity results in bleeding complications, and the inhibition of angiogenesis is a promising strategy for managing extensive JNA tumors. To better characterize the endothelial components of JNA, we aimed to evaluate markers of vascular differentiation and proliferation, such as friend leukemia integration-1 (FLI-1) and endoglin, lymphatic markers, including podoplanin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) and its cognate ligand VEGFC, GLUT-1, a diagnostic marker that discriminates between hemangiomas and vascular malformations, and two markers of tissue remodeling, stromelysin 3 (ST3) and secreted acid protein rich in cysteine (SPARC). Antigens were assessed immunohistochemically in vessels and stromal cells of JNA archival cases (n=22). JNA endothelial cells were positive for endoglin, VEGFC and FLI-1, whereas podoplanin and VEGFR3 were negative in all cases. Both endothelial cells and fibroblasts stained for ST3 and SPARC. GLUT-1 was investigated in JNA cases, in infantile hemangiomas (n=123) and in vascular malformations (n=135) as controls. JNAs and vascular malformations were GLUT-1-negative, while hemangiomas showed positive staining. The presence of markers of endothelial differentiation and proliferation highlighted the hyper-proliferative state of JNA vessels. The absence of podoplanin and VEGFR3 underscores their blood endothelial cell characteristic. The absence of GLUT-1 discriminates JNAs from hemangiomas. ST3 and SPARC up-regulation in endothelial cells and fibroblasts may contribute to a compensatory signaling for controlling angiogenesis. Some of these markers may eventually serve as therapeutic targets. Our results may aid in the understanding of JNA pathophysiology.","['Nonogaki, Suely', 'Campos, Heloisa G A', 'Butugan, Ossamu', 'Soares, Fernando A', 'Mangone, Flavia Regina Rotea', 'Torloni, Humberto', 'Brentani, M Mitzi']","['Nonogaki S', 'Campos HG', 'Butugan O', 'Soares FA', 'Mangone FR', 'Torloni H', 'Brentani MM']","['Instituto Adolfo Lutz, Central, Divisao de Patologia, Laboratorio de Imuno-histoquimica, CEP 01246-902;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,2010/11/01 00:00,2010/11/01 00:01,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2010.141 [doi]', 'etm-01-06-0921 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2010 Nov;1(6):921-926. doi: 10.3892/etm.2010.141.

Cord blood mononuclear cells were depleted of mature blood cell linage (Lin)-positive cells and then Lin-negative cells were sorted by flow cytometry based on the expression of CD34 and CD318. Analysis of sorted cells by colony-forming assay showed that CD34(+)CD318(+) cells produced more mixed colony forming units and erythroid burst forming unit-derived colonies than CD34(+)CD318(-) cells. These colonies were also produced by CD34(-)CD318(+) and CD34(-)CD318(-) cells, but were generally fewer in number.

We examined whether ADAR-1 could edit HTLV-2 and STLV-3 virus genomes in cell culture and in vivo. Using a highly sensitive PCR-based method, referred to as 3DI-PCR, we showed that ADAR-1 could hypermutate adenosine residues in HTLV-2. STLV-3 hypermutation was obtained without using 3DI-PCR, suggesting a higher mutation frequency for this virus.

To determine the role of the 205-nucleotide deletion in the pathogenicity of ALV-J, a pair of viruses were constructed and rescued. The first virus was an ALV-J Chinese isolate (designated HLJ09SH01) containing the 205-nucleotide deletion in its 3'UTR. The second virus was a chimeric clone in which the 3'UTR contains a 205-nucleotide sequence corresponding to a region of the ALV-J prototype virus. The replication and pathogenicity of the rescued viruses (rHLJ09SH01 and rHLJ09SH01A205) were investigated. Compared to rHLJ09SH01A205, rHLJ09SH01 showed a moderate growth advantage in vitro and in vivo, in addition to exhibiting a higher oncogenicity rate and lethality rate in layers and broilers. Increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and vascular endothelial growth receptor subtype 2 (VEGFR-2) expression was induced by rHLJ09SH01 more so than by rHLJ09SH01A205 during early embryonic vascular development, but this increased expression disappeared when the expression levels were normalized to the viral levels. This finding suggests that the expression of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 is associated with viral replication and may also represent a novel molecular mechanism underlying the oncogenic potential of ALV-J.

Evidence suggests that the progression of hematolymphoid malignancies also depends on the induction of new blood vessel formation under the influence of acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, multiple myeloma and lymphomas. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most important proangiogenic agent that activates receptors on vascular endothelial cells and promotes blood vessel regeneration. It has been demonstrated that VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression is upregulated in several types of hematolymphoid tumor cells accompanied with angiogenesis. The levels of VEGF/VEGFR are correlated with the treatment, relapse and prognosis of hematolymphoid tumors. In order for VEGF family and their receptors as antiangiogenic targets to treat solid tumors, several antiangiogenic agents targeting VEGF-related pathways have been used for the treatment of hematolymphoid malignancies in clinical trials. The results demonstrate a promising therapeutic intervention in multiple types of hematolymphoid tumors. This review aims to summarize recent advances in understanding the role of VEGF and angiogenesis in leukemias, mainly focusing on their upstream transcriptors, downstream targets and the correlation of VEGF/VEGFR with the treatment, relapse or prognosis of leukemia.

The objective of this study was to test the reliability and validity of the pediatric modified-Total Neuropathy Scale (ped-mTNS) to measure chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in school-aged children. METHODS: Forty-one subjects aged 5-18 years undergoing chemotherapy with vincristine or cisplatin and 41 age- and gender-matched controls completed study measures. Subjects were tested with the ped-mTNS at a specified time during treatment. Standardized measures of balance and hand function were completed concurrently. Internal consistency of the ped-mTNS was evaluated using Chronbach's alpha. Validity was tested by comparing case and control ped-mTNS scores as well as testing the hypothesis that ped-mTNS scores would be associated with scores on tests of balance and manual dexterity. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability were each assessed in a subset of 10 subjects. RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, six with lymphoma, and 12 with solid tumors completed measures along with 41 age- and gender-matched controls. Internal consistency was acceptable with a Chronbach's alpha of 0.76. Children undergoing treatment for cancer had significantly worse scores on the ped-mTNS compared to controls (subjects, 8.7 +/- 4.2; controls, 1.4 +/- 0.9; p < 0.001). As hypothesized, scores on the ped-mTNS were associated with measures of balance and manual dexterity. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.9 each). CONCLUSIONS: The ped-mTNS is a reliable and valid measure of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in school-aged children that is associated with relevant functional limitations.","['Gilchrist, Laura S', 'Tanner, Lynn']","['Gilchrist LS', 'Tanner L']","[""Hematology and Oncology Program, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55404, USA. lsgilchrist@stkate.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Observer Variation', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2012/09/21 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-012-1591-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2013 Mar;21(3):847-56. doi: 10.1007/s00520-012-1591-8.

In this study we compared results of flow cytometric immunophenotype (FCI) with cytomorphology, histopathology and clinical findings in a series of patients with NK cell neoplasms with peripheral blood and/or bone marrow involvement, and the FCI of neoplastic and normal NK cells were compared. Retrospective data and specimens (bone marrow aspiration or peripheral blood) from 71 cases of NK cell neoplasms were obtained. All patients have been demonstrated laboratory and clinical features consistent with NK cell neoplasms, and the subtypes were determined by integrated clinical estimation. Routine 4-color flow cytometry (FCM) using a NK/T cell related antibody panels was performed. NK cell neoplasms were divided into two major subtypes by FCI, namely malignant NK cell lymphoma, including extranodal nasal type NK cell lymphoma (ENKL, 11 cases) and aggressive NK cell lymphoma/leukemia (ANKL, 43 cases), and relative indolent chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cell (CLPD-NK, 17 cases). The former exhibited stronger CD56-expressing, larger forward scatter (FSC) and more usually CD7- and CD16-missing. FCI of CLPD-NK was similar to normal NK cells, but CD56-expressing was abnormal, which was negative in five cases and partially or dimly expressed in eight cases. Cytomorphologic abnormal cells were found on bone marrow slides of 4 cases of ENKL and 30 cases of ANKL. Eight cases of ENKL were positive in bone marrow biopsies, and other three cases were negative. In 32 cases of ANKL which bone marrow biopsies were applied, 21 cases were positive in the first biopsies. Lymphocytosis was found only in six cases of CLPD-NK by cytomorphology, and biopsy pathology was not much useful for diagnosing CLPD-NK. These results suggest that FCM analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood was superior to cytomorphology, bone marrow biopsy, and immunohistochemistry in sensitivity and early diagnosis for ANKL, stage III/IV ENKL and CLPD-NK. FCI could not only define abnormal NK cells but also determine the malignant classification. It is beneficial for clinical management and further study of NK cell neoplasms.","['Jiang, Neng-Gang', 'Jin, Yong-Mei', 'Niu, Qian', 'Zeng, Ting-Ting', 'Su, Jun', 'Zhu, Huan-Ling']","['Jiang NG', 'Jin YM', 'Niu Q', 'Zeng TT', 'Su J', 'Zhu HL']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, 610041.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/classification/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Cavity/pathology', 'Nose Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/21 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1574-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Jan;92(1):89-96. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1574-3.

We have shown that the CD4(+) T-cell expression of a novel splice isoform of Pbx1, Pbx1-d, is associated with lupus susceptibility in the NZM2410 mouse and in lupus patients. The function of Pbx1 in T cells is unknown, but the splicing out of the DNA-binding domain in Pbx1-d predicts a dominant-negative function. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that Pbx1-d transduction accelerates differentiation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast pregenitors and mimics the effect of short hairpin RNA silencing of Pbx1. Conversely, Pbx1-d transduction reduced the expression of Sox3, a gene strongly transactivated by Pbx1, and Pbx1-d did not bind the Sox3 promoter. These results constitute a first step towards the understanding on how Pbx1-d contributes to systemic autoimmunity in the NZM2410 mouse model as well as in lupus patients.","['Sengupta, M', 'Liang, S', 'Potula, H-H S', 'Chang, L-J', 'Morel, L']","['Sengupta M', 'Liang S', 'Potula HH', 'Chang LJ', 'Morel L']","['Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Autoimmunity', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/immunology', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/immunology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2012/09/21 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201243 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2012.43 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2012 Dec;13(8):653-7. doi: 10.1038/gene.2012.43.

There is some debate about the diagnostic criteria; but the most widely accepted framework is that defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, which requires the simultaneous occurrence of at least three of abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertrigliceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The prevalence of MS increases with age and varies depending on genetic factors. An abnormally high prevalence has been observed in patients with heterogeneous conditions, such as solid organ transplant recipients, AIDS patients and long-term cancer survivors. As some of the pathogenetic factors possibly involved include cyclosporine A, corticosteroids and cancer chemoradiotherapy, it is possible that MS may also be a complication in hematological patients. Some of the characteristics of MS have been reported with a certain frequency in thalassemia patients, and are mainly attributed to iron overload. Impaired hemostasis is a feature of MS rather than a factor predisposing to its development. In oncohematology, an abnormally high prevalence of MS features has been observed in survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition to corticosteroid- and cancer therapy-related hypogonadism, hypothyroidism and defective growth hormone incretion are other factors related to the development of MS. Moreover, the highest frequency of MS is observed in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Pediatric patients and allogeneic HSCT recipients have been the subject of foremost investigations; but adult patients and autologous HSCT recipients have also been studied more recently. A wide range of factors may contribute to the development of MS in HSCT recipients. Unfortunately, the real entity of the problem is far from clear because of the retrospective design of the studies, the limited size of their populations and their heterogeneous selection criteria, thus making it difficult to determine whether MS is a transient and possibly reversible phenomenon or a true late effect of the procedure.","['Annaloro, Claudio', 'Airaghi, Lorena', 'Saporiti, Giorgia', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi']","['Annaloro C', 'Airaghi L', 'Saporiti G', 'Onida F', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Deliliers GL']","[""Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico - U.O.

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) instillations have been reported to salvage CVCs with antibiotic-refractory infection. We implemented this treatment in 2002. The impact on the survival of CVCs has been evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHODS: Children with newly diagnosed ALL during 1999-2005 having their first CVC inserted before (n = 16) and after (n = 24) the introduction of the procedure were studied. All bacteraemic episodes were reviewed, recording bacteriological findings and treatment, and the time to premature or planned removal of the CVC was determined. RESULTS: In the comparison cohort, 31.0% (9/29) of bacteraemic episodes led to removal of the CVC, compared to 5.5% (2/36) in the intervention cohort (p = 0.01). Thus, the rate of catheter loss due to infection fell from 56.3% (9/16) to 8.3% (2/24) after introducing HCl treatment (p = 0.0025). Overall, the premature catheter removal rate fell from 75.0% (12/16) to 45.8% (11/24) (p = 0.10). Analysed in a CUSUM plot the reduced frequency of premature CVC removal evidently coincided with the introduction of the procedure. In a subgroup analysis of 21 monobacterial infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci, a decrease in systemic and lock antibiotic therapy was found. No adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: HCl instillations significantly reduced the need to remove and replace CVCs. The procedure is practical, appears to be safe, and may reduce the consumption of antibiotics.","['Madsen, Mette', 'Rosthoj, Steen']","['Madsen M', 'Rosthoj S']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aalborg Hospital, Denmark. mette.madsen@rn.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,['QTT17582CB (Hydrochloric Acid)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteremia/prevention & control', 'Catheter-Related Infections/*prevention & control', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Central Venous Catheters/*microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrochloric Acid/*administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/09/21 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00365548.2012.708941 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 2013 Jan;45(1):38-44. doi: 10.3109/00365548.2012.708941.

AREAS COVERED: In this article, we review preclinical and clinical studies with dasatinib for the therapy of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive leukemias. EXPERT OPINION: Dasatinib is very effective in the setting of CML resistance or intolerance to imatinib, particularly in patients in chronic phase (CP). Dasatinib is also effective against most BCR-ABL1 mutations that arise during therapy with imatinib. Further studies have confirmed activity of dasatinib as a single-agent, and combined with chemotherapy, for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+-ALL). More recently, randomized trials have demonstrated that dasatinib is superior to imatinib in the initial therapy of patients with CML, and the drug was approved by the FDA for this indication in 2011.","['Santos, Fabio P S', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Santos FP', 'Cortes J']","['Hematology and Oncology Institute, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']",2012/09/21 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2012.725722 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2012 Nov;13(16):2381-95. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2012.725722.

Infectious manifestations may progress despite adequate anti-infectious treatment and lead to a very high short-term mortality. Granulocyte transfusion (GT) therapy is often considered. However, its efficacy is not well documented. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcome of a cohort of patients with haematological malignancies receiving GT during neutropenia and severe infection. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with a median age of 46 y (range 3-82 y) who had received 1 or more GT were included. Acute leukaemia (80%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17%) predominated as the underlying malignancy. All patients had severe and prolonged (median 16 days) neutropenia. The major indications for GT were persistent fever and clinical deterioration despite broad anti-infectious therapy, in combination with progressive pneumonia (n = 16), neutropenic enterocolitis (n = 6), and soft tissue infections (n = 3). GTs were given for a median of 3 transfusions (range 1-14). The median time to fever defervescence after GT was 14 days (range 6-33 days). For 11 patients, the resolution of fever and all signs of infection could directly be related to GT, and 3 of these patients became long-term survivors. Mortality at 30 days post-GT was 40% and at 6 months post-GT was 72%. GT was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of severely ill neutropenic patients appeared to benefit from GT. The results further underline the need for well- designed, randomized, prospective trials to determine the efficacy of this intervention in patients with life-threatening infectious complications.","['Cherif, Honar', 'Axdorph, Ulla', 'Kalin, Mats', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus']","['Cherif H', 'Axdorph U', 'Kalin M', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Department of Haematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. honar.cherif@akademiska.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/blood/*therapy', 'Bacteria/classification/isolation & purification', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*transplantation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/drug therapy/therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/09/21 06:00,2013/05/31 06:00,['2012/09/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00365548.2012.714906 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 2013 Feb;45(2):112-6. doi: 10.3109/00365548.2012.714906.

Although important aspects of iron metabolism in HO1-deficient (Hmox1-/-) mice have already been revealed, little is known about the regulation of Fpn expression and its role in HO1 deficiency. In the present study, we characterize the cellular and systemic factors influencing Fpn expression in Hmox1-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages and in the liver and kidney of Hmox1-/- mice. In Hmox1-/- macrophages, Fpn protein was relatively highly expressed under high levels of hepcidin in culture medium. Similarly, despite high hepatic hepcidin expression, Fpn is still detected in Kupffer cells and is also markedly enhanced at the basolateral membrane of the renal tubules of Hmox1-/- mice. Through the activity of highly expressed Fpn, epithelial cells of the renal tubules probably take over the function of impaired system of tissue macrophages in recycling iron accumulated in the kidney. Moreover, although we have found increased expression of FLVCR (feline leukaemia virus subgroup C receptor), a haem exporter, in the kidneys of Hmox1-/- mice, haem level was increased in these organs.

As people are continuously exposed to EMFs in everyday life, it is a matter of great debate whether they can be harmful to human health. On the basis of two decades of epidemiological studies, an increased risk for childhood leukemia associated with Extremely Low Frequency fields has been consistently assessed, inducing the International Agency for Research on Cancer to insert them in the 2B section of carcinogens in 2001. EMFs interaction with biological systems may cause oxidative stress under certain circumstances. Since free radicals are essential for brain physiological processes and pathological degeneration, research focusing on the possible influence of the EMFs-driven oxidative stress is still in progress, especially in the light of recent studies suggesting that EMFs may contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. This review synthesizes the emerging evidences about this topic, highlighting the wide data uncertainty that still characterizes the EMFs effect on oxidative stress modulation, as both pro-oxidant and neuroprotective effects have been documented. Care should be taken to avoid methodological limitations and to determine the patho-physiological relevance of any alteration found in EMFs-exposed biological system.","['Consales, Claudia', 'Merla, Caterina', 'Marino, Carmela', 'Benassi, Barbara']","['Consales C', 'Merla C', 'Marino C', 'Benassi B']","['Unit of Radiation Biology and Human Health, ENEA-Casaccia, Rome 00123, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cell Biol,International journal of cell biology,101517861,,,,2012/09/20 06:00,2012/09/20 06:01,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/683897 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Biol. 2012;2012:683897. doi: 10.1155/2012/683897.

Although the associations were not confirmed in subsequent studies by other investigators, patients continue to question the consensus of the scientific community in rejecting the validity of the association. Here we report blinded analysis of peripheral blood from a rigorously characterized, geographically diverse population of 147 patients with CFS/ME and 146 healthy subjects by the investigators describing the original association. This analysis reveals no evidence of either XMRV or pMLV infection. IMPORTANCE Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis has an estimated prevalence of 42/10,000 in the United States, with annual direct medical costs of $7 billion. Here, the original investigators who found XMRV and pMLV (polytropic murine leukemia virus) in blood of subjects with this disorder report that this association is not confirmed in a blinded analysis of samples from rigorously characterized subjects. The increasing frequency with which molecular methods are used for pathogen discovery poses new challenges to public health and support of science. It is imperative that strategies be developed to rapidly and coherently address discoveries so that they can be carried forward for translation to clinical medicine or abandoned to focus resource investment more productively. Our study provides a paradigm for pathogen dediscovery that may be helpful to others working in this field.","['Alter, Harvey J', 'Mikovits, Judy A', 'Switzer, William M', 'Ruscetti, Francis W', 'Lo, Shyh-Ching', 'Klimas, Nancy', 'Komaroff, Anthony L', 'Montoya, Jose G', 'Bateman, Lucinda', 'Levine, Susan', 'Peterson, Daniel', 'Levin, Bruce', 'Hanson, Maureen R', 'Genfi, Afia', 'Bhat, Meera', 'Zheng, HaoQiang', 'Wang, Richard', 'Li, Bingjie', 'Hung, Guo-Chiuan', 'Lee, Li Ling', 'Sameroff, Stephen', 'Heneine, Walid', 'Coffin, John', 'Hornig, Mady', 'Lipkin, W Ian']","['Alter HJ', 'Mikovits JA', 'Switzer WM', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Lo SC', 'Klimas N', 'Komaroff AL', 'Montoya JG', 'Bateman L', 'Levine S', 'Peterson D', 'Levin B', 'Hanson MR', 'Genfi A', 'Bhat M', 'Zheng H', 'Wang R', 'Li B', 'Hung GC', 'Lee LL', 'Sameroff S', 'Heneine W', 'Coffin J', 'Hornig M', 'Lipkin WI']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Warren G.

As a consequence, the impact of SIO in this context remains under debate. The aim of this study was to test whether the objective pretransplant quantification of liver-iron content (LIC) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could circumvent these limitations and conclusively define the prognostic relevance of SIO. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The correlation between pretransplant LIC and surrogate parameters as well as the impact of SIO on posttransplant outcome was assessed within an observational study of patients (n = 88) with either myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing allo-SCT. RESULTS: Ferritin levels of 1,000 ng/mL or more provided only poor specificity (31.8%) for predicting elevated LIC (>/=125 mumol/g) and even higher thresholds (>/=2,500 ng/mL) lacked an association with nonrelapse mortality (NRM). In contrast, LIC 125 mumol/g or more was a significant risk factor for NRM in uni- and multivariate analysis (HR = 2.98; P = 0.016). Multivariate Cox-regression further showed that LIC 125 mumol/g or more was associated with a decreased overall survival (HR = 2.24, P = 0.038), whereas ferritin or transfusion burden were not. CONCLUSIONS: SIO reflected by LIC is an independent negative prognostic factor for posttransplant outcome in patients with AML and MDS undergoing allo-SCT. Therefore, MRI-based LIC, and not interference-prone serum markers such as ferritin, should be preferred for pretransplant risk stratification and patient selection in future clinical trials.","['Wermke, Martin', 'Schmidt, Anne', 'Middeke, Jan Moritz', 'Sockel, Katja', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Schonefeldt, Claudia', 'Mair, Sabine', 'Plodeck, Verena', 'Laniado, Michael', 'Weiss, Gunter', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Theurl, Igor', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Platzbecker, Uwe']","['Wermke M', 'Schmidt A', 'Middeke JM', 'Sockel K', 'von Bonin M', 'Schonefeldt C', 'Mair S', 'Plodeck V', 'Laniado M', 'Weiss G', 'Schetelig J', 'Ehninger G', 'Theurl I', 'Bornhauser M', 'Platzbecker U']","['Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Carl-Gustav-Carus, Dresden, Germany. martin.wermke@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Heart/physiopathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infections/complications', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Overload/complications/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Liver/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/05/22 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-1683 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1683 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Dec 1;18(23):6460-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1683.

Murine C17.2 neural progenitor cells (NPC) demonstrate a tropism for cell line-derived tumors, but their affinity for patient-derived tumors is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that NPC accumulate in patient-derived tumors at levels detectable by optical imaging. Mice bearing solid tumors after transplantation with patient-derived leukemia cells and untransplanted controls received 10(6) fluorescent DiR-labeled NPC daily for 1-4 days, were imaged, then sacrificed. Tissues were analyzed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry to detect tumor cell engraftment (CD45) and NPC (FITC-beta galactosidase or DiR). Tumors consisted primarily of CD45-positive cells and demonstrated mild fluorescence, corresponding to frequent clusters of FITC-beta gal-positive cells. Both transplanted and control mice demonstrated the highest fluorescent signal in the spleens and other tissues of the reticuloendothelial activating system. However, only rare FITC-beta gal-positive cells were detected in the mildly engrafted transplanted spleens and none in the control spleens, suggesting that their high DiR signal reflects the sequestration of DiR-positive debris. The mildly engrafted transplanted kidneys demonstrated low fluorescent signal and rare FITC-beta gal-positive cells whereas control kidneys were negative. Results indicate that NPC accumulate in tissues containing patient-derived tumor cells in a manner that is detectable by ex vivo optical imaging and proportional to the level of tumor engraftment, suggesting a capacity to home to micrometastatic disease. As such, NPC could have significant clinical applications for the targeted diagnosis and treatment of cancer.","['Newton, Isabel G', 'Plaisted, Warren C', 'Messina-Graham, Steven', 'Abrahamsson Schairer, Annelie E', 'Shih, Alice Y', 'Snyder, Evan Y', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'Mattrey, Robert F']","['Newton IG', 'Plaisted WC', 'Messina-Graham S', 'Abrahamsson Schairer AE', 'Shih AY', 'Snyder EY', 'Jamieson CH', 'Mattrey RF']","['University of California, San Diego, CA 92103-8756, USA. inewton@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Contrast Media Mol Imaging,Contrast media & molecular imaging,101286760,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Optical Imaging', 'Tropism']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cmmi.1485 [doi]'],ppublish,Contrast Media Mol Imaging. 2012 Nov-Dec;7(6):525-36. doi: 10.1002/cmmi.1485.,10.1002/cmmi.1485 [doi],,"['P50 CA128346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 EB005970/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'T32EB005970/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC4091721,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,['NIHMS595677'],,,,,,

Culture was terminated after 12 passages or when the cell morphology changed from pluripotency. Pluripotency was analyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and immunostaining with antibodies to Oct3/4, Nanog, SSEA4, and TRA-1-60. SB431542 (SB), an activin inhibitor, was added to the culture, and the morphology of the cells was observed. hiPS cells cultured with A, AC, and ACL after 12 passages were positive for ALP staining. Oct3/4 was positive in hiPS cells cultured with A, AC, and ACL. hiPS cells were positive for Nanog when cultured with A and AC; however, Nanog signal was weaker in cells cultured with ACL. SSEA4 was positive in hiPS cells cultured with A and AC but almost negative in those cultured with ACL. hiPS cells were positive for TRA-1-60 when cultured with A, AC, and ACL. hiPS cells lose their undifferentiated morphology at six passages when cultured with A + SB, five passages with AC + SB, and nine passages with ACL.

Dexamethasone has been used successfully to prevent complications in ATRA-treated APL patients, although its mechanism of action is still not clear. In the present study, we have examined the effect of dexamethasone on the modulation of AnxA1 in ATRA-APL NB4 (ATRA-NB4) cells, ATRA-NB4 cells-derived microparticles (MPs) and its role during cell-cell interaction between ATRA-NB4 cells and endothelial cells. Our results have shown that dexamethasone can inhibit the percentage of ATRA-NB4 cells expressing surface AnxA1 and its receptor FPR2/ALX in a time-dependent manner based on flow cytometric analysis. However, dexamethasone treatment of ATRA-NB4 cells has no significant effect on the level of AnxA1 mRNA, the total cellular level of AnxA1 protein or the release of AnxA1 from these cells, as determined by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that dexamethasone is able to significantly inhibit the adhesion of ATRA-NB4 cells to endothelial cells, and this anti-adhesive effect can be inhibited if the cells were pre-treated with a neutralizing antibody specific for AnxA1. Finally, dexamethasone also enhances the release of AnxA1-containing MPs from ATRA-NB4 cells which can in turn prevent the adhesion of the ATRA-NB4 cells to endothelial cells. We conclude that biologically active AnxA1 originating from dexamethasone-treated ATRA-APL cells and their MPs plays an anti-adhesive effect and this contributes to inhibit the adhesion of ATRA-APL cell to endothelial cells.","['Tsai, Wen-Hui', 'Lai, Shu-Lien', 'Li, I-Ting', 'Chien, Hong-Yu', 'Shih, Chung-Hung', 'Kou, Yu Ru', 'Hsu, Hui-Chi']","['Tsai WH', 'Lai SL', 'Li IT', 'Chien HY', 'Shih CH', 'Kou YR', 'Hsu HC']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Annexin A1/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/07/10 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24394 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2013 Mar;114(3):551-7. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24394.,10.1002/jcb.24394 [doi],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

A supervised interrogation of the gene expression profiles of primary leukemic cells from a cohort of 207 children with high risk B-lineage ALL identified up-regulated CD19 gene expression as a biomarker for t(1;19)(+) ALL. A disulfide-linked immunoconjugate of a 5-amino-modified 24 mer phosphorothioate anti-sense E2A-PBX1 oligonucleotide (AON) with a mAb specific for a CD19 receptor (alphaCD19-AON) was prepared as a CD19-directed and leukemia-specific biotherapeutic agent against E2A-PBX1(+) B-lineage ALL. Treatment of E2A-PBX1(+) leukemia cells with low nanomolar concentrations of alphaCD19-AON resulted in selective depletion of E2A-PBX1 transcripts and caused apoptotic destruction and abrogation of clonogenic growth. Subcutaneously administered alphaCD19-AON at a total dose level of 93 nmol kg(-1) delivered over 14 days using a micro-osmotic pump more than doubled the leukemia-free survival time of SCID mice in a xenograft model of E2A-PBX1(+) human B-lineage ALL (82.0 +/- 1.9 days vs. 37.0 +/- 0.1 days, P < 0.0001). Both the AON moiety and the targeting CD19-specific mAb moiety were required for the in vitro as well as in vivo anti-leukemic activity of alphaCD19-AON. The observed in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemic potency of the alphaCD19-AON immunoconjugate provides the first preclinical proof-of-principle that t(1;19)(+) high risk B-lineage ALL can be treated with leukemia-specific biotherapeutic agents that knock-down E2A-PBX1 expression.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Dibirdik, Ilker', 'Myers, Dorothea E']","['Uckun FM', 'Qazi S', 'Dibirdik I', 'Myers DE']","[""Developmental Therapeutics Program, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2ib20114c [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2013 Jan;5(1):122-32. doi: 10.1039/c2ib20114c.,10.1039/c2ib20114c [doi],,"['R01CA-154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA-164098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA-151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OSU toxicity was enhanced by the HSP90 inhibitor 17-N-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) that correlated with reduced expression of ERBB1 and ERBB2. Inhibition of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway blocked the interaction between 17AAG and OSU. OSU toxicity was enhanced by the inhibitor of ERBB1/2/4, lapatinib. Knock down of ERBB1/2/4 in a cell line specific fashion promoted OSU toxicity. Combined exposure of cells to lapatinib and OSU resulted in reduced AKT and ERK1/2 activity; expression of activated forms of AKT and to a lesser extent MEK1 protected cells from the lethal effects of the drug combination. Knock down of PTEN suppressed, and expression of PTEN enhanced, the lethal interaction between OSU and lapatinib. Downstream of PTEN, inhibition of mTOR recapitulated the effects of lapatinib. Knock down of CD95, NOXA, PUMA, BIK or AIF, suppressed lapatinib and OSU toxicity. Knock down of MCL-1 enhanced, and overexpression of MCL-1 suppressed, drug combination lethality. Lapatinib and OSU interacted in vivo to suppress the growth of established tumors. Collectively our data argue that the inhibition of ERBB receptor function represents a useful way to enhance OSU lethality in brain tumor cells.","['Booth, Laurence', 'Cruickshanks, Nichola', 'Ridder, Thomas', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Grant, Steven', 'Dent, Paul']","['Booth L', 'Cruickshanks N', 'Ridder T', 'Chen CS', 'Grant S', 'Dent P']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipofectamine)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (OSU 03012)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Beclin-1', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Genes, erbB-1', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Lapatinib', 'Lipids', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptor, ErbB-4', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/06/28 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['22275 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.22275 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2012 Dec;13(14):1501-11. doi: 10.4161/cbt.22275.

Forward transitions between ESC and EpiSC can be accomplished by changing culture conditions; however reverse transitions between EpiSC and ESC are rare events that require transgene insertion or culture on feeders. We demonstrate that transgene-free reversion of EpiSCs to ESCs can be enhanced by local microenvironmental control and the subsequent reactivation of dormant LIF-STAT3 signaling. Reactivation of LIF responsiveness occurs in regions of colony constraint (high local cell density) typical of culture on feeders, a condition that can be recapitulated using micropatterned (muP) colonies under defined conditions. This increased LIF responsiveness results in a subsequent increase in the frequency of EpiSC reversion. Importantly, the resulting revertant EpiSCs are functionally indistinguishable from naive mESC. Our findings demonstrate that signaling pathway activation and repression create barriers to cell fate transitions that can be overcome by microenvironmental control.","['Onishi, Kento', 'Tonge, Peter D', 'Nagy, Andras', 'Zandstra, Peter W']","['Onishi K', 'Tonge PD', 'Nagy A', 'Zandstra PW']","['Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,"['0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Germ Layers/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2ib20098h [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2012 Nov;4(11):1367-76. doi: 10.1039/c2ib20098h.,10.1039/c2ib20098h [doi],,['MOP-57885/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been implicated in certain malignancies, including leukemia, cervical cancer and breast cancer. However the role of this molecule in colorectal cancer remains unknown. The current study aimed to investigate the expression of SIPA1 in colorectal tumour tissues and its impact on the function of colorectal cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 94 colorectal cancer tissues together with 80 normal background tissues were used to examine the expression of SIPA1 transcript and protein using real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical methods, respectively. Any association with clinical and histopathological characteristics was then identified. Ribozyme transgenes targeting SIPA1 were prepared to knockdown the expression of SIPA1 in colorectal cancer cells. The impact on their functions was subsequently determined, using respective in vitro function assays. RESULTS: An increased expression of SIPA1 was evident in colorectal cancer tissues compared with its expression in normal background tissues (p<0.001). In colorectal tumours, its expression appeared to be lower in poorly-differentiated samples and in patients who had lymphatic metastasis. Knockdown of SIPA1 in colorectal cancer cells resulted in reduced cell growth in vitro. The knockdown exhibited a contrasting effect on invasion and migration, both of which were increased in SIPA1-knockdown cells compared with the controls. CONCLUSION: SIPA1 is up-regulated in colorectal cancer. This suggests that SIPA1 plays diverse roles during disease progression as has contrasting effects on growth and motility of colorectal cancer cells.","['Ji, Ke', 'Ye, Lin', 'Toms, Anne-Marie', 'Hargest, Rachel', 'Martin, Tracey A', 'Ruge, Fiona', 'Ji, Jiafu', 'Jiang, Wen G']","['Ji K', 'Ye L', 'Toms AM', 'Hargest R', 'Martin TA', 'Ruge F', 'Ji J', 'Jiang WG']","['Metastasis and Angiogenesis Research Group, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, U.K. jiangw@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (SIPA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Caco-2 Cells', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Catalytic/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transgenes', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['9/5/321 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2012 Sep-Oct;9(5):321-7.,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to test if the explanation could be found in the diagnostic criteria a re-evaluation of diagnosis using the 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for ET and MF was performed. METHODS: This prospective study of 60 patients with ET and PV was set up in 1998 to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of anagrelide treatment. Bone marrow trephine biopsies were requested from study start, after 2 and 7 years of follow-up. A blinded re-evaluation of the bone marrow trephines was performed. The 2008 WHO bone marrow criteria were used for diagnosis and fibrosis grading. RESULTS: Of 40 patients with an initial diagnosis of ET, 21 were confirmed as 'true ET' whereas 17 were reclassified as primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (12 PMF-0, 3 PMF-1, 2 PMF-2) and 2 as myeloproliferative neoplasms of uncertain origin. After 7 years of follow-up, 19 of 21 patients with 'true ET' were alive, none had transformed to MF, leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. In contrast, 4/17 patients reclassified as PMF had died, two patients transformed to myelodysplastic syndrome and 7 patients progressed to overt MF. DISCUSSION: We conclude that a blinded re-evaluation of bone marrow trephines from study start and after 7 years of follow-up using 2008 World Health Organization criteria was able to differentiate between true ET and PMF with a marked difference in follow-up outcome.","['Ejerblad, Elisabeth', 'Kvasnicka, Hans M', 'Thiele, Jurgen', 'Andreasson, Bjorn', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Lofvenberg, Eva', 'Markevarn, Berit', 'Merup, Mats', 'Nilssson, Lars', 'Palmblad, Jan', 'Samuelsson, Jan', 'Birgegard, Gunnar']","['Ejerblad E', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Thiele J', 'Andreasson B', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Lofvenberg E', 'Markevarn B', 'Merup M', 'Nilssson L', 'Palmblad J', 'Samuelsson J', 'Birgegard G']","['Department of Hematology, Uppsala University, Sweden. elisabeth.ejerblad@akademiska.se']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quinazolines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'World Health Organization']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['hem63 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000023 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2013 Jan;18(1):8-13. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000023.

These transcription factors combine a conserved DNA-binding homeobox with a divergent N-terminus that mediates interaction with variable cofactors. The resulting combinatorial diversity is thought to be responsible for mammalian HOX specificity. Contrasting this proposed mechanism for normal HOX function, here we demonstrate that, in the context of hematopoietic immortalization and leukemogenesis, individual HOX properties are governed almost exclusively by the homeodomain. Swap experiments between HOXA1 and HOXA9, 2 members of nonrelated paralog groups, revealed that gene expression patterns of HOX transformed cells in vitro are determined by the nature of the homeodomain. Similar results were seen in vivo during HOX-mediated leukemogenesis. An exchange of the homeodomains was sufficient to convert the slow, low-penetrance phenotype of HOXA1-induced leukemia to the aggressive fast-acting disease elicited by HOXA9 and vice versa. Mutation and deletion studies identified several subregions within the DNA binding domain responsible for paralog specificity. Previously defined binding sites for PBX cofactors within the exchangeable, nonhomeobox segment were dispensable for in vitro oncogenic HOX activity but affected in vivo disease development. The transcriptional activator domain shared by HOXA1 and HOXA9 at the very N-terminus proved essential for all transformation.","['Breitinger, Constanze', 'Maethner, Emanuel', 'Garcia-Cuellar, Maria-Paz', 'Slany, Robert K']","['Breitinger C', 'Maethner E', 'Garcia-Cuellar MP', 'Slany RK']","['Department of Genetics, University Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Phenotype', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Sequence Alignment']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53880-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-384685 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 8;120(19):4018-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-384685.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening for CEBPA mutations was assessed using PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) in pretreatment bone marrow samples from 55 newly diagnosed adult AML. RESULTS: CEBPA mutations were found in 11 (20%) of 55 AML patients. They had significantly higher hemoglobin (P = 0.037), and lower LDH (P = 0.003) levels when compared to those without. CEBPA mutations were frequently detected in M4 (45.5%) and M2 (27.2%) subtypes, and significantly associated with normal karyotype (90.9%, P = 0.007). We distinguished six cases with two different mutations or one homozygous mutation (CEBPA(double-mut)) as well as five cases with only one single heterozygous mutation (CEBPA(single-mut)). Patients with CEBPA mutations had significantly higher complete remission (P = 0.047), lower mortality (p = 0.047). Double CEBPA mutant cases showed longer disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) when compared to wild type CEBPA (for DFS; median = 27 versus 24 months respectively; P = 0.009 and for OS; median = 28 versus 25 months respectively; p = 0.008). No significant differences were found between CEBPA(single-mut) cases and wild type cases regarding DFS and OS (for DFS; median = 13 versus 24 months respectively; P = 0.615 and for OS; median = 14 versus 25 months respectively; P = 0.703). CONCLUSION: CEBPA mutation status is known to be a prognostic factor for favorable outcome in AML patients. CEBPA(double-mut) is associated with favorable DFS and OS. In contrast, CEBPA(single-mut) AMLs survival studies did not differ significantly with wild-type cases. These results demonstrate significant underlying heterogeneity within CEBPA mutation positive AML with prognostic relevance. Based on these findings, we propose that CEBPA(double-mut) should be clearly defined from CEBPA(single-mut) AML and considered as a separate entity in the classification of AML.

They have shown that the BCR/ABL oncoprotein induced the production of TGF-beta in the CML hemangioblasts, and that TGF-beta activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-NF-kappaB pathway in these cells. Activation of this pathway enhanced the production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 leading to increased synthesis of soluble Kit ligand and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. TGF-beta is known to maintain the CML-initiating cells through the Akt-FoxO pathway.

The assay evaluated the MdmX-p53 interaction by detecting the quenching of the fluorescence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the MdmX protein, after its interaction with a p53 peptide labeled with a fluorescence quencher. In this report, the developed HTS assay was applied to about 40 000 compounds, and 255 hit compounds that abrogated the GFP quenching were selected. Next, the obtained hits were reevaluated by other assays. First, their effects on the diffusion time of a fluorescently-labeled p53 peptide after incubation with the MdmX protein were tested by measuring the diffusion time using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and six stable hit compounds with IC(50) values less than 5 microM were selected. Next, we further confirmed their inhibition of the MdmX-p53 interaction by surface plasmon resonance. To indicate the efficacy of the hit compound as a candidate anticancer drug, we showed that the hit compound triggered apoptosis after p53 and p21 accumulation in cultured MV4;11 leukemia cells. Thus, the new HTS assay is effective for obtaining novel MdmX-p53 interaction inhibitors that are valuable as candidate compounds for cancer treatment.","['Tsuganezawa, Keiko', 'Nakagawa, Yukari', 'Kato, Miki', 'Taruya, Shigenao', 'Takahashi, Fumio', 'Endoh, Morio', 'Utata, Rei', 'Mori, Masumi', 'Ogawa, Naoko', 'Honma, Teruki', 'Yokoyama, Shigeyuki', 'Hashizume, Yoshinobu', 'Aoki, Masaaki', 'Kasai, Takuma', 'Kigawa, Takanori', 'Kojima, Hirotatsu', 'Okabe, Takayoshi', 'Nagano, Tetsuo', 'Tanaka, Akiko']","['Tsuganezawa K', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Kato M', 'Taruya S', 'Takahashi F', 'Endoh M', 'Utata R', 'Mori M', 'Ogawa N', 'Honma T', 'Yokoyama S', 'Hashizume Y', 'Aoki M', 'Kasai T', 'Kigawa T', 'Kojima H', 'Okabe T', 'Nagano T', 'Tanaka A']","['RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,"['0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', '*Small Molecule Libraries', '*Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2012/09/20 06:00,2013/06/25 06:00,['2012/09/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1087057112460729 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057112460729 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2013 Feb;18(2):191-8. doi: 10.1177/1087057112460729.

Structural and biophysical analysis show that this antagonist binds in the WDR5 peptide-binding pocket with a Kd of 450 nM and inhibits the catalytic activity of the MLL core complex in vitro. The degree of inhibition was enhanced at lower protein concentrations consistent with a role for WDR5 in directly stabilizing the MLL multiprotein complex.

Patients showed significantly increased frequencies of Tregs as compared to controls, a significantly higher percentage than that identified by previous studies, possibly indicating a different prognosis of CLL in different parts of the world and, more precisely, a worse prognosis of CLL in the Indian population. A higher frequency of Tregs was also seen in advanced stage of disease with significantly reduced frequencies of Tregs in patients with CLL after chemotherapy. A significant proportion of CD127low/-FoxP3+ Tregs expressed only low levels of CD25. Thus, CD127 appears to be a better marker than CD25 for the identification of CD4+FoxP3+ T cells as potential Tregs. Our results suggest that the specificity and sensitivity of CD4+CD127low/- cells are comparable to those of CD4+FoxP3+, which is the gold standard, and can be used as an alternative.

We then proceed to the unsupervised case and consider the clustering of the tissue samples and also the clustering of the gene profiles.

We show that immunoprecipitation (IP)-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in H929 multiple myeloma (MM) cancer cells led to the discovery of a rare and unexpected BCR-ABL fusion, informing a therapeutic intervention using imatinib (Gleevec). BCR-ABL is the driving mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is uncommon to other cancers. Three different IP-MS experiments central to cell signaling pathways were sufficient to discover a BCR-ABL fusion in H929 cells: phosphotyrosine (pY) peptide IP, p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) IP, and the GRB2 adaptor IP. The pY peptides inform tyrosine kinase activity, p85 IP informs the activating adaptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in AKT activation and GRB2 IP identifies RTKs and adaptors leading to ERK activation. Integration of the bait-prey data from the three separate experiments identified the BCR-ABL protein complex, which was confirmed by biochemistry, cytogenetic methods, and DNA sequencing revealed the e14a2 fusion transcript. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and the GAB2 adaptor protein, important for MAPK signaling, were common to all three IP-MS experiments. The comparative treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs revealed only imatinib, the standard of care in CML, was inhibitory to BCR-ABL leading to down-regulation of pERK and pS6K and inhibiting cell proliferation. These data suggest a model for directed proteomics from patient tumor samples for selecting the appropriate TKI drug(s) based on IP and LC-MS/MS. The data also suggest that MM patients, in addition to CML patients, may benefit from BCR-ABL diagnostic screening.","['Breitkopf, Susanne B', 'Yuan, Min', 'Pihan, German A', 'Asara, John M']","['Breitkopf SB', 'Yuan M', 'Pihan GA', 'Asara JM']","['Division of Signal Transduction, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1212759109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1212759109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Oct 2;109(40):16190-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1212759109.

However, little is known about how T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling influences the development of these two CD4 T-cell subsets. To study TCR signaling for T-CD4 T-cell development, we used a GFP reporter system of Nur77 in which GFP intensity directly correlates with TCR signaling strength. T-CD4 T cells expressed higher levels of GFP than E-CD4 T cells, suggesting that T-CD4 T cells received stronger TCR signaling than E-CD4 T cells during selection. Elimination of Ras GTPase-activating protein enhanced E-CD4 but decreased T-CD4 T-cell selection efficiency, suggesting a shift to negative selection. Conversely, the absence of IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase that causes poor E-CD4 T-cell selection due to insufficient TCR signaling improved T-CD4 T-cell generation, consistent with rescue from negative selection. Strong TCR signaling during T-CD4 T-cell development correlates with the expression of the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein. However, although modulation of the signaling strength affected the efficiency of T-CD4 T-cell development during positive and negative selection, the signaling strength is not as important for the effector function of T-CD4 T cells. These findings indicate that innate T-CD4 T cells, together with invariant natural killer T cells and gammadelta T cells, receive strong TCR signals during their development and that signaling requirements for the development and the effector functions are distinct.","['Qiao, Yu', 'Zhu, Lingqiao', 'Sofi, Hanief', 'Lapinski, Philip E', 'Horai, Reiko', 'Mueller, Kristen', 'Stritesky, Gretta L', 'He, Xi', 'Teh, Hung-Sia', 'Wiest, David L', 'Kappes, Dietmar J', 'King, Philip D', 'Hogquist, Kristin A', 'Schwartzberg, Pamela L', ""Sant'Angelo, Derek B"", 'Chang, Cheong-Hee']","['Qiao Y', 'Zhu L', 'Sofi H', 'Lapinski PE', 'Horai R', 'Mueller K', 'Stritesky GL', 'He X', 'Teh HS', 'Wiest DL', 'Kappes DJ', 'King PD', 'Hogquist KA', 'Schwartzberg PL', ""Sant'Angelo DB"", 'Chang CH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Rasgrp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (emt protein-tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Thymocytes/cytology/immunology']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1207528109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1207528109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Oct 2;109(40):16264-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1207528109.

(3-2-Mercaptoethyl)biphenyl-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (E2072) is a potent (K(i) = 10 nM), selective, and orally available inhibitor of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII). Here, we report that E2072 attenuates hyperalgesia and nerve conduction velocity deficits in preclinical rodent models of neuropathic pain and oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. In the chronic constrictive injury model, orally administered E2072 reversed pre-existing thermal hyperalgesia in rats in a dose-dependent fashion with a minimally effective dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day. It is noteworthy that multiple days of dosing of E2072 were required before analgesia was realized even though GCPII inhibitory exposures were achieved on the first day of dosing. In addition, analgesia was found to persist for up to 7 days after cessation of dosing, consistent with E2072's pharmacokinetic profile and sustained exposure. Furthermore, in a chronic oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy model (6 mg/kg i.p. oxaliplatin twice weekly for 4 weeks), female BALB/c mice receiving daily oral E2072 at 1.0 and 0.1 mg/kg displayed no deficits in either caudal or digital velocity compared with significant deficits observed in mice treated with oxaliplatin alone (12 +/- 3 and 9 +/- 2%, respectively). Similar findings were seen with oxaliplatin-induced digital and caudal amplitude deficits. It is noteworthy that E2072 showed no interference with the antineoplastic efficacy of oxaliplatin in mice bearing leukemia (L1210), even at doses 100 times its neuroprotective/analgesic dose, indicating a selective effect on neuropathy. These data support the therapeutic utility of GCPII inhibitors in neuropathy and neuropathic pain.","['Wozniak, Krystyna M', 'Wu, Ying', 'Vornov, James J', 'Lapidus, Rena', 'Rais, Rana', 'Rojas, Camilo', 'Tsukamoto, Takashi', 'Slusher, Barbara S']","['Wozniak KM', 'Wu Y', 'Vornov JJ', 'Lapidus R', 'Rais R', 'Rojas C', 'Tsukamoto T', 'Slusher BS']","['Brain Science Institute, NeuroTranslational Drug Discovery Program, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (3-(2-mercaptoethyl)biphenyl-2,3-dicarboxylic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', 'EC 3.4.17.21 (Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hyperalgesia/*drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neural Conduction/*drug effects', 'Neuralgia/*drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Neuropathy/*drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Tissue Distribution']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.112.197665 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.112.197665 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2012 Dec;343(3):746-54. doi: 10.1124/jpet.112.197665.

In this paper, we demonstrate that Abl tyrosine kinase, a master switch for cell growth and trafficking of intracellular organelles, controls the acidification of lysosomes in human macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition by imatinib and gene silencing of Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinase reduced the lysosomal pH in human macrophages by increasing the transcription and expression of the proton pumping enzyme vacuolar-type H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase. Because lysosomal acidification is required for antimicrobial activity against intracellular bacteria, we determined the effect of imatinib on the growth of the major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Imatinib limited the multiplication of M. tuberculosis, and growth restriction was dependent on acidification of the mycobacterial compartment. The effects of imatinib were also active in vivo because circulating monocytes from imatinib-treated leukemia patients were more acidic than monocytes from control donors. Importantly, sera from imatinib-treated patients triggered acidification and growth restriction of M. tuberculosis in macrophages. In summary, our results identify the control of phagosomal acidification as a novel function of Abl tyrosine kinase and provide evidence that the regulation occurs on the level of the vacuolar-type H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase. Given the efficacy of imatinib in a mouse model of tuberculosis and our finding that orally administered imatinib increased the ability of human serum to trigger growth reduction of intracellular M. tuberculosis, clinical evaluation of imatinib as a complementary therapy of tuberculosis, in particular multidrug or extremely drug-resistant disease, is warranted.","['Bruns, Heiko', 'Stegelmann, Frank', 'Fabri, Mario', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'van Zandbergen, Ger', 'Wagner, Manfred', 'Skinner, Mhairi', 'Modlin, Robert L', 'Stenger, Steffen']","['Bruns H', 'Stegelmann F', 'Fabri M', 'Dohner K', 'van Zandbergen G', 'Wagner M', 'Skinner M', 'Modlin RL', 'Stenger S']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (ABI1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*immunology/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/growth & development/*immunology', 'Phagosomes/drug effects/*immunology/microbiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/immunology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2012/09/19 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1201538 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1201538 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Oct 15;189(8):4069-78. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1201538.

However, very little is known about the expression and function of Meis, Pbx, and Prep genes during early development. RESULTS: In order to determine whether TALE proteins could contribute to the early cell fate decisions in mammalian development, this study aimed to characterize in a systematic manner the pattern of expression of all Meis, Pbx, and Prep genes from the precompaction to blastocyst stage corresponding to the first step of cell differentiation in mammals. To reveal to what extent TALE genes expression at these early stages is a conserved feature among mammals, this study was performed in parallel in the bovine and mouse models. We demonstrated the transcription and translation of TALE genes, before gastrulation in the two species. At least one member of Meis, Pbx, and Prep subfamilies was found expressed at the RNA and protein levels but different patterns of expression were observed between genes and between species, suggesting specific gene regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest a previously unexpected involvement of these factors during the early development in mammals.","['Sonnet, Wendy', 'Rezsohazy, Rene', 'Donnay, Isabelle']","['Sonnet W', 'Rezsohazy R', 'Donnay I']","['Embryologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire Animale, Institut des Sciences de la Vie, Universite catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Meis3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/03/22 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvdy.23873 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2012 Nov;241(11):1827-39. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.23873.

However, intolerance and resistance to these agents remains a challenge, and TKIs are unable to eradicate rare leukemia-initiating cells. Leukemia treatment would benefit from a better understanding of molecular signals that are necessary for the survival of leukemia-initiating cells but dispensable for normal hematopoietic stem cells. Leukemia-initiating cells in CML can arise from myeloid progenitor cells, a population that we have reported in normal hematopoiesis to depend on the RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1). We now report that Bcr-Abl transformed leukemic cells were ADAR1-dependent in a conditional ADAR1 knockout mouse model. ADAR1 deletion reversed leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and preferentially depleted primitive Lin-Sca+Kit+ (LSK) leukemic cells but not LSK cells lacking the leukemic oncoprotein. ADAR1 deletion ultimately normalized the peripheral white blood count, eliminating leukemic cells as assessed by PCR. These results uncover a novel requirement for ADAR1 in myeloid leukemic cells and indicate that ADAR1 may comprise a new molecular target for CML-directed therapeutics.","['Steinman, Richard A', 'Yang, Qiong', 'Gasparetto, Maura', 'Robinson, Lisa J', 'Liu, Xiaoping', 'Lenzner, Diana E', 'Hou, Jingzhou', 'Smith, Clayton', 'Wang, Qingde']","['Steinman RA', 'Yang Q', 'Gasparetto M', 'Robinson LJ', 'Liu X', 'Lenzner DE', 'Hou J', 'Smith C', 'Wang Q']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. steinman@pitt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Gene Deletion', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27851 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Apr 15;132(8):1741-50. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27851.

We investigated whether new-onset hyperglycemia immediately after HSCT predicts acute GVHD. We studied nondiabetic adult recipients of human leukocyte antigen-matched HSCT (peripheral blood stem cells) for acute leukemia. Using mean morning serum glucose on Days 1-10, we classified hyperglycemia as: mild (6.11-8.33 mmol/L), moderate (8.34-9.98), and severe (minimum of 9.99). Subjects who were GVHD-free on Day 10 were followed during Days 11-100 for grades II-IV acute GVHD or competing event. Evaluation utilized cumulative incidence-based proportional hazards regression. Subjects (n = 328) were age 18-74, median of 49 years. Per body mass index (BMI)--25.0 % were obese (BMI, 30-48), 33.8 % overweight (25 to <30), 30.8 % normal weight (21 to <25), and 10.4 % lean (18 to <21). Mild, moderate, or severe hyperglycemia occurred during Days 1-10 in 50.0, 21.3, and 16.8 % of subjects, respectively. Cumulative incidence on Day 100 was 44.8 (+/-2.8) % acute GVHD and 7.9 (+/-1.5) % competing event. Among normal-to-overweight subjects (n = 212), severe hyperglycemia developed in 14.2 % (n = 30) and more than doubled the risk of acute GVHD (hazards ratio, 2.71; 95 % CI, 1.58-4.65--adjusted for donor/recipient characteristics, prophylactic regimen, and mucositis). In contrast, among obese subjects (n = 82), severe hyperglycemia developed in 30.5 % (n = 25) but did not significantly affect risk of GVHD. (No lean subjects (n = 34) developed severe hyperglycemia.) Hyperglycemia that was less than severe had an effect indistinguishable from normoglycemia. In nondiabetic patients, severe hyperglycemia immediately after allogeneic HSCT indicates increased likelihood of acute GVHD. This association is absent in obese patients, who may be primed by obesity-induced inflammation to develop severe hyperglycemia even without experiencing the cytokine storm that is essential to GVHD pathogenesis.","['Gebremedhin, Efrem', 'Behrendt, Carolyn E', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Parker, Pablo', 'Salehian, Behrouz']","['Gebremedhin E', 'Behrendt CE', 'Nakamura R', 'Parker P', 'Salehian B']","['Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Inflammation,Inflammation,7600105,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Glucose', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*diagnosis', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10753-012-9533-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Inflammation. 2013 Feb;36(1):177-85. doi: 10.1007/s10753-012-9533-7.,10.1007/s10753-012-9533-7 [doi],,['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC3546172,,,,,,,['NIHMS408621'],,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 1,550 adults with primary AML, treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B first-line trials, who had pretreatment cytogenetics and, for cytogenetically normal patients, mutational status of NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 available. We compared complete remission (CR) rates, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) among patients classified into the four ELN genetic groups (favorable, intermediate-I, intermediate-II, adverse) separately for 818 younger (age < 60 years) and 732 older (age >/= 60 years) patients. RESULTS: The percentages of younger versus older patients in the favorable (41% v 20%; P < .001), intermediate-II (19% v 30%; P < .001), and adverse (22% v 31%; P < .001) genetic groups differed. The favorable group had the best and the adverse group the worst CR rates, DFS, and OS in both age groups. Both intermediate groups had significantly worse outcomes than the favorable but better than the adverse group. Intermediate-I and intermediate-II groups in older patients had similar outcomes, whereas the intermediate-II group in younger patients had better OS but not better CR rates or DFS than the intermediate-I group. The prognostic significance of ELN classification was confirmed by multivariable analyses. For each ELN group, older patients had worse outcomes than younger patients. CONCLUSION: The ELN classification clearly separates the genetic groups by outcome, supporting its use for risk stratification in clinical trials. Because they have different proportions of genetic alterations and outcomes, younger and older patients should be reported separately when using the ELN classification.","['Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Maharry, Kati S', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Block, AnneMarie W', 'Patil, Shivanand R', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Mrozek K', 'Marcucci G', 'Nicolet D', 'Maharry KS', 'Becker H', 'Whitman SP', 'Metzeler KH', 'Schwind S', 'Wu YZ', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Block AW', 'Patil SR', 'Baer MR', 'Kolitz JE', 'Moore JO', 'Carroll AJ', 'Stone RM', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210-1228, USA. krzysztof.mrozek@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.43.4738 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.43.4738 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Dec 20;30(36):4515-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.43.4738.

However, heavy ion radiotherapy and extended space exploration will expose humans to densely ionising high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation for which there is currently no understanding of leukaemia risk. Murine models have implicated chromosomal deletion that includes the hematopoietic transcription factor gene, PU.1 (Sfpi1), and point mutation of the second PU.1 allele as the primary cause of low-LET radiation-induced murine acute myeloid leukaemia (rAML). Using array comparative genomic hybridisation, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and high resolution melt analysis, we have confirmed that biallelic PU.1 mutations are common in low-LET rAML, occurring in 88% of samples. Biallelic PU.1 mutations were also detected in the majority of high-LET rAML samples. Microsatellite instability was identified in 42% of all rAML samples, and 89% of samples carried increased microsatellite mutant frequencies at the single-cell level, indicative of ongoing instability. Instability was also observed cytogenetically as a 2-fold increase in chromatid-type aberrations. These data highlight the similarities in molecular characteristics of high-LET and low-LET rAML and confirm the presence of ongoing chromosomal and microsatellite instability in murine rAML.","['Steffen, Leta S', 'Bacher, Jeffery W', 'Peng, Yuanlin', 'Le, Phuong N', 'Ding, Liang-Hao', 'Genik, Paula C', 'Ray, F Andrew', 'Bedford, Joel S', 'Fallgren, Christina M', 'Bailey, Susan M', 'Ullrich, Robert L', 'Weil, Michael M', 'Story, Michael D']","['Steffen LS', 'Bacher JW', 'Peng Y', 'Le PN', 'Ding LH', 'Genik PC', 'Ray FA', 'Bedford JS', 'Fallgren CM', 'Bailey SM', 'Ullrich RL', 'Weil MM', 'Story MD']","['Genetic Analysis Group, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cesium Radioisotopes', 'Chromatids/radiation effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Iron', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/genetics', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/genetics', 'Linear Energy Transfer', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', '*Microsatellite Instability', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ges055 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/ges055 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2013 Jan;28(1):71-9. doi: 10.1093/mutage/ges055.

The patient suffered from a breakthrough invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus after long-term antifungal therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Several isolates were analyzed. First isolates were susceptible in vitro to all azole agents. However, after prolonged treatment with itraconazole and voriconazole a multiple azole resistant A. fumigatus isolate was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) when the patient was suffering from an invasive infection, and cavitary lesions were observed. RESULTS: Analysis of the resistant mechanisms operating in the last strain led us to report the first isolation in Spain of an azole resistant A. fumigatus strain harboring the L98H mutation in combination with the tandem repeat (TR) alteration in CYP51A gene (TR-L98H). Long-term azole therapy may increase the risk of resistance selecting strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to these compounds. However, since the isolates were genetically different the suggestion that could be made is that the resistance was not induced during the prolonged azole therapy but the patient might simply have acquired this resistant isolate from the environment, selected by the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in all long-term treatments with antifungal agents, especially with azoles, repeated sampling and regular susceptibility testing of strains isolated is necessary as resistant isolates could be selected.","['Mellado, Emilia', 'De La Camara, Rafael', 'Buendia, Buenaventura', 'Rodriguez-Tudela, Juan L', 'Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel']","['Mellado E', 'De La Camara R', 'Buendia B', 'Rodriguez-Tudela JL', 'Cuenca-Estrella M']","['Servicio de Micologia, Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Rev Iberoam Micol,Revista iberoamericana de micologia,9425531,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.- (cytochrome P-450 CYP51A, Aspergillus)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/drug effects/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Caspofungin', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Fungal/*genetics', 'Echinocandins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fungal Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Lipopeptides', '*Point Mutation', 'Postoperative Complications/drug therapy/etiology/*microbiology', 'Pulmonary Aspergillosis/drug therapy/etiology/*microbiology', 'Recurrence', 'Spain', 'Species Specificity', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1130-1406(12)00087-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.riam.2012.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Iberoam Micol. 2013 Jan 3;30(1):64-8. doi: 10.1016/j.riam.2012.09.002.

The subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) are the main neurogenic regions in the adult brain. Therein, resides a subpopulation of astrocytes that act as neural stem cells (NSCs). Increasing evidence indicates that pro-inflammatory and other immunological mediators are important regulators of neural precursors into the SVZ and the SGZ. There are a number of inflammatory cytokines that regulate the function of NSCs. Some of the most studied include: interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, insulin-like growth factor-1, growth-regulated oncogene-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor, cardiotrophin-1, ciliary neurotrophic factor, interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha. This plethora of immunological mediators can control the migration, proliferation, quiescence, cell-fate choices and survival of NSCs and their progeny.

In this review, we summarized the current evidence regarding the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the regulation of adult NSCs under in vitro and in vivo conditions.

The prognostication is done according to the IPSS or very recently to the revised IPSS by a combination of cytopenia, morphologic features according to the WHO classification (2008) and cytogenetic results. In addition, also molecular markers have been shown to contribute important information for diagnosis and also for prognosis in patients with MDS. These markers are in some cases found by next generation sequencing including whole exome sequencing of patients with MDS. Prospective analysis will show the best combination of methods to diagnose patients with MDS or to define their respective prognosis.

CNTF is a cytoplasmic factor believed to be released upon cellular damage, while CLC requires interaction with a soluble cytokine receptor, cytokine-like factor 1 (CLF), to be efficiently secreted. Both cytokines activate a receptor complex comprising the cytokine binding CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFRalpha) and two signaling chains namely, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFRbeta) and gp130. Human CNTF can recruit and activate an alternative receptor in which CNTFRalpha is substituted by IL-6Ralpha. As both CNTF and CLC have immune-regulatory activities in mice, we compared their ability to recruit mouse receptors comprising both gp130 and LIFRbeta signaling chains and either IL-6Ralpha or IL-11Ralpha which, unlike CNTFRalpha, are expressed by immune cells. Our results indicate that 1) mouse CNTF, like its human homologue, can activate cells expressing gp130/LIFRbeta with either CNTFRalpha or IL-6Ralpha and, 2) CLC/CLF is more restricted in its specificity in that it activates only the tripartite CNTFR. Several gp130 signaling cytokines influence T helper cell differentiation. We therefore investigated the effect of CNTF on CD4 T cell cytokine production. We observed that CNTF increased the number of IFN-gamma producing CD4 T cells. As IFN-gamma is considered a mediator of the therapeutic effect of IFN-beta in multiple sclerosis, induction of IFN-gamma by CNTF may contribute to the beneficial immunomodulatory effect of CNTF in mouse multiple sclerosis models. Together, our results indicate that CNTF activates the same tripartite receptors in mouse and human cells and further validate rodent models for pre-clinical investigation of CNTF and CNTF derivatives. Furthermore, CNTF and CLC/CLF differ in their receptor specificities. The receptor alpha chain involved in the immunomodulatory effects of CLC/CLF remains to be identified.","['Tormo, Aurelie Jeanne', 'Letellier, Marie-Claude', 'Lissilaa, Rami', 'Batraville, Laurie-Anne', 'Sharma, Mukut', 'Ferlin, Walter', 'Elson, Greg', 'Crabe, Sandrine', 'Gauchat, Jean-Francois']","['Tormo AJ', 'Letellier MC', 'Lissilaa R', 'Batraville LA', 'Sharma M', 'Ferlin W', 'Elson G', 'Crabe S', 'Gauchat JF']","['Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (cardiotrophin-like cytokine)', '0 (cytokine-like factor-1)', '0 (interleukin-6 receptor alpha)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/metabolism']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(12)00652-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2012 Dec;60(3):653-60. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.014.

Tissue-specific miHAs have successfully been used in anti-tumor therapy without causing unspecific graft-versus-host reactions. However, only a small number of miHAs have been identified to date, limiting the clinical use. Here we present an immunoinformatics pipeline for the identification of miHAs. The pipeline can be applied to large-scale miHA screening, for example, in the development of diagnostic tests. Another interesting application is the design of personalized miHA-based cancer therapies based on patient-donor pair-specific miHAs detected by this pipeline.

In the present study, we show that the treatment of leukemia cells with apigenin resulted in the induction of DNA damage preceding the activation of the apoptotic program. Apigenin-induced DNA damage was mediated by p38 and protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta), yet was independent of reactive oxygen species or caspase activity. Treatment of monocytic leukemia cells with apigenin induced the phosphorylation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and histone H2AX, two key regulators of the DNA damage response, without affecting the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad-3-related (ATR) kinase. Silencing and pharmacological inhibition of PKCdelta abrogated ATM and H2AX phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of p38 reduced H2AX phosphorylation independently of ATM. We established that apigenin delayed cell cycle progression at G1/S and increased the number of apoptotic cells. In addition, genome-wide mRNA analyses showed that apigenin-induced DNA damage led to down-regulation of genes involved in cell-cycle control and DNA repair. Taken together, the present results show that the PKCdelta-dependent activation of ATM and H2AX define the signaling networks responsible for the regulation of DNA damage promoting genome-wide mRNA alterations that result in cell cycle arrest, hence contributing to the anti-carcinogenic activities of this flavonoid.","['Arango, Daniel', 'Parihar, Arti', 'Villamena, Frederick A', 'Wang, Liwen', 'Freitas, Michael A', 'Grotewold, Erich', 'Doseff, Andrea I']","['Arango D', 'Parihar A', 'Villamena FA', 'Wang L', 'Freitas MA', 'Grotewold E', 'Doseff AI']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apigenin/*pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00614-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Dec 15;84(12):1571-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.005.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 127 patients with refractory/relapse acute leukemia and investigated the incidence, causes and risk factors of IRM. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of the patients died after the transplantation. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival was (35.2-/+5.3)% and (30.8-/+5.6)% among these patients, respectively. IRM occurred in 28.3% (36/127) of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed that grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host diseases (aGVDH, P=0.049, OR=3.017) and post-transplant invasive fungal infection (P=0.032, OR=3.223) were independent risk factors of IRM. CONCLUSION: As a common cause of transplant-related mortality, IRM is more frequent in cases of refractory/relapse acute leukemia than in cases with a standard risk profile, and effective prophylaxis and treatment of severe GVHD remain currently the primary measures for reducing post-transplant IRM.","['Lin, Ren', 'Sun, Jing', 'Mao, Yujing', 'Zhao, Mengxia', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Zhou, Hongsheng', 'Huang, Fen', 'Song, Xiaoling', 'Li, Han', 'Ma, Qinghui']","['Lin R', 'Sun J', 'Mao Y', 'Zhao M', 'Liu Q', 'Zhou H', 'Huang F', 'Song X', 'Li H', 'Ma Q']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. lansinglinren@21cn.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mycoses/*mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2012/09/19 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2012/09/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2012 Sep;32(9):1377-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
