Epub 2012 Aug 8.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by the accumulation of B cells that are resistant to apoptosis. This resistance is induced by pro-survival stimuli from the microenvironment. TCL1 and ATM are central to the pathogenesis of the disease and associated with more aggressive disease. Their protein products have recently been shown to physically interact in leukemic cells and to impact on NF-kappaB signaling, which is a key regulator of apoptosis. In the present study we show that TCL1 and ATM are significantly co-expressed and up-regulated in malignant cells compared to non-malignant B cells, and that expression of TCL1 is partially deregulated by aberrant DNA-methylation. In addition, complex external stimuli induce essentially similar TCL1 and ATM time-course kinetics. In line with a coordinative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling by TCL1, its knockdown induced apoptosis in primary leukemia cells. These findings suggest that both genes functionally cooperate to modulate similar apoptosis-related cellular pathways.","['Cooperation Unit Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis, University Ulm, DKFZ Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a proportion of patients achieve major molecular response - hence the need to find biological predictors of outcome to select the optimal therapeutic strategy now that more potent inhibitors are available. We investigated a panel of 20 polymorphisms in seven genes, potentially associated with the pharmacogenetics of imatinib, in a subset of 189 patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia enrolled in the TOPS trial. The analysis included polymorphisms in the transporters hOCT1, MDR1, ABCG2, OCTN1, and OATP1A2, and in the metabolizing genes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. In the overall population, the OCTN1 C allele (rs1050152), a simple combination of polymorphisms in the hOCT1 gene and another combination in the genes involved in imatinib uptake were significantly associated with major molecular response. The combination of polymorphisms in imatinib uptake was also significantly associated with complete molecular response. Analyses restricted to Caucasians highlighted the significant association of MDR1 CC (rs60023214) genotype with complete molecular response. We demonstrate the usefulness of a pharmacogenetic approach for stratifying patients with chronic myeloid leukemia according to their likelihood of achieving a major or complete molecular response to imatinib. This represents an attractive opportunity for therapy optimization, worth testing in clinical trials.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. s.angelini@unibo.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors versus imatinib as first-line treatment for these patients. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors to imatinib as first-line treatment in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Outcomes assessed were: complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response at 12, 18 and 24 months, all-cause mortality and progression to accelerated phase/blastic crisis at 12, 18 and 24 months, and chronic myelogenous leukemia related mortality and toxicity at last follow up. Relative risks were estimated and pooled using a fixed effect model. Our search yielded four trials including 2,120 patients. At 12 months, treatment with 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors significantly improved both complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response (relative risk 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09-1.23, and 1.68, 95% CI: 1.48-1.91, respectively). While major molecular response was improved at all time points, complete cytogenetic response improved at 18 months but not at 24 months. Importantly, rate of progression to accelerated phase/blastic crisis was significantly lower with the newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors throughout all time points. Second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors improved chronic myelogenous leukemia related mortality without a statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality at 12, 18 and 24 months. We conclude that 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be added safely to the first-line treatment armamentarium of chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Although an advantage is suggested by surrogate parameters, longer follow up is necessary to see if this translates into superior overall survival.","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Israel. shay_gr@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel metrics for non-disease variables are urgently needed to help define the best treatment for each older patient. We investigated the feasibility and prognostic value of geriatric/quality of life assessments aside from established disease-specific variables in 195 patients aged 60 years or over with myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia. These patients were grouped according to treatment intensity and assessed. Assessment consisted of eight instruments evaluating activities of daily living, depression, mental functioning, mobility, comorbidities, Karnofsky Index and quality of life. Patients with a median age of 71 years (range 60-87 years) with myelodysplastic syndromes (n=63) or acute myeloid leukemia (n=132) were treated either with best supportive care (n=47), hypomethylating agents (n=73) or intensive chemotherapy/hematopoietic cell transplantation (n=75). After selection of variables, pathological activities of daily living and quality of life/fatigue remained highly predictive for overall survival in the entire patient group beyond disease-related risk factors adverse cytogenetics and blast count of 20% or over. In 107 patients treated non-intensively activities of daily living of less than 100 (hazard ratio, HR 2.94), Karnofsky Index below 80 (HR 2.34) and quality of life/'fatigue' of 50 or over (HR 1.77) were significant prognosticators. Summation of adverse features revealed a high risk of death (HR 9.36). In-depth evaluation of older patients prior to individual treatment allocation is feasible and provides additional information to standard assessment. Patients aged 60 years or over with newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia and impairments in activities of daily living, Karnofsky Index below 80%, quality of life/'fatigue' of 50 or over, are likely to have poor outcomes.","['University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany. barbara.deschler@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['Haematologica. 2013 Jan;98(1):7-9.

The mean long-term follow-up period was 38 months (range 12-74 months, median 29 months). RESULTS: The first PET-CT showed abnormal 18F-FDG uptake in five patients, while by standard criteria eight patients showed persistent disease. At the end of follow-up (mean 38 months), all four patients with previously negative scan were still PET negative and in complete remission by standard criteria. All five patients with previously positive scan were still PET positive: one patient died for disease progression and four are alive with disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data, although in a small series of CLL patients, suggest that the metabolic findings revealed at first PET-CT after transplant seem to predict the patient outcome and to assess the metabolic disease status earlier than clinical evaluation by standard criteria. PET-CT performed during follow-up may be useful to early detect disease progression.","['Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Policlinico Universitario ""A.

Epub 2012 Aug 9.,"PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of ""occult"" bacteremia/fungemia as well as the diversity of pathogens involved in hematology patients treated with corticosteroids. METHODS: Daily surveillance blood cultures were taken from patients treated with corticosteroids as part of their intensive chemotherapy or during graft-versus-host disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during a 3-year period (2006-2009). We reviewed the frequency of occult bacteremia/fungemia as well as the pathogens involved. RESULTS: During the 3-year period, 3,821 bottles were cultured from 215 patients and 4.9 % of the bottles tested were positive. Surveillance blood cultures revealed bloodstream infection in 24 % of the patients (definite bloodstream infection in 16 %). Seventy-five percent of patients were still afebrile when microorganisms were detected. The main risk group was acute lymphocytic leukemia patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. The pathogens cultured most frequently were coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence of occult bacteremia was detected by surveillance blood cultures. Further studies are needed to evaluate if a strategy based on surveillance blood cultures can reduce mortality related to bloodstream infections.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 8.,"CD200 is a transmembrane molecule with an important immunoregulatory role that is overexpressed on most chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In this study, we characterized a previously unknown soluble form of this molecule in human plasma termed sCD200. Levels of sCD200 were elevated in the plasma of patients with CLL as compared with healthy controls, and there was a significant correlation with CLL disease stage. Infusion of sCD200(hi) CLL plasma into severely immunocompromised NOD.SCIDgamma(c)(null) (NSG) mice enhanced the engraftment of CLL splenocytes as compared with mice receiving sCD200(lo) normal plasma. CLL cells were detected in both the spleen and peritoneal cavity of animals for up to 75 days. Engraftment of CLL cells did not occur after infusion of CLL plasma depleted of sCD200 and was abolished in mice treated with anti-CD200 or OKT3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), suggesting a role for both sCD200 and T cells in CLL engraftment. Notably, anti-CD200 mAb was as effective as rituximab in eliminating engrafted CLL cells when administered 21 days after engraftment. Taken together, our findings point to sCD200 as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for CLL. Furthermore, the humanized mouse model described here may prove valuable to preclinically assess new treatment regimens for CLL.","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,['(c)2012 AACR.'],['#190633/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABT-737 binds with equal affinity to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w in vitro and is expected to overrule apoptosis resistance mediated by these Bcl-2 proteins in equal measure. We have profiled ABT-737 specificity for all six pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins, in p53 wild-type or p53-mutant human T-leukemic cells. Bcl-B was untargeted, like Bfl-1 and Mcl-1, in accord with their low affinity for ABT-737 in vitro. However, Bcl-2 proved a better ABT-737 target than Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. This was reflected in differential apoptosis-sensitivity to ABT-737 alone, or combined with etoposide. ABT-737 was not equally effective in displacing BH3-only proteins or Bax from Bcl-2, as compared with Bcl-xL or Bcl-w, offering an explanation for the differential ABT-737 sensitivity of tumor cells overexpressing these proteins. Inducible expression demonstrated that BH3-only proteins Noxa, but not Bim, Puma or truncated Bid could overrule ABT-737 resistance conferred by Bcl-B, Bfl-1 or Mcl-1. These data identify Bcl-B, Bfl-1 and Mcl-1, but also Bcl-xL and Bcl-w as potential mediators of ABT-737 resistance and indicate that target proteins can be differentially sensitive to BH3-mimetics, depending on the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins they are complexed with.","['Division of Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about subclonal evolutionary processes according to treatment and subsequent relapse in multiple myeloma (MM). This issue was addressed in a cohort of 24 MM patients treated either with conventional chemotherapy or with the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. As MM is a highly heterogeneous disease associated with a large number of chromosomal abnormalities, a subset of secondary genetic events that seem to reflect progression, 1q21 gain, NF-kappaB-activating mutations, RB1 and TP53 deletions, was examined. By using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, subclones were identified with nonlinear complex evolutionary histories. Such reordering of the spectrum of genetic lesions, identified in a third of MM patients during therapy, is likely to reflect the selection of genetically distinct subclones, not initially competitive against the dominant population but which survived chemotherapy, thrived and acquired new anomalies.

Since then, it has been widely associated with different types of cancers and studied in detail in myeloid leukemias. However, despite these studies, its role in the induction, pathogenesis and maintenance of AML, and other blood disorders, is still not well understood. Recent efforts to uncover its plethora of transcriptional targets have provided key insights into understanding its mechanism of action. This review evaluates our current knowledge of the role of Myb in leukemia, with a particular focus on AML, from the vast literature spanning three decades, highlighting key studies that have influenced our understanding. We discuss recent insights into its role in leukemogenesis and how these could be exploited for the therapeutic targeting of Myb, its associated co-regulators or its target genes, in order to improve outcomes in the treatment of a wide range of hematopoietic malignancies.","['University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover in the absence of PRH, dasatinib does not inhibit cell survival as effectively as in PRH expressing cells.

At our laboratory Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in oral cancers and to predict outcome in oral cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. To study the role of Mcl-1 isoforms in radiation response of oral squamous carcinoma cells (OSCC), we investigated in the present study, the association of Mcl-1 isoform expression with radiosensitivity of OSCC, using siRNA strategy. METHODS: The time course expression of Mcl-1 splice variants (Mcl-1L, Mcl-1S & Mcl-1ES) was studied by RT-PCR, western blotting & immunofluorescence, post-irradiation in oral cell lines [immortalized FBM (radiosensitive) and tongue cancer AW8507 & AW13516 (radioresistant)]of relatively differing radiosensitivities. The effect of Mcl-1L knockdown alone or in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) on cell proliferation, apoptosis & clonogenic survival, was investigated in AW8507 & AW13516 cells. Further the expression of Mcl-1L protein was assessed in radioresistant sublines generated by fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR). RESULTS: Three to six fold higher expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L versus pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S was observed at mRNA & protein levels in all cell lines, post-irradiation. Sustained high levels of Mcl-1L, downregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax & Bak and a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in apoptosis was observed in the more radioresistant AW8507, AW13516 versus FBM cells, post-IR. The ratios of anti to pro-apoptotic proteins were high in AW8507 as compared to FBM. Treatment with Mcl-1L siRNA alone or in combination with IR significantly (P < 0.01) increased apoptosis viz. 17.3% (IR), 25.3% (siRNA) and 46.3% (IR plus siRNA) and upregulated pro-apoptotic Bax levels in AW8507 cells. Combination of siRNA & IR treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced cell proliferation and clonogenic survival of radioresistant AW8507 & AW13516 cells, suggesting a synergistic effect of the Mcl-1L siRNA with IR on radiosensitivity. Interestingly, during the development of radioresistant sublines using FIR, high expression of Mcl-1L was observed. CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that Mcl-1L isoform has an important role in the survival and radioresistance of OSCC and may be a promising therapeutic target in oral cancers.","['Teni Lab, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, 410210, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe a single-center experience of monitoring BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutations and discuss the impact of treatment on mutation selection. METHODS: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients treated with TKIs at the Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno during 2003-2011 were included in this study. A total number of 100 patients who did not achieve an optimal therapy response or who lost their therapy response were screened for the presence of BCR-ABL1 KD mutations, using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Our data show that pretreatment with non-specific non-TKI drugs prior to TKI therapy does not preferentially select for initial BCR-ABL1 KD mutations, in contrast to first-line imatinib therapy, which shows a clear predominance of T315I or P-loop mutations compared with mutations located in other KD regions. In addition, the median time to detection of P-loop mutations was substantially shorter in patients treated with first-line imatinib than in those pretreated with non-TKI drugs. Furthermore, analysis of CML patients who had recurrent resistance to TKI therapy revealed possible therapy-driven selection of BCR-ABL1 KD mutations. Finally, we confirm the previously described poor prognosis of CML patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL1 KD, since 40.0% of our CML patients who harbored a BCR-ABL1 KD mutation died from CML while receiving TKI treatment. Moreover, among the patients who are still on treatment, 27.8% have already progressed. Our data also confirm the unique position of the T315I mutation with respect to its strong resistance to currently approved TKIs. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the 'real-life' data described in this study, it is possible that the therapy itself results in its failure and selects the most resistant mutations under the selective pressure of the applied therapy regimen in some CML patients who harbor BCR-ABL1 KD mutations.","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This intensive treatment has a high early transplant-related mortality, and an additional significant cause of death in these patients is later AML relapse. Retransplantation can be considered for a minority of patients, but only 10-20% of selected patients then achieve long-term survival. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has an antileukemic effect, but the effect of this treatment usually lasts for only 3-4 months. A possible strategy to improve the prognosis could be to combine antileukemic T-cell therapy (i.e. DLI) with AML-targeting therapy. Several aspects have to be considered for such approaches: (i) the therapy should have immunomodulatory rather than immunosuppressive effects; (ii) the regimen should have a low hematological toxicity to preserve residual normal bone marrow function; and (iii) the treatment should have a documented antileukemic effect. DLI elicit both graft versus host and graft versus leukemia effects, and could be added to pharmacological treatment. Epigenetic targeting should be considered in these patients because both demethylating agents as well as the histone deacetylase inhibitors have documented antileukemic effects and have a relatively low hematological toxicity. Other drugs to consider are thalidomide, lenalidomide, antiangiogenic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, which all have both antileukemic and immunomodulatory effects. Relatively few clinical studies are available for patients with this high-risk disease. The designs of future clinical trials have to carefully consider the antileukemic and immunomodulatory effects together with the risk of especially hematological toxicity.","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 8.,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases. Approximately 30% of patients with MDS will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Immune dysregulation may contribute to MDS initiation and progression. The altered expression and clonal expansion of the Vbeta repertoire were observed in patients with MDS. To further examine the characteristic features of gammadelta(+)T cells in MDS, we investigated the distribution pattern and clonal expansion capacity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vgamma and Vdelta repertoire in patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and compared the difference between groups of patients with RAEB and RAEB-AML. Thirty-one patients with newly diagnosed MDS-RAEB were enrolled, and 9 of the 31 patients with RAEB developed AML (RAEB-AML). The TCR Vgamma subfamily expression frequencies were similar in the RAEB and RAEB-AML patient groups. The number of the TCR Vdelta subfamilies expressed in the RAEB group was higher than that in the RAEB-AML group. In most cases, a significantly higher Vdelta4 subfamily expression frequency (63.64%, 14/22) could be detected in the RAEB group, whereas only 11.11% (1/9) was found in the RAEB-AML group (p=0.0079). At least one clonally expanded TCR Vdelta subfamily member was detected in all cases in both groups. Vdelta3 was the most frequent clonally expanded T cell subfamily member found in the RAEB and RAEB-AML group, while the most frequent clonally expanded T cell subfamily member in the RAEB-AML group was Vdelta8 (87.5%, 7/8), which was significantly higher than that in the RAEB group (42.86%, 9/21; p=0.0307). In conclusion, the TCR Vdelta subfamily expression pattern exhibited a marked restriction in patients with RAEB-AML. The lower Vdelta4 frequency and higher clonally expanded Vdelta8 T cell alterations were the characteristic features found in RAEB-AML.

Epub 2012 Aug 7.,"BACKGROUND: Immunotactoid glomerulopathy (ITG) is a rare glomerular disease. Here, we report the largest clinicopathologic series of ITG and define its proteomic profile. METHODS: The characteristics of 16 ITG patients who were identified from our pathology archives are provided between 1993 and 2011. We also performed laser microdissection and mass spectrometry (LMD/MS) in three cases. RESULTS: Presentation included proteinuria (100%), nephrotic syndrome (69%), renal insufficiency (50%) and microhematuria (80%). Hypocomplementemia was present in 46% and a serum M-spike in 63%. Hematologic malignancy was present in 38%, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 19%, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in 13% and myeloma in 13%. The pattern of glomerular injury was membranoproliferative (56%), membranous (31%) or proliferative (13%) glomerulonephritis. The microtubular deposits were immunoglobulin light chain restricted in 69% and had a mean diameter of 31 nm (range 17-52). During an average of 48 months of follow-up for 12 patients, 50% had remission, 33% had persistent renal dysfunction and 17% progressed to end-stage renal disease. Proteomic analysis by LMD/MS revealed the presence of immunoglobulins, monotypic light chains, complement factors of the classical and terminal pathway and small amount of serum amyloid P-component. CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic malignancy, particularly lymphoma, is not uncommon in ITG. ITG appears to have a better prognosis than other paraprotein-related renal lesions, with a half of patients expected to recover kidney function with immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy. The proteomic profile of ITG is consistent with deposition of monotypic immunoglobulins and activation of the classical and terminal pathway of complement.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. nasr.samih@mayo.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 301 parents were selected based on positive or negative family history of cancer at baseline, case-control status, and gender of the respondent (mother or father). Baseline responses were compared with responses at the second interview using the same questionnaire. Reliability was measured using proportion of overall agreement, Cohen's kappa, and Cronbach's alpha; a logistic regression model was also used to assess the role of the case-control status on overall agreement as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The overall agreement between interviews was high and similar for cases (85 %) and controls (86 %); there were no consistent effects of respondent gender, age at first interview, or time elapsed between interviews on agreement measures. Agreement measures did not materially vary according to whether respondents were reporting about their mothers, fathers, or siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed very good reliability of reporting family history among young parents of children affected with leukemia and parents of healthy control children.","['Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, 1110 Avenue des Pins, Ouest, Montreal, QC H3A 1A, Canada. claire.infante-rivard@mcgill.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 8.,"Formaldehyde (FA), a major industrial chemical and ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a human leukemogen. The major mode of action of FA is thought to be the formation of DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs). Repair of DPCs may be mediated by the Fanconi anemia pathway; however, data supporting the involvement of this pathway are limited, particularly in human hematopoietic cells. Therefore, we assessed the role of FANCD2, a critical component of the Fanconi anemia pathway, in FA-induced toxicity in human lymphoblast cell models of FANCD2 deficiency (PD20 cells) and FANCD2 sufficiency (PD20-D2 cells). After treatment of the cells with 0-150 muM FA for 24 h, DPCs were increased in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines, with greater increases in FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells. FA also induced cytotoxicity, micronuclei, chromosome aberrations, and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines, with greater increases in cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PD20 cells. Increased levels of gamma-ATR and gamma-H2AX in both cell lines suggested the recognition of FA-induced DNA damage; however, the induction of BRCA2 was compromised in FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells, potentially reducing the capacity to repair DPCs. Together, these findings suggest that FANCD2 protein and the Fanconi anemia pathway are essential to protect human lymphoblastoid cells against FA toxicity. Future studies are needed to delineate the role of this pathway in mitigating FA-induced toxicity, particularly in hematopoietic stem cells, the target cells in leukemia.","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7356, USA.']",,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS399462'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 7.,"BACKGROUND: Optimal adherence to imatinib therapy is of paramount importance to maximise treatment effectiveness in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The main objective of this study was to investigate patient-reported personal factors associated with adherence behaviour. METHODS: Analysis was conducted on 413 CML patients receiving long-term therapy with imatinib. Adherence behaviour was measured with the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and personal factors investigated included: quality of life, perceived social support, fatigue, symptom burden, psychological wellbeing and desire for additional information. Key socio-demographic and treatment-related factors were also taken into account. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate factors associated with optimal adherence to therapy. RESULTS: In all, 53% of patients reported an optimal adherence behaviour. The final multivariate model retained the following variables as independent predictors of optimal adherence to therapy: desire for more information (ref. no), odds ratio (OR)=0.43 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29-0.66; P<0.001), social support (higher score representing greater support), OR=1.29 (95% CI, 1.11-1.49; P<0.001) and concomitant drug burden (ref. no), OR=1.82 (95% CI, 1.18-2.80; P=0.006). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a higher level of social support, satisfaction with information received and concomitant drug burden are the main factors associated with greater adherence to long-term imatinib therapy.","['Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases, Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Via Benevento, 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. f.efficace@gimema.it']",['Br J Cancer. 2012 Sep 4;107(6):901-3.

Although, well described in signal transduction, its role in cancer has recently been emerging especially in leukemia, breast and ovarian cancer, and melanoma. GAB2 is essential for two major signal transduction pathways in cancer, the PI3-K-AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways, and thus regulates a number of key cellular processes. This review focuses on structure and function of GAB2, its regulatory proteins, emerging role in cancer, and potential as a therapeutic target.","['Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York 10032, USA.']",,,['R01 CA138678/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS399548'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experience with this approach in patients with acute leukemia undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with an alemtuzumab-incorporating conditioning protocol is lacking. We conducted a single-center prospective study to investigate the applicability and efficacy of prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (pDLI) in patients with leukemia undergoing HCT with a low-dose alemtuzumab-containing conditioning regimen. Inclusion criteria were high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or increasing mixed chimerism. All patients included were tapered off of immunotherapy. Exclusion criteria were a history of >/= grade II or active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Of the 56 consecutive patients who underwent HCT with an alemtuzumab-containing regimen, 15 patients (8 with acute myelogenous leukemia and 7 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia) met the study inclusion criteria and received prophylactic DLI (total of 45 infusions) from 7 sibling donors and 8 unrelated donors. The first infusion was given at a median of 162 days posttransplantation. The median number of DLIs was 3, and the median cumulative CD3(+) cell dose was 2 x 10(6)cells/kg. Six of the 8 patients (75%) who received pDLI while in mixed chimerism converted to stable, complete donor chimerism. Some 47% of DLI recipients developed GVHD (4 acute GVHD and 3 with chronic GVHD) after a median cumulative dose of 2 x 10(6) CD3(+) cells/kg. After a median follow-up of 575 days, 11 (73%) pDLI recipients were alive. All 4 deaths were due to GVHD-related causes. None of the patients who received pDLIs relapsed.

In T cell-depleted allo-SCT, mismatching of HLA-DPB1 was not associated with an increased risk of severe GVHD, but a significant decreased risk of disease relapse was still observed. To investigate whether patient HLA-DP-specific CD4(+) T cell responses were frequently induced after T cell-depleted HLA-DPB1-mismatched allo-SCT and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), we developed a method to screen for the presence of HLA-DP-specific CD4(+) T cells using CD137 as an activation marker and analyzed 24 patient-donor combinations. The patients suffered from various B cell malignancies, multiple myeloma, and myeloid leukemias. Patient HLA-DP-specific CD4(+) T cells were detected after DLI in 13 of 18 patients who exhibited a clinical response to DLI, compared with only 1 of 6 patients without a clinical response to DLI. Eight patients developed significant GVHD. These data show that patient HLA-DP-specific CD4(+) T cells frequently occur after HLA-DPB1-mismatched T cell-depleted allo-SCT and DLI, and are associated with graft-versus-leukemia reactivity both in the presence and absence of GVHD.","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands. c.e.rutten@lumc.nl']",['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jan;19(1):1-2.

In two cases of CBF AML associated with systemic mastocytosis (SM), the persistence of mast cells and the detection of a high ratio of fusion transcript, in bone marrow, during the courses of chemotherapy, led us to determine whether the mast cell component of the disease carried the same molecular alterations as leukaemic blasts. We demonstrate that sorted mast cells carried CBF abnormality. These observations point out the lack of specificity of MRD monitoring by RQ-PCR in these exceptional AML cases with SM. Moreover, this suggests that leukaemic blasts and mast cells derive from a common malignant progenitor.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre de Biologie Pathologie, CHU Lille, Lille, France.""]",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a female patient with isolated central nervous system relapse of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during peripheral remission after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patient showed a progressive cognitive decline as the main symptom. MRI revealed a hydrocephalus and an increase in cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with around 50% immature blasts in the differential count. A highly elevated BCR-ABL/ ABL ratio was detected in the CSF, whilst the ratio for peripheral blood and bone marrow was not altered. On treatment of the malresorptive hydrocephalus with shunt surgery, the patient showed an initial cognitive improvement, followed by a secondary deterioration. At this time, the cranial MRI showed leukemic infiltration of lateral ventricles walls. Hence, intrathecal administration of cytarabine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone was initiated, which caused a significant decrease of cells in the CSF. Soon after, the patient demonstrated significant cognitive improvement with a good participation in daily activities. At a later time point, after the patient had lost the major molecular response of CML, therapy with dasatinib was initiated. In a further follow-up, the patient was neurologically and hematologically stable. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with treated CML, the rare case of an isolated CNS blast crisis has to be taken into account if neurological symptoms evolve. The analysis of BCR-ABL in the CSF is a further option for the reliable detection of primary isolated relapse of CML in these patients.","['Hans Berger Department of Neurology, Jena University Hospital, Erlanger Allee 101, D-07747 Jena, Germany.

From 856 patients with CML studied during 2 years in our laboratory, we selected 32 who showed persistent levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts (>0.1%) in at least two consecutive studies. Using our strategy, we identified mutations in 11/32 cases (34.4%), while only two of them (6.2%) were detectable by sequencing. Furthermore, we were able to estimate the timing and dynamics of mutated clones, evaluating retrospective samples from the same patient. In cases with lack or loss of molecular response this analysis might be useful for designing early therapeutic strategies.","['Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX, CONICET-ANM), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425 Buenos Aires, Argentina. clnafer@yahoo.com.ar']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the chemical composition and cytotoxicity of essential oil from leaves of S. terebinthifolius as well as the identification of active compounds from this oil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Essential oil from S. terebinthifolius leaves, obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus, was characterized in terms of its chemical composition. Also, the crude oil was subjected to chromatographic separation procedures to afford an active fraction composed of alpha- and beta-pinenes. These compounds, including hydrogenation (pinane) and epoxydation (alpha-pinene oxide) derivatives from alpha-pinene, were tested in vitro against murine melanoma cell line (B16F10-Nex2) and human melanoma (A2058), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), leukemia (human leukemia (HL-60) and cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell lines. RESULTS: Forty-nine constituents were identified in the oil (97.9% of the total), with germacrene D (23.7%), bicyclogermacrene (15.0%), beta-pinene (9.1%) and beta-longipinene (8.1%) as the main compounds. The crude essential oil showed cytotoxic effects in several cell lines, mainly on leukemia and human cervical carcinoma. Fractions composed mainly of alpha- and beta-pinenes as well as those composed of individually pinenes showed effective activities against all tested cell lines. Aiming to determinate preliminary structure/activity relationships, alpha-pinene was subjected to epoxydation and hydrogenation procedures whose obtained alpha-pinene oxide showed an expressive depression in its cytotoxicity effect, similar as observed to pinane derivative. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The obtained results indicated that the monoterpenes alpha- and beta-pinenes could be responsible to the cytotoxic activity detected in the crude oil from leaves of S. terebinthifolius. In addition, it was possibly inferred that the presence of double bond in their structures, mainly at endocyclic position, is crucial to cytotoxic potential detected in these derivatives.","['instituto de Ciencias Ambientais, Quimicas e Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Campus Diadema, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some enlargements could be associated with other conditions such as puberty, pregnancy or diabetes or be a symptom of a systemic disease (leukemia, Wegener's granulomatosis or sarcoidosis). In rare cases the cause for the enlargement is genetic and termed hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF). HGF is a genetic disorder characterized by a progressive enlargement of the gingiva. Histologically, the gingiva is characterized by an accumulation of dense fibrous connective tissue. This is believed to be due to an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix composed mainly of collagen molecules or due to an alteration in fibroblast proliferation. Different pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed and examined over the years but no precise process has been identified. The main objective of this paper is to discuss this genetic anomaly and support it with clinical cases of a mother and her two children. It will focus on the clinical and histologic characteristics of HGF as well as known biologic and genetic features and treatment modalities.","['Department of Periodontics, College of Dentistry, University of Tennesssee Health Science Center, Memphios, Tennessee, USA. rlivada@uthsc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"Separase, an endopeptidase required for the separation of sister-chromatides in mitotic anaphase, triggers centriole disengagement during centrosome duplication. In cancer, separase is frequently overexpressed, pointing to a functional role as an aneuploidy promoter associated with centrosomal amplification and genomic instability. Recently, we have shown that centrosomal amplification and subsequent chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), increasing from chronic phase (CP) toward blast crisis (BC). Moreover, a functional linkage of p210BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity with centrosomal amplification and clonal evolution has been established in long-term cell culture experiments. Unexpectedly, therapeutic doses of imatinib (IM) did not counteract; instead induced similar centrosomal alterations in vitro. We investigated the influence of IM and p210BCR-ABL on Separase as a potential driver of centrosomal amplification in CML. Short-term cell cultures of p210BCR-ABL-negative (NHDF, UROtsa, HL-60, U937), positive (K562, LAMA-84) and inducible (U937p210BCR-ABL/c6 (Tet-ON)) human cell lines were treated with therapeutic doses of IM and analyzed by qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis and quantitative Separase activity assays. Decreased Separase protein levels were observed in all cells treated with IM in a dose dependent manner. Accordingly, in all p210BCR-ABL-negative cell lines, decreased proteolytic activity of Separase was found. In contrast, p210BCR-ABL-positive cells showed increased Separase proteolytic activity. This activation of Separase was consistent with changes in the expression levels of Separase regulators (Separase phosphorylation at serine residue 1126, Securin, CyclinB1 and PP2A). Our data suggest that regulation of Separase in IM-treated BCR-ABL-positive cells occurs on both the protein expression and the proteolytic activity levels. Activation of Separase proteolytic activity exclusively in p210BCR-ABL-positive cells during IM treatment may act as a driving force for centrosomal amplification, contributing to genomic instability, clonal evolution and resistance in CML.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mannheim Medical Center, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Nov 23.,"To define the correlation between BCR promoter DNA methylation and response to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we investigated BCR promoter DNA methylation in three groups of subjects. The first group included chronic phase patients enrolled in an imatinib dose escalation trial. In the trial, patients who failed to achieve optimal response with 400 mg/day (suboptimal responders) received an escalated imatinib dose. The level of BCR promoter DNA methylation was quantitated at baseline six months after dose escalation. The second group included patients who achieved complete cytogenetic remission after receiving 400 mg/day of imatinib (optimal responders), and the third group were the healthy controls. In the suboptimal responders, an increased BCR promoter DNA methylation at six months compared with the baseline was related to a rapid reduction in the BCR-ABL/ABL transcript level following dose escalation (p=0.001) and a longer time to treatment failure (TTFx) of the dose-escalated imatinib (p=0.008). When multivariate analysis was performed with regard to the baseline BCR-ABL transcript level, baseline BCR promoter DNA methylation, and a change in the BCR promoter DNA methylation following dose escalation, the increase in the BCR promoter DNA methylation following dose escalation was an independent predictive factor for TTFx of dose-escalated imatinib (hazard ratio, 0.294; p=0.015). The baseline BCR promoter DNA methylation level in the suboptimal responders was lower than that in BCR promoter DNA methylation in the optimal responders (p=0.001) and healthy controls (p<0.001). In both the optimal and suboptimal responders, BCR promoter DNA methylation had an inverse correlation with the duration of the 400 mg/day imatinib use. In conclusion, increased BCR promoter DNA methylation strongly correlates with a more favorable imatinib response in CML patients.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with improved chemotherapy regimens, many of these traditional prognostic factors have lost clinical significance. We aimed to improve relapse prediction in children with ALL through evaluation of the early chemosensitivity of normal and malignant cells and to determine the relationship between such chemosensitivity and risk of relapse. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 60 children with newly diagnosed ALL of whom 40 patients were in complete remission for at least 4 years and 20 patients relapsed during or following treatment. Time to peripheral blood blast clearance (PBBC) was used as a measure of chemosensitivity of malignant lymphoblasts while end-of-induction complete blood count (CBC) parameters were used as a measure of chemosensitivity of normal hematopoietic cells. Our results showed that longer time to PBBC and lower end-of-induction total leukocyte count (TLC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. In conclusion, time to PBBC and end-of-induction TLC and ANC are important predictors of relapse and should be used to modify the intensity of chemotherapy at earlier time points during the course of treatment. A wider prospective, randomized, controlled trial is required to confirm our results.","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 6.,"The chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, couple to Galphai to induce leukocyte recruitment and activation at sites of inflammation. Upon activation by CXCL8, these receptors become phosphorylated, desensitized, and internalized. In this study, we investigated the role of different G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in CXCR1- and CXCR2-mediated cellular functions. To that end, short hairpin RNA was used to inhibit GRK2, 3, 5, and 6 in RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing CXCR1 or CXCR2, and CXCL8-mediated receptor activation and regulation were assessed. Inhibition of GRK2 and GRK6 increased CXCR1 and CXCR2 resistance to phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization, respectively, and enhanced CXCL8-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and exocytosis in vitro. GRK2 depletion diminished CXCR1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation but had no effect on CXCR2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. GRK6 depletion had no significant effect on CXCR1 function. However, peritoneal neutrophils from mice deficient in GRK6 (GRK6(-/-)) displayed an increase in CXCR2-mediated G protein activation but in vitro exhibited a decrease in chemotaxis, receptor desensitization, and internalization relative to wild-type (GRK6(+/+)) cells. In contrast, neutrophil recruitment in vivo in GRK6(-/-) mice was increased in response to delivery of CXCL1 through the air pouch model. In a wound-closure assay, GRK6(-/-) mice showed enhanced myeloperoxidase activity, suggesting enhanced neutrophil recruitment, and faster wound closure compared with GRK6(+/+) animals. Taken together, the results indicate that CXCR1 and CXCR2 couple to distinct GRK isoforms to mediate and regulate inflammatory responses. CXCR1 predominantly couples to GRK2, whereas CXCR2 interacts with GRK6 to negatively regulate receptor sensitization and trafficking, thus affecting cell signaling and angiogenesis.","['Department of Biology, Julius L.

Epub 2012 Aug 6.,"PURPOSE: T-cell depletion (TCD) reduces the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, concerns about relapse, graft rejection, and variability in technique have limited the widespread application of this approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Outcomes of 44 patients receiving HLA-identical sibling TCD grafts using a uniform technique for CD34(+) selection as the sole form of immune suppression were compared with outcomes of 84 patients receiving T-replete grafts and pharmacologic immune suppression therapy (IST). RESULTS: Groups were similar, except for fewer men (36% with TCD v 56% with IST) and more frequent use of radiation-containing regimens (100% with TCD v 50% with IST) in the CD34-selected TCD cohort. The proportion of patients with neutrophil engraftment at day 28 was similar (96% with IST and 100% with TCD grafts). The 100-day rates of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD were 39% and 23% with IST and TCD grafts, respectively (P = .07). Corresponding 2-year rates of chronic GVHD were lower with TCD grafts than IST (19% v 50%, respectively; P < .001). There were no differences in rates of graft rejection, leukemia relapse, treatment-related mortality, and disease-free and overall survival rates. At 1 year, 54% and 12% of patients were still on immunosuppression in the IST and TCD cohorts, respectively. TCD was associated with a higher GVHD-free survival at 2 years compared with IST (41% v 19%, respectively; P = .006). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TCD via CD34 selection might lower long-term morbidity as a result of chronic GVHD without negatively impacting relapse rates in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Additional prospective studies should be undertaken to definitively address the role of TCD in HCT.","['Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['J Clin Oncol. 2012 Sep 10;30(26):3160-1.

Epub 2012 Aug 6.,"PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that the replication checkpoint, which involves the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3 related (ATR) and Chk1, contributes to cytarabine resistance in cell lines. In the present study, we examined whether this checkpoint is activated in clinical acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) during cytarabine infusion in vivo and then assessed the impact of combining cytarabine with the recently described Chk1 inhibitor SCH 900776 in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: AML marrow aspirates harvested before and during cytarabine infusion were examined by immunoblotting. Human AML lines treated with cytarabine in the absence or presence of SCH 900776 were assayed for checkpoint activation by immunoblotting, nucleotide incorporation into DNA, and flow cytometry. Long-term effects in AML lines, clinical AML isolates, and normal myeloid progenitors were assayed using clonogenic assays. RESULTS: Immunoblotting revealed increased Chk1 phosphorylation, a marker of checkpoint activation, in more than half of Chk1-containing AMLs after 48 hours of cytarabine infusion. In human AML lines, SCH 900776 not only disrupted cytarabine-induced Chk1 activation and S-phase arrest but also markedly increased cytarabine-induced apoptosis. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that SCH 900776 enhanced the antiproliferative effects of cytarabine in AML cell lines and clinical AML samples at concentrations that had negligible impact on normal myeloid progenitors. CONCLUSIONS: These results not only provide evidence for cytarabine-induced S-phase checkpoint activation in AML in the clinical setting, but also show that a selective Chk1 inhibitor can overcome the S-phase checkpoint and enhance the cytotoxicity of cytarabine. Accordingly, further investigation of the cytarabine/SCH 900776 combination in AML appears warranted.","['Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA084321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA70095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA069912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA69912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM072474/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA84321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008685/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA070095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS399617'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 6.,"The generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells is an important tool for regenerative medicine. However, the main restriction is the risk of tumor development. In this study we found that during the early stages of somatic cell reprogramming toward a pluripotent state, specific gene expression patterns are altered. Therefore, we developed a method to generate partial-iPS (PiPS) cells by transferring four reprogramming factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) to human fibroblasts for 4 d. PiPS cells did not form tumors in vivo and clearly displayed the potential to differentiate into endothelial cells (ECs) in response to defined media and culture conditions. To clarify the mechanism of PiPS cell differentiation into ECs, SET translocation (myeloid leukemia-associated) (SET) similar protein (SETSIP) was indentified to be induced during somatic cell reprogramming. Importantly, when PiPS cells were treated with VEGF, SETSIP was translocated to the cell nucleus, directly bound to the VE-cadherin promoter, increasing vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) expression levels and EC differentiation. Functionally, PiPS-ECs improved neovascularization and blood flow recovery in a hindlimb ischemic model. Furthermore, PiPS-ECs displayed good attachment, stabilization, patency, and typical vascular structure when seeded on decellularized vessel scaffolds. These findings indicate that reprogramming of fibroblasts into ECs via SETSIP and VEGF has a potential clinical application.","[""Cardiovascular Division, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre, London, United Kingdom.""]",['Circ Res. 2013 Mar 1;112(5):748-50.

A 21-year-old male diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia received an allogeneic HSCT from human leukocyte antigen- identical sibling donor. Twenty one months after transplantation, he developed progressive dyspnea and was diagnosed BO. Despite standard immunosuppressive therapy, the patient rapidly progressed to respiratory failure and Novalung(R) interventional lung-assist membrane ventilator was applied in the intensive care unit. Three months after the diagnosis of BO, the patient underwent bilateral lung transplantation (LT) and was eventually able to wean from the ventilator and the Novalung(R). Since the LT, the patient has been under a strict rehabilitation program in order to overcome a severe lower extremity weakness and muscle atrophy. Histologic findings of the explanted lungs confirmed the diagnosis of BO. Nine months after the LT, the patient showed no signs of rejection or infectious complications, but still required rehabilitation treatment. This is the first LT performed in a patient with BO after allogeneic HSCT in Korea. LT can be an effective therapy in terms of survival for patients with respiratory failure secondary to development of BO following HSCT.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS: Hematologic malignancies population in a 1,200-bed tertiary care hospital on a 22-bed bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit and a 22-bed leukemia unit. METHODS: An mCLABSI definition was developed, and pathogens and rates were compared against those determined using the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definition. RESULTS: By the NHSN definition the CLABSI rate on the BMT unit was 6.0 per 1,000 central line-days, and by the mCLABSI definition the rate was 2.0 per 1,000 line-days ([Formula: see text]). On the leukemia unit, the NHSN CLABSI rate was 14.4 per 1,000 line-days, and the mCLABSI rate was 8.2 per 1,000 line-days ([Formula: see text]). The top 3 CLABSI pathogens by the NHSN definition were Enterococcus species, Klebsiella species, and Escherichia coli. The top 3 CLABSI pathogens by the mCLABSI definition were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The difference in the incidence of CONS as a cause of CLABSI under the 2 definitions was statistically significant ([Formula: see text]).

Epub 2012 Aug 6.,"The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is central to signaling by cytokine receptors, a superfamily of more than 30 transmembrane proteins that recognize specific cytokines, and is critical in blood formation and immune response. Many of those receptors transmit anti-apoptotic, proliferative and differentiation signals, and their expression and functions are critical for the formation of blood lineages. Several cancers, including blood malignancies, have been associated with constitutive activation of members of the STAT family, which normally require JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation for transcriptional activation. More recently, human myeloproliferative neoplasms were discovered to be associated with a unique acquired somatic mutation in JAK2 (JAK2 V617F), rare exon 12 JAK2 mutations, or thrombopoietin receptor mutations that constitutively activate wild-type JAK2. Prompted by these observations, many studies have explored the possibility that JAKs, cytokine receptors, or other components of the JAK/STAT pathway are mutated or upregulated in several hematological malignancies. This has been observed in certain pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias and adult T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias, and overexpression of JAK2 seems to be important in Hodgkin lymphoma. Here we discuss the nature and respective contribution of mutations dysregulating the JAK/STAT pathway in hematological malignancies and present examples in which such mutations drive the disease, contribute to the phenotype, or provide a survival and proliferative advantage. JAK inhibitors are making their way into the therapeutic arsenal (for example, in myelofibrosis), and we discuss the possibility that other hematological diseases might benefit from treatment with these inhibitors in combination with other agents.","['INSERM, UMR 1009, Hematopoiese Normale et Pathologique, Villejuif, France. verpre@igr.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 6.,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are among the most widely prescribed medications in clinical practice. The beneficial effects of GCs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are based on their ability to induce apoptosis, but the underlying transcriptional mechanisms remain poorly defined. Computational modeling has enormous potential in the understanding of biological processes such as apoptosis and the discovery of novel regulatory mechanisms. We here present an integrated analysis of gene expression kinetic profiles using microarrays from GC sensitive and resistant ALL cell lines and patients, including newly generated and previously published data sets available from the Gene Expression Omnibus. By applying time-series clustering analysis in the sensitive ALL CEM-C7-14 cells, we identified 358 differentially regulated genes that we classified into 15 kinetic profiles. We identified GC response element (GRE) sequences in 33 of the upregulated known or potential GC receptor (GR) targets. Comparative study of sensitive and resistant ALL showed distinct gene expression patterns and indicated unexpected similarities between sensitivity-restored and resistant ALL. We found that activator protein 1 (AP-1), Ets related gene (Erg) and GR pathways were differentially regulated in sensitive and resistant ALL. Erg protein levels were substantially higher in CEM-C1-15-resistant cells, c-Jun was significantly induced in sensitive cells, whereas c-Fos was expressed at low levels in both. c-Jun was recruited on the AP-1 site on the Bim promoter, whereas a transient Erg occupancy on the GR promoter was detected. Inhibition of Erg and activation of GR lead to increased apoptosis in both sensitive and resistant ALL. These novel findings significantly advance our understanding of GC sensitivity and can be used to improve therapy of leukemia.","['Faculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that activated big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1) preferentially associates with PML isoform IV and disrupts PML-MDM2 interaction. Doxorubicin, a common chemotherapeutic agent, is known to promote PML-mediated p53 activation in part by promoting PML-dependent MDM2 nucleolar sequestration. We discovered that BMK1 deactivation coupled with doxorubicin synergistically enhanced MDM2 nucleolar sequestration and, consequently, promoted PML-mediated p53 upregulation leading to tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. Collectively, these results not only suggest that BMK1 activity has a role in suppressing p53 by blocking the interaction between PML and MDM2, but also implicate that pharmacological BMK1 inhibitor should significantly enhance the anticancer capacity of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.","['Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA079871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA079871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS387642'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies revealed that transduction of primitive mouse hematopoietic cells with a NUP98HOXA10homeodomain (NA10HD) fusion gene enables a subsequent rapid and marked expansion in vitro of hematopoietic stem cell numbers without causing their transformation or deregulated expansion in vivo. To determine whether forced expression of NA10HD in primitive human cells would have a similar effect, we compared the number of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) present in cultures of lenti-NA10HD versus control virus-transduced CD34(+) cells originally isolated from human cord blood and chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. We found that NA10HD greatly increases outputs of both normal and Ph(+)/BCR-ABL(+) LTC-ICs, and this effect is particularly pronounced in cultures containing growth factor-producing feeders. Interestingly, NA10HD did not affect the initial cell cycle kinetics of the transduced cells nor their subsequent differentiation. Moreover, immunodeficient mice repopulated with NA10HD-transduced CP-CML cells for more than 8 months showed no evidence of altered behavior. Thus, NA10HD provides a novel tool to enhance both normal and CP-CML stem cell expansion in vitro, without apparently altering other properties.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the challenging properties of class discovery from cancer data sets is that cancer gene expression profiles not only include a large number of genes, but also contains a lot of noisy genes. In order to reduce the effect of noisy genes in cancer gene expression profiles, we propose two new consensus clustering frameworks, named as triple spectral clustering-based consensus clustering (SC3) and double spectral clustering-based consensus clustering (SC2Ncut) in this paper, for cancer discovery from gene expression profiles. SC3 integrates the spectral clustering (SC) algorithm multiple times into the ensemble framework to process gene expression profiles. Specifically, spectral clustering is applied to perform clustering on the gene dimension and the cancer sample dimension, and also used as the consensus function to partition the consensus matrix constructed from multiple clustering solutions.Compared with SC3, SC2Ncut adopts the normalized cut algorithm, instead of spectral clustering, as the consensus function.Experiments on both synthetic data sets and real cancer gene expression profiles illustrate that the proposed approaches not only achieve good performance on gene expression profiles, but also outperforms most of the existing approaches in the process of class discovery from these profiles.","['School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, B3 Building, Higher Education Megacenter, Panyu, Guangzhou City, China 510006. zhwyu@scut.edu.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLAA, -B, and -DRB1 allele distributions in 156 ALL patients (aged 3-54 years) were analyzed and compared with unrelated healthy hematopoietic stem cell donors from the same ethnic and geographic background. RESULTS: No significance was found at HLA-A, -B loci between the ALL group and the control group. However, a significant difference was discovered at HLA-DRB1*14 (8.65% in the ALL group versus 4.8% in the control group, pC < 0.05), with an odds ratio of 1.87 (95% confidence interval 1.26- 2.80). CONCLUSION: HLA-DRB1*14 may be associated with susceptibility to ALL acquisition among the Jiangsu Han population.","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Changzhou No. 2 People's Hospital Affiliated with Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, P.R.

Epub 2012 Aug 4.,"The recently released draft horse genome is incompletely characterised in terms of its repetitive element profile. This paper presents characterisation of the endogenous retrovirus (ERVs) of the horse genome based on a data-mining strategy using murine leukaemia virus proteins as queries. 978 ERV gene sequences were identified. Sequences were identified from the gamma, epsilon and betaretrovirus genera. At least one full length gammaretroviral locus was identified, though the gammaretroviral sequences are very degenerate. Using these data the RNA expression of these ERVs were derived from RNA transcriptome data from a variety of equine tissues. Unlike the well studied human and murine ERVs there do not appear to be particular phylogenetic groups of equine ERVs that are more transcriptionally active. Using this novel approach provided a more technically feasible method to characterise ERV expression than previous studies.","['School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, United Kingdom.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with cosmid probes derived from the 14q32 region, we characterized the rearranged 14q32 allele. Molecular cloning of the breakpoint revealed that the reciprocal translocation fused the 5' proximal region of the B-cell lymphoma 11B (BCL11B) gene segment (on 14q32) to the third intron of the HELIOS gene (on 2q34). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the leukemia cells revealed that a substantial level of the HELIOS-BCL11B fusion mRNA was expressed relative to the level of wild-type (WT)-BCL11B derived from the intact allele. In contrast, an aberrant HELIOS isoform was detected at a low level of expression compared to the expression of normal HELIOS isoforms. Functional analysis of the HELIOS-BCL11B fusion protein revealed reduced transcriptional suppression activity compared to that of the WT-BCL11B due to the loss of the N-terminal friend of GATA-repression motif, which functions as a metastasis-associated protein 2 binding site. We also found abnormal subnuclear localization of the ectopically expressed fusion protein compared to the localization of WT-BCL11B to subnuclear speckles in HEK293T cells. Our results suggest that dysfunction of the BCL11B gene plays an important role in the development of ATLL.","['Faculty of Science and Engineering, Graduate School, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In 1964, the transmission of lymphoma in cats and the presence of virus-like particles that resembled 'the virus of murine leukaemias' in the induced tumours were reported in Nature. These seminal studies initiated research on feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and launched the field of feline retrovirology.

Epub 2012 Jun 12.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bendamustine compared with chlorambucil as first-line treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who would be considered unsuitable for treatment with fludarabine combination chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: A semi-Markov approach was used to estimate time in each health state. The model was parameterized primarily by using data from a phase III randomized, open-label trial comparing bendamustine with chlorambucil. It captured the increased progression-free survival and improved response rates with bendamustine, and the cost and quality of life impacts of postprogression treatments. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. A lifetime (35-year) time horizon was used. Deterministic sensitivity analyses, probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses in older patients and patients with poor performance status were carried out. RESULTS: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound 11,960 per quality-adjusted life-year. None of the deterministic sensitivity analyses increased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio by more than pound 2000. Subgroup analyses showed that bendamustine remained cost-effective across different patient groups. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at the pound 20,000 threshold, bendamustine has a 90% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Bendamustine represents good value for first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are unsuitable for treatment with fludarabine combination chemotherapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is below the thresholds commonly applied in England and Wales ( pound 20,000- pound 30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year).","['Oxford Outcomes, Oxford, UK.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes', 'Research (ISPOR).

The presence of either a methyl group (1f) or a chlorine atom (1o) at position 2' of the B ring played an important role in affecting antiproliferative activity. The cytotoxic effects of these compounds were accompanied by the concentration- and time-dependent appearance of DNA- and nuclear-fragmentation, increase in the percentage of sub-G(1) cells, and processing of multiple caspases and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage. Pretreatment of cells with the specific mitogen-activated extracellular kinases (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor PD98059, together with 1f and 1o, resulted in an important enhancement of cell death, which might have clinical implications for the use of both compounds in combination with MEK 1/2 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Associated Unit to the Spanish National Research Council (C.S.I.C.), University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Instituto Canario de Investigacion del Cancer, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To investigate the clinical efficacy of cytokine-induced killer cells for the treatment of refractory lymphoma, the present clinical study was conducted. A total of 8 male patients with a mean age of 41 years (range 22-65) who were pathologically diagnosed with malignant lymphoma (Hodgkin's disease, 2 and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 6) were enrolled. CIK cells were expanded by priming with IFN-gamma, monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD3 and IL-1alpha, followed by the addition of IL-2 the following day using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the 8 male patients. The CIK cells were then transfused back to the patients as treatment. On day 13, the CIK cell count reached 7-18x10(19) (mean, 12.7x10(9)), a 44- to 140-fold increase (mean, 98-fold). The average percentage of cells expressing CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD3(+)CD56(+) were also increased from 50.9+/-3.5, 29.9+/-1.7, 41.3+/-3.2, 1.6+/-0.2% to 90.2+/-1.6, 40.6+/-5.5, 52.8+/-4.9 and 33.1+/-4.0%, respectively. Patients showed measurable radiographic tumor reduction, increased T-cell subset levels, and relief of symptoms after treatment. No severe toxicity or side effects were reported. CIK cells developed by this culture method have a high in vitro proliferation rate and tumor-killing capacity. In conclusion, CIK cell treatment of patients with malignant lymphoma achieves effective clinical responses, causing few side effects.","['Department of Hematology, Beijing Military General Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Beijing, P.R.

Hodgkin's lymphoma variant of Richter transformation is relatively rare, and only approximately 100 cases have been reported in the literature. This study examined a case of a 53-year-old woman who developed Hodgkin's lymphoma almost 5 years after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The major points of interest regarding CLL with Hodgkin's transformation were also considered, such as the potential role of MDR-1 gene polymorphisms. The patient was evaluated for two MDR-1 gene polymorphisms, G2677T polymorphism in exon 21 and silent C3435T polymorphism in exon 26, to ascertain whether polymorphisms affect the risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma variant of Richter transformation and whether genomic polymorphisms provide prognostic information on the clinical progression of the disease. According to the data obtained, the analysis of polymorphisms in the MDR1 gene exons 21 and 26 revealed that the T2677T and T3435T alleles are not a predisposing factor to Richter transformation, while the presence of the wild-type genotype may be associated with a more favorable response to therapy.","['Division of Hematology, Policlinico G.

Cancer initiating cells (CICs) have been proposed to be involved in the development of brain tumors including MB. Prominin-1 antigen (CD133) is a candidate surface molecular marker for CICs. In the present study, CD133-positive cells were isolated from human Daoy MB cells and their gene expression was compared with that of control Daoy cells. DNA microarray analysis revealed that there were 398 up-regulated genes (>2-fold increase) and 318 down-regulated genes (<50% decrease) in the CD133-positive cell-enriched fractions. Up-regulated genes included neuregulin-1, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 6, vascular endothelial growth factor, inhibin beta A, promyelocytic leukemia gene, MYC, and hairy enhancer of split-1, which are components of growth signaling pathways. Molecular studies suggest that developmentally regulated signals important for stem cell maintenance are also involved in MB tumorigenesis. Moreover, these molecules can serve as novel targets for MB treatment.","['Department of Neurosurgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu 431-3192.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, patients are not usually referred to hemato-oncologically specialized centres and are treated locally instead. Comprehensive findings beyond prospective controlled trials are therefore lacking. Clinical data of 209 patients who had received a HL diagnosis were collected. A total of 7 patients received radiotherapy (RT) alone (3%), 75 (35%) were treated with a combination of chemotherapy (CT) and RT and 127 patients received CT alone [mainly doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD)]. Complete response (CR) following first-line treatment was achieved in 178 patients (85%) and in 195 (93%) after salvage treatment. Favorable disease (p=0.000359), limited-stage disease (p=0.0003), involvement of lymph nodes above the diaphragm (p=0.05) and absence of mediastinal bulky tumor involvement positively affected the CR rate following first-line treatment. Out of the 195 patients that achieved CR, 31 relapsed. Male gender (p=0.043) and age over 45 years (p=0.047) were significantly associated with an increased incidence of relapse. Age at diagnosis was the key factor affecting long-term outcome.

This class of model, first proposed by Dabrowska and Doksum (1988), which we term ""generalized proportional odds model,"" is well suited for the mixture cure model setting due to a clear separation between long-term and short-term effects. A standard expectation-maximization algorithm can be employed to locate the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators, which are shown to be consistent and semiparametric efficient. However, there are difficulties in the M-step due to the nonparametric component. We overcome these difficulties by proposing two different algorithms. The first is to employ an majorize-minimize (MM) algorithm in the M-step instead of the usual Newton-Raphson method, and the other is based on an alternative form to express the model as a proportional hazards frailty model.

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"PURPOSE: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for impaired bone accrual. This peripheral quantitative computed tomography study assessed changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and structure after completion of ALL treatment. METHODS: Fifty ALL participants, ages 5-22 yr, were enrolled within 2 yr (median 0.8 yr) after completing ALL therapy. Tibia peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans were performed at enrollment and 12 months later. Age-, sex-, and race-specific Z-scores for trabecular BMD (TrabBMD), cortical BMD (CortBMD), and cortical area (CortArea) were generated based on more than 650 reference participants. Multivariable linear regression models examined determinants of changes in Z-scores. RESULTS: At enrollment, mean TrabBMD (-1.03+/-1.34) and CortBMD (-0.84+/-1.05) Z-scores were low (both P<0.001) compared with reference participants. TrabBMD and CortBMD Z-scores increased to -0.58+/-1.41 and -0.51+/-0.91 over 1 yr, respectively (both P<0.001). Changes in cortical outcomes varied according to the interval since completion of therapy. Among those enrolled less than 6 months after therapy, CortArea Z-scores increased and CortBMD Z-scores decreased (both P<0.01). Among those enrolled 6 months or more after therapy, CortArea Z-scores did not change and CortBMD Z-scores increased (P<0.01). Changes in CortArea and CortBMD Z-scores were inversely associated (r=-0.32, P<0.001). Cumulative glucocorticoid exposure, leukemia risk status, and antimetabolite chemotherapy were not associated with outcomes. CONCLUSION: TrabBMD was low after completion of ALL therapy and improved significantly. Early increases in cortical dimensions were associated with declines in CortBMD; however, participants further from ALL therapy demonstrated stable cortical dimensions and increases in CortBMD, potentially reflecting the time necessary to mineralize newly formed bone.","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 3535 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. moab@email.chop.edu""]",,,"['K24DK076808/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1-RR-024134/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 DK076808/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024134/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD000850/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K12HD000850/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 2.,"In survival analysis with competing risks, the transformation model allows different functions between the outcome and explanatory variables. However, the model's prediction accuracy and the interpretation of parameters may be sensitive to the choice of link function. We review the practical implications of different link functions for regression of the absolute risk (or cumulative incidence) of an event. Specifically, we consider models in which the regression coefficients beta have the following interpretation: The probability of dying from cause D during the next t years changes with a factor exp(beta) for a one unit change of the corresponding predictor variable, given fixed values for the other predictor variables. The models have a direct interpretation for the predictive ability of the risk factors. We propose some tools to justify the models in comparison with traditional approaches that combine a series of cause-specific Cox regression models or use the Fine-Gray model. We illustrate the methods with the use of bone marrow transplant data.","['Department of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. tag@biostat.ku.dk']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS713844'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"SCOPE: The aim of the present study was to explore the signaling pathways associated with gallic acid induced matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)/MMP-9 downregulation in human leukemia K562 cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Unlike the insignificant effect on human Bcr/Abl-negative leukemia U937 cells, gallic acid attenuated invasion of human Bcr/Abl-positive leukemia K562 cells with characteristic of decreased protein expression and mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Gallic acid induced beta-TrCP upregulation evoked Bcr/Abl degradation in K562 cells, while overexpression of Bcr/Abl attenuated gallic acid induced MMP-2/MMP-9 downregulation. Overexpression of Bcr/Abl restored the levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-Akt but not JNK phosphorylation in gallic acid treated K562 cells. Gallic acid treatment repressed Akt/ERK-mediated c-Fos phosphorylation and JNK1-mediated ATF-2 phosphorylation. c-Jun inactivation was mediated through gallic acid induced Akt/ERK and JNK inactivation. Knockdown of c-Fos, c-Jun, and ATF-2 by siRNA and luciferase promoter assay reflected that c-Jun/ATF-2 and c-Jun/c-Fos were, respectively, responsible for MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in K562 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitating assay showed that gallic acid reduced the binding of c-Jun/ATF-2 and c-Jun/c-Fos with promoter region of MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that MMP-2 and MMP-9 downregulation in gallic acid treated K562 cells are mediated through suppression of JNK1-mediated c-Jun/ATF-2 and Akt/ERK-mediated c-Jun/c-Fos pathways, respectively.","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",,"['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Unblinded clinical trials in multiple tumor types have shown that the assay will be used frequently by clinicians to determine treatment, and when used, results in higher response rates, longer times to relapse, and longer survivals. Model economic analyses suggest possible cost savings in clinical use based on increased generic drug use and single-agent substitution for combination therapies. Two initial studies with drugs in development are promising. The assay may help reduce costs and speed time to drug approval. Correlative studies with molecular biomarkers are planned.

Epub 2012 Jul 21.,"Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), an etiological factor that causes adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma (ATL), infects over 20 million people worldwide. About 1 million of HTLV-1-infected patients develop ATL, a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without an effective therapy. The pX region of the HTLV-1 viral genome encodes an oncogenic protein, Tax, which plays a central role in transforming CD4+ T lymphocytes by deregulating oncogenic signaling pathways and promoting cell cycle progression. Expression of Tax following viral entry is critical for promoting survival and proliferation of human T cells and is required for initiation of oncogenesis. Tax exhibits diverse functions in host cells, and this oncoprotein primarily targets IkappaB kinase complex in the cytoplasm, resulting in persistent activation of NF-kappaB and upregulation of its responsive gene expressions that are crucial for T cell survival and cell cycle progression. We here review recent advances for the pathological roles of Tax in modulating IkappaB kinase activity. We also discuss our recent observation that Tax connects the IkappaB kinase complex to autophagy pathways. Understanding Tax-mediated pathogenesis will provide insights into development of new therapeutics in controlling HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Hershey, PA 17033, USA. hcheng@hmc.psu.edu']",,,['R01 AI090113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS435212'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacokinetics of imatinib in patients with CML are characterised by large interpatient variability. Concentration monitoring of imatinib and its active metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib (DMI) is considered necessary to enhance the safe and effective use of imatinib. A rapid, simple and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay was developed for the simultaneous determination of imatinib and its metabolite DMI in human plasma. After proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile, imatinib, DMI and the internal standard D8-imatinib were resolved on a Gemini-NX 3 mum C18 column using gradient elution of 0.05 % formic acid and methanol. The three compounds were detected using electrospray ionisation in the positive mode. Standard curves of imatinib and DMI were adequately fitted by quadratic equations (r > 0.999) over the concentration range of 10 to 2,000 ng/mL which encompasses clinical concentrations.

Epub 2012 Aug 4.,"PURPOSE: Barasertib (AZD1152) is a pro-drug that rapidly undergoes phosphatase-mediated cleavage in serum to release barasertib-hQPA, a selective Aurora B kinase inhibitor that has shown preliminary activity in clinical studies of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pharmacokinetic (PK), metabolic and excretion profiles of barasertib and barasertib-hQPA were characterized in this open-label Phase I study. METHODS: Five patients with poor prognosis AML (newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory) received barasertib 1,200 mg as a 7-day continuous infusion every 28 days. On Day 2 of Cycle 1 only, patients also received a 2-hour infusion of [(14)C]-barasertib. Blood, urine and feces samples were collected at various time points during Cycle 1. Safety and preliminary efficacy were also assessed. RESULTS: Barasertib-hQPA was extensively distributed to tissues, with a slow rate of total clearance (CL = 31.4 L/h). Overall, 72-82 % of radioactivity was recovered, with approximately double the amount recovered in feces (mean = 51 %) compared with urine (mean = 27 %). The main metabolism pathways for barasertib were (1) cleavage of the phosphate group to form barasertib-hQPA, followed by oxidation and (2) loss of the fluoroaniline moiety to form barasertib-hQPA desfluoroaniline, followed by oxidation. One of the four patients evaluable for response entered complete remission. No new or unexpected safety findings were observed; the most common adverse events were nausea and stomatitis. CONCLUSIONS: The PK profile of barasertib is similar to previous studies using the same dosing regimen in patients with AML. The majority of barasertib-hQPA clearance occurred via hepatic metabolic routes.","['The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. mike.dennis@christie.nhs.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 5.,"The thioredoxin system facilitates proliferative processes in cells and is upregulated in many cancers. The activities of both thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) are mediated by oxidation/reduction reactions among cysteine residues. A common target in preclinical anticancer research, TrxR is reported here to be significantly inhibited by the anticancer agent laromustine. This agent, which has been in clinical trials for acute myelogenous leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, is understood to be cytotoxic principally via interstrand DNA crosslinking that originates from a 2-chloroethylating species generated upon activation in situ. The spontaneous decomposition of laromustine also yields methyl isocyanate, which readily carbamoylates thiols and primary amines. Purified rat liver TrxR was inhibited by laromustine with a clinically relevant IC(50) value of 4.65 muM. A derivative of laromustine that lacks carbamoylating activity did not appreciably inhibit TrxR while another derivative, lacking only the 2-chloroethylating activity, retained its inhibitory potency. Furthermore, in assays measuring TrxR activity in murine cell lysates, a similar pattern of inhibition among these compounds was observed. These data contrast with previous studies demonstrating that glutathione reductase, another enzyme that relies on cysteine-mediated redox chemistry, was not inhibited by methylcarbamoylating agents when measured in cell lysates. Mass spectrometry of laromustine-treated enzyme revealed significant carbamoylation of TrxR, albeit not on known catalytically active residues. However, there was no evidence of 2-chloroethylation anywhere on the protein. The inhibition of TrxR is likely to contribute to the cytotoxic, anticancer mechanism of action for laromustine.","['Department of Chemistry, Colby College, Waterville, ME 04901, USA. kprice@colby.edu']",,,"['5P20RR016463-12/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR018787/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016463/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '8 P20 GM103423-12/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20-RR018787/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103423/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS398884'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that AKN-028, a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a potent FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor (IC(50)=6 nM), causing dose-dependent inhibition of FLT3 autophosphorylation. Inhibition of KIT autophosphorylation was shown in a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line overexpressing KIT. In a panel of 17 cell lines, AKN-028 showed cytotoxic activity in all five AML cell lines included. AKN-028 triggered apoptosis in MV4-11 by activation of caspase 3. In primary AML samples (n=15), AKN-028 induced a clear dose-dependent cytotoxic response (mean IC(50) 1 muM). However, no correlation between antileukemic activity and FLT3 mutation status, or to the quantitative expression of FLT3, was observed. Combination studies showed synergistic activity when cytarabine or daunorubicin was added simultaneously or 24 h before AKN-028. In mice, AKN-028 demonstrated high oral bioavailability and antileukemic effect in primary AML and MV4-11 cells, with no major toxicity observed in the experiment. In conclusion, AKN-028 is a novel TKI with significant preclinical antileukemic activity in AML. Possible sequence-dependent synergy with standard AML drugs and good oral bioavailability has made it a candidate drug for clinical trials (ongoing).","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that 61 miRNAs were significantly deregulated in CD34+ cells from MPN patients compared with controls (P<0.01). Global miRNA analysis also revealed that polycythemia vera (JAKV617F) and essential thrombocythemia (JAK2 wild type) patients have significantly different miRNA expression profiles from each other. Among the deregulated miRNAs, expression of miR-134, -214 and -433 was not affected by changes in JAK2 activity, suggesting that additional signaling pathways are responsible for the deregulation of these miRNAs in MPN. Despite its upregulation in MPN CD34+ and during normal erythropoiesis, both overexpression and knockdown studies suggest that miR-433 negatively regulates CD34+ proliferation and differentiation ex vivo. Its novel target GBP2 is downregulated during normal erythropoiesis and regulates proliferation and erythroid differentiation in TF-1 cells, indicating that miR-433 negatively regulates hematopoietic cell proliferation and erythropoiesis by directly targeting GBP2.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Robert H.

Morphologic evaluation using a forced-air dried preparation alone is not helpful to distinguish CLL from other indolent B-cell leukemias, including hairy cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. CLL immunophenotypic score should be more strictly applied in Japan than in Western countries. CONCLUSION: Fluorescence in situ hybridization for CCND1/IGH, the presence of leukocytosis and lymphadenopathy at diagnosis, and the morphological evaluation using naturally air dried preparations are important clues to make a correct diagnosis of Japanese CLL.","['Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Japan. yisobe@juntendo.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 2.,"During prometaphase, dense microtubule nucleation sites at centrosomes form robust spindles that align chromosomes promptly. Failure of centrosome maturation leaves chromosomes scattered, as seen routinely in cancer cells, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We previously reported that the Miki (LOC253012) gene is frequently deleted in MDS patients, and that low levels of Miki are associated with abnormal mitosis. Here we demonstrate that Miki localizes to the Golgi apparatus and is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by tankyrase-1 during late G2 and prophase. PARsylated Miki then translocates to mitotic centrosomes and anchors CG-NAP, a large scaffold protein of the gamma-tubulin ring complex. Due to impairment of microtubule aster formation, cells in which tankyrase-1, Miki, or CG-NAP expression is downregulated all show prometaphase disturbances, including scattered and lagging chromosomes. Our data suggest that PARsylation of Miki by tankyrase-1 is a key initial event promoting prometaphase.","['Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Temporarily and spatially specific expression of RARs suggests their pivotal roles in the adult brain. Am80 is considered to be a promising candidate drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of its transcriptional controls of multiple target genes involved in etiology and pathology of AD. In APP23 AD model mice, administration of Am80 decreased the deposition of insoluble amyloid-beta(42). In senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8), Am80 ameliorated the decrease of cortical acetylcholine, as well as reducing anxiety in behavioral tests and improving the sleep deficit. Am80 also effected a significant improvement of memory in the rat scopolamine-induced memory deficit model. Like other retinoids, Am80 also has an immunomodulatory effect and reduces secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by astrocytes and microglia surrounding amyloid-beta plaques. In a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, Am80 reduced inflammatory cytokines and showed significant efficacy. Retinoids also promote differentiation of neural stem cells, and Am80 improved the recovery of spinal cord-injured rats. Am80 may also improve vascular factors involved in onset and/or progression of AD. Am80 has been in clinical use for treatment of APL in Japan since 2005, and has been reported to have fewer side effects than other retinoids. We have recently started a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Am80 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","['Research Foundation ITSUU Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan. hfukasawa@itsuu.or.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"In this study, we focused the effects of crebanine, an alkaloid isolated from the tuber of Stephania venosa, on various human cancer cells. Crebanine treatment was found to significantly inhibit the proliferation of human leukemic cells (HL-60, U937 and K562), human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) and cervix cancer cell lines (KB-3-1 and KB-V1), of which HL-60 cells were the most sensitive to its treatment. In contrast, crebanine caused much less toxicity in human normal fibroblast cells. Our results demonstrated that crebanine mediated cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and this was associated with down-regulation of cyclins A and D. In addition, crebanine induced apoptosis, which was detected by observation of the membrane phospholipid exposure in flow cytometry. Its induction of apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in cleavage of caspase-3, -8, -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and was attributable to the augmentation of Bax/Bcl proteins level. Crebanine also decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, crebanine exerts anti-proliferative effects on human cancer cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1 phases and apoptosis. Our results suggest that crebanine is a promising new candidate as a chemotherapeutic agent for cancer therapy.","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 53000, Thailand.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most children with pharyngitis have benign, self-limited disease with infrequent complications such as peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, or lymphadenitis. Recent studies have touted the benefits of steroids in the treatment of children with pharyngitis for pain control. These studies do not address the potential life-threatening complication of steroids in patients with pharyngitis or lymphadenopathy in the setting of undiagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoma. We report 4 cases of children treated with steroids for pharyngitis or adenitis that subsequently were diagnosed with ALL or lymphoma. If steroids are to be used in children with pharyngitis or adenitis, the following recommendations should be strongly considered: Careful history and physical examination should be obtained. Presence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy outside the cervical region should raise suspicions regarding an underlying malignancy. Normal results of complete blood cell count in the setting of clear cut pharyngitis with exudates and a lack of significant adenopathy essentially rules out the diagnosis of ALL. Because traditional analgesics are available, which do not affect the curability of ALL or lymphoma, the routine use of steroids in pharyngitis in children should be considered only in rare circumstances.","['SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA. sadowitp@upstate.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects were likely to be mediated via inhibition of AKT and NF-kappaB pathways. These findings provide evidence for clinic protocols using panobinostat and borezomib to overcome drug resistance in refractory AML patients.","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2012 Aug 2.,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) represent a biologically distinct subpopulation of myeloid leukemias, with reduced cell cycle activity and increased resistance to therapeutic challenge. To better characterize key properties of LSCs, we employed a strategy based on identification of genes synergistically dysregulated by cooperating oncogenes. We hypothesized that such genes, termed ""cooperation response genes"" (CRGs), would represent regulators of LSC growth and survival. Using both a primary mouse model and human leukemia specimens, we show that CRGs comprise genes previously undescribed in leukemia pathogenesis in which multiple pathways modulate the biology of LSCs. In addition, our findings demonstrate that the CRG expression profile can be used as a drug discovery tool for identification of compounds that selectively target the LSC population. We conclude that CRG-based analyses provide a powerful means to characterize the basic biology of LSCs as well as to identify improved methods for therapeutic targeting.","['James P.

We identified the arginine methyltransferase Carm1 as a Pax7 interacting protein and found that Carm1 specifically methylates multiple arginines in the N terminus of Pax7. Methylated Pax7 directly binds the C-terminal cleavage forms of the trithorax proteins MLL1/2 resulting in the recruitment of the ASH2L:MLL1/2:WDR5:RBBP5 histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex to regulatory enhancers and the proximal promoter of Myf5. Finally, Carm1 is required for the induction of de novo Myf5 transcription following asymmetric satellite stem cell divisions. We defined the C-terminal MLL region as a reader domain for the recognition of arginine methylated proteins such as Pax7. Thus, arginine methylation of Pax7 by Carm1 functions as a molecular switch controlling the epigenetic induction of Myf5 during satellite stem cell asymmetric division and entry into the myogenic program.","['The Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, Canada K1H 8L6.']",['Cell Cycle. 2013 Jan 1;12(1):3-4.

Epub 2011 Dec 31.,"BACKGROUND: Breast milk is considered by the WHO the ideal food for the first months of life. Although health professionals are aware of recommendations, high rates of drop-outs have been identified in Portugal. A false notion of hypogalactia is the major factor for early termination, which is allied to the technical difficulties of the feeding. Health professionals, often lacking training in the area, may have difficulty in reassuring mothers in these situations. In Portugal, at the 3rd month, most mothers stop breastfeeding by indication of their medical assistant. OBJECTIVES: Gather evidence about the advantages of breast-feeding compared to artificial milk, and establish useful strategies in clinical practice to avoid early withdrawal. METHODS: A survey was conducted for articles from the last six years in the major sites of evidence-based medicine and reference sites (Pubmed, Cochrane, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Tripdatabase, WHO). RESULTS: Breast-feeding is clearly associated with benefits to the infant, including significant protective effects for gastrointestinal infections (64%), middle ear (23- 50%), severe respiratory infections (73%) and for acute lymphocytic leukemia (19%) and sudden death syndrome in infants (36%). We also found long-term benefits, such as for obesity (7-24%) and other cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood. The mother also benefits from its protective effect for cancers of the breast and ovary, and diabetes mellitus type 2 as also, proportionate to the duration of breastfeeding. Health professionals have an important role in the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. The notion of its advantages, the communication prior to delivery, accessibility support and training in technical aspects of correct picks are the proven strategies for evidence explored in the article. DISCUSSION: Breast milk contains several unique and exclusive elements, orchestrators of its health benefits. Postnatal period is critical to the development of neuro--hypothalamic circuits involved in appetite control--nutritional programming--in which leptin, present in breast milk, appears to have a decisive role. CONCLUSION: Despite scientific advances, breast milk continues to demonstrate clear advantages for human health in the short and long term. Proper feeding technique is not often achieved by the dyad mother-infant alone, warning for a greater involvement of health professionals. It is urgent to continue to insist on training for the improvement of the indices relating to this area in Portugal.","['Unidade de Saude Familiar Vale do Vouga, ACES Entre Douro e Vouga II - Aveiro Norte, Aveiro, Portugal.']",,,,,,,,,Aleitamento materno: a importancia de intervir.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 is an oncogene in various human tumors, and overexpression correlates with a poor clinical outcome. Sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2, coding for a critical transcription factor determining the fate of stem cells, was recently identified as an oncogene in human cervical carcinoma and other tumors. However, the roles of B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 and sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2 in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma are poorly understood. We initially observed a more pronounced increase in B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 protein expression in primary cervical carcinoma than in normal cervical tissues, and B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 protein expression correlated significantly with sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2 protein expression, as seen by Western blotting (r = 0.75; P < .01). Furthermore, B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 and sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2 both had higher expression in cervical carcinoma than in normal cervical tissue, and the amounts correlated with pathologic grade. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 colocalized in the nucleus with sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2 in both normal cervical tissue and cervical carcinoma. From the cervical carcinoma cell line SiHa, we isolated 2 clones, B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1(+)/sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2(+) (SiHa-3) and B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1(-)/sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2(-) (SiHa-2). The SiHa-3 cells grew better in vitro and formed tumors more readily in vivo than did SiHa-2. Knockout of sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2 inhibited cell growth in vitro with a block at G1/S. In contrast, knockout of B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 did not affect either cell growth in vitro or the cell cycle. Interference with either B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 or sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2 in SiHa-3 significantly inhibited tumorigenesis (P < .05). Coexpression of B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 and sex-determining region of Y chromosome-related high mobility group box-2 may promote cervical carcinogenesis.","[""Department of Reproductive Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University of Medical School, Xi'an, The People's Republic of China.""]",,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We show that transcription factor Scl/Tal1 is essential for both establishing the hematopoietic transcriptional program in hemogenic endothelium and preventing its misspecification to a cardiomyogenic fate. Scl(-/-) embryos activated a cardiac transcriptional program in yolk sac endothelium, leading to the emergence of CD31+Pdgfralpha+ cardiogenic precursors that generated spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes. Ectopic cardiogenesis was also observed in Scl(-/-) hearts, where the disorganized endocardium precociously differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Induction of mosaic deletion of Scl in Scl(fl/fl)Rosa26Cre-ER(T2) embryos revealed a cell-intrinsic, temporal requirement for Scl to prevent cardiomyogenesis from endothelium. Scl(-/-) endothelium also upregulated the expression of Wnt antagonists, which promoted rapid cardiomyocyte differentiation of ectopic cardiogenic cells. These results reveal unexpected plasticity in embryonic endothelium such that loss of a single master regulator can induce ectopic cardiomyogenesis from endothelial cells.","['Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Our study implicates five networks of kinases that regulate the switch to polyploidy. Moreover, we find that dimethylfasudil (diMF, H-1152P) selectively increased polyploidization, mature cell-surface marker expression, and apoptosis of malignant megakaryocytes. An integrated target identification approach employing proteomic and shRNA screening revealed that a major target of diMF is Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We further find that MLN8237 (Alisertib), a selective inhibitor of AURKA, induced polyploidization and expression of mature megakaryocyte markers in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) blasts and displayed potent anti-AMKL activity in vivo. Our findings provide a rationale to support clinical trials of MLN8237 and other inducers of polyploidization and differentiation in AMKL.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), viral infections/reactivations are a frequent complication, sometimes with fatal outcome. Thus, early diagnosis is recommended by screening of whole blood or plasma preparations using highly sensitive molecular techniques that test for the most common viral pathogens, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and adenoviruses (ADVs). Despite this approach, not every reactivation/infection can be adequately detected or excluded, even with highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction. Particularly after toxic treatment, uncommon infections or infections resistant to first-line treatment can occur, even in unusual locations. Herein, we present the case of a child with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia after allogeneic HSCT who suffered from 5 different viral reactivations/infections, including acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 esophagitis, human herpesvirus 6 encephalitis, rotavirus gastroenteritis, respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, and ADV esophagitis, despite routinely performed blood examinations for viral pathogens remaining unrevealing at all times.","['Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena, Jena, Germany.']",,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GABP complex, consisting of DNA binding GABPalpha subunit and transactivation GABPbeta subunit, critically regulates HSC multipotency and self-renewal via controlling an essential gene regulatory module. Two GABPbeta isoforms, GABPbeta1L and GABPbeta2, contribute to assembly of GABPalpha(2)beta(2) tetramer. We demonstrate that GABPbeta1L/beta2 deficiency specifically impairs HSC quiescence and survival, with little impact on cell cycle or apoptosis in differentiated blood cells. The HSC-specific effect is mechanistically ascribed to perturbed integrity of the GABP-controlled gene regulatory module in HSCs. Targeting GABPbeta1L/beta2 also impairs LSC self-renewal in p210(BCR-ABL)-induced chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and exhibits synergistic effects with tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib therapy in inhibiting CML propagation. These findings identify the tetramer-forming GABPbeta isoforms as specific HSC regulators and potential therapeutic targets in treating LSC-based hematological malignancy.","['Department of Microbiology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to determine if genetic background affects the efficiency of generating iPSCs during early reprograming as well as the pluripotent stability of the iPSCs during later stages of reprograming. METHODS: Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from six strains of mice (NON/LtJ; C57BL/6J; DBA/2J; BALB/cJ; 129S1/SvlmJ; CAST/EiJ) that were selected based on genetic diversity and differences in ability to produce embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines. MEFs were reprogramed via doxycycline-inducible lentiviral transduction of murine Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc. Differences in efficiency to generate iPSCs were assessed by comparing the total number of colonies, the percentage of colonies positive for alkaline phosphatase staining and the percentage of cells positive for SSEA1. iPSC colonies were expanded to establish doxycycline-independent cell lines whose pluripotency was then evaluated via ability to form teratomas in NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice. Proliferation of non-transduced parent MEFs from each strain was also examined over ten days under conditions that simulated reprograming. RESULTS: NON/LtJ and CAST/EiJ strains were more efficient than other strains in generating iPSCs for all parameters measured and parent MEFs from these strains were more proliferative than those from other strains. Doxycycline-independent iPSC lines were established using standard conditions for all strains except BALB/cJ, which required a higher concentration (5x) of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). iPSCs from all strains were capable of producing teratomas in NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that genetic background does affect iPSC generation and pluripotent stability. In addition, our results demonstrate that strain differences in efficiency to generate iPSCs during the early stages of reprograming are correlated with those observed in proliferation of parent MEFs. These findings have important implications both for future iPSC applications as well as for future investigation into determining the genes responsible for reprograming efficiency and stability.",,,,"['K08 AR060875/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', '1K08AR060875-01A1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is a life-threatening complication occurring after intensive chemotherapy; however, no data are available on NE development after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of NE after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT (autoSCT). METHODS: A total of 297 adult patients who qualified for autoSCT with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia were analyzed. Patients were conditioned with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan (BEAM); melphalan alone; or busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BuCy2), and transplanted with peripheral blood or bone marrow CD34(+) cells. Diagnosis of NE was established in case of neutropenic fever, abdominal pain or diarrhea, and bowel wall thickening >4 mm on abdominal sonography. RESULTS: Neutropenic infections occurred in 262 patients (88%). NE was diagnosed in 32 patients (12%), a median +3 (1-5) days after SCT. Bloodstream infections were present in 18 patients, with gram-negative bacteria in 11 patients. All patients were treated conservatively with carbapenems and total parenteral nutrition with bowel rest. The course of disease was complicated by ileus or septic shock in 9 patients, and was fatal for 3 (9.6%) patients. In univariate analysis, the initial diagnosis of NHL (P = 0.017) and conditioning with BEAM (P = 0.043) had prognostic value. In multivariate analysis, only initial diagnosis of NHL (P = 0.017) had prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: NE is a rare but severe complication in patients undergoing autoSCT. Gram-negative bacteria remain the main causative pathogen. Abdominal sonography allows early diagnosis and treatment, effective in most of patients without surgery. In our analysis, NE was seen more often in NHL patients treated with a BEAM regimen.","['Department of Hematology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland. lidia.gil@skpp.edu.pl']",,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antiproliferative activity of HEAMQ was determined by MTT assay and its effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis were studied by flow cytometry, and by immunoblots, respectively. In addition, combination chemotherapy of HEAMQ with cisplatin and temozolomide under in vitro and in vivo conditions was tested. HEAMQ showed concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity toward U937 and L1210 cells. It induced G2/M arrest that in U937 cells was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expressions of cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. HEAMQ-induced apoptosis was accompanied with up-regulation of the protein expression of Bax and down-regulation of the protein expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, XIAP, and survivin, resulting in cytochrome c release and activation of caspases. Inhibitors of JNK (SP600125) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) suppressed HEAMQ-induced apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest, attenuated the activation of Bax, and blocked down-regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP and survivin in HEAMQ-treated U937 cells. In addition, combinations of HEAMQ with cisplatin and temozolomide resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell growth, producing long-term survivors of L1210 tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, these results indicate that HEAMQ antineoplastic activity toward leukemia cells is associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The in vivo studies further confirmed the antitumor activity of HEAMQ and highlighted that this agent could be used to further increase therapeutic efficacies of traditional chemotherapeutic agents.","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, 83391 Bratislava, Slovakia. exoncip@savba.sk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 4.,"The efficacy of bendamustine versus chlorambucil in a phase III trial of previously untreated patients with Binet stage B/C chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was re-evaluated after a median observation time of 54 months in May 2010. Overall survival (OS) was analysed for the first time. At follow-up, investigator-assessed complete response (CR) rate (21.0% vs 10.8%), median progression-free survival (21.2 vs 8.8 months; P < 0.0001; hazard ratio 2.83) and time to next treatment (31.7 vs 10.1 months; P < 0.0001) were improved for bendamustine over chlorambucil. OS was not different between groups for all patients or those </=65 years, >65 years, responders and non-responders. However, patients with objective response or a CR experienced a significantly longer OS than non-responders or those without a CR. Significantly more patients on chlorambucil progressed to second/further lines of treatment compared with those on bendamustine (78.3% vs 63.6%; P = 0.004). The benefits of bendamustine over chlorambucil were achieved without reducing quality of life. In conclusion, bendamustine is significantly more effective than chlorambucil in previously untreated CLL patients, with the achievement of a CR or objective response appearing to prolong OS. Bendamustine should be considered as a preferred first-line option over chlorambucil for CLL patients ineligible for fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab.","['Onkologische Gemeinschaftspraxis, Frankfurt, Germany.

Epub 2012 Aug 20.,"We report herein the design, total synthesis, and functional analysis of a novel artificial ion channel molecule, designated as dansylated polytheonamide mimic (3). The channel 3 was designed based on an exceptionally potent cytotoxin, polytheonamide B (1). Our strategy for the development of synthetic ion channels, which could be easily derivatized for various functions, involved two key features. First, the structure of 1 was simplified by replacing many of nonproteinogenic amino acid residues which required multistep synthesis by commercially available amino acids while retaining those residues necessary for folding. It significantly reduced the number of synthetic steps and facilitated a practical chemical construction of 3. Second, the introduction of propargyl glycine at residue 44 enabled facile installation of dansyl group as a reporter of the membrane localization of 3. Application of a newly designed protective group strategy provided efficient construction of the 37 amino acid sequence of residues 12-48 through one automatic solid-phase peptide synthesis. After peptide cleavage from the resin, 3 was synthesized via dansyl group introduction and one fragment-coupling reaction with residues 1-11, followed by the global deprotection. The simplified mimic 3 exhibited potent cytotoxicity toward p388 mouse leukemia cells (IC(50) = 12 nM), effectively induced ion transport across the lipid bilayers of liposomes, and displayed H(+) and Na(+) ion channel activities. Because of its simplified yet functional scaffold structure with a potential for diversification, our rationally designed ion channel molecule should be useful as a novel platform for developing various cytotoxic channel molecules with additional desired functions.","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a B-cell differentiation model and mRNA profiling, we found that recombinant (r)IL-24 stimulated genes of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Bax, Bid, Casp8, COX6C, COX7B) after 36 h, whereas the transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and metabolism was inhibited within 6 h. Unexpectedly, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a hormone known to promote cell growth, was stimulated by IL-24. Activated B-cells express receptor for IGF1, to which they become sensitized and undergo apoptosis, a mechanism similar in this respect to IL-24-induced cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of the IGF1 pathway reversed the effects of IL-24. IL-24-mediated apoptosis was also antagonized by pifithrin-alpha, an inhibitor of p53 transactivation. Altogether, these results disclose sequential molecular signals generated by IL-24 in activated B-cells.","['EA 4369, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.']",,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 Jul;57(7):1748.

During dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines are released, contributing to disease pathogenesis. In this study, the release of HMGB1 from human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and primary peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) cells was examined during dengue virus (DV)-infection. HMGB1 was shown to translocate from cell nuclei to the cytoplasm in both K562- and PBM-infected cells. The translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was shown to be mediated by the host cell p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetylase complex in K562 cells. In addition, DV capsid protein was observed to be the putative viral protein in actuating HMGB1 migration from the nucleus to cytoplasm through the involvement of PCAF acetylase. HMGB1 was released from DV-infected K562 cells into the extracellular milieu in a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.)-independent manner and its release can be inhibited by the addition of 1-5 mM of ethyl pyruvate (EP) in a dose-dependent manner. Application of DV-infected K562 cell culture supernatants to primary endothelial cells induced vascular permeability. In contrast, supernatants from DV-infected K562 cells treated with EP or HMGB1 neutralizing antibody were observed to maintain the structural integrity of the vascular barrier.","['Laboratory of Molecular RNA Virology and Antiviral Strategies, Department of Microbiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 30.,"GLUT1 is the predominant glucose transporter in leukemia cells, and the modulation of glucose transport activity by cytokines, oncogenes or metabolic stresses is essential for their survival and proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms allowing to control GLUT1 trafficking and degradation are still under debate. In this study we investigated whether plasma membrane cholesterol depletion plays a role in glucose transport activity in M07e cells, a human megakaryocytic leukemia line. To this purpose, the effect of cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) on both GLUT1 activity and trafficking was compared to that of the cytokine Stem Cell Factor (SCF). Results show that, like SCF, MBCD led to an increased glucose transport rate and caused a subcellular redistribution of GLUT1, recruiting intracellular transporter molecules to the plasma membrane. Due to the role of caveolae/lipid rafts in GLUT1 stimulation in response to many stimuli, we have also investigated the GLUT1 distribution along the fractions obtained after non ionic detergent treatment and density gradient centrifugation, which was only slightly changed upon MBCD treatment. The data suggest that MBCD exerts its action via a cholesterol-dependent mechanism that ultimately results in augmented GLUT1 translocation. Moreover, cholesterol depletion triggers GLUT1 translocation without the involvement of c-kit signalling pathway, in fact MBCD effect does not involve Akt and PLCgamma phosphorylation. These data, together with the observation that the combined MBCD/SCF cell treatment caused an additive effect on glucose uptake, suggest that the action of SCF and MBCD may proceed through two distinct mechanisms, the former following a signalling pathway, and the latter possibly involving a novel cholesterol dependent mechanism.","['Biochemistry Department G Moruzzi, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated for distribution and functional significance of mutations in 50 CLPD-NKs and 120 T-LGL patients by direct sequencing, allele-specific PCR, and microarray analysis. STAT3 gene mutations are present in both T and NK diseases: approximately one-third of patients with each type of disorder convey these mutations. Mutations were found in exons 21 and 20, encoding the Src homology 2 domain. Patients with mutations are characterized by symptomatic disease (75%), history of multiple treatments, and a specific pattern of STAT3 activation and gene deregulation, including increased expression of genes activated by STAT3. Many of these features are also found in patients with wild-type STAT3, indicating that other mechanisms of STAT3 activation can be operative in these chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. Treatment with STAT3 inhibitors, both in wild-type and mutant cases, resulted in accelerated apoptosis.

To study this, we engineered Molt3, a T cell progenitor T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, using lentiviral IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7Ralpha) to serve as a model system. IL-7 promoted pre-TCR activation in IL-7Ralpha(hi) Molt3 as illustrated by CD25 up-regulation after anti-CD3 stimulation. Anti-CD3 treatment activated Akt and Erk1/2 signaling pathways as proven using specific inhibitors, and IL-7 further enhanced both signaling pathways. The close association of IL-7Ralpha with CD3zeta in the pre-TCR complex was illustrated through live imaging confocal fluorescence microscopy. These results demonstrate a direct and cooperative role of IL-7 in pre-TCR signaling.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in CML treatment, TKI resistance, caused by mutations in Bcr-Abl or aberrant activity of its network partners, remains a clinical problem. Using inducible expression and knockdown systems, we analyzed the role of Gab2 in Bcr-Abl signaling in human CML cells, especially with respect to TKI sensitivity. We show for the first time that Gab2 signaling protects CML cells from various Bcr-Abl inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib and GNF-2), whereas Gab2 knockdown or haploinsufficiency leads to increased TKI sensitivity. We dissected the underlying molecular mechanism using various Gab2 mutants and kinase inhibitors and identified the Shp2/Ras/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axes as the two critical signaling pathways. Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. The identification of Gab2 as a novel modulator of TKI sensitivity in CML suggests that Gab2 could be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target in TKI-resistant disease.","['Centre for Biological Systems Analysis, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",,,['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of beta-catenin features prominently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has previously been associated with poor clinical outcome. Overexpression of gamma-catenin mRNA (a close homologue of beta-catenin) has also been reported in AML and has been linked to the pathogenesis of this disease, however, the relative roles of these catenins in leukemia remains unclear. Here we report that overexpression and aberrant nuclear localization of gamma-catenin is frequent in AML. Significantly, gamma-catenin expression was associated with beta-catenin stabilization and nuclear localization. Consistent with this, we found that ectopic gamma-catenin expression promoted the stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin in leukemia cells. beta-Catenin knockdown demonstrated that both gamma- and beta-catenin contribute to TCF-dependent transcription in leukemia cells. These data indicate that gamma-catenin expression is a significant factor in the stabilization of beta-catenin in AML. We also show that although normal cells exclude nuclear translocation of both gamma- and beta-catenin, this level of regulation is lost in the majority of AML patients and cell lines, which allow nuclear accumulation of these catenins and inappropriate TCF-dependent transcription.","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, Cardiff, UK.']",,,['Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that Bach2 is downregulated in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and here we demonstrate the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl mediates this phenomenon. We have cloned a 3.9 Kb genomic DNA fragment upstream of the transcription initiation site, and delineated the core and proximal BACH2 promoter regions. Transient BCR-ABL expression led to significant reduction in BACH2 promoter activity and this effect was dependent on the kinase function of the oncoprotein. Sequential deletions disclosed several regulatory elements within the promoter region, as well as within BACH2 exonic sequences. Analysis of these elements and transient transfection assays led to the identification of the Pax5 transcription factor as a potent trans-activator of BACH2, whose effect is predominantly mediated through occupation of a binding site on the BACH2 promoter, as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Overall, our data show that Pax5 functions as an intermediate effector in the Bcr-Abl-mediated transcriptional repression of BACH2. The current results, combined with previous reports, establish Pax5 and Bach2 as transcriptional targets of Bcr-Abl, whose downregulation may contribute to lymphoid blast crisis of CML.","['Department of Haematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is a promising strategy, but resistance that arises during the course of treatment caused by secondary mutations within the mutated gene itself poses a significant challenge. In an effort to predict FLT3 resistance mutations that might develop in patients, we used saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected cells in FLT3 TKI. We identified F621L, A627P, F691L and Y842C mutations in FLT3/ITD that confer varying levels of resistance to FLT3 TKI. Western blotting confirmed that some FLT3 TKI were ineffective at inhibiting FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling through MAP kinase, STAT5 and AKT in some mutants. Balb/c mice transplanted with the FLT3/ITD Y842C mutation confirmed resistance to sorafenib in vivo but not to lestaurtinib.

We demonstrated earlier that a mixture of experimentally selected substances (""active mixture"", AM: L-arginine, L-histidine, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, L-ascorbate, D-biotin, pyridoxine, riboflavin, adenine, L(-)malate) possesses a selective toxic effect in vitro on a variety of tumor cell lines, and we have shown that the AM selectively induces apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro. To explore the in vivo significance of our earlier findings we examined the antitumor effect of AM in Colon 26 murine colorectal adenocarcinoma, B16 murine melanoma, MXT murine mammary carcinoma, S180 murine sarcoma, P388 murine lymphoid leukemia, HL-60 human promyeloid leukemia, PC-3 human prostate carcinoma, and HT-29 human colon carcinoma tumor models. Treatment of tumor bearing mice with AM inhibited the growth of the tumors investigated, with an inhibitory effect ranging from 40 to 69%. The AM had a comparable antitumor effect with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin in the Colon-26 tumor model, and combined treatment with AM and 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin resulted in an enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effect. The AM induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and induced G1 arrest in PC-3 cells and increased the number of apoptotic cells in PC-3 xenografts. These findings suggest that the AM might offer an interesting perspective in the treatment of cancer and in combination with other treatments may offer hope for a more effective cancer therapy.","['Immunal Ltd., Cancer Research and Product Development Laboratory, H-7630 Pecs, Finn u. 1/1., Hungary. kulcsar@immunal.hu']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was conducted to investigate the prognostic role of the angiogenesis-related Notch ligand and the receptor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and assess whether their expression correlates with that of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 60 untreated AML patients and 40 healthy controls were obtained. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA expression of delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), Notch1, VEGF, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie2. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels of Dll4 and Notch1. The results demonstrated that Dll4, Notch1, VEGF, VEGFR-2 and Ang-2 expression were significantly higher in untreated AML patients than in the controls. Univariate analysis of factors associated with the overall survival showed a significantly shorter survival in patients with the unfavorable karyotype, higher Dll4 expression, higher Notch1 expression, higher VEGF expression or higher Ang-2 expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that the karyotype and expression levels of Notch1, Dll4, VEGF and Ang-2 were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Additionally, the prognostic value of Dll4 expression (but not Notch1) was more significant in the subgroup consisting of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Subgroup analysis showed that Notch1 and Dll4 expression levels had a prognostic impact on patients with high VEGF or Ang-2 levels. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the activation of the Notch pathway may indicate an unfavorable prognosis in AML. In particular, Dll4 may be a relevant prognostic marker in intermediate-risk AML.","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, immunological aspects of neural stem cells in the lateral ventricle are still under debate. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb), called Namu mAb, which stains the subventricular zone in the lateral ventricle of adult mouse brain. Namu mAb reacted to the cells in the subventricular zone and never reacted to differentiated neural cells such as neurons and glial cells such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Its reaction pattern for the subventricular zone and the neurospheres was similar to that of Nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein mAbs. Namu mAb recognition molecule, Namu antigen, was a 50 kDa protein present in the cytoplasmic fraction of mouse brain, and its expression was clearly observed in neurospheres cultured in the presence of epidermal growth factor, but it was never or only weakly induced in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor or leukemia inhibitory factor. Collectively, it is concluded that Namu mAb specifically reacts to undifferentiated neural cells in mouse brain.","['Departments of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Ohu University, Koriyama, Japan. m-kotani@pha.ohu-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the second protocol, induction chemotherapy was modified introducing high-dose cytarabine and etoposide (block CC) instead of high-dose methotrexate (block AA). Forty-one patients with stage III and elevated lactate dehydrogenase or stage IV or B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia were included. Five patients (12.1%) had an early death at a median of 23 days after treatment initiation, caused by sepsis in 4 and by a Stevens Johnson syndrome in 1. Children that had an early death were significantly more likely to present with renal failure (P=0.04) and have significantly higher levels of phosphate and creatinine on admission (P=0.02 and 0.008). Eighty percent of children dying early had prior extensive abdominal surgery and positive blood cultures after the first cycle.

Epub 2012 Aug 3.,"B-RAF is mutated to a constitutively active form in 8% of human cancers including 50% of melanomas. In clinical trials, the RAF inhibitor, PLX4032 (vemurafenib), caused partial or complete responses in 48-81% of mutant B-RAF harboring melanoma patients. However, the average duration of response was 6-7 months before tumor regrowth, indicating the acquisition of resistance to PLX4032. To understand the mechanisms of resistance, we developed mutant B-RAF melanoma cells that displayed resistance to RAF inhibition through continuous culture with PLX4720 (the tool compound for PLX4032). Resistance was associated with a partial reactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, recovery of G1/S cell-cycle events, and suppression of the pro-apoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins, Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death-extra large (Bim-EL) and Bcl-2 modifying factor (Bmf). Preventing ERK1/2 reactivation with MEK (mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitors blocked G1-S cell-cycle progression but failed to induce apoptosis or upregulate Bim-EL and Bmf. Treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, led to de-repression of Bim-EL and enhanced cell death in the presence of PLX4720 or AZD6244 in resistant cells. These data indicate that acquired resistance to PLX4032/4720 likely involves ERK1/2 pathway reactivation as well as ERK1/2-independent silencing of BH3-only proteins. Furthermore, combined treatment of HDAC inhibitors and MEK inhibitors may contribute to overcoming PLX4032 resistance.","['Department of Cancer Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",,,"['R01 GM067893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA125103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P30CA56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM067893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA056036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study investigated the possible protective role of carvedilol on ADR-induced left ventricular dysfunction in children with ALL. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty children with newly diagnosed ALL were included in this study. They were divided into 2 equal groups: 1) ADR; and 2) ADR + carvedilol. Patients were evaluated with conventional 2-dimensional echocardiographic examination (2D), pulsed tissue Doppler (PTD), and 2-dimensional longitudinal strain echocardiography (2DS) before and after therapy. Plasma lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and troponin I levels were also determined before and after therapy. ADR treatment reduced left ventricular systolic dysfunction as assessed by a significant decrease in fractional shortening (FS) (2D) and global peak-systolic strain (GPSS; 2DS). In addition, ADR treatment significantly increased plasma troponin I and LDH. Pretreatment of ADR-treated patients with carvedilol resulted in a significant increase in FS (2D) and GPSS (2DS). Furthermore, carvedilol pretreatment inhibited ADR-induced increase in plasma troponin I and LDH. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested a protective role of carvedilol against ADR-induced cardiotoxicity.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt. nagla_fouad@yahoo.com']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"Imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib are three tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently used to treat Bcr-Abl1 positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). However, achieving maximum benefit with these drugs may require optimal dosing and adherence to therapy. In those cases, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be a useful tool in managing patients with CML. The paper presents simple and high throughput method for simultaneous determination of all three TKIs in dried blood spot (DBS) samples from CML patients. DBS samples were prepared by applying 10 muL of spiked whole blood onto an Agilent DBS cards. Whole blood spot was punched out of the card, transferred to a well in a 96-well Captiva ND Lipids filter plate. After the addition of isotopically labelled internal standard, the drug was extracted with 0.1% formic acid in methanol. The collected extract (1 muL) was injected onto a Phenomenex Kinetex 50 mm x 2.1 mm C18 column and eluted with acetonitrile gradient into a triple quadrupole ESI-MS/MS Agilent 6460 operated in positive mode. The total run time was only 2.6 min. The method was validated in terms of linearity, selectivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, absolute and relative matrix effect and stability. The effect of haematocrit (Hct) on the accurate concentration determination was also examined. The method was linear in the range of 50-5000 mug/L for imatinib and nilotinib and in the range of 2.5-250 mug/L for dasatinib, with correlation coefficient values higher than 0.997. Lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) were 50 mug/L for imatinib and nilotinib and 2.5 mug/L for dasatinib. The method proved to be accurate (% bias < 13.2) and precise (CV < 10.3%) on intra- as well as on inter-day basis. Sample matrix (% ME=94.5-106.7) and different Hct values had no significant effect on the accuracy of measured concentrations. Samples proved to be stable whilst stored on DBS cards at room temperature or in the refrigerator; however, at 40 degrees C the stability of dasatinib was compromised. The method presented was successfully applied to clinical samples.","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Askerceva 7, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Included in this study are 12,955 women treated for benign gynecologic disorders at hospitals in the Northeastern U.S. between 1925 and 1965; 9,770 women treated by radiation and 3,186 women treated by other methods. The average age at treatment was 45.9 years (range, 13-88 years), and the average follow-up period was 30.1 years (maximum, 69.9 years). Radiation doses to organs and active bone marrow were reconstructed by medical physicists using original radiotherapy records. The highest doses were received by the uterine cervix (median, 120 Gy) and uterine corpus (median, 34 Gy), followed by the bladder, rectum and colon (median, 1.7-7.2 Gy), with other abdominal organs receiving median doses </=1 Gy and organs in the chest and head receiving doses <0.1 Gy. Standardized mortality rate ratios relative to the general U.S. population were calculated. Radiation-related risks were estimated in internal analyses using Poisson regression models. Mortality was significantly elevated among irradiated women for cancers of the uterine corpus, ovary, bladder, rectum, colon and brain, as well as for leukemia (exclusive of chronic lymphocytic leukemia) but not for cancer of the cervix, Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Evidence of a dose-response was seen for cancers of the ovary [excess relative risk (ERR) = 0.31/Gy, P < 0.001], bladder (ERR = 0.21/Gy, P = 0.02) and rectum (ERR = 0.23/Gy, P = 0.05) and suggested for colon (ERR = 0.09/Gy, P = 0.10), but not for cancers of the uterine corpus or brain nor for non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Relative risks of mortality due to cancers of the stomach, pancreas, liver and kidney were close to 1.0, with no evidence of dose-response over the range of 0-1.5 Gy. Breast cancer was not significantly associated with dose to the breast or ovary. Mortality due to cancers of heavily irradiated organs remained elevated up to 40 years after irradiation. Significantly elevated radiation-related risk was seen for cancers of organs proximal to the radiation source or fields (bladder, rectum and ovary), as well as for non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our results corroborate those from previous studies that suggest that cells of the uterine cervix and lymphopoietic system are relatively resistant to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. Studies of women irradiated for benign gynecologic disorders, together with studies of women treated with higher doses of radiation for uterine cancers, provide quantitative information on cancer risks associated with a broad range of pelvic radiation exposures.","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. rsakata@rerf.or.jp']",,,['ZIA CP010222-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS410250'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, although gene expression responses have been reported in a wide variety of cells, none has emerged as robust, widely replicated effects. DNA microarrays facilitate comprehensive searches for changes in gene expression without a requirement to select candidate responsive genes. To determine if gene expression changes occur in white blood cells of volunteers exposed to an ELF-EMF, each of 17 pairs of male volunteers age 20-30 was subjected either to a 50 Hz EMF exposure of 62.0 +/- 7.1 muT for 2 h or to a sham exposure (0.21 +/- 0.05 muT) at the same time (11:00 a.m. to 13:00 p.m.). The alternative regime for each volunteer was repeated on the following day and the two-day sequence was repeated 6 days later, with the exception that a null exposure (0.085 +/- 0.01 muT) replaced the sham exposure. Five blood samples (10 ml) were collected at 2 h intervals from 9:00 to 17:00 with five additional samples during the exposure and sham or null exposure periods on each study day. RNA samples were pooled for the same time on each study day for the group of 17 volunteers that were subjected to the ELF-EMF exposure/sham or null exposure sequence and were analyzed on Illumina microarrays. Time courses for 16 mammalian genes previously reported to be responsive to ELF-EMF exposure, including immediate early genes, stress response, cell proliferation and apoptotic genes were examined in detail. No genes or gene sets showed consistent response profiles to repeated ELF-EMF exposures. A stress response was detected as a transient increase in plasma cortisol at the onset of either exposure or sham exposure on the first study day. The cortisol response diminished progressively on subsequent exposures or sham exposures, and was attributable to mild stress associated with the experimental protocol.","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Sanger Building, Cambridge, CB2 1GA, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to explore associations between changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospholipids and neurocognitive function in children undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Seventy-six children were followed prospectively from diagnosis. CSF samples were collected during scheduled lumbar punctures and phospholipids were extracted. Neurocognitive evaluations were conducted annually beginning shortly after diagnosis. Concentrations of sphingomyelin (SM) increased following induction (p = 0.03) and consolidation (p = 0.04), while lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) increased following induction (p = 0.003). Multivariable analyses demonstrated associations between post-induction SM and motor speed at 1 year (p < 0.001), 2 years (p = 0.001) and 3 years (p = 0.02) following diagnosis. Post-induction LPC was associated with verbal working memory (p = 0.007). Results indicate that early changes in phospholipids are related to neurocognitive decline and suggest a chemotherapy impact on white matter integrity.","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. kevin. krull@stjude.org""]",,,"['R01 MH085849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NR004905/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'NR04905/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD037816/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'MH085849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'HD37816/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS530319'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of disease is highly heterogenous; it affects people over 65-70 years of age. This hematologic cancer is characterized by the resistance to apoptosis stimuli predominantly associated with overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Therapeutic options for advanced CLL patients are limited. Thus there is an urgent need to discover a novel, less toxic, and much more effective agent(s) or drug combinations for CLL patients. Among chemotherapeutic(s) and immunotherapeutics currently in use, several enzyme inhibitors were tested to gain better results in CLL treatment.

Epub 2012 Jul 31.,"Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a prominent feature of low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), although the underlying mechanism remains controversial. High-risk MDS have less apoptosis associated with increased expression of the prosurvival BCL2-related proteins. To address the mechanism and pathogenic role of apoptosis and BCL2 expression in MDS, we used a mouse model resembling human MDS, in which the fusion protein NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) of the chromosomal translocation t(2;11)(q31;p15) is expressed in hematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from 3-month-old mice had increased rates of apoptosis associated with increased cell cycling and DNA damage. Gene expression profiling of these MDS progenitors revealed a specific reduction in Bcl2. Restoration of Bcl2 expression by a BCL2 transgene blocked apoptosis of the MDS progenitors, which corrected the macrocytic anemia. Blocking apoptosis also restored cell-cycle quiescence and reduced DNA damage in the MDS progenitors. We expected that preventing apoptosis would accelerate malignant transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, contrary to expectations, preventing apoptosis of premalignant cells abrogated transformation to AML. In contrast to the current dogma that overcoming apoptosis is an important step toward cancer, this work demonstrates that gaining a survival advantage of premalignant cells may delay or prevent leukemic progression.","['Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia. christopher.slape@monash.edu']",,,"['R01 CA043540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to investigate the outcomes associated with distinct high-risk chromosomal abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We performed a retrospective cohort analysis in patients with high-risk AML who received first, HLA-compatible, allogeneic HSCT between January 2005 and December 2008. Data from 236 patients with a median age of 55 years were included. Because complex karyotype (CK), -5/5q-, and abnl(17p) are overlapping categories, a hierarchical classification system based on the presence or absence of abnl(17p) and -5/5q- was developed. Patients with abnl(17p) had a 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-25%), patients with -5/5q- but no abnl(17p) a 2-year EFS of 29% (95% CI, 14%-44%), and patients with adverse-risk AML but neither of the 2 marker lesions a 2-year EFS of 49% (95% CI, 39%-59%). Notably, complex and monosomal karyotypes lost their prognostic value when these marker lesions were excluded. In conclusion, hierarchical classification of adverse-risk karyotypes by 2 marker lesions, abnl(17p) and -5/5q-, is effective in prognostication of the outcome of allogeneic HSCT in AML.","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['Blood. 2012 Sep 20;120(12):2357-8.

We identified CD25(POS) myeloblasts in 87 patients (13%), of whom 92% had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. CD25 expression correlated with expression of stem cell antigen CD123. In multivariate analysis, controlled for prognostic baseline characteristics and daunorubicin dose, CD25(POS) patients had inferior complete remission rates (P = .0005) and overall survival (P < .0001) compared with CD25(NEG) cases. In a subset of 396 patients, we integrated CD25 expression with somatic mutation status to determine whether CD25 impacted outcome independent of prognostic mutations. CD25 was positively correlated with internal tandem duplications in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), DNMT3A, and NPM1 mutations. The adverse prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD(POS) AML was restricted to CD25(POS) patients. CD25 expression improved AML prognostication independent of integrated, cytogenetic and mutational data, such that it reallocated 11% of patients with intermediate-risk disease to the unfavorable-risk group. Gene expression analysis revealed that CD25(POS) status correlated with the expression of previously reported leukemia stem cell signatures. We conclude that CD25(POS) status provides prognostic relevance in AML independent of known biomarkers and is correlated with stem cell gene-expression signatures associated with adverse outcome in AML.","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",,,"['CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA143798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'U10 CA066636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA023318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['GEO/GSE24505'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 1.,"Using specific inhibitors, kinase-negative mutants, and small interfering RNA against protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) or PKCbetaI, we find that PKCbetaI positively regulates degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells, whereas PKCalpha negatively regulates degranulation. Mass spectrometric and mutagenic analyses reveal that PKCalpha phosphorylates cofilin at Ser-23 and/or Ser-24 during degranulation. Overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable form (S23,24A), but not that of a mutant-mimicking phosphorylated form (S23,24E), increases degranulation. Furthermore, the S23,24A mutant binds to F-actin and retains its depolymerizing and/or cleavage activity; conversely, the S23,24E mutant is unable to sever actin filaments, resulting in F-actin polymerization. In addition, the S23,24E mutant preferentially binds to the 14-3-3zeta protein. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin and simultaneous observation of degranulation, PKC translocation, and actin polymerization reveals that during degranulation, actin polymerization is dependent on PKCalpha activity. These results indicate that a novel PKCalpha-mediated phosphorylation event regulates cofilin by inhibiting its ability to depolymerize F-actin and bind to 14-3-3zeta, thereby promoting F-actin polymerization, which is necessary for cessation of degranulation.","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Biosignal Research Center, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: In March 2011, the hospital pharmacy team at an acute care hospital was struggling to supply cytarabine for four specific patients, all of whom needed critical maintenance therapy after induction. Cytarabine was not available from any source in the United States, and the team had no realistic projected release dates for back orders. Idis UK, a pharmaceutical distributor, was asked to identify available drug and eventually found an unrestricted source of cytarabine in Switzerland. Once available drug was identified, a price quote for the supply amount was written for our consideration. This was inspected carefully to ensure that the drug, strength, dosage form, and any other ingredients listed were indeed what were expected. The pharmacy department worked with the hospital's department of finance and accounting to submit the necessary financial paperwork. Payment was electronically sent to the distributor before the drug was shipped. Before the order for cytarabine was placed, the associated risks and benefits were assessed. The patients provided consent to treatment with the unapproved product. Acceptance of the price quote and instructions to order the drug were e-mailed to the distributor. The necessary documentation was completed and included with the shipment. The importation process, from initial inquiries to delivery, took 21 days. CONCLUSION: The importation of cytarabine amid a drug shortage required a complex process that involved the efforts of an overseas distributor, the cooperation of multiple health professionals, and meticulous attention to detail.","['Park Nicollet Methodist Hospital, 6500 Excelsior Boulevard, St. Louis Park, MN 55426, USA. wendy.hunnisett_dritz@parknicollet.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are some circumstances in which it loses specificity, making necessary to consider other tests such as pulse oximetry to adequately determine hypoxemia. We report a 67 years old patient with sudden hypoacusia, right hemiparesis and polypnea. His laboratory exams on admission, showed extreme hypoxemia in several readings, without correlation to the patient's clinical condition nor the pulse oximetry, and a leukocytosis of 800.000 cells x ml, with many immature cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia was diagnosed and treatment with hydroxyurea was initiated, achieving normalization in the arterial gases in accordance with the fall of the white cell count. Interpretation of laboratory findings according to the general clinical context of the patient allowed to suspect a spurious hypoxemia, saving the patient from unnecessary and risky interventions.","['Departamento de Medicina Interna, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",,,,,,,,,Hipoxemia espuria por hiperleucocitosis.

Among these, the MLLT11 gene is highly unique as MLL fusion partner because the entire open reading frame is usually fused in-frame to the N-terminal portion of the MLL gene. By using molecular genetic methods, we identified the chromosomal fusion site within MLL exon 10 sequences which were fused to the MLLT11 intron 1 sequences. This unusual break site results in the creation of two in-frame MLL-MLLT11 fusion transcripts in this acute myeloid leukemia patient with t(1;11)(q21;q23). One fusion transcript represents a normal splice product, while the other contains intronic sequences and a cryptic splice event in order to generate an intact fusion transcript. We also reviewed all published articles which have reported t(1;11)(q21;q23) in myeloid or lymphoid neoplasm and attempted to summarize these published data. Of interest, pediatric patients displayed a significant larger portion of unique balanced translocations (n = 40), while complex karyotypes were less often identified (n = 12).

Epub 2012 Aug 1.,"AIMS: Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an effective therapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukaemia, can cause sudden cardiac death due to long QT syndrome (LQTS). The present study was designed to determine whether ATO could induce cardiac fibrosis and explore whether cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are involved in the development of LQTS by ATO. METHODS AND RESULTS: ATO treatment of guinea pigs caused substantial interstitial myocardial fibrosis and LQTS, which was accompanied by an increase in transforming growth factor beta1(TGF-beta1) secretion and a decrease in ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) and inward rectifying potassium channel (I(K1)) subunit Kir2.1 protein levels. ATO promoted collagen production and TGF-beta1 expression and secretion in cultured CFs. Whole-cell patch clamp and western blotting showed that treatment with TGF-beta1 markedly reduced HERG and I(K1) current densities and downregulated HERG and Kir2.1 protein expression in HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human recombinant HERG channel and in cardiomyocytes (CMs). These changes were completely reversed by treatment with the protein kinase A (PKA) antagonist, H89. CM and CF co-cultures showed that ATO significantly increased TGF-beta1 levels in the culture medium, whereas markedly reduced HERG and Kir2.1 protein levels were observed in CMs compared with ATO-treated CMs not co-cultured with CFs. Finally, in vivo administration of LY364947, a pharmacological antagonist of TGF-beta signalling, dramatically prevented interstitial fibrosis and LQTS and abolished aberrant expression of TGF-beta1, HERG, and Kir2.1 in ATO-treated guinea pigs. CONCLUSION: ATO-induced TGF-beta1 secretion from CFs aggravates QT prolongation, suggesting that modulation of TGF-beta signalling may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of drug-induced LQTS.","['Department of Pharmacology, Harbin Medical University, Xuefu Road 194, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150081, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As well as being of general interest to understanding of haematopoiesis, GATA1 isoform biology is important for children with Down syndrome associated acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (DS-AMKL) where GATA1FL mutations are an essential driver for disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Human primary cells and cell lines were analyzed using GATA1 isoform specific PCR. K562 cells expressing GATA1s or GATA1FL transgenes were used to model the effects of the two isoforms on in vitro haematopoietic differentiation. RESULTS: We found no evidence for lineage specific use of GATA1 isoforms; however GATA1s transcripts, but not GATA1FL transcripts, are down-regulated during in vitro induction of terminal megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation in the cell line K562. In addition, transgenic K562-GATA1s and K562-GATA1FL cells have distinct gene expression profiles both in steady state and during terminal erythroid differentiation, with GATA1s expression characterised by lack of repression of MYB, CCND2 and SKI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the theory that the GATA1s isoform plays a role in the maintenance of proliferative multipotent megakaryocyte-erythroid precursor cells and must be down-regulated prior to terminal differentiation. In addition our data suggest that SKI may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of children with DS-AMKL.","['Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, Level 3, Glasgow Biomedical Research Centre, 120, University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK. chris.halsey@glasgow.ac.uk']",,,"['ETM/276/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'G0901113/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'SCD/08/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 50 t-MN patients (34 MDS and 16 AML) selected among all patients receiving azacitidine (AZA) at 10 Italian Hematology Centers. Patients had developed a t-MN at a median of 6.5 years (range 1.7- 29) after treatment of the primary tumor (hematological neoplasm, 27 patients; solid tumor, 23 patients). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 42% (complete remission: 10 patients, partial remission: 2 and hematological improvement: 8 patients) and was obtained after a median of 3 cycles (range 1-6). Median overall survival (OS) was 21 months (range 1-53.6+) from AZA start. OS was significantly better in patients with less than 20% blasts, in normal karyotype t-AML and when AZA was used as front-line treatment. This was confirmed by the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports efficacy of AZA in the largest series of therapy-related MN patients treated with 5-AZA.

The aim of this review was to summarize data published thus far from ecological and case-control studies in exposed populations, taking into account radon dose estimation and evidence of radon-induced genotoxicity, in an effort to clarify the correlation between home radon exposure and incidence of childhood leukemia. Among 12 ecological studies, 11 reported a positive association between radon levels and elevated frequency of childhood leukemia, with 8 being significant. In conjunction with ecological studies, several case-control studies on indoor radon exposure and childhood leukemia were examined, and most investigations indicated a weak association with only a few showing significance. A major source of uncertainty in radon risk assessment is radon dose estimate. Methods for radon exposure measurement in homes of children are one of the factors that affect the risk estimates in a case-control study. The effects of radon-induced genetic damage were studied both in vitro and in vivo using genetic endpoints including chromosomal aberration (CA), micronuclei (MN) formation, gene mutation, and deletions and insertions. By applying a meta-analysis, an increased risk of childhood leukemia induced by indoor radon exposure was noted for overall leukemia and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Data thus indicated an association between environmental radon exposure and elevated leukemia incidence, but more evidence is required in both human investigations and animal mechanistic research before this assumption may be confirmed with certainty.","['School of Public Health, Soochow University, Suzhou, China. tongjian@suda.edu.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 31.,"Quite a few epidemiological studies including meta-analyses indicate that prostate inflammation is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. The cause of inflammation in the prostate is speculated to be several microorganisms that cause prostatitis or sexually transmitted infections. Other specific microorganisms, such as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus, are also reported to relate to the development of prostate cancer; however, the contribution of this microorganism to prostate cancer development needs to be carefully interpreted. Environmental factors, especially dietary factors, might also be associated with prostate cancer development. Among related dietary factors, charred meat carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine might be a link between environmental factors and inflammation, because 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine has the potential to accelerate prostate inflammation through its estrogenic effect. In light of these findings, preventing or reducing prostate inflammation might be one strategy for chemoprevention of prostate cancer.","['Department of Urology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",,['(c) 2012 The Japanese Urological Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in 2008, Omura Y reported several newly discovered organ representation areas that exist between the lower end of the eyebrows and upper end of the upper eyelid. This space was divided into 5 organ representation areas. The first space (more than 1/4 of entire space) near the side of the face (temple) is the bone marrow representation area (BMRA). Therefore, we examined the bone marrow representation areas non-invasively using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT). When the small rectangular shaped part of the BMRA is strong negative (-) with more than -2, often there is a malignancy associated with bone marrow. In this area, we found 1) Integrin alpha5beta1 & Oncogen C-fos Ab2 increased very significantly between 125-300 ng BDORT units; 2) very high Chrysotile Asbestos (0.11-0.14 mg); 3) markedly reduced Acetylcholine of less than 1 ng; 4) significantly reduced telomere of less than 1 yg (= 10(-24) g); and 5) Increased 8-OH-dG (often more than 5 ng). Once the abnormal small rectangular area is localized by BDORT, by detecting the specific microscope slide which produces EMF (electromagnetic field) resonance, one can diagnose these malignancies non-invasively in about 10 minutes. When a subject has any one of the above 7 types of bone marrow associated malignancies, the 5 aforementioned abnormal parameters can be detected. When Acetylcholine is markedly reduced to 0.25 ng or less, 8-OH-dG is 10 ng or higher, and Sirtuin 1 (one of the 7 mammalian longevity genes products) in both the Hippocampus and the body is 0.025 pg or less, most of the patients have a very poor prognosis. However, we found that increasing normal cell telomere & longevity gene product Sirtuin 1 can often improve both pathology & prognosis. All measurements are in BDORT units (the weight required to produce maximum EMF resonance).",['Heart Disease Research Foundation. icaet@yahoo.com'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 19.,"Acute leukemias are the most common cancer in childhood and characterized by the uncontrolled production of hematopoietic precursor cells of the lymphoid or myeloid series within the bone marrow. Even when a relatively high efficiency of therapeutic agents has increased the overall survival rates in the last years, factors such as cell lineage switching and the rise of mixed lineages at relapses often change the prognosis of the illness. During lineage switching, conversions from lymphoblastic leukemia to myeloid leukemia, or vice versa, are recorded. The central mechanisms involved in these phenomena remain undefined, but recent studies suggest that lineage commitment of plastic hematopoietic progenitors may be multidirectional and reversible upon specific signals provided by both intrinsic and environmental cues. In this paper, we focus on the current knowledge about cell heterogeneity and the lineage switch resulting from leukemic cells plasticity. A number of hypothetical mechanisms that may inspire changes in cell fate decisions are highlighted. Understanding the plasticity of leukemia initiating cells might be fundamental to unravel the pathogenesis of lineage switch in acute leukemias and will illuminate the importance of a flexible hematopoietic development.","[""Leukemia Clinic, Mexican Children's Hospital Federico Gomez, 06720 Mexico City, DF, Mexico.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As DP 1 and DP 3 share two of four key antigen-binding amino-acid polymorphisms (aspartic acid84-lysine69), we asked whether Asp84-Lys69 or Asp84 alone were independent prognostic indicators in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analysed EFS in 798 UKALL XI patients, stratified by Asp84-Lys69 vs non-Asp84-Lys69, for a median follow-up of 12.5 years. Asp84-Lys69 was associated with a significantly worse EFS than non-Asp84-Lys69 (5-year EFS: Asp84-Lys69: 58.8% (95% CI (confidence of interval): 52.7-64.9%); non-Asp84-Lys69: 67.3% (63.4-71.2%); 2P=0.007). Post-relapse EFS was 10% less in Asp84-Lys69 than non-Asp84-Lys69 patients. EFS was significantly worse (P=0.03) and post-relapse EFS marginally worse (P=0.06) in patients with Asp84 compared with Gly84. These results suggest that Asp84-Lys69 predicted adverse EFS in the context of UKALL XI because of Asp84, and may have influenced post-relapse EFS. We speculate that this may be due to the recruitment of Asp84-Lys69-restricted regulatory T cells in the context of this regimen, leading to the re-emergence of residual disease.

Epub 2012 Jul 19.,"The treatment of myeloma has undergone extraordinary improvements in the past half century. These advances have been accompanied by a concern for secondary primary malignancies (SPMs). It has been known for decades that extended therapy with alkylating chemotherapy agents, such as melphalan, carries an increased risk of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML), with a cumulative risk as high as 10-15%. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support became widely accepted for myeloma in the 1990s. Despite the use of high doses of melphalan, the risk of t-MDS/AML with this procedure is estimated to be less than 5%, with much of this risk attributable to pretransplant therapy. Recently, lenalidomide has come under scrutiny for its possible association with SPMs. It is too soon to declare a causal relationship at this time, but there appears to be an increased number of SPMs in reports from several studies using lenalidomide maintenance. Current studies should be amended and future studies planned to better define the risk of SPMs and the risk factors and mechanisms for its development. Patients should be educated regarding this potential concern but the current use of lenalidomide should not generally be altered until further data are available.","['Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 May 8.,"The application of nucleoside analogue-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy with rituximab or alemtuzumab has increased both response rate and survival in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). However, because none of these therapies is curative, sequential therapeutic regimens are required. The majority of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL carry poor prognostic factors and show shorter overall survival and resistance to standard treatment. Numerous drugs have recently been approved for CLL therapy and many novel agents are under clinical investigation. The role of the tumor microenvironment and of immune dysfunction in CLL have allowed to enlarge the therapeutic armamentarium for CLL patients. This article will provide a comprehensive summary regarding mechanism of action, efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in CLL patients. Relevant clinical trials using lenalidomide alone or in combinations are discussed. Lenalidomide shows good activity also in relapsed/refractory or treatment-naive CLL patients. Definitive data from ongoing studies are needed to validate overall and progression-free survival.

Epub 2012 Jul 12.,"We have applied bioinformatic approaches to identify pathways common to chemical leukemogens and to determine whether leukemogens could be distinguished from non-leukemogenic carcinogens. From all known and probable carcinogens classified by IARC and NTP, we identified 35 carcinogens that were associated with leukemia risk in human studies and 16 non-leukemogenic carcinogens. Using data on gene/protein targets available in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) for 29 of the leukemogens and 11 of the non-leukemogenic carcinogens, we analyzed for enrichment of all 250 human biochemical pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The top pathways targeted by the leukemogens included metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, glutathione metabolism, neurotrophin signaling pathway, apoptosis, MAPK signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling and various cancer pathways. The 29 leukemogens formed 18 distinct clusters comprising 1 to 3 chemicals that did not correlate with known mechanism of action or with structural similarity as determined by 2D Tanimoto coefficients in the PubChem database. Unsupervised clustering and one-class support vector machines, based on the pathway data, were unable to distinguish the 29 leukemogens from 11 non-leukemogenic known and probable IARC carcinogens. However, using two-class random forests to estimate leukemogen and non-leukemogen patterns, we estimated a 76% chance of distinguishing a random leukemogen/non-leukemogen pair from each other.","['Genes and Environment Laboratory, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. reuben.thomas@berkeley.edu']",,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Comparative Toxicogenomics Database', '*carcinogen', '*clustering', '*leukemogen', '*pathway']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the increases in survival and overall cure rate of cancer patients, interest has arisen on the potential risk of this agent for therapy-related secondary leukemia. Topoisomerase II inhibitors, including etoposide and teniposide, frequently cause rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on chromosome 11q23, which is associated with secondary leukemia. The prognosis is extremely poor for leukemias associated with rearrangements in the MLL gene, including etoposide-related secondary leukemias. It is of great importance to gain precise knowledge of the clinical aspects of these diseases and the mechanism underlying the leukemogenesis induced by this agent to ensure correct assessments of current and future therapy strategies. Here, I will review current knowledge regarding the clinical aspects of etoposide-related secondary leukemia, some probable mechanisms, and strategies for treating etoposide-induced leukemia.","['Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka Suita, Osaka, Japan. sezoe@bldon.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MLL', '*etoposide', '*secondary leukemia', '*treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 30.,"NKp30 is a natural cytotoxicity receptor that is expressed on NK cells and recognizes B7-H6, which is expressed on several types of tumors but few normal cells. To target effector T cells against B7-H6+ tumors, we developed several chimeric AgRs (CARs) based on NKp30, which contain the CD28- and/or CD3zeta-signaling domains with the transmembrane domains from CD3zeta, CD28, or CD8alpha. The data show that chimeric NKp30-expressing T cells responded to B7-H6+ tumor cells. The NKp30 CAR-expressing T cells produced IFN-gamma and killed B7-H6 ligand-expressing tumor cells; this response was dependent upon ligand expression on target cells but not on MHC expression. PBMC-derived dendritic cells also express NKp30 ligands, including immature dendritic cells, and they can stimulate NKp30 CAR-bearing T cells to produce IFN-gamma, but to a lesser extent. The addition of a CD28-signaling domain significantly enhanced the activity of the NKp30 CAR in a PI3K-dependent manner. Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing a chimeric NKp30 receptor containing a CD28-signaling domain inhibited the growth of a B7-H6-expressing murine lymphoma (RMA/B7-H6) in vivo. Moreover, mice that remained tumor-free were resistant to a subsequent challenge with the wild-type RMA tumor cells, suggesting the generation of immunity against other tumor Ags. Overall, this study demonstrates the specificity and therapeutic potential of adoptive immunotherapy with NKp30 CAR-expressing T cells against B7-H6+ tumor cells in vivo.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",,,"['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA130911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR007576/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32AR007576/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA130911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS390476'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 30.,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of significant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) -related genes: CRLF2 deregulation (CRLF2-d), IGH@ translocations (IGH@-t), and deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, and EBF1 in adolescents and adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort comprised 454 patients (age 15 to 60 years old) treated on the multicenter United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Trial XII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2993 trial (UKALLXII/ECOG2993) with Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor ALL. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were used to detect these genetic alterations. RESULTS: Twenty patients (5%) had CRLF2-d (P2RY8-CRLF2, n = 7; IGH@-CRLF2, n = 13), and 36 patients (8%) harbored an IGH@-t with a different partner gene. There was little overlap between IGH@-t, CRLF2-d, and established chromosomal abnormalities. Deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, or EBF1 were prevalent with 101 (33%) of 304 patients harboring one and 102 (33%) harboring two or more alterations, occurring with varying frequency in all cytogenetic subgroups. The 5-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) rates for the whole cohort were 40%, 55%, and 43%, respectively. Patients with CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions were associated with an inferior outcome in univariate but not multivariate analysis. In particular, CRLF2-d patients had a lower RFS compared with other patients (30%), whereas those with IGH@-t or IKZF1 deletions had a lower OS (27% and 35%, respectively). CONCLUSION: CRLF2-d and IGH@-t represent distinct subtypes of adolescent and adult ALL. Deletions of key B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes are highly prevalent but vary in frequency by cytogenetic subgroup. CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions are associated with poor outcome in adolescent and adult ALL.","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Level 5, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Queen Victoria Rd, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE1 4LP, United Kingdom. anthony.moorman@ncl.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving induction treatment may improve the rate and quality of remission and consequently survival. In our previous trial, in younger patients, we showed improved survival for the majority of patients when adding gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) to induction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Untreated patients with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (median age, 67 years; range, 51 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy with either daunorubicin/ara-C or daunorubicin/clofarabine, with (n = 559) or without (n = 556) GO 3 mg/m(2) on day 1 of course one of therapy. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 69% (complete remission [CR], 60%; CR with incomplete recovery [CRi], 9%), with no difference between GO (70%) and no GO (68%) arms. There was no difference in 30- or 60-day mortality and no major increase in toxicity with GO. With median follow-up of 30 months (range, 5.5 to 54.6 months), 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower with GO (68% v 76%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P = .007), and 3-year survival was significantly better (25% v 20%; HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00; P = .05). The benefit was apparent across subgroups. There was no interaction with other treatment interventions. A meta-analysis of 2,228 patients in two United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute trials showed significant improvements in relapse (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.93; P = .002) and OS (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.98; P = .02).

Nude mice injected with NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with HCCRBP-3 also induced the tumor formation.

Epub 2012 Jul 31.,"NPM1 is a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar phosphoprotein, the gene for which maps to chromosome 5q35 in close proximity to a commonly deleted region associated with (del)5q, a type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This region is also a frequent target of deletions in de novo and therapy-related MDS/acute myeloid leukemia. Previous studies have shown that Npm1(+/-) mice develop an MDS-like disease that transforms to acute myeloid leukemia over time. To better understand the mechanism by which NPM1 haploinsufficiency causes an MDS phenotype, we generated factor-dependent myeloid cell lines from the bone marrow of Npm1(+/+) and Npm1(+/-) mice and demonstrated compromised neutrophil-specific gene expression in the MNPM1(+/-) cells. We attribute these observations to increased levels of the shorter, dominant negative leukemogenic isoform (p30) of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha). We show that this increase is caused, in part, by elevated levels of the activated translation initiation factor eIF4E, overexpression of which also increases translation of C/EBPalphap30 in HEK293 cells. In a positive feedback loop, eIF4E expression is further elevated both at the mRNA and protein levels by C/EBPalphap30 but not by the full-length C/EBPalphap42. Re-expression of C/EBPalphap42 or NPM1 but not C/EBPalphap30 in MNPM1(+/-) cells partially rescues the myeloid phenotype. Our observations suggest that the aberrant feed-forward pathway that keeps eIF4E and C/EBPalphap30 elevated in NPM1(+/-) cells contributes to the MDS phenotype associated with NPM1 deficiency.","[""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. akhanna-gupta@partners.org""]",,,"['R01 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA074031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL063357/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-74031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HL63357/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve outcomes in the treatment of AML, the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group has conducted six studies in AML patients aged 15-64 years since 1987. In AML201 study, IDR (12 mg/m(2)/day for 3 days) or DNR (50 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days) in combination with Ara-C (100 mg/m(2)/day continuous infusion for 7 days) was established as the standard induction therapy, and four courses of combination chemotherapy using non-cross-resistant agents for non-core binding factor (CBF) AML or three courses of high-dose Ara-C for CBF AML was established as the standard consolidation therapy. The AML97 study showed that allo-HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor reduced relapse incidence and improved disease-free survival (DFS), but did not significantly impact overall survival (OS) in poor or intermediate risk patients. Despite these studies by JALSG, only about one-third of AML patients remain free of disease for more than 7 years. The JALSG is now conducting the AML209 study to adapt individual therapies according to genetic alterations.","['Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minamiohtsuka, Toshima-ku, Tokyo, 170-8476, Japan. miyawaki@mail.wind.ne.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 1.,"BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) after lumpectomy for breast cancer can be delivered with several different regimens. We evaluated a cost-minimization strategy to select among RT options. METHODS: An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective review identified a sample of 100 women who underwent lumpectomy for invasive or in situ breast cancer during 2009. Post lumpectomy RT options included: no radiation in women >/=70 years [T1N0, estrogen receptor (ER)+] per Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 (no-RT), accelerated external-beam partial-breast irradiation (APBI), and Canadian fractionation (C-RT), as alternatives to standard whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT). Eligibility for RT regimens was based on published criteria. RT costs were estimated using the 2011 US Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and average Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes billed per regimen at our institution. Costs were modeled in a 1,000-patient theoretical cohort. RESULTS: Median patient age was 56.5 years (range 32-93 years). Tumor histology included invasive ductal cancer (78 %), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (15 %), invasive lobular cancer (6 %), and mixed histology (1 %). Median tumor size was 1 cm (range 0.2-5 cm). Estimated per-patient cost of radiation was US$5,341.81 for APBI, US$9,121.98 for C-RT, and US$13,358.37 for WBRT. When patients received the least expensive radiation regimen for which they were eligible, 14 % received no-RT, 44 % received APBI, 7 % received C-RT, and 35 % defaulted to WBRT. Using a cost-minimization strategy, estimated RT costs were US$7.67 million, versus US$13.36 million had all patients received WBRT, representing cost savings of US$5.69 million per 1,000 patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: A cost-minimization strategy results in a 43 % reduction in estimated radiation costs among women undergoing breast conservation.","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. rgreenup13@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 1.,"The PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway, associated with cancer development and disease progression, is recognized to be an anti-tumor drug target that could present important therapeutic benefit. However, no targeted Akt medicines have been commercialized yet, reflecting that drug selection procedures requires significant improvement from early research to clinical trials. Thus, new methods permitting both the evaluation of cytotoxic and proliferation inhibition effect on cancer cells but also to provide a global fingerprint of the drug action mechanism of new Akt inhibitor candidates are of major interest. Because it can detect very subtle molecular changes and could provide a global fingerprint of drug effects on cells, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy appears to be a promising method to develop new time- and cost-saving tools for chemical library screening improvements. In this study, we combine FTIR spectroscopy, advanced chemometrics analysis and cross-validation by standard biological assays to establish a basis of a mid-throughput methodology for rapid and automated assessment of cell response to Akt inhibitors and quantitative evaluation of their anti-proliferative effects. Our results shows that our methodology is able (1) to detect cell response to an Akt inhibitor exposure even for very low doses, (2) to provide biochemical information of interest about its effects on the cell metabolism, lipidome, and proteome, (3) to predict accurately resulting cell proliferation inhibition rate. Thus, further based on a large spectral data base, our methodology could contribute to facilitate preliminary screening of chemical libraries and improving the selection procedure of drug candidates in laboratory routine.","['University Bordeaux, Pharmacochimie, FRE 3396, Bordeaux, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR-based analyses of short tandem repeats (STRs) are commonly used and are accurate and applicable to allogeneic transplant recipients. These analyses are performed on blood and marrow aspirates, but it is unknown if analyses of both are required. We performed a retrospective analysis of 42 consecutive adult allogeneic SCT recipients at our institution to determine if both sample types are needed. METHODS: Chimerism status was determined by multiplex PCR and capillary electrophoresis of STRs. Analyses were performed at 30, 60, and 90days after SCT on both unfractionated blood and unfractionated marrow aspirate. RESULTS: PCR analyses of STRs for chimerism performed on unfractionated blood highly correlated with results obtained using unfractionated marrow aspirates at 30, 60, or 90days following transplant (p<0.0001 for each time point). Overall and relapse-free survival of patients experiencing full donor chimerism was not statistically different from patients demonstrating mixed chimerism at days 30, 60, and 90 following SCT. CONCLUSIONS: PCR-based chimerism analyses on blood provide similar information as marrow aspirate analyses. These are unique results suggesting that chimerism analyses may be assessed on peripheral blood alone.","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 31.,"Despite great improvements, a significant proportion of cancer patients still die, mainly because of the development of metastases. At this stage, current treatments still rely heavily on conventional chemotherapy for most cancers. The efficacy of chemotherapy is dose-dependent, which is limited by toxicity to non-tumor tissues, as a result of its poor tumor selectivity. To improve survival length and preserve quality of life, the challenge is to develop approaches aimed at increasing chemotherapy toxicity to tumor tissue while not affecting non-tumor tissues. Marine-derived lipids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have the potential to differentially sensitize tissues to chemotherapy. These lipids enhance the cytotoxicity of 15 anticancer drugs (antimetabolites, alkylating or intercalating agents, microtubule stabilizers, Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor and arsenic trioxide) to a variety of cancer cell lines or tumors in animals, used as models for breast, prostate, colonic, lung, cervical, ovarian cancers, neuroblastomas, leukemia or lymphomas. However, DHA and EPA do not sensitize non-tumor tissues to anticancer drugs, which suggests that the effect of these lipids is tumor selective. Two phase II clinical trials already support these results, and randomized, phase III trials are ongoing. In this review, we discuss the double-faceted properties of these lipids, and then focus on their potential for transfer to the patient in the light of current therapeutic strategies. Should their beneficial effects be confirmed, the consequences could be considerable by opening up the prospect of systematic supplementation during cancer treatment, a significant shift in current cancer therapeutic paradigms.","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University Hospital of Tours, France. nawaleh@hotmail.com']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To better characterize these toxicities and to identify any associated risk factors, we performed a systematic review. We searched the PubMed database, limited to the English language, published between 1999 and December 2011. We selected only those articles in which TMZ was temporally related and was the sole or main contributing chemotherapeutic drug to idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDRs) and other uncommon toxicities. Hematological IDRs are biopsy-proven aplastic anemia or grade V toxicity or grade IV toxicity with slow and incomplete hematological recovery. Seventy-three cases were identified, including 21 hematological IDRs, 31 nonhematological IDRs and uncommon infections, and 21 second primary cancers. With a caveat of publication and reporting bias, the following observations could be made. The hematological IDRs predominantly occurred in female patients (exact binomial two-tailed, P=0.0041) and most patients were receiving TMZ concomitantly with radiotherapy for glioma. The median duration of exposure to TMZ was 30 days and the median cumulative TMZ exposure was 2250 mg/m (range, 500-6900 mg/m). The sex predilection was not evident in nonhematological IDRs and other uncommon toxicities. TMZ-induced pneumonitis and cholestatic hepatitis are emerging as a nonhematological hypersensitive reaction and IDR, respectively. For TMZ-related myelodysplasia or leukemia, the cumulative dose of TMZ ranged from 1400 to 30 000 mg/m. The cumulative dose of TMZ was lower and latency was shorter with a previous exposure to other leukemogenic drugs, suggesting that TMZ may have augmented the leukemogenic potential of other drugs.

Epub 2012 Jul 28.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a severe, rapidly progressing disease triggered by blocking granulocyte or monocyte differentiation and maturation. Because of its heterogeneity, AML is divided into a number of subtypes. Unfortunately, so far very few correlations have been found between AML classification and its clinical course or patient response to treatment. In addition, as yet only a few subtype-specific AML biomarkers have been discovered. To solve these problems here, we focused on two AML subtypes M1 and M2 that are especially difficult to differentiate. Using 2D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we analyzed the protein profiles of peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) samples collected from 38 AML-M1/M2 patients and 17 healthy volunteers. Comparative analysis of AML-M1/M2 and control PB/BM cells revealed 25 proteins that accumulated differentially. Hierarchical clustering of proteomic results clearly divided the AML samples into 2 groups (M1 and M2). Annexin III, L-plastin and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were found only in the M2 group. We also observed that the levels of annexin I and actin gamma 1 were correlated with resistance to treatment and the time of relapse. It appears that these five proteins can serve as potential AML biomarkers.","['Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, the common culture system for mouse ESC requires mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) as a feeder layer supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The drawbacks associated with MEF and the cost of LIF have motivated exploration of new feeder cell types to maintain self-renewal of mouse ESCs without the need of exogenous LIF. However, why these feeder cells could maintain ESCs at the undifferentiated state independent of exogenous LIF is unclear. METHODS: We derived mouse ESC lines using human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) in the absence of exogenous LIF. We also examined the dependence of HFF on the JAK-Stat3 pathway to maintain ESC identities and explored the potential molecular basis for HFF to support self-renewal of ESCs. RESULTS: HFF supported mouse ESC self-renewal superiorly to MEFs. Using the HFF system, multiple lines of mouse ESCs were successfully derived without addition of exogenous LIF and any small molecular inhibitors. These ESCs had capacities to self-renew for a long period of time and to differentiate into various cell types of the three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the ESCs participated in embryonic development and contributed to germ cell lineages in the chimeric mouse. At a molecular level, HFF was dependent on the JAK-Stat3 pathway to maintain ESC self-renewal. The high level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) produced by HFF might be responsible for the exogenous LIF-independent effect. CONCLUSION: This study describes an efficient, convenient and economic system to establish and maintain mouse ESC lines, and provides insights into the functional difference in the support of ESC culture between MEF and HFF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our current work was to evaluate the effect of the Jak/Stat signalling pathway on the differentiation of human non-endocrine pancreatic cells into insulin-producing cells. Activation of the Jak/Stat signalling pathway by leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) stimulated differentiation of C-peptide-negative human non-endocrine pancreatic cells into insulin-producing cells in 6.3 +/- 2.0 % cells (N = 5) and induced expression of pro-endocrine transcription factor neurogenin 3, Notch signalling pathway suppressor HES6 and stimulator of beta-cell neogenesis REG3A. The expression of the REG3A gene and increased rate of differentiation into insulin-producing cells (10.2 +/- 2.1 %) were further stimulated by a combination of LIF with nicotinamide and dexamethasone. Glucose-stimulated (5 vs. 20 mM) C-peptide secretion confirmed proper insulin secretory function of trans-differentiated insulin-producing cells (0.51 vs. 2.03 pmol C-peptide/mug DNA, P < 0.05). Our results indicate that Jak/Stat signalling critically contributes to trans-differentiation of non-endocrine pancreatic cells into functional insulin-producing cells. The positive effect of the Jak/Stat signalling pathway on trans-differentiation is mediated by the key genes that activate differentiation of pancreatic beta-cells.","['Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 22.,"Feature selection algorithms play a crucial role in identifying and discovering important genes for cancer classification. Feature selection algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main groups: filter-based methods and wrapper-based methods. Filter-based methods have been quite popular in the literature due to their many advantages, including computational efficiency, simplistic architecture, and an intuitively simple means of discovering biological and clinical aspects. However, these methods have limitations, and the classification accuracy of the selected genes is less accurate. In this paper, we propose a set of univariate filter-based methods using a between-class overlapping criterion. The proposed techniques have been compared with many other univariate filter-based methods using an acute leukemia dataset. The following properties have been examined: classification accuracy of the selected individual genes and the gene subsets; redundancy check among selected genes using ridge regression and LASSO methods; similarity and sensitivity analyses; functional analysis; and, stability analysis. A comprehensive experiment shows promising results for our proposed techniques. The univariate filter based methods using between-class overlapping criterion are accurate and robust, have biological significance, and are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Therefore, they are well suited for biological and clinical discoveries.","['Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. aloks@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the effects of TFA and calycosin (a compound isolated from TFA), on apoptosis induction, and cell cycle of human erythroleukemia cell line K562 by an array of techniques, including proliferation (MTT), PI staining, Annexin V/PI double staining, and RT-PCR.

Epub 2012 Jul 24.,"BACKGROUND: Clear therapeutic guidelines for HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) are missing due to the lack of randomized double-blind controlled clinical trials. Moderate yet similar clinical benefit has been demonstrated for IFN-alpha and high-dose ascorbic acid (AA) monotherapy in a large open clinical trial. However, there is a lack of in vivo and in vitro studies exploring and comparing the effects of high-dose AA and IFN-alpha treatment in the context of HAM/TSP. Therefore, we performed the first comparative analysis of the ex vivo and in vitro molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of IFN-alpha and high-dose AA in HAM/TSP. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Through thymidine incorporation and quantification of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines, we demonstrate that high-dose AA displays differential and superior antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects over IFN-alpha in HAM/TSP PBMCs ex vivo. In addition, high-dose AA, but not IFN-alpha, induced cell death in both HAM/TSP PBMCs and HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines MT-2 and MT-4. Microarray data combined with pathway analysis of MT-2 cells revealed AA-induced regulation of genes associated with cell death, including miR-155. Since miR-155 has recently been demonstrated to up-regulate IFN-gamma, this microRNA might represent a novel therapeutic target in HAM/TSP, as recently demonstrated in multiple sclerosis, another neuroinflammatory disease. On the other hand, IFN-alpha selectively up-regulated antiviral and immune-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to IFN-alpha, high-dose AA treatment has superior ex vivo and in vitro cell death-inducing, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory anti-HTLV-1 effects.

Epub 2012 Jul 27.,"22Rv1 is a common prostate cancer cell line used in xenograft mouse experiments as well as in vitro cell culture assays to study aspects of prostate cancer tumorigenesis. Recently, this cell line was shown to harbor multiple copies of a gammaretrovirus, called XMRV, integrated in its genome. While the original prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 is free of any retrovirus, subsequently generated cell lines 22Rv1 and CWR-R1, carry this virus and additionally shed infectious gammaretroviral particles in their supernatant. Although XMRV most likely was generated by recombination events in cell culture this virus has been demonstrated to infect human cells in vitro and 22Rv1 as well as CWR-R1 cells are now considered biosafety 2 reagents. Here, we demonstrate that 22Rv1 cells with reduced retroviral transcription show reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased necrosis of the primary tumor derived from xenografted cells in scid mice when compared to the parental cell line. The presence of XMRV transcripts significantly increases secretion of osteopontin (OPN), CXCL14, IL13 and TIMP2 in 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, these data are supported by in vitro cell invasion and differentiation assays. Collectively, our data suggest that the presence of XMRV transcripts at least partially contributes to 22Rv1 characteristics observed in vitro and in vivo with regard to migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis. We propose that data received with 22Rv1 cells or equivalent cells carrying xenotropic gammaretroviruses should be carefully controlled including other prostate cancer cell lines tested for viral sequences.","['Institute for Microbiology and Virology, University Medical Center Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, two viral (Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV)) and one retrotransposon (Ty3) RTs were used for selection. Like HIV RT, both viral RTs selected duplexes with primer strands mimicking the G tract at the PPT 3' end (AMV PPT: 5'-AGGGAGGGGGA-3'; MuLV PPT: 5'-AGAAAAAGGGGGG-3'). In contrast, Ty3, whose PPT lacks a G tract (5'-GAGAGAGAGGAA-3') showed no selective binding to any duplex sequences. Experiments were also conducted with DNA duplexes (termed DNA PPTs) mimicking the RNA PPT-DNA duplex of each virus and a control duplex with a random DNA sequence. Retroviral RTs bound with high affinity to all viral DNA PPT constructs, with HIV and MuLV RTs showing comparable binding to the counterpart DNA PPT duplexes and reduced affinity to the AMV DNA PPT. AMV RT showed similar behavior with a modest preference for its own DNA PPT. Ty3 RT showed no preferential binding for its own or any other DNA PPT and viral RTs bound the Ty3 DNA PPT with relatively low affinity. In contrast, binding affinity of HIV RT to duplexes containing the HIV RNA PPT was less dependent on the G tract, which is known to be pivotal for efficient extension. We hypothesize that the G tract on the RNA PPT helps shift the binding orientation of RT to the 3' end of the PPT where extension can occur.","['Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States of America.']",,,"['GM051140/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DA033892/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 GM051140/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DA030896/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR026140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM051140/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 DA024558/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 27.,"The nucleoside analogues 8-amino-adenosine and 8-chloro-adenosine have been investigated in the context of B-lineage lymphoid malignancies by our laboratories due to the selective cytotoxicity they exhibit toward multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines and primary cells. Encouraging pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 8-chloro-adenosine being documented in an ongoing Phase I trial in CLL provide additional impetus for the study of these promising drugs. In order to foster a deeper understanding of the commonalities between their mechanisms of action and gain insight into specific patient cohorts positioned to achieve maximal benefit from treatment, we devised a novel two-tiered chemoinformatic screen to identify molecular determinants of responsiveness to these compounds. This screen entailed: 1) the elucidation of gene expression patterns highly associated with the anti-tumor activity of 8-chloro-adenosine in the NCI-60 cell line panel, 2) characterization of altered transcript abundances between paired MM and MCL cell lines exhibiting differential susceptibility to 8-amino-adenosine, and 3) integration of the resulting datasets. This approach generated a signature of seven unique genes including G6PD which encodes the rate-determining enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Bioinformatic analysis of primary cell gene expression data demonstrated that G6PD is frequently overexpressed in MM and CLL, highlighting the potential clinical implications of this finding. Utilizing the paired sensitive and resistant MM and MCL cell lines as a model system, we go on to demonstrate through loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies that elevated G6PD expression is necessary to maintain resistance to 8-amino- and 8-chloro-adenosine but insufficient to induce de novo resistance in sensitive cells. Taken together, these results indicate that G6PD activity antagonizes the cytotoxicity of 8-substituted adenosine analogues and suggests that administration of these agents to patients with B-cell malignancies exhibiting normal levels of G6PD expression may be particularly efficacious.","['Robert H.

However, the effect of NCG on pregnancy remains unknown. This study examined the effects of NCG on pregnancy outcome and evaluated potential mechanisms involved. Reproductive performance, embryo implantation, and concentration of amino acids in serum and uterine flushing, were determined in rats fed control or NCG supplemented diets. Ishikawa cells and JAR cells were used to examine the mechanism by which NCG affects embryo implantation. Dietary NCG supplementation increased serum levels of arginine, onithine, and proline, as well as uterine levels of arginine, glutamine, glutamate, and proline. Additionally, it stimulated LIF expression, and enhanced the activation of signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), protein kinase B (PKB), and 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) during the periimplantation period, resulting in an increase in litter size but not birth weight. In uterine Ishikawa cells, LIF expression was also enhanced by treatment with arginine and its metabolites. In trophoblast JAR cells, treatment with arginine and its metabolites enhanced Stat3, PKB, and S6K1 activation and facilitated cellular adhesion activity. These effects were abolished by pretreatment with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin) and mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin). The results demonstrate that NCG supplementation enhances pregnancy outcome and have important implications for the pregnancy outcome of mammalian species.","['State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this issue, a cohort of 144 adult B-ALL patients (106 BCR-ABL1-positive and 38 B-ALL negative for known molecular rearrangements) was screened for IKZF1 deletions by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays; a sub-cohort of these patients (44%) was then analyzed for gene expression profiling. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total or partial deletions of IKZF1 were more frequent in BCR-ABL1-positive than in BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL cases (75% vs 58%, respectively, p = 0.04). Comparison of the gene expression signatures of patients carrying IKZF1 deletion vs those without showed a unique signature featured by down-regulation of B-cell lineage and DNA repair genes and up-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle, JAK-STAT signalling and stem cell self-renewal. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays we corroborated these findings both in vivo and in vitro, showing that Ikaros deleted isoforms lacked the ability to directly regulate a large group of the genes in the signature, such as IGLL1, BLK, EBF1, MSH2, BUB3, ETV6, YES1, CDKN1A (p21), CDKN2C (p18) and MCL1. CONCLUSIONS: Here we identified and validated for the first time molecular pathways specifically controlled by IKZF1, shedding light into IKZF1 role in B-ALL pathogenesis.","['Department of Hematology and Oncological Sciences L. and A.

Epub 2012 Jul 27.,"Homeobox genes encode transcription factors impacting key developmental processes including embryogenesis, organogenesis, and cell differentiation. Reflecting their tight transcriptional control, homeobox genes are often embedded in large non-coding, cis-regulatory regions, containing tissue specific elements. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) homeobox genes are frequently deregulated by chromosomal aberrations, notably translocations adding T-cell specific activatory elements. NKX3-1 is a prostate specific homeobox gene activated in T-ALL patients expressing oncogenic TAL1 or displaying immature T-cell characteristics. After investigating regulation of NKX3-1 in primary cells and cell lines, we report its ectopic expression in T-ALL cells independent of chromosomal rearrangements. Using siRNAs and expression profiling, we exploited NKX3-1 positive T-ALL cell lines as tools to investigate aberrant activatory mechanisms. Our data confirmed NKX3-1 activation by TAL1/GATA3/LMO and identified LYL1 as an alternative activator in immature T-ALL cells devoid of GATA3. Moreover, we showed that NKX3-1 is directly activated by early T-cell homeodomain factor MSX2. These activators were regulated by MLL and/or by IL7-, BMP4- and IGF2-signalling. Finally, we demonstrated homeobox gene SIX6 as a direct leukemic target of NKX3-1 in T-ALL. In conclusion, we identified three major mechanisms of NKX3-1 regulation in T-ALL cell lines which are represented by activators TAL1, LYL1 and MSX2, corresponding to particular T-ALL subtypes described in patients. These results may contribute to the understanding of leukemic transcriptional networks underlying disturbed T-cell differentiation in T-ALL.","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. sna@dsmz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is considered as the main telomere maintenance mechanism in OS. In this study, we investigated the expression of ALT-associated proteins and mRNAs in human OS cell lines. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression in OS cell lines, while the expression of mRNA was determined by reverse-transcriptase PCR and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Whole-genome expression arrays were used to analyze the expression of all the mRNAs involved in telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) including human telomerase reverse transcriptase, promyelocytic leukemia proteins and other related proteins. OS and normal cell lines do not express telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) as a key subunit of telomerase, although they show varying levels of ALT-associated proteins and mRNAs such as PML, Rad52, MRE11 and FEN1 by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. A number of mRNAs that play essential roles in ALT are expressed more in OS cell lines than in the osteoblast cell line, as shown by whole-genome expression arrays. In conclusion, OS cell lines maintain their telomere length primarily through the ALT mechanism. There are numerous other proteins that regulate this process in OS; therefore, anti-ALT therapy may be a more effective method to treat OS than anti-telomerase therapy.","['Department of Orthopedics, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, P.R.

Epub 2012 Jul 17.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a biologically and clinically separate type of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by a translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARa) locus on chromosome 17, the great majority of which is t(15; 17)(q24.1; q21.1) (Collins (1998), Melnick and Licht (1999), and Grimwade (1999)). Retinoic acid is a critical ligand in the differentiation pathway of multiple tissues, mediated through binding to an RAR. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a subgroup of the retinoid family, which induces complete remission (CR) in APL by causing differentiation and apoptosis in immature malignant promyelocytes rather than inducing cell death by cytotoxicity (Warrell et al. (1993), Liu et al. (2000), and Cassinat et al. (2001)). ATRA-associated toxicity consisting of headache, fever, weakness, fatigue, dry skin, dermatitis, gastrointestinal disorders, and hypertriglyceridemia has been shown to be mild (Kurzrock et al. (1993)). Herein, we describe a patient with APL that developed an erythematous reaction of the whole body followed by desquamation and exfoliation during ATRA therapy.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, 34093 Istanbul, Turkey.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The guest, cetirizine, was arranged in a horizontal bilayer between the zinc-layered hydroxide (ZLH) inorganic interlayers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies indicated that the intercalation takes place without major change in the structure of the guest and that the thermal stability of the guest in the nanocomposites is markedly enhanced. The loading of the guest in the nanocomposites was estimated to be about 49.4% (w/w). The release study showed that about 96% of the guest could be released in 80 hours by phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.4 compared with about 97% in 73 hours at pH 4.8.

The most commonly reported deficit is difficulty with attention. Problems with social functioning have also been identified, but their relationship with cognitive functioning is not well understood. This multi-site, cross-sectional study aimed to examine the impact of attention on social functioning. PROCEDURE: Four hundred sixty nine survivors of ALL and brain tumors (55% ALL; 57% male) completed study procedures, including parent- and teacher-report measures of attention (Conners' Rating Scales, Revised) and parent-report of social functioning [Social Skills Rating System (SSRS)] as part of their screening evaluation for a large clinical trial. Survivors were 12.1 years of age and 4.9 years from the end of treatment at the time of study. RESULTS: Results revealed that survivors' parent-reported attention problems were uniquely associated with their social functioning, relative to known demographic- and treatment-related risk factors. Teacher-reported attention problems, in contrast, were not, despite a significant correlation between the two. Deficits in intelligence and female gender were also significantly associated with poor social functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Attention problems uniquely impact difficulties with social functioning in survivors of pediatric cancer. Future studies will need to further examine the relationship between attention and social functioning in survivors, particularly when assessed by teacher report.

PROCEDURE: We analyzed serial chimerism status following SCT and evaluated the efficacy of immunological interventions for the management of mixed chimerism (MC) in children with JMML. RESULTS: Chimerism analysis was available in 26 SCT cases following the first and second SCT. MC was observed in 16 cases and withdrawal of IST was performed in 14 cases immediately after identification of MC. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was performed in five MC cases. Eight MC cases were observed at the time of neutrophil recovery. Following withdrawal of IST, three cases achieved complete chimerism (CC) while the proportion of autologous cells increased rapidly in the remaining five cases. Six MC cases were observed after achievement of hematological remission (HR) and responses to withdrawal of IST were observed in two cases. In the remaining four cases, despite withdrawal of IST, the proportion of autologous cells increased. Five cases received DLI but only one case responded. CONCLUSION: Although the benefits of immunological interventions for MC after SCT in JMML were limited, some patients did achieve HR as a result of these treatment modalities without a second SCT. Close monitoring of donor chimerism and early detection of MC is helpful in guiding treatment after SCT in children with JMML.","['Department of Pediatrics, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan. inagakij@nk-cc.go.jp']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 30.,"Activation of NRas signaling is frequently found in human myeloid leukemia and can be induced by activating mutations as well as by mutations in receptors or signaling molecules upstream of NRas. To study NRas-induced leukemogenesis, we retrovirally overexpressed wild-type NRas in a murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model in C57BL/6J mice. Overexpression of wild-type NRas caused myelomonocytic leukemias approximately 3 months after BMT in the majority of mice. A subset of mice (30%) developed malignant histiocytosis similar to mice that received mutationally activated NRas(G12D)-expressing bone marrow. Aberrant Ras signaling was demonstrated in cells expressing mutationally active or wild-type NRas, as increased activation of Erk and Akt was observed in both models. However, more NRas(G12D) were found to be in the activated, GTP-bound state in comparison with wild-type NRas. Consistent with observations reported for primary human myelomonocytic leukemia cells, Stat5 activation was also detected in murine leukemic cells. Furthermore, clonal evolution was detected in NRas wild-type-induced leukemias, including expansion of clones containing activating vector insertions in known oncogenes, such as Evi1 and Prdm16. In vitro cooperation of NRas and Evi1 improved long-term expansion of primary murine bone marrow cells.

The reactivity of proteins to arsenic must be associated with the various biological functions of As. Here, we investigated the selectivity of arsenite to zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) with different zinc binding motifs (C2H2, C3H, and C4). Single ZFP domain proteins were used for the direct comparison of the reactivity of different ZFPs. The binding constants and the reaction rates have been studied quantitatively. Results show that both the binding affinity and reaction rates of single-domain ZFPs follow the trend of C4 > C3H >> C2H2. Compared with the C2H2 motif ZFPs, the binding affinities of C3H and C4 motif ZFPs are nearly two orders of magnitude higher and the reaction rates are approximately two-fold higher. The formation of multi-domain ZFPs significantly enhances the reactivity of C2H2 type ZFPs, but has negligible effects on C3H and C4 ZFPs. Consequently, the reactivities of the three types of multi-domain ZFPs are rather similar. The 2D NMR spectra indicate that the As(III)-bound ZFPs are also unfolded, suggesting that arsenic binding interferes with the function of ZFPs.","['CAS Key Laboratory of Soft Matter Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Materials Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei Anhui, 230026, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 27.,"The use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was almost abandoned in recent years for very effective targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, approximately one third of patients still need another treatment including SCT. 38 consecutive CML patients were treated (most in preimatinib era) with allogeneic SCT, using partial T cell depletion (TCD) and preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), without post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Conditioning included busulfan, cyclophosphamide, antithymocytic globulin, and fludarabine followed by donor stem cell transfusion. With a median follow up of 90.5 months (1-134), 32 patients are alive. 97% engrafted. 5-year leukemia free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were 78.95% and 84.2%, respectively. All patients are in major molecular remission and 78% in complete molecular remission. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 13%. Twenty-four patients received DLI for residual disease. Acute GvHD, mostly Grades I-II, occurred in 18% of patients post-transplant and in 24% of patients receiving DLI. In conclusion, the risk-adapted approach using only partial TCD and preemptive escalated dose of DLI precluded the need for immunosuppressive medications and reduced the risk of significant GvHD without compromising engraftment and long-term disease control.

Epub 2012 Jul 30.,"Chondrosarcoma is a form of malignant skeletal tumor of cartilaginous origin. The non-malignant form of the disease is termed chondroma. Correctly distinguishing between the two forms is essential for making therapeutic decisions. However, due to their similar histological appearances and the lack of a reliable diagnostic marker, it is often difficult to distinguish benign tumors from low-grade chondrosarcoma. Therefore, it is necessary to search for a potential marker that has diagnostic and prognostic values in chondrosarcoma. In this study, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that elevated leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) expression was associated with increased malignancy in human chondrosarcoma tissue microarrays. Moreover, siRNA depletion of LRF drastically reduced proliferation of chondrosarcoma cell lines and effectively induced senescence in these cells. This could be attributed to the observation that LRF-depleted cells were arrested at the G(1) phase, and had increased p53 and p21 expression. Moreover, LRF depletion not only drastically reduces the cellular migration and invasion potentials of chondrosarcoma cells but also sensitized these cells to the apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. We conclude that LRF is a survival factor in chondrosarcomas and its expression correlates with tumor malignancy and chemoresistance. Our data implicate the potential role of LRF as both a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for chondrosarcomas.","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Lawrence J.

Overall survival is compromised by treatment-related mortality (TRM), GvHD, and relapse. Pretransplant clinical risk indicators in elderly patients qualifying for HCT are highly desirable. Pro-BNP is known as a predictor of death in patients with an increasing variety of clinical conditions and frequently used as a routine parameter for organ complications in the allogeneic transplant setting without well-established scientific evidence. Our hypothesis was that pre-HCT NT-pro-BNP could aid in identifying elderly patients at risk for early mortality. We retrospectively evaluated NT-pro-BNP values in 177 consecutive patients of >/=60 years HCT (2005-2010). In 29.4 % of cases, NT-pro-BNP values were within our institute's normal range (<125 pg/ml). Analysis of different NT-pro-BNP cutoff points by receiver operating characteristics curve for mortality at day +100 revealed no single cutoff value with satisfying specificity and sensitivity. The individual outcome of patients with extremely high NT-pro-BNP values was not associated with an increase in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity. NT-pro-BNP values of patients succumbing to TRM did not differ significantly from those alive or having died of relapse-median 276 vs. 217 pg/ml. In conclusion, pre-HCT NT-pro-BNP was of no convincing prognostic relevance for day 100 mortality.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany. peter.haas@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated the correlated expression of OPN and beta1, 4-GalT-I in endometrium during early pregnancy, and recombinant human OPN (rhOPN) protein induced the beta1, 4-GalT-I up-regulation in RL95-2 cells. Inhibition of MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB suppressed rhOPN-induced beta1, 4-GalT-I expression. In addition, rhOPN promoted the adhesion of blastocysts cells in vitro in beta1, 4-GalT-I-dependent manner. Moreover, the adhesion is greatly inhibited when beta1, 4-GalT-I was blocked with the specific antibody.

The 2.2-A crystal structure of the CRM1-Ran-RanBP1 complex bound to KPT-251, a representative molecule of this class of inhibitors, shows that the drug occupies part of the groove in CRM1 that is usually occupied by the NES, but penetrates much deeper into the groove and blocks CRM1-directed protein export. SINE inhibitors exhibit potent antileukemic activity, inducing apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations in a panel of 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines representing different molecular subtypes of the disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dose-dependent effects of the inhibitors on freshly isolated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells were assessed as increased phosphatidylserine exposure. Inhibition by sorafenib and dasatinib of survival and anti-apoptotic signaling in CLL cells was examined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Sorafenib uniformly induced apoptosis in CLL lymphocytes with a concentration inhibiting by 50% (IC50) of 8 mM, whereas the response to dasatinib was heterogeneous with the onset of inhibition at submicromolar concentrations but with IC50 values below 25 mM in only a few samples. At the respective pharmacologically achievable plasma concentrations, the inhibitors showed more efficient apoptosis induction by sorafenib than by dasatinib and less than additive mutual enhancement in combination. Co-culture with the bone marrow stroma cell line HS-5 increased the viability of untreated CLL cells but did not protect from sorafenib-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib or dasatinib displayed sigmoidal or saturation-type dose-response relationships for apoptosis induction, which were uniform or highly divergent, respectively, among individual CLL samples and therefore might complement each other in their clinical potential for CLL.","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne Bonn, Germany.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

Epub 2012 Jul 27.,"Retroviral genome recognition is mediated by interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the virally encoded Gag polyprotein and cognate RNA packaging elements that, for most retroviruses, appear to reside primarily within the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the genome. Recent studies suggest that a major packaging determinant of bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a member of the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)/BLV family and a non-primate animal model for HTLV-induced leukemogenesis, resides within the gag open reading frame. We have prepared and purified the recombinant BLV NC protein and conducted electrophoretic mobility shift and isothermal titration calorimetry studies with RNA fragments corresponding to these proposed packaging elements. The gag-derived RNAs did not exhibit significant affinity for NC, suggesting an alternate role in packaging. However, an 83-nucleotide fragment of the 5'-UTR that resides just upstream of the gag start codon binds NC stoichiometrically and with high affinity (K(d)=136+/-21 nM). These nucleotides were predicted to form tandem hairpin structures, and studies with smaller fragments indicate that the NC binding site resides exclusively within the distal hairpin (residues G369-U399, K(d)=67+/-8 nM at physiological ionic strength). Unlike all other structurally characterized retroviral NC binding RNAs, this fragment is not expected to contain exposed guanosines, suggesting that RNA binding may be mediated by a previously uncharacterized mechanism.","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The management of these diseases is particularly difficult in elderly patients, as non-tumour-related life expectancy is highly variable and the benefit-to-risk ratio for oncological treatments depends on comorbidities and pharmacological factors. Very few data are available in very old or frail patients, and management decisions are usually based on data obtained in younger patients. Patients might, therefore, be overtreated or undertreated without clear clinical or biological justification. In this Review we discuss the management of haematological malignant diseases in the elderly, with respect to biology or pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features. We focus on acute myeloid leukaemia and aggressive lymphoma. Additionally, we discuss how the implementation of geriatric tools, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment scores, in the clinical management of elderly patients might help to adapt treatment to meet individual patients' needs.","['Comprehensive Anticancer Centre, Medical Oncology, Nice, France. frederic.peyrade@nice.unicancer.fr']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to investigate whether there might be excess cancer-related mortality in populations residing in towns lying in the vicinity of Spanish mining industries governed by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register Regulation, according to the type of extraction method used. An ecologic study was designed to examine municipal mortality due to 32 types of cancer, across the period 1997 through 2006. Population exposure to pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source. Poisson regression models, using the Bayesian conditional autoregressive model proposed by Besag, York and Mollie and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations for Bayesian inference, were used: to analyze risk of dying from cancer in a 5-kilometer zone around mining installations; effect of type of industrial activity; and to conduct individual analyses within a 50-kilometer radius of each installation. Excess mortality (relative risk, 95% credible interval) of colorectal cancer (1.097, 1.041-1.157), lung cancer (1.066, 1.009-1.126) specifically related with proximity to opencast coal mining, bladder cancer (1.106, 1.016-1.203) and leukemia (1.093, 1.003-1.191) related with other opencast mining installations, was detected among the overall population in the vicinity of mining installations. Other tumors also associated in the stratified analysis by type of mine, were: thyroid, gallbladder and liver cancers (underground coal installations); brain cancer (opencast coal mining); stomach cancer (coal and other opencast mining installations); and myeloma (underground mining installations). The results suggested an association between risk of dying due to digestive, respiratory, hematologic and thyroid cancers and proximity to Spanish mining industries. These associations were dependent on the type of mine.","['Cancer and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, National Center for Epidemiology, Carlos III Institute of Health, Avda.

In this study, conventional cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular genetic studies were used to characterize the type and frequency of MLL rearrangements in a consecutive series of 45 Portuguese patients with MLL-related leukemia treated in a single institution between 1998 and 2011. In the group of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and an identified MLL fusion partner, 47% showed the presence of an MLL-AFF1 fusion, as a result of a t(4;11). In the remaining cases, a MLL-MLLT3 (27%), a MLL-MLLT1 (20%), or MLL-MLLT4 (7%) rearrangement was found. The most frequent rearrangement found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia was the MLL-MLLT3 fusion (42%), followed by MLL-MLLT10 (23%), MLL-MLLT1 (8%), MLL-ELL (8%), MLL-MLLT4 (4%), and MLL-MLLT11 (4%). In three patients, fusions involving MLL and a septin family gene (SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT9), were identified. The most frequently identified chromosomal rearrangements were reciprocal translocations, but insertions and deletions, some cryptic, were also observed. In our series, patients with MLL rearrangements were shown to have a poor prognosis, regardless of leukemia subtype. Interestingly, children with 1 year or less showed a statistically significant better overall survival when compared with both older children and adults. The use of a combined strategy in the initial genetic evaluation of acute leukemia patients allowed us to characterize the pattern of MLL rearrangements in our institution, including our previous discovery of two novel MLL fusion partners, the SEPT2 and CT45A2 genes, and a very rare MLL-MLLT4 fusion variant.","['Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Epub 2012 Jul 30.,"Treatment-related toxicity can be life-threatening and is the primary cause of interruption or discontinuation of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), leading to an increased risk of relapse. Mercaptopurine is an essential component of continuation therapy in all ALL treatment protocols worldwide. Genetic polymorphisms in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) are known to have a marked effect on mercaptopurine metabolism and toxicity; however, some patients with wild-type TPMT develop toxicity during mercaptopurine treatment for reasons that are not well understood. To identify additional genetic determinants of mercaptopurine toxicity, a genome-wide analysis was performed in a panel of human HapMap cell lines to identify trans-acting genes whose expression and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are related to TPMT activity, then validated in patients with ALL. The highest ranking gene with both mRNA expression and SNPs associated with TPMT activity in HapMap cell lines was protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2 (PACSIN2). The association of a PACSIN2 SNP (rs2413739) with TPMT activity was confirmed in patients and knock-down of PACSIN2 mRNA in human leukemia cells (NALM6) resulted in significantly lower TPMT activity. Moreover, this PACSIN2 SNP was significantly associated with the incidence of severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity during consolidation therapy containing mercaptopurine, and remained significant in a multivariate analysis including TPMT and SLCO1B1 as covariates, consistent with its influence on TPMT activity. The association with GI toxicity was also validated in a separate cohort of pediatric patients with ALL. These data indicate that polymorphism in PACSIN2 significantly modulates TPMT activity and influences the risk of GI toxicity associated with mercaptopurine therapy.","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['Am J Gastroenterol. 2014 Jun;109(6):925-7.

Our aim was to estimate plasma levels of the endogenous nitric oxide formation inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with only chemotherapy. METHODS: ADMA and its isomer symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) were measured in 25 former ALL patients (aged 18-28 years) who had survived without recurrent disease >/= 5 years from completing chemotherapy without cranial irradiation, and in 20 healthy controls (aged 20-31 years). RESULTS: Characteristics of the both groups were similar, except for lower high-density lipoproteins-cholesterol (HDL-C) in ALL survivors. Compared to controls, the former ALL patients exhibited significant, albeit small, rises in levels of ADMA (0.63 +/- 0.09 [SD] vs. 0.57 +/- 0.07 mumol/L; p=0.016), but not SDMA, with a consequently increased ADMA to SDMA ratio (1.08 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.16; p=0.004). The effect of former ALL on ADMA was attenuated (intergroup p=0.10 [ANCOVA]) upon adjustment for HDL-C (ADMA vs. HDL-C regression coefficient: -0.065 +/- 0.030 [SEM]; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: ADMA is elevated in adult childhood ALL survivors, which can reflect late detrimental chemotherapy effects, partially related to minor lipid profile changes. Whether these subtle ADMA elevations might herald future CV morbidity, remains to be elucidated.","['Department of Internal Medicine and Gerontology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its product, CD117, is a specific immunohistochemical (IHQ) marker that is associated with response to a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy with STI-571 (Gleevec(R)) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and GISTs. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CD117 in glial tumors as this finding may guide therapeutic approaches for these brain tumors. Ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas, in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded blocks were assayed for CD117 immunoreactivity using anti-c-kit (CD117, DAKO). GISTs were used as positive control. We observed immunoreactivity of CD117 protein in 25.5% of tumors in both histological types. In oligodendrogliomas, there was an association between older age at diagnosis and positivity for CD117 (P=0.039). In addition, we observed an association between higher tumor grade (grade III) and positivity for CD117 (P=0.007). No clinical association was observed in ependymomas (P>0.05). This study encourages further investigations, considering that CD117 may be a possible oncogenic factor in some glial tumors. In this case, tumors that express this marker may eventually benefit from a therapy with selective inhibitors of receptor kinases.","['Laboratory Research Pathology, Graduate Program in Pathology of Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil. zavalhia@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,"['Dis Markers. 2014;2014:180132.

A growing body of literature has been devoted to the association of CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the results remain conflicting. The aim of the present study was to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. METHODS: Meta-analyses assessing the association of CYP1A1 MspI variation with AML were conducted and subgroup analyses on ethnicity and age groups were further performed. Eligible studies were identified for the period up to May 2012. RESULTS: A total of ten case-control studies including 1330 cases and 3688 controls were selected for analysis. The overall data failed to indicate a significant association of CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism with AML risk (C vs T: OR = 1.13; 95%CI = 0.87-1.48; CC vs TT: OR = 1.72; 95%CI = 0.99-3.01; CC + TC vs TT: OR = 1.16; 95%CI = 0.86-1.55). In subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, significant AML risk was shown among Asians (CC + TC vs TT: OR = 1.33; 95%CI = 1.09-1.62) but not Caucasians or mixed races. In subgroup analysis regarding age groups, no associations were observed in either the childhood AML or the adult AML subgroups. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggested that CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism might be a risk factor for AML among Asians. Further investigations are needed to confirm the conclusions.","['Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. zhuowenlei@yahoo.com.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We report two cases; one occurred in association with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and another with basal cell carcinoma (BCC). RESULTS: Both patients were 83-year-old males without established histories of systemic hematopoietic disorders; one presented with an erythematous papule on the right upper back and the other with a nodule on the left wrist. One biopsy revealed nodular BCC with an associated perivascular myeloid leukemic infiltrate showing immunohistochemical positivity for CD43 and CD45. The other biopsy showed SCC associated with a leukemic infiltrate in sheets with myeloid blasts, eosinophilic myelocytes and maturing myeloid precursors. The myeloid cells showed immunohistochemical expression of CD43, CD68, CD33, CD117 and myeloperoxidase. Both patients had myeloblasts on peripheral blood smear. One patient declined further treatment and died of disease 5 weeks after the initial biopsy. The other patient underwent chemotherapy and is alive after 6 months.

This study was aimed at determining the characteristics of RBC alloimmunization in transfusion-dependent patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (MDS/CMML). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The transfusion and clinical records of all patients with MDS/CMML seen at our hospital from 1990 to 2009 were reviewed. The cumulative incidence of RBC alloimmunization was calculated by taking death as a competing risk. Incidence rates were compared by Poisson multivariate regression. RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were included. Median age was 74 years; 55% were men and had received a median of 33 (range, 4-421) RBC units. Forty-two (15%) patients formed 81 alloantibodies and seven autoantibodies. Three additional patients developed autoantibodies without alloantibodies. The incidence rate of RBC alloimmunization was 1 per 10.5 person-years and was independent of sex, age, and MDS diagnostic category. The cumulative incidence of alloimmunization increased with the number of RBC transfusions, reaching a plateau at 19.5% after 130 RBC units. The most common antibody specificities were Kell (26 cases), E (19), c (5), and Jk(a) (5). In 26 (62%) of the 42 alloimmunized patients, only the Rh system and Kell were involved.

As DNA methylation affects gene expression and chromatin structure, we investigated the effects of novel DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor, RG108, alone and in its combinations with structurally several HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors [sodium PB (phenyl butyrate) or BML-210 (N-(2-aminophenyl)-N'phenyloctanol diamine), and all-trans RA (retinoic acid)] in the human PML (promyelocytic leukaemia) NB4 cells. RG108 at different doses from 20 to 100 muM caused time-, but not a dose-dependent inhibition of NB4 cell proliferation without cytotoxicity. Temporal pretreatment with RG108 before RA resulted in a dose-dependent cell growth inhibition and remarkable acceleration of granulocytic differentiation. Prolonged treatments with RG108 and RA in the presence of HDAC inhibitors significantly increased differentiation. RG108 caused time-dependent re-expression of methylation-silenced E-cadherin, with increase after temporal or continuous treatments with RG108 and RA, or RA together with PB in parallel, in cell maturation, suggesting the role of E-cadherin as a possible therapeutic marker. These processes required both PB-induced hyperacetylation of histone H4 and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, indicating the cooperative action of histone modifications and DNA methylation/demethylation in derepression of E-cadherin. This work provides novel experimental evidence of the beneficial role of the DNMT inhibitor RG108 in combinations with RA and HDACIs in the effective differentiation of human PML based on epigenetics.","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius University, Mokslininku Street 12, LT08662, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathway can be abnormally activated in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), as well as in some pediatric lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders. Most commonly, this abnormal activation occurs as a consequence of constitutive activation of AKT, providing a compelling rationale to target this pathway in many of these conditions. A variety of agents, beginning with the rapamycin analogue (rapalog) sirolimus, have been used successfully to target this pathway in a number of pediatric hematologic malignancies. Rapalogs demonstrate significant preclinical activity against ALL, which has led to a number of clinical trials. Moreover, rapalogs can synergize with a number of conventional cytotoxic agents and overcome pathways of chemotherapeutic resistance for drugs commonly used in ALL treatment, including methotrexate and corticosteroids. Based on preclinical data, rapalogs are also being studied in AML, CML, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently, significant progress has been made using rapalogs to treat pre-malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, including the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS); complete remissions in children with otherwise therapy-resistant disease have been seen. Rapalogs only block one component of the pathway (mTORC1), and newer agents are under preclinical and clinical development that can target different and often multiple protein kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Most of these agents have been tolerated in early-phase clinical trials. A number of PI3K inhibitors are under investigation. Of note, most of these also target other protein kinases. Newer agents are under development that target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTORC1 and PI3K, and the triad of PI3K, mTORC1, and mTORC2. Preclinical data suggest these dual- and multi-kinase inhibitors are more potent than rapalogs against many of the aforementioned hematologic malignancies. Two classes of AKT inhibitors are under development, the alkyl-lysophospholipids (APLs) and small molecule AKT inhibitors. Both classes have agents currently in clinical trials. A number of drugs are in development that target other components of the pathway, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E (eIF4E) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Finally, a number of other key signaling pathways interact with PI3K/AKT/mTOR, including Notch, MNK, Syk, MAPK, and aurora kinase. These alternative pathways are being targeted alone and in combination with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with promising preclinical results in pediatric hematologic malignancies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in pediatric hematologic malignancies, the agents that are used to target this pathway, and the results of preclinical and clinical trials, using those agents in childhood hematologic cancers.","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",,,"['R56A1091791/PHS HHS/United States', 'K08 CA104882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 K08 CA104882-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-A1-30070/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA1116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS607332'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For centuries, conventional organ-based classification system (i.e., breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and so on) has been utilized. Recently, molecular diagnostics has become an essential component in clinical decision-making. However, tumor evolution and behavior cannot accurately be predicted, despite numerous research studies reporting promising tumor biomarkers. To advance molecular diagnostics, a better understanding of intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity is essential. Tumor cells interact with the extracellular matrix and host non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, which is influenced by genomic variation, hormones, and dietary, lifestyle and environmental exposures, implicated by molecular pathological epidemiology. Essentially, each tumor possesses its own unique characteristics in terms of molecular make-up, tumor microenvironment and interactomes within and between neoplastic and host cells. Starting from the unique tumor concept and paradigm, we can better classify tumors by molecular methods, and move closer toward personalized cancer medicine and prevention.","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. shuji_ogino@dfci.harvard.edu""]",,,"['R01 CA118553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA087969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA87969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA127003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151993/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS415810'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diseases of the avian leukosis complex have a number of features of distinction. They were the first neoplastic diseases in any species to be shown, 100 years ago, to be transmissible and caused by viruses, and have consequently been studied extensively by biomedical scientists as models for the role of viruses in cancer. They also became, from around the 1920s, the major cause of mortality and economic loss to the developed poultry industry, and were studied by agricultural scientists searching to understand and control them. The remit of the review is to cover research carried out over the 40 years since 1971, when the journal was founded. In this review on avian leukosis, an introductory summary is given of knowledge acquired over the preceding 60 years. Subsequently a selection is provided of discoveries, both fundamental and more applied, that seem to us to be of particular importance and interest. Much of the work was carried out by biomedical scientists interested in cancer. Probably the most significant was the discovery in the avian retroviruses of oncogenes that cause leukosis and other tumours and of their origin from proto-oncogenes in normal cells. These oncogenes are involved in cancer in many species, including chickens and humans. Other work was performed by agricultural scientists interested in poultry disease. Interests of the two groups have overlapped, particularly as a result of a shift of emphasis to molecular biology research.","['2 Manor Green, Harwell, Didcot, Oxon, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of thirteen MLL rearrangements detected, five were capable of generating MLL fusion genes, including MLL-MLLT3, the most common fusion in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Other fusions, all previously clinically unobserved, included MLL-NKD1, a fusion to the negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, a pathway linked to leukaemic cell proliferation. The majority of the fusions exhibited clonal persistence from before treatment until 6 months post-chemotherapy, suggesting the fusions may confer a survival advantage to the mutant clone. MLL breakpoints were partly clustered at a specific location, indicating commonality in the process of their formation. Further, the same MLL breakpoint location exhibited a 50-100-fold increase in C to T transitions, consistent with attack by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA). As is also observed in AML and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, in this single patient setting, MLL is capable of interacting with multiple fusion partners. This finding defines a discrete site of MLL susceptibility to fragmentation, linked to possible deregulation of AICDA function.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California Davis, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",,['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['P01 CA105049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS391121'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper addresses the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in Asians with respect to clinical-epidemiologic and histopathological features. Compared with Western countries, Asia usually has higher rates of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis T-cell lymphoma, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and lower rates of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. Among many variants of mycosis fungoides, hypopigmented lesions, pityriasis lichenoides-like lesions, and ichthyosiform lesions are more prevalent in Asia than in the West. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is endemic in southwestern Japan especially in the Kyushu island. The clinicopathologic characteristics of cutaneous lymphoma vary according to geography, and this may be ascribed to genetic and environmental etiologic factors.","['Department of Dermatology, Kosin University College of Medicine, 34 Amnam-Dong, Seo-gu, Busan 602-702, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Feb 21.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by both circulating peripheral disease as well as involvement of the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that the stromal microenvironment provides anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signals to CLL cells, and may contribute significantly to resistance to a wide variety of treatments. Our understanding of the complex interactions involved in CLL cell trafficking continues to grow. Chemokines and corresponding chemokine receptors are key factors for organizing CLL cell trafficking and homing and the complex cellular interactions between CLL and accessory cells. Important chemokines include CCL3, CCL4, and CCL22, which are released by CLL cells, and CXCL12, CXCL13, CXCL9, 10, 11, CCL 19, and CCL21, which are constitutively secreted by various stromal cells. Integrins such as VLA-4 (CD49d) as well as selectins and CD44 also likely play a role in directing CLL cell migration within the tissue microenvironments. Data are also emerging that other molecules such as MMP-9 and cytoskeletal proteins also contribute to CLL cell trafficking. Though this interplay is complex, it is critical that we improve our understanding of CLL cell trafficking to facilitate the development of novel therapies that target these pathways. Several drugs in clinical development, such as CXCR4 antagonists and PI3K, Btk, and Syk inhibitors appear to modulate CLL cell trafficking and CLL-stroma interactions. Here, we review the current understanding of the molecular interactions that underlie CLL cell trafficking and we highlight some of the promising approaches underway to target these pathways therapeutically in CLL.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",,,"['L30 CA162376-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS359497'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 23.,"We have reported that a novel c-Myc-binding protein, MM-1, repressed E-box-dependent transcription and transforming activities of c-Myc and that a mutation of A157R in MM-1, which is often observed in patients with leukemia or lymphoma, abrogated all of the repressive activities of MM-1 toward c-Myc, indicating that MM-1 is a novel tumor suppressor. MM-1 also binds to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to degradation of c-Myc. In this study, we identified Rabring7, a Rab7-binding and RING finger-containing protein, as an MM-1-binding protein, and we found that Rabring7 mono-ubiquitinated MM-1 in the cytoplasm without degradation of MM-1. Rabring7 was also found to bind to c-Myc and to ubiquitinate c-Myc in a threonine 58-dependent manner. When c-Myc was co-transfected with MM-1 and Rabring7, c-Myc was degraded. Furthermore, it was found that c-Myc was stabilized in MM-1-knockdown cells even when Rabring7 was transfected and that Rabring7 was bound to and co-localized with MM-1 and c-Myc after MM-1 and Rabring7 had been translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These results suggest that Rabring7 stimulates c-Myc degradation via mono-ubiquitination of MM-1.","['Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cases represent a heterogeneous group of diseases that historically have been classified into different categories. We studied 313 AML patients and specifically compared the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular features of cases of AML with erythroid predominance, arbitrarily defined as >/=50% erythroid precursors, to AML cases without erythroid predominance. We also assessed 51 patients with a high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB). All neoplasms were classified according to the World Health Organization classification. With the exception of therapy-related AML/MDS, the presence of erythroid predominance in variously classified categories of AML was associated with a survival advantage. In addition, AML with erythroid predominance had a lower frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities as well as a lower frequency of mutations involving NPM1, NRAS and FLT3 as compared with AML without erythroid predominance. We conclude that the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular features of AML with erythroid predominance in the non-therapy-related setting are much closer to those of a high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome than they are to other types of AML.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

The objective of this study was to characterize the cellular and humoral immune responses to an influenza vaccine in children with cancer who were receiving chemotherapy. In this study, children with cancer, who were not previously immunized, received an influenza vaccine via intramuscular injection. Blood samples were obtained prior to and at 4 weeks after immunization. Antibodies were measured using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Cell-mediated immunity was measured by specific lymphoproliferation with (3)H-thymidine incorporation and by measuring cell frequencies following staining with monoclonal antibodies (CD8, CD4, CD19, CD45RA and CD27) using flow cytometry following incubation with the influenza antigen for 5 days. Geometric mean titers (GMT), mean counts per minute (cpm), cell frequencies prior to and following vaccination and percentage patient responses were compared using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U and Chi-square tests; where p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant result. A total of 56 children were included. Their mean age was 6.64+/-3.61 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 75, solid tumors in 23 and lymphoma in 2% of the children. Subjects with titers >/=40 hemagglutination units (HU) increased from 43% prior to vaccination to 73% following vaccination (p=0.01), whereas the GMT increased from 31.35 [95% confidence interval (CI), 29-111] to 143.45 HU (95% CI, 284-640) following vaccination (p<0.001). An increase in CD45RA expression in CD8(+) T cells was observed following vaccination (p=0.01). An increase in CD27 expression was observed in the CD4/8-negative cell population stimulated with the influenza antigen following vaccination (p<0.05). No serious adverse effects were observed. An increase in the seropositivity rate and GMT values following influenza vaccination were also observed. Influenza immunization was well tolerated among these children with cancer and increased the humoral and cellular immune responses with the activation of probable lymphoid precursors.","['School of Medicine, Department of Experimental Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.']",,,['R01 TW006193/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the following years, further analysis revealed that the cell lines had acquired additional karyotypical abnormalities and differed in the presence of certain typical chromosomal rearrangements. To obtain cytogenetic authentication prior to the use of the two cell lines, we analyzed their karyotype by combining DAPI- and CMA-chromosome bandings and a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based approach by using BAC clones useful for the identification of chromosome regions of interest. Sequences of the MYC, PLZF, RARA and BCR genes, that are known to play a critical role in leukemogenesis, and certain BAC clones mapped to five known common fragile sites (CFS) were used for the FISH analysis. A telomeric probe (TTAGGG)n and a set of BAC clones were used to characterize the marker chromosome der(1) that was observed in the cell line KG-1a. The existence of notable differences between the karyotype of the KG-1a cell line previously described, and that described in this study, demonstrate that the use of established cancer cell lines should be preceded by cytogenetic and/or molecular characterization.","['Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Sapienza University, I-00185 Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 May 25.,"Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a minority of tumor cells possessing the stem cell properties of self-renewal and differentiation in leukemia and several solid tumors. However, these cells do not possess the normal regulatory mechanisms of stem cells. Following transplantation, they are capable of initiating tumorigenesis and are therefore known as 'tumor stem cells'. Cellular origin analysis of tumor stem cells has resulted in three hypotheses: Embryonal rest hypothesis, anaplasia and maturation arrest. Several signaling pathways which are involved in carcinogenesis, including Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch and Oct-4 signaling pathways are crucial in normal stem cell self-renewal decisions, suggesting that breakdown in the regulation of self-renewal may be a key event in the development of tumors. Thus, tumors can be regarded as an abnormal organ in which stem cells have escaped from the normal constraints on self-renewal, thus, leading to abnormally differentiated tumor cells that lose the ability to form tumors. This new model for maligancies has significance for clinical research and treatment.","[""Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, P.R.

Twenty-four months after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in the course of graft-versus-host disease, she developed subcutaneous emphysema of the right inguinal and pudendal region. PCI was diagnosed based on a CT examination. A 3-year-old boy was treated for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Fourteen months after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation he presented with an increased severity of intestinal symptoms, including intermittent bleeding from large intestine. PCI was diagnosed based on a CT exam and was confirmed by a colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumatosis cystoides interstitialis in the course of chronic graft-versus-host disease has a heterogeneous clinical presentation that does not correlate with results of imaging. CT is a method of choice to diagnose PCI.

The strength of this versatile method results from induction of specific T to C transitions at sites of interaction. However, current analytical tools do not distinguish between non-experimentally and experimentally induced transitions. Furthermore, geometric properties at potential binding sites are not taken into account. To surmount these shortcomings, we developed a two-step algorithm consisting of a non-parametric two-component mixture model and a wavelet-based peak calling procedure. Our algorithm can reduce the number of false positives up to 24% thereby identifying high confidence interaction sites. We successfully employed this approach in conjunction with a modified PAR-CLIP protocol to study the functional role of nuclear Moloney leukemia virus 10, a putative RNA helicase interacting with Argonaute2 and Polycomb.

We have shown previously that phosphorylation of the Proline-Rich Homeodomain protein (PRH/Hhex) by CK2 inhibits the DNA-binding activity of this transcription factor. Furthermore, PRH represses the transcription of multiple genes encoding components of the VEGF-signalling pathway and thereby influences cell survival. Here we show that the inhibitory effects of PRH on cell proliferation are abrogated by CK2 and that CK2 inhibits the binding of PRH at the Vegfr-1 promoter. Phosphorylation of PRH by CK2 also decreases the nuclear association of PRH and induces its cleavage by the proteasome. Moreover, cleavage of phosphorylated PRH produces a stable truncated cleavage product which we have termed PRHDeltaC (HhexDeltaC). PRHDeltaC acts as a transdominant negative regulator of full-length PRH by sequestering TLE proteins that function as PRH co-repressors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We exposed clear cell RCC cells to HDACIs (vorinostat or belinostat) or sorafenib. We performed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium, inner salt (MTS) assays, western blotting, flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to evaluate mechanisms of cell death, and used CalcuSyn to analyze the potential synergism. RESULTS: HDACIs alone inhibited the growth of clear cell RCC cell lines, increased acetylation of histone 3 and of tubulin, activated caspases-8, -9, and -3, and augmented the sub-G(1) population, independently of VHL and permeability glycoprotein (P-gp). Moreover, pre-treatment of Caki-1 (wild-type VHL) and 786-O (mutant VHL) with HDACIs followed by sorafenib reduced cell viability synergistically via activation of caspases and downregulation of the levels of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and secreted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

RESULTS: Overexpression of PI3KC2beta was found in subsets of tumours and cell lines from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), medulloblastoma (MB), neuroblastoma (NB), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Specific pharmacological inhibitors of PI3KC2beta or RNA interference impaired proliferation of a panel of human cancer cell lines and primary cultures. Inhibition of PI3KC2beta also induced apoptosis and sensitised the cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

We have reported previously that statins induce conformational changes in CD20 molecules and impair rituximab-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Here we investigated in more detail the influence of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) on CD20 expression and antitumor activity of anti-CD20 mAbs. Among all FTIs studied, L-744,832 had the most significant influence on CD20 levels. It significantly increased rituximab-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity against primary tumor cells isolated from patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas or chronic lymphocytic leukemia and increased CD20 expression in the majority of primary lymphoma/leukemia cells. Incubation of Raji cells with L-744,832 led to up-regulation of CD20 at mRNA and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that inhibition of farnesyltransferase activity was associated with increased binding of PU.1 and Oct-2 to the CD20 promoter sequences. These studies indicate that CD20 expression can be modulated by FTIs. The combination of FTIs with anti-CD20 mAbs is a promising therapeutic approach, and its efficacy should be examined in patients with B-cell tumors.","['Department of Immunology, Center of Biostructure Research, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1A, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HF overexpression is present in human hematologic malignancies, suggesting that HF overexpression may contribute to the development of hematologic cancers. However, in vivo evidence that HF is directly linked to hematologic tumorigenesis has not yet been shown. In this study, we show that transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing the human HF gene (hHF-tg) developed aggressive radiation-induced thymic lymphoma/leukemia (TL) compared with wild-type (WT) mice, providing evidence that HF overexpression promotes leukemia/lymphomagenesis. Fractionated X-irradiation of hHF-tg mice caused a higher incidence and earlier onset of TL compared with WT mice. Immunological and pathological features of TLs were similar in both groups. However, proliferative activity of hHF-tg lymphoma cells was higher than that of WT lymphoma cells, and microarray analyses revealed that some leukemia/lymphoma-related genes were differentially expressed in hHF-tg TLs compared with WT TLs. To investigate whether cell damage induced by irradiation is related to leukemia/lymphomagenesis, we evaluated apoptotic levels in the thymus and bone marrow (BM) of hHF-tg and WT groups after fractionated X-irradiation. Apoptosis was augmented in the hHF-tg BM, but not in the thymus, compared with the WT BM, suggesting a possible linkage between increased BM apoptosis by HF overexpression and accelerated radiation-induced TL development. Our findings indicate that HF overexpression is closely related to the development of leukemia/lymphoma, which could have implications for the prevention of malignant hematologic diseases.","['Molecular Imaging Center, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These translocations result in overexpression of mature miR-125b, consisting of 22 nucleotides. To analyze the role of miR-125b-1 in leukemogenesis, we created a bone marrow transplantation model using a retrovirus vector containing GFP expression elements. Sole transduction of miR-125b-1 into bone marrow cells resulted in expansion of hematopoietic cells expressing GFP. Compared with cells lacking GFP expression, we observed that GFP(+)/CD11b(+) or GFP(+)/Gr(-)1(+) cells were increased in the bone marrow and spleen. Although previous studies reported sole induction of miR-125b-induced leukemia, we did not find leukemic transformation in our model. Transduction of miR-125b-1 did accelerate myeloid tumors induced by a C-terminal mutant of CAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha-C(m)), a class II-like mutation. As miR-125b has been shown to hasten the development of leukemia in a BCR/ABL-transduced animal model, our present results support the conclusion that overexpression of miR-125b cooperates with other genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the previous doubly transgenic mouse model in which coexpression of MYC and PIM2 transgenes exclusively induced B cell lymphoma, we were able to show that the same combination of genes can also transform primary bone marrow myeloid cells in vitro resulting in permanent cell lines which induce myeloid sarcoma upon in vivo transplantation. By inducing cancerous transformation of fresh bone marrow cells in a controlled environment, the model we established will be useful for detailed study of the molecular events involved in initial transformation process of primary myeloid bone marrow cells and provides a model that can give insight to the molecular pathologic characteristics of human myeloid sarcoma, a rare presentation of solid tumors of undifferentiated myeloid blast cells associated with various types of myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 133-791, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although significant improvements in cancer therapy have been made, tumor recurrence is frequent and can partly be due to the absence of therapeutic target which tumor stem cells are regarded as. In this paper we shall explore different therapeutic scenarios for successful tumor treatment by using a predictive mathematical model based on the cell compartment method. In particular, we shall study the effects of the chemotherapeutic target rate and of the interval of G-CSF administration on therapy for myeloid malignancies through simulating chemotherapy with G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) support. The results indicate that if target rate is raised to an enough high value, the efficiency of chemotherapy increases so greatly that the tumor mature cells perish completely and normal mature cells are maintained at a normal level.

However, too long interval of G-CSF administration is demonstrated not propitious to patients' healing.

Two such genes, cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 (caspase-3), an apoptosis activator, and B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), an apoptosis suppressor, are tightly regulated for their expression and activation. Statins, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, have been recently recognized as neuroprotective drugs. However, their underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of simvastatin in a rat model of SE induced by kainic acid (KA). Feeding of simvastatin for 3 days after kainate injection rescued SE-induced neuronal apoptosis, as determined by histological examination of brain sections at the level of the dorsal hippocampus. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that SE treatment markedly increased caspase-3 mRNA expression and reduced Bcl-2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus. Similarly, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of the rat hippocampus demonstrated that under SE treatment, caspase-3 protein levels significantly increased and peaked at 72 h, whereas Bcl-2 protein levels decreased from 6-24 h following SE. Interestingly, simvastatin could reverse the aforementioned SE-induced changes, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of simvastatin against neuronal apoptosis may be achieved by inhibiting caspase-3 expression and increasing Bcl-2 expression.","['Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no report has been issued on the apoptotic effect of Qu on human malignant pleural mesothelioma. In the present study, it was found that MSTO-211H mesothelioma cell viability was reduced and apoptotic cell death was increased by Qu (20-80 microM), which was found to have an IC(5)(0) of 58 microM. In addition, Qu increased the sub-G(1) cell population, and was found to interact with specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and significantly suppressed its expression at the protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, Qu modulated the levels of Sp1 regulatory genes, such as cyclin D1, myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl)-1 and survivin in MSTO-211H cells. Apoptotic signaling cascades were activated by the cleavage of Bid, caspase-3 and PARP, and by the downregulation of Bcl-xL and the upregulation of Bax in MSTO-211H cells. Our results strongly suggest that Sp1 be considered as a novel molecular target of Qu in human malignant pleural mesothelioma.","['Department of Dental Pharmacology, School of Dentistry, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 561-756, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recruitment of both, CLL cells and T lymphocytes, to this supportive microenvironment greatly depends on CXCL12 production by stromal and myeloid cells. CXCL12 also supplies survival stimuli to leukemic B cells, but whether it exerts stimulatory effects on T lymphocytes from CLL patients is unknown. In order to evaluate the capacity of CXCL12 to increase CD4(+) T cell activation and proliferation in CLL patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with or without recombinant human CXCL12 or autologous nurse-like cells, and then T cell activation was induced by anti-CD3 mAb. CXCL12 increases the proliferation and the expression of CD25, CD69, CD154, and IFNgamma on CD3-stimulated CD4(+) T cells from CLL patients, similarly in T cells from ZAP-70(+) to ZAP-70(-) patients. Autologous nurse-like cells establish a close contact with CD4(+) T cells and increase their activation and proliferation partially through a CXCR4-dependent mechanism. In addition, we found that activated T cells in the presence of CXCL12 enhance the activation and proliferation of the leukemic clone. In conclusion, CXCL12 production by lymphoid tissue microenvironment in CLL patients might play a key dual role on T cell physiology, functioning not only as a chemoattractant but also as a costimulatory factor for activated T cells.","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX) - CONICET, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081 (1425), Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to facilitate measurement of microarray identified gene signatures in routine clinical tissue a novel method combining quantum dot based oligonucleotide in situ hybridisation (QD-ISH) and post-hybridisation spectral image analysis was used for multiplex in-situ transcript detection in archival bone marrow trephine samples from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Tissue-microarrays were prepared into which white cell pellets were spiked as a standard. Tissue microarrays were made using routinely processed bone marrow trephines from 242 patients with AML. QD-ISH was performed for six candidate prognostic genes using triplex QD-ISH for DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and for HOXA4, HOXA9, Meis1. Scrambled oligonucleotides were used to correct for background staining followed by normalisation of expression against the expression values for the white cell pellet standard. Survival analysis demonstrated that low expression of HOXA4 was associated with poorer overall survival (p=0.009), whilst high expression of HOXA9 (p<0.0001), Meis1 (p=0.005) and DNMT3A (p=0.04) were associated with early treatment failure. These results demonstrate application of a standardised, quantitative multiplex QD-ISH method for identification of prognostic markers in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical samples, facilitating measurement of gene expression signatures in routine clinical samples.","['Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9WL, UK.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The homodimeric protease (PR) of XMRV plays a critical role in the production of functional viral proteins and is a prerequisite for viral replication. We synthesized XMRV PR using the wheat germ cell-free expression system and carried out structural analysis of XMRV PR in a complex with an inhibitor, amprenavir (APV), by means of NMR. Five different combinatorially (15)N-labeled samples were prepared and backbone resonance assignments were made by applying Otting's method, with which the amino acid types of the [(1)H, (15)N] HSQC resonances were automatically identified using the five samples (Wu et al., 2006) [14]. A titration experiment involving APV revealed that one APV molecule binds to one XMRV PR dimer. For many residues, two distinct resonances were observed, which is thought to be due to the structural heterogeneity between the two protomers in the APV:XMRV PR=1:2 complex. PR residues at the interface with APV have been identified on the basis of chemical shift perturbation and identification of the intermolecular NOEs by means of filtered NOE experiments. Interestingly, chemical shift heterogeneity between the two protomers of XMRV PR has been observed not only at the interface with APV but also in regions apart from the interface. This indicates that the structural heterogeneity induced by the asymmetry of the binding of APV to the XMRV PR dimer is transmitted to distant regions. This is in contrast to the case of the APV:HIV-1 PR complex, in which the structural heterogeneity is only localized at the interface. Long-range transmission of the structural change identified for the XMRV PR complex might be utilized for the discovery of a new type of drug.","['Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto University, Gokasho, Uji, Kyoto 611-0011, Japan.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, high doses of MTX not only prevent CNS recurrence but also hematologic relapses. Although, standard treatment protocol for ALL includes multimodality therapy, MTX is usually associated with neurotoxicity and affects periventricular deep white matter region. Methotrexate-induced 'acute toxic leukoencephalopathy' has varying clinical manifestations ranging from acute neurological deficit to seizures or encephalopathy. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is widely available and routinely used in clinical practice to identify acute stroke and also to distinguish acute stroke from non-stroke like conditions. We report a local teenage Chinese girl who developed 2 discrete episodes of left upper and lower limb weakness with left facial nerve paresis after receiving the 2 nd and 3 rd cycle of high dose of intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate, without having cranial irradiation. After each episode of her neurological deficit, the DW-MRI scan showed focal restricted diffusion in right centrum semiovale. Her left sided focal neurological deficit and facial nerve paresis almost completely subsided on both these occasions within 3 days of symptom onset. Follow-up DW-MRI, after her neurological recovery, revealed almost complete resolution of previously noted restricted diffusion in right centrum semiovale, while the lesion was not evident on concurrent T2W (T2-weighted) and FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion recovery) sequences, nor showed any post contrast enhancement on post gadolinium enhanced T1W (T1-weighted) sequences.

To study the profile of different cancers in a particular cancer belt helps to know the exact incidence of different cancers in that region and their likely etiology. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of different cancers in Kashmir valley. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients registered at our Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) from Jan. 2009 to Dec. 2011 was carried out. All patients were histologically proven malignancies and were referred to the RCC for proper staging and treatment. All patients were properly evaluated and treated. RESULTS: A total of 8648 patients were registered during this period. Esophageal cancer was the most common cancer followed by cancers of Lung, Stomach, Colorectal, Breast, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Gastro esophageal junction, Ovary, Skin, Gallbladder, Multiple Myeloma, Acute Lymphoid Leukemia, Urinary Bladder, Prostate and Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Pattern of malignancies in valley is different from rest of the India. Gastrointestinal malignancies are the commonest malignancies in Kashmir valley followed by lung cancer in males and breast cancer in females.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Regional Cancer Center, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar, India. drmaliktariq@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we update our experience with SCT in patients with ALL with a novel conditioning regimen. A total of 44 patients with high-risk or advanced (greater than first complete remission) ALL in remission underwent SCT after myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine + busulfan + total body irradiation. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 4.3 years (range, 1.0-9.0 years). The cohort consists of 32 patients with high-risk disease (median age, 40 years; range, 19-64 years) and 12 patients with advanced disease (median age, 25 years; range, 19-65 years) who underwent SCT: 25 with a related donor (21 fully matched) and 19 with an unrelated donor (16 fully matched). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 53.2%, and that of grade III-IV acute GVHD was 20.6%. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 55%. The 100-day nonrelapse mortality was 13.6%. Five-year progression-free survival was 56.7%, and 5-year overall survival was 66.0%. Nine patients (20%) died in remission, 6 (14%) died after relapse, and 2 survived after a second SCT for relapsed disease.

Analysis of the p53 biosignatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 526 healthy individuals and 65 acute myeloid leukaemia patients indicated a novel putative p53 protein variant in a subset of individuals (227 of 526 healthy tested). The p53 variant was more distinct in the reference standard aligned biosignatures of healthy individuals, compared to the non-standard aligned leukaemia biosignatures. This approximately 2 kDa heavier variant of p53 appeared with similar frequency in leukemic and healthy test persons, without coinciding with known splice forms or post-translational modifications of p53. We propose that a standardized leukocyte protein biosignature of p53 provides a powerful research tool and indicate how p53 protein biosignatures may be used in future diagnostics.

Epub 2012 Jul 25.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have greatly improved the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In addition to direct kinase inhibition, their effects can also be mediated through immune modulation, such as expansion of cytotoxic T and natural-killer cells observed during dasatinib therapy. As natural-killer cell and partially CD8(+) T-cell function are regulated by killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), we studied whether the KIR gene profile is associated with clinical therapy response in dasatinib-treated CML patients (n = 191). In first-line patients, the absence of the inhibitory KIR2DL5A (p = 0.0489), 2DL5B (p = 0.030), and 2DL5all (p = 0.0272) genes were associated with improved molecular response at the 12-month time point. In addition, the same trend was seen with two activating KIR genes, 2DS1 (p = 0.061) and 2DS2 (p = 0.071). Furthermore, when patients were clustered into two groups by their KIR gene profile, the BCR-ABL1 transcript levels differed significantly between the groups (p = 0.047), showing that patients who lacked several KIR genes had better response. The comparison of first-line and second-line patients did not show any significant differences in either KIR or human leukocyte antigen genotypes. Our results show that immunogenetic factors, such as the KIR gene profile, can play a role in tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy response. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the functional significance of KIR genes associated with treatment outcomes.","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

There is increasing evidence that the immune system plays an essential role for the eradication or immunologic control of remaining leukemia cells. We developed several DNA-based vaccines encoding a BCR-ABL(p185) specific peptide and GM-CSF, and CD40-L, IL-27 or IL-12 and evaluated the preventive and therapeutic efficacy against a lethal challenge of syngeneic Ph(+) ALL in Balb/c mice. In vivo cell depletion assays and cytokine expression studies were performed and the efficacy of the DNA vaccine was compared with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) alone and the combination of the DNA vaccine and 6-MP. Preventive immunization with the vaccine BCR-ABL/GM-CSF/IL-12 and the TLR-9 agonist dSLIM induced an innate and adaptive immune response mediated by NK-cells, CD4(+) T-cells and CD8(+) T-cells leading to a survival rate of 80%. Therapeutic vaccination resulted in a significantly longer leukemia-free survival (40.7 days vs. 20.4 days) and a higher survival rate (56% vs. 10%) compared to chemotherapy with 6-MP. Remarkably, in combination with the vaccine 6-MP acted synergistically and led to 100% survival. These results demonstrate that minimal residual disease of Ph(+) ALL can be significantly better controlled by a combined treatment approach of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This provides a rationale for improving maintenance therapy in order to reduce the relapse rate in patients with Ph(+) ALL.","['Department of Pediatrics, Universitat zu Lubeck, UKSH, Campus Lubeck, Germany. koechling.luebeck@freenet.de']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"A set of 16 previously synthesized aryl-aminopyridine and aryl-aminoquinoline derivatives have been evaluated for cytotoxic activity against three cancer cell lines (human cervical cancer-HeLa; human chronic myeloid leukemia-K562; human melanoma-Fem-x) and two types of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with and without phytohemaglutinin (PBMC-PHA; PBMC+PHA). Twelve of the studied compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity, with selectivity against K562 but not the remaining two cancer cell lines. Four compounds were not active in cytotoxicity assays, presumably due to high predicted lipophilicity and low solubility. To rationalize the observed cytotoxic effects, structure-based virtual screening was carried out against a pool of potential targets constructed using the inverse docking program Tarfisdock and bibliographical references. The putative targets were identified on the basis of the best correlation between docking scores and in vitro cytotoxicity. It is proposed that the mechanism of action of the studied aminopyridines involves the disruption of signaling pathways and cancer cell cycle through the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases and several tyrosine kinases, namely Bcr-Abl kinase and KIT receptor kinase. The obtained results can guide further structural modifications of the studied compounds aimed at developing selective agents targeting proteins involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation.","['University of Belgrade, Faculty of Pharmacy, Vojvode Stepe 450, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2012 Jul 24.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common adult leukemia in the Western world, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of small mature CD5(+)B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, lymphoid organs, and bone marrow (BM). The main feature of the disease is decreased apoptosis, resulting in the pathologic accumulation of these malignant cells. Appropriate cellular responses to changes in oxygen tension during normal development or pathological processes, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, are ultimately regulated by the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Unlike their normal counterparts, CLL cells express HIF-1alpha even under normoxia. In addition, overexpression of HIF-1alpha has been observed in leukemic cells in BM specimens from CLL patients. The HIF transcription factor has been implicated in controlling the expression of a wide variety of genes implicated in apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. This review describes pathways regulating CLL survival with a focus on HIF-1alpha and its target genes, MIF and Midkine (MK), and the potential cross-talk between these factors.","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel. idit.shachar@weizmann.ac.il']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

We report that, in live mammalian cells, ClF targets hRNR by converting its alpha-subunit into kinetically stable hexamers. We established mammalian expression platforms that enabled isolation of functional alpha and characterization of its altered oligomeric associations in response to ClF treatment. Size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy documented persistence of in-cell-assembled-alpha(6). Our data validate hRNR as an important target of ClF, provide evidence that in vivo alpha's quaternary structure can be perturbed by a nonnatural ligand, and suggest small-molecule-promoted, persistent hexamerization as a strategy to modulate hRNR activity.

Epub 2012 Jul 25.,"BACKGROUND: High-dose methylprednisolone is active in treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but infectious toxicity is serious. The aim of this project was to retrospectively assess efficacy and safety of high-dose dexamethasone combined with rituximab (R-dex) in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 54 patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory CLL using R-dex regimen at two tertiary centers. Two schedules of rituximab were used (not randomized - based on the choice of the center): group 1, rituximab 500 mg/m(2)day 1, 8, 15, 22 (375 mg/m(2) in 1st dose) every 4 weeks (n=29); group 2, 500 mg/m(2)day 1 (375 mg/m(2) in 1st cycle) repeated every 3 weeks (n=25). The target dose of dexamethasone was 40 mg on days 1-4 and 10-13 or 15-18. Rai III/IV stages were present in 82%, unmutated IgVH genes in 82%, del 11q in 38% and del 17p in 19% pts; 46% had bulky lymph nodes; 82% were pretreated with fludarabine and 29% with alemtuzumab. RESULTS: Overall response rate/complete remissions were 62/21% (Group 1) and 72/4% (Group 2). In three patients, R-dex was successfully used for debulking before nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. R-dex was particularly effective in improvement of anemia and thrombocytopenia (p=0.0055 and p=0.0036); B-symptoms resolved after treatment in 11/17 pts. Hematological toxicity was mild. Serious infections occurred in 32% pts. At the median follow-up of 9 and 10 months, median progression-free survival was 6 months in Group 1 and 6.9 months in Group 2 (p=ns); median overall survival was 14.1 months in Group 1 vs. not reached in Group 2 (p=ns). CONCLUSIONS: R-dex appears to be an active and feasible treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL. Infectious toxicity remains an important issue. Further investigation of this regimen in larger studies appears fully warranted.","['2nd Department of Medicine, Department of Hematology, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. smolej@seznam.cz']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Pharmacokinetic parameters were dose-independent and exhibited low inter-patient variability. CPX-351 showed a negligible distribution phase and prolonged mono-exponential first-order plasma elimination (t(1/2) approximately 24 h). The plasma ratio of 5:1 was maintained at all dose levels. Nearly all of the detectable cytarabine and daunorubicin in circulation following CPX-351 administration was in the form of liposome encapsulated drug. Dose-dependent hematopoietic effects had early onset with cytopenias at 12 units/m(2), and a gradual increase in frequency and severity, until single induction complete response was achieved at 43 units/m(2). Non-hematologic effects had onset by 24 units/m(2) with shallow dose-response until maximum frequency and severity were observed at the 101-134 units/m(2) dose levels. Single induction response occurred over a 2.3-fold range of doses indicating that CPX-351 may be useful at high doses for patients suitable for intensive chemotherapy and at reduced doses for patients at increased risk of treatment-related mortality.

Epub 2012 Aug 14.,"Overexpression of zeta-chain-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) was recently recognized as an independent prognostic marker for the aggressive form of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and implementation of quantitative detection of ZAP-70 protein in B cells to clearly distinguish patients with CLL with the aggressive form of the disease. B cells were isolated from patient blood and lysed. Released ZAP-70 protein was detected using an immunomagnetic fluorescence assay. The assay protocol was developed using Jurkat cells and recombinant ZAP-70 (rZAP-70). The limit of detection was determined to be lower than 125 Jurkat cells and 39 pg of rZAP-70 protein. The signal response was linear over a wide dynamic range, from 125 to 40 000 Jurkat cells per test (R(2) = 0.9987) and from 0 to 40 000 pg rZAP-70 protein per test (R(2) = 0.9928). The results from 20 patients with CLL correlated strongly with flow cytometry analysis. Concordance between the two methods for positive and negative results was 100% (7/7) and 92% (12/13), respectively, while the overall concordance between the two methods was 95%. The assay reported here is a simple, reliable and reproducible method for quantitative detection of ZAP-70 in patient leukemic cells, without the need for cell fixation or permeabilization. The ZAP-70 signal was linear over a wide dynamic range, which we believe enables quantitative assessment of small changes in ZAP-70 expression over the course of the disease and in response to therapeutic intervention.","['Creatv MicroTech, Inc., Potomac, MD 20854, USA. pzhu@creatvmicrotech.com']",,,"['R44 CA094430/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 CA094430-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS525217'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The duration of immunity provided by an inactivated FeLV vaccine, Versifel FeLV, when administered to cats of the target age was determined. Kittens received two vaccinations when aged 7 to 9 weeks old, and were subsequently challenged up to 36 months later with the FeLV-A Glasgow isolate. RESULTS: In all studies, all of the younger aged control kittens showed persistent FeLV p27 antigenaemia confirming that the challenge virus was severe and efficacious. In contrast, the control cats did not show the required level of persistent antigenaemia, with a maximum of 45% cats affected in the middle duration study and only 10% in the longer study. However, apart from one animal in the short duration study, all of the cats vaccinated with Versifel FeLV were negative for persistent antigenaemia and can be considered treatment successes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have shown that although age-related resistance to infection with a virulent FeLV challenge is evident from as early as 10 months of age, vaccination with Versifel FeLV may aid in the protection of cats from FeLV related disease up to three years after primary vaccination as kittens.","['Veterinary Medicine Research and Development, Pfizer Animal Health, Pfizer European Service Centre, Zaventem, Belgium.

In a microarray assay using samples from 100 children with ALL, SFRS1 was found to be up-regulated. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1, also termed SF2/ASF), encoded by the SFRS1 gene, had been shown to be a pro-oncoprotein. Our previous study indicated that SRSF1 can be methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in vitro; however, the biological function of SRSF1 and PRMT1 in pediatric ALL are presently unknown. METHODS: Matched, newly diagnosed (ND), complete remission (CR) and relapse (RE) bone marrow samples from 57 patients were collected in order to evaluate the expression patterns of SRSF1 and PRMT1. The potential oncogenic mechanism of SRSF1 and PRMT1 in leukemogenesis was also investigated. RESULTS: We identified significant up-regulation of SRSF1 and PRMT1 in the ND samples. Importantly, the expression of SRSF1 and PRMT1 returned to normal levels after CR, but rebounded in the RE samples. Our observation that SRSF1 could predict disease relapse was of particular interest, although the expression patterns of SRSF1 and PRMT1 were independent of the cytogenetic subtypes. In pre-B-cell lines, both SRSF1 and PRMT1 expression could be efficiently attenuated by the clinical chemotherapy agents arabinoside cytosine (Ara-c) or vincristine (VCR). Moreover, SRSF1 and PRMT1 were associated with each other in leukemia cells in vivo. Knock-down of SRSF1 resulted in an increase in early apoptosis, which could be further induced by chemotherapeutics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that SRSF1 serves as an anti-apoptotic factor and potentially contributes to leukemogenesis in pediatric ALL patients by cooperating with PRMT1.","[""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, 56 Nanlishi Road, Beijing 100045, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between T2DM and the risk of developing common cancers in a Chinese population. METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study was carried out in the Nan-Hu district of Jiaxing city, Zhejiang province, China. The incidence of cancer cases among type 2 diabetic patients were identified through record-linkage of the Diabetic Surveillance and Registry Database with the Cancer Database from January 2002 to June 2008. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for the risk of cancer among the patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The overall incidence of cancer was 1083.6 per 10(5) subjects in male T2DM patients and 870.2 per 105 in females. Increased risk of developing cancer was found in both male and female T2DM patients with an SIR of 1.331 (95% CI = 1.143-1.518) and 1.737 (1.478-1.997), respectively. As for cancer subtypes, both male and female T2DM patients had a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer with the SIRs of 2.973 (1.73-4.21) and 2.687 (1.445-3.928), respectively. Elevated risk of liver and kidney cancers was only found in male T2DM patients with SIRs of 1.538 (1.005-2.072) and 4.091 (1.418-6.764), respectively. Increased risks of developing breast cancer [2.209 (1.487-2.93)] and leukemia SIR: [4.167 (1.584- 6.749) ] were found in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that patients with T2DM have an increased risk of developing cancer. Additional cancer screening should be employed in the management of patients with T2DM.","[""Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310009, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 10.,"Fludarabine and cladribine are purine analogues used to treat hematological malignancies. Alone or in combination with therapeutic antibodies, they are effective in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not well understood. Plasma membrane proteins perform a variety of essential functions that can be affected by malignancy and perturbed by chemotherapy. Analysis of surface proteins may contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms of action of purine analogues and identify biomarkers for targeted therapy. The surface of human cells is rich in N-linked glycoproteins, enabling use of a hydrazide-coupling technique to enrich for glycoproteins, with iTRAQ labeling for quantitative comparison. A number of plasma membrane proteins on human leukemia and lymphoma cells were affected by treatment with a purine analogue, including decreases in CD22 (an adhesion and signaling molecule) and increases in CD205 (a ""damaged cell marker"") and CD80 and CD50 (T-cell interaction molecules). Purine analogues may affect B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and costimulatory molecules, leading to multiple signals for apoptosis and cell clearance. Fludarabine and cladribine induce differential effects, with some cell survival proteins (ECE-1 and CD100) more abundant after fludarabine treatment. Cell surface proteins induced by fludarabine and cladribine may be targets for therapeutic antibodies.","['School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 27.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only known cure for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) who develop aplasia or leukemia. However, transplant regimens typically contain high-dose alkylators, which are poorly tolerated in FA patients. Furthermore, as many patients lack human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched family donors, alternative donors are used, which can increase the risk of both graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To improve on these three concerns, we developed a multi-institutional clinical trial using a fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen with limited alkylators/low-dose radiation, HLA-haploidentical marrow, followed by reduced-dose cyclophosphamide (CY) to treat three FA patients with aplasia. All three patients engrafted with 100% donor CD3 chimerism at 1 month. One patient died early from disseminated toxoplasmosis infection. Of the two survivors, one had significant pretransplant co-morbidities and inadequate immunosuppression, and developed severe acute GVHD. The other patient had only mild acute and no chronic GVHD. With a follow-up of 2 and 3 years, respectively, both patients are doing well, are transfusion-independent, and maintain full donor chimerism. The patient with severe GVHD has resolving oral GVHD and good quality of life. We conclude that using low-intensity conditioning, HLA-haploidentical marrow, and reduced-dose CY for in vivo T-cell depletion can correct life-threatening aplasia in FA patients.","['Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA. mthakar@mcw.edu']",,,"['P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS454654'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS & METHODS: Children with ALL (n = 96) were screened for GCPII C1561T, RFC1 G80A, cSHMT C1420T, TYMS 5 -UTR 2R3R, TYMS 3 -UTR ins6/del6, MTHFR C677T, MTR A2756G polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP and PCR-amplified fragment length polymorphism techniques. RESULTS: GCPII C1561T showed independent association with toxicity. The following synergetic interactions appeared to increase the toxicity of 6-mercaptopurine: TPMT*12 x RFC1 G80A; TPMT CTTAT haplotype x RFC1 G80A; TPMT CTTAT haplotype x RFC1 G80A x TYMS 2R3R. The genetic variants of thiopurine and folate pathway cumulatively appeared to increase the predictability of toxicity (r(2) = 0.41) in a multiple linear regression model. For the observed toxicity grades of 1, 2, 3 and 4, the respective predicted toxicity grades were 1.65 +/- 0.29, 1.68 +/- 0.24, 2.56 +/- 0.58 and 2.99 +/- 1.03, p(trend) < 0.0001.

STUDY DESIGN: Between 1975 and 2010, 905 patients with GTN were treated at the Sheffield Centre. Twenty-four of them died. The medical records of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients, 11 died during initial treatment. A further 8 died from disease relapse and progression of the disease. The cause of death was unrelated in the other 5, who were excluded from analysis. For the remaining 19 patients, death was due to metastatic tumor in 13 and was treatment related in 6. Adverse prognostic features for death from GTN included histology (7 were placental site trophoblastic tumor [PSTT]), risk score (15 were high risk) and chemotherapy resistance. All 5 of the patients who died of acute treatment-related complications (invariably sepsis and/or multiorgan failure) still had active GTN at the time of death; all were treated prior to 1987. One multitreated patient died of acute myeloid leukemia 3 years posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Metastatic multidrug-resistant PSTT was and still is the single most important cause of death. Death from choriocarcinoma was with nonpulmonary metastases not responding to initial treatment. Early treatment-related death (from sepsis) is nowadays avoidable.","['Sheffield Centre for Trophoblastic Disease, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and HLTV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, HTLV-1 uveitis (HU) has been established as a distinct clinical entity caused by HTLV-1 based on seroepidemiological, clinical, and virological studies. HU is one of the most common causes of uveitis in endemic areas of Japan and can be a problematic clinical entity all over the world. HU occurs with a sudden onset of floaters and foggy vision, and is classified as an intermediate uveitis. Analysis of infiltrating cells in eyes with HU revealed that the majority of infiltrating cells were CD3(+) T cells, but not malignant cells or leukemic cells based on their T cell receptor usage. HTLV-1 proviral DNA, HTLV-1 protein, and viral particles were detected from infiltrating cells in eyes with HU. HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) T cell clones established from infiltrating cells in eyes with HU produced large amounts of various inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma. Taken together, HU is considered to be caused by inflammatory cytokines produced by HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells that significantly accumulate in eyes; therefore, topical and/or oral corticosteroid treatment is effective to treat intraocular inflammation in patients with HU. Further investigation is needed to establish a specific treatment for HU.","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University , Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD4+ T cell', 'HTLV-1', 'T cell clone', 'ocular inflammation', 'uveitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 12.,"Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) inhibits necroptosis by allosterically inhibiting the kinase activity of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which plays a critical role in necroptosis. RIP1 is a crucial adaptor kinase involved in the activation of NF-kappaB, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). NF-kappaB, ROS and MAPKs all play important roles in apoptotic signaling. Nec-1 was regarded as having no effect on apoptosis. Here, we report that Nec-1 increased the rate of nuclear condensation and caspases activation induced by a low concentration of shikonin (SHK) in HL60, K562 and primary leukemia cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of RIP1 significantly enhanced shikonin-induced apoptosis in K562 and HL60 cells. Shikonin treatment alone could slightly inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in leukemia cells, and the inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 was significantly augmented by Nec-1. We also found that Nec-1 could inhibit NF-kappaB p65 translocation to the nucleus at a later stage of SHK treatment. In conclusion, we found that Nec-1 can promote shikonin-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. The mechanism by which Nec-1 sensitizes shikonin-induced apoptosis appears to be the inhibition of RIP1 kinase-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document Nec-1 sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 3 East Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310016, China; E-Mails: hanweidong1979@gmail.com (W.H.); fyzju@sina.com (Y.F.); wzg79@163.com (Z.W.).']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ERK1/2', 'Necrostatin-1', 'apoptosis', 'receptor-interacting protein 1', 'shikonin']",,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20130704'],,,,,,

Several prognostic factors have been identified that can stratify patients into groups that differ in their relative tendency for disease progression and/or survival. Here, we pursued a subnetwork-based analysis of gene expression profiles to discriminate between groups of patients with disparate risks for CLL progression. From an initial cohort of 130 patients, we identified 38 prognostic subnetworks that could predict the relative risk for disease progression requiring therapy from the time of sample collection, more accurately than established markers. The prognostic power of these subnetworks then was validated on 2 other cohorts of patients. We noted reduced divergence in gene expression between leukemia cells of CLL patients classified at diagnosis with aggressive versus indolent disease over time. The predictive subnetworks vary in levels of expression over time but exhibit increased similarity at later time points before therapy, suggesting that degenerate pathways apparently converge into common pathways that are associated with disease progression. As such, these results have implications for understanding cancer evolution and for the development of novel treatment strategies for patients with CLL.","['Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",,,"['R37-CA049870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES014811/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES14811/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA049870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the genetic aberrations observed in newly diagnosed pPCL are typically found in advanced multiple myeloma. These cytogenetic abnormalities and mutations lead to increased proliferation, enhanced inhibition of apoptosis, escape from immune surveillance, and independence from the BM microenvironment, with changes in expression of adhesion molecules or chemokine receptors.

Epub 2012 Jul 26.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have definitively determined that flow cytometry (FC) is significantly more sensitive than cytomorphology (CM) in detection of hematolymphoid neoplasms (HLNs). However, its utility in paucicellular bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens has not been established. METHODS: FC was performed on BAL specimens submitted from 44 patients with a prior diagnosis of HLN. Panels chosen were based upon cellularity of specimen and patient history. FC results were compared with concurrent CM evaluations. RESULTS: All 44 BALs were deemed satisfactory for FC and yielded informative results that assisted in diagnosis. Diagnoses included 22/44 B-cell neoplasms, 16/44 T-cell neoplasms, four/44 myeloid neoplasms, and two/44 plasma cell neoplasms. Overall concordance was demonstrated between FC and CM in 77% (34/44) of cases. In nine/44 cases (20%), one technique (FC or CM) clearly detected malignant cells when the other did not. FC was more sensitive than CM in detecting a HLN in eight/nine discordant cases. In only one case (one/44, 2%) were malignant HLN cells suspected by CM, but not identified by FC (one/44, 2%). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate, in the largest series published to date, that FC can be performed on BAL specimens. FC is indicated in evaluation of BAL for HLN and improves sensitivity of detection of HLN over CM alone. An integrated FC and CM approach is superior to either technique alone in diagnostic evaluation of BAL.","['Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",,"['Published 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS439144'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mixture is composed of two structural forms: 4-cyano-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-a-methyl-1-naphthaleneacetonitrile (THNA, CAS No. 57964-39-3) and 4-cyano-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenepropionitrile (THNP, CAS No. 57964-40-6). The THNA form consists of four stereoisomers. [Structure:see text]. The THNP form consists of two stereoisomers. [Structure:see text]. SAN Trimer is a by-product of the production of acrylonitrile styrene plastics and is created in specific manufacturing processes for polymers of acrylonitrile and styrene. In June 1998, due to community concerns about the toxicity of SAN Trimer, it was nominated to the NTP for carcinogenicity testing by a member of Congress. Male and female F344/N rats were exposed to SAN Trimer in feed in perinatal and postnatal studies for 7 weeks, 18 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, and in rat reticulocytes, leukocytes, liver cells, and brain cells. In vivo comet and micronucleus assays were performed in the juvenile rats. 7-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm SAN Trimer (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 90, 175, 270, or 410 mg SAN Trimer/kg body weight to males and 45, 90, 185, 295, or 430 mg/kg to females) for 2 weeks postweaning; the dams of these rats were fed the same concentrations of SAN Trimer from gestation day 7 until the pups were weaned. One 4,000 ppm male rat died 3 days after weaning; all other rats that started the postweaning phase survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm males and 2,000 and 4,000 ppm females were significantly less than those of the controls; weaning mean body weights were reduced in 4,000 ppm males and females and in 2,000 ppm females. Feed consumption by 2,000 and 4,000 ppm males and females was less than that by the control groups. Thinness in 4,000 ppm male rats was the only clinical finding related to SAN Trimer exposure. Nonneoplastic lesions were observed in the brain, thymus, spleen, liver, kidney, and reproductive organs of males and females and were considered due to overt toxicity. 18-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets of 0, 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,600 ppm SAN Trimer (equivalent to average daily doses of 10, 20, 40, 80, or 150 mg/kg to males and females) for 3 months postweaning; the dams of these rats were fed the same concentrations from gestation day 7 until the pups were weaned. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of 1,600 ppm males and females exposed to 200 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. At termination, brown staining of the urogenital fur was observed in females exposed to 200 ppm or greater. The liver weights of all exposed groups of males and the spleen weights of 800 and 1,600 ppm males and 1,600 ppm females were significantly greater than those of the controls. There were no significant differences in sperm parameters of male rats or the estrous cyclicity of female rats administered 400, 800, or 1,600 ppm in the diet when compared to the control groups. No exposure-related histopathologic lesions were observed. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female core study rats were fed diets of 0, 400, 800, or 1,600 ppm SAN Trimer (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, or 75 mg/kg to males and 20, 40, or 85 mg/kg to females) for 2 years. Special study groups of 20 males and 20 females were fed the same exposure concentrations and were evaluated at 27, 52, and 78 weeks for hematology and clinical chemistry or at 26, 51, and 77 weeks for urinalysis. The dams of core and special study rats were fed the same concentrations from gestation day 7 until the pups were weaned. Mean body weights of 1,600 ppm males were less than 90% of the controls after week 1; mean body weights of 800 and 1,600 ppm females were less than 90% of the controls after weeks 41 and 13, respectively. Feed consumption by exposed groups of males and females was generally similar to that by the control groups. Brown staining of the urogenital fur was observed in all exposed groups, and the number of animals affected increased with increasing exposure concentration. Rare neoplasms were present in the central nervous system of male and female rats. In the original evaluation, the 800 and 1,600 ppm groups of male rats each had one astrocytoma and one granular cell tumor in the brain. Also in the brain, one 400 ppm female had a granular cell tumor and one control, one 400 ppm, and one 800 ppm female had a mixed cell glioma. In the spinal cord, one astrocytoma was noted in a 1,600 ppm male in the original evaluation. In the expanded review of the spinal cord, one granular cell tumor was found in a 400 ppm male and one meningioma was found in an 800 ppm female. There were statistically significant increases in the incidence of spinal nerve root degeneration in 1,600 ppm males and the incidences of sciatic nerve degeneration in 800 and 1,600 ppm females. More importantly, there were increases in the severities of both nerve lesions in males and in the severity of spinal nerve root degeneration in females. The incidences of bone marrow hyperplasia were significantly increased in 1,600 ppm males and females and 800 ppm females. Incidences of bone marrow granulomatous inflammation were increased in 1,600 ppm males and 800 and 1,600 ppm females, and the increase in the 800 ppm females was significant. Because this lesion is very rare and did not occur in control animals, it should be considered biologically significant. In the liver, the incidence of eosinophilic focus was significantly increased in 1,600 ppm males and the incidences of mixed cell focus were significantly increased in 400 and 1,600 ppm males. Incidences of mixed cell focus were increased in the liver of all exposed groups of females, and the increase was significant in the 1,600 ppm group. The incidence of transitional epithelial hyperplasia of the urinary bladder in 1,600 ppm females was significantly greater than that in the controls. There were significant decreases in the incidences of pituitary gland pars distalis adenoma in 1,600 ppm males and females, and the incidences in both sexes occurred with negative trends. The incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma occurred in females with a negative trend, and the incidences in 800 and 1,600 ppm females were significantly less than that in the control group. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in all exposed groups of males and females were significantly less than those in the controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: SAN Trimer (Batch 3) was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 or TA100 or in Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA/pKM101 in tests conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation. In vivo, however, results of a comet assay indicated significantly increased levels of DNA damage in brain cells of male and female juvenile rats following administration of SAN Trimer (Batch 3) by oral gavage. Dose-related increases in DNA damage in liver cells of these rats were also observed, but the increases were smaller than those observed in brain cells and were judged to be equivocal in both males and females. Indications of DNA damage following exposure to SAN Trimer were also seen in leukocytes of male and female rats. Increases in male rats were significant, but in females, observed levels of DNA damage did not correlate with dose. Therefore, the results were judged to be positive in males and equivocal in females. In addition to the positive comet assay results, significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated reticulocytes were observed in peripheral blood of male and female juvenile rats dosed with SAN Trimer. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year feed study preceded by perinatal exposure, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of SAN Trimer in male and female F344/N rats given feed containing 400, 800, or 1,600 ppm SAN Trimer. Exposure to SAN Trimer resulted in increased incidences and/or severities of peripheral nerve degeneration in male and female F344/N rats, increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the bone marrow and liver in male and female F344/N rats, and of nonneoplastic urinary bladder lesions in female F344/N rats. The incidences of pituitary gland adenoma and mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female F344/N rats and mammary gland fibroadenoma in female F344/N rats were decreased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,['National Toxicology Program'],,,"['Chhabra RS', 'Behl M', 'Elmore SA', 'Bishop JB', 'Collins BJ', 'Foster PM', 'Herbert RA', 'Hooth MJ', 'King-Herbert AP', 'Kissling GE', 'Malarkey DE', 'Roycroft JH', 'Smith CS', 'Stout MD', 'Travlos GS', 'Walker NJ', 'Witt KL', 'Alred M', 'Blumenstock J', 'Canter D', 'Chapin RE', 'Chhabra RS', 'Chiasson B', 'Collins BJ', 'Draves MF', 'Fagliano J', 'Gargas M', 'Gorin J', 'Gowers J', 'Holler J', 'Jones S', 'Ledoux T', 'Leung HW', 'Lijinsky W', 'Mignone T', 'Molholt B', 'Olsen M', 'Post G', 'Reyes J', 'Rouse R', 'Rowland C', 'Susten A', 'Tapp M', 'van Birgelen AP', 'Wilger C', 'Hejtmancik MR', 'Vasconcelos DY', 'Hamlin MH 2nd', 'Brix AE', 'Morrison JP', 'Brix AE', 'Elmore SA', 'Flake GP', 'Garman R', 'Herbert RA', 'Hoenerhoff MJ', 'Hurley R', 'Lanning L', 'Little P', 'Malarkey DE', 'Nyska A', 'Wolfe GW', 'Atkinson B', 'Wang Y', 'Brecher S', 'Iyer S', 'Tharakan VS', 'Crockett PW', 'Betz LJ', 'McGowan KP', 'Gunnels SR', 'Hall BF', 'Harper LM', 'Serbus DC']","['Chhabra, R S', 'Behl, M', 'Elmore, S A', 'Bishop, J B', 'Collins, B J', 'Foster, P M', 'Herbert, R A', 'Hooth, M J', 'King-Herbert, A P', 'Kissling, G E', 'Malarkey, D E', 'Roycroft, J H', 'Smith, C S', 'Stout, M D', 'Travlos, G S', 'Walker, N J', 'Witt, K L', 'Alred, M', 'Blumenstock, J', 'Canter, D', 'Chapin, R E', 'Chhabra, R S', 'Chiasson, B', 'Collins, B J', 'Draves, M F', 'Fagliano, J', 'Gargas, M', 'Gorin, J', 'Gowers, J', 'Holler, J', 'Jones, S', 'Ledoux, T', 'Leung, H W', 'Lijinsky, W', 'Mignone, T', 'Molholt, B', 'Olsen, M', 'Post, G', 'Reyes, J', 'Rouse, R', 'Rowland, C', 'Susten, A', 'Tapp, M', 'van Birgelen, A P J M', 'Wilger, C', 'Hejtmancik, M R', 'Vasconcelos, D Y', 'Hamlin, M H 2nd', 'Brix, A E', 'Morrison, J P', 'Brix, A E', 'Elmore, S A', 'Flake, G P', 'Garman, R', 'Herbert, R A', 'Hoenerhoff, M J', 'Hurley, R', 'Lanning, L', 'Little, P', 'Malarkey, D E', 'Nyska, A', 'Wolfe, G W', 'Atkinson, B', 'Wang, Y', 'Brecher, S', 'Iyer, S', 'Tharakan, V S', 'Crockett, P W', 'Betz, L J', 'McGowan, K P', 'Gunnels, S R', 'Hall, B F', 'Harper, L M', 'Serbus, D C']",,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 26.,"Cytogenetic abnormalities are important diagnostic and prognostic criteria for hematologic malignancies. Karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are the conventional methods by which these abnormalities are detected. The sensitivity of these microscopy-based methods is limited by the abundance of the abnormal cells in the samples and therefore these analyses are commonly not applicable to minimal residual disease (MRD) stages. A flow cytometry-based imaging approach was developed to detect chromosomal abnormalities following FISH in suspension (FISH-IS), which enables the automated analysis of several log-magnitude higher number of cells compared with the microscopy-based approaches. This study demonstrates the applicability of FISH-IS for detecting numerical chromosome aberrations, establishes accuracy, and sensitivity of detection compared with conventional FISH, and feasibility to study procured clinical samples of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Male and female healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells hybridized with combinations of chromosome enumeration probes (CEP) 8, X, and Y served as models for disomy, monosomy, and trisomy. The sensitivity of detection of monosomies and trisomies amongst 20,000 analyzed cells was determined to be 1% with a high level of precision. A high correlation (R(2) = 0.99) with conventional FISH analysis was found based on the parallel analysis of diagnostic samples procured from 10 AML patients with trisomy 8 (+8). Additionally, FISH-IS analysis of samples procured at the time of clinical remission demonstrated the presence of residual +8 cells indicating that this approach may be used to detect MRD and associated chromosomal defects.","['Flow and Image Cytometry Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA. hans.minderman@roswellpark.org']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.'],"['S10 RR022335/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '4R33CA126667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1S10RR022335-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA126667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS667497'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the development of culture conditions that can be used to generate functional cardiomyocytes to form cardiac tissue may be of great interest. In this study, isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured with several culture conditions in vitro and characterized for cell proliferation, myofibril organization, and cardiac functionality by assessing cell morphology, immunocytochemical staining, and time-lapse confocal scanning microscopy. When cardiomyocytes were cultured in liver cell line derived conditioned medium without exogenous growth factors and cytokines, the cell proliferation increased, cell morphology was highly elongated, and subsequent myofibril organization was highly developed. These developed myofibril organization also showed high level of contractibility and synchronization, representing high functionality of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, many of the known factors in hepatic conditioned medium, such as insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), did not show similar effects as the hepatic conditioned medium, suggesting the possibility of synergistic activity of the several soluble factors or the presence of unknown factors in hepatic conditioned medium. Finally, we demonstrated that our culture system could provide a potentially powerful tool for in vitro cardiac tissue organization and cardiac function study.","[""Center for Biomedical Engineering, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.""]",,,"['EB007249/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'HL092836/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE019024/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'RL1 DE019024/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 EB007249/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL092836/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past decade, deregulation of miRNAs (by expression and/or function) has been associated with the pathogenesis, progression and prognosis of different diseases, including leukemia. The number of discovered genes encoding miRNAs has risen exponentially in this period, but the numbers of miRNA-target genes discovered and validated lag far behind. Scientists have gained more in-depth knowledge of the basic mechanism of action of miRNAs, but the main challenge still remaining is the identification of direct targets of these important 'micro-players', to understand how they fine-tune so many biological processes in both healthy and diseased tissue. Many technologies have been developed in the past few years, some with more potential than others, but all with their own pros and cons. Here, we review the most common and most potent computational and experimental approaches for miRNA-target gene discovery and discuss how the hunting of targets is challenging but possible by taking the experimental limitations in consideration and choosing the correct cellular context for identifying relevant target genes.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Limbal niche cells were isolated from the limbal stroma by collagenase alone or following dispase removal of the limbal epithelium (D/C), and cultured on plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), or coated or three-dimensional Matrigel in embryonic stem cell medium with leukemia inhibitory factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Expression of cell markers, colony-forming units-fibroblast, tri-lineage differentiation, and ability of supporting limbal epithelial stem/progenitor cells were compared to limbal residual stromal cells. RESULTS: Stromal cells expressing angiogenesis markers were found perivascularly, subjacent to limbal basal epithelial cells, and in D/C and limbal residual stromal cells. When seeded in three-dimensional Matrigel, D/C but not limbal residual stromal cells yielded spheres of angiogenesis progenitors that stabilized vascular networks. Similar to collagenase-isolated cells, D/C cells could be expanded on coated Matrigel for more than 12 passages, yielding spindle cells expressing angiogenesis and mesenchymal stem cells markers, and possessing significantly higher colony-forming units-fibroblast and more efficient tri-lineage differentiation than D/C and limbal residual stromal cells expanded on plastic in DMEM with 10% FBS, of which both lost the pericyte phenotype while limbal residual stromal cells turned into myofibroblasts. Upon reunion with limbal epithelial stem/progenitor cells to form spheres, D/C cells expanded on coated Matrigel maintained higher expression of p63alpha and lower expression of cytokeratin 12 than those expanded on plastic in DMEM with 10% FBS, while spheres formed with human corneal fibroblasts expressed cytokeratin 12 without p63alpha. CONCLUSIONS: In the limbal stroma, cells subjacent to limbal basal epithelial cells serve as niche cells, and generate progenitors with angiogenesis and mesenchymal stem cells potentials. They might partake in angiogenesis and regeneration during corneal wound healing.","[""Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",,,"['R01 EY006819/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY06819/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its expression was observed in hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells, erythropoietic, myeloid and lymphoblastic lineages cell lines and in human leukemic blast cells in lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The studies on human bone marrow cells show that JAK/STAT pathway plays a substantial role in signal transduction in young bone marrow cells. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between leptin receptor expression and the proliferation of neoplastic hematopoietic cells in bone marrow. The study was performed in a total of 57 children of both sexes aged 3 months to 16 years. A group of 46 patients with acute leukemia involved 25 children with ALLB, 11 children with ALLT and 10 children with ANNL. The control group consisted of 11 non-obese children with non-malignant hematological disturbances. The tests were performed on bone marrow samples. The assessments of membrane expression of Ob-R and the antigens determining the phenotype of bone marrow cells were performed using a flow cytometry method. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a significant decrease of Ob-R expression on leukemic blasts was observed in comparison with respective populations of normal bone marrow cells. Also in progenitor cells populations a significant decrease of CD34+Ob-R+w ALLT and ALLB was observed in comparison with the cells from normal bone marrow.

Epub 2012 Jul 26.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between childhood infections and childhood leukaemia have produced inconsistent results, likely due to the recall error/bias of infection data reported by the parents. The current study used a population-based and record-based case-control design to evaluate the association between childhood leukaemia and infections using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. METHODS: In all, 846 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 193 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2008, aged >1 and <10 years, were included. Up to four controls (3374 for ALL and 766 for AML) individually matched to each case on sex, birth date and time of diagnosis (reference date for the controls) were identified. Conditional logistic regression was performed to assess the association between childhood leukaemia and infections. RESULTS: Having any infection before 1 year of age was associated with an increased risk for both childhood ALL (odds ratio = 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.2-4.7) and AML (odds ratio = 6.0, 95% confidence interval 2.0-17.8), with a stronger risk associated with more episodes of infections. Similar results were observed for infections occurring >1 year before the cases' diagnosis of childhood leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Children with leukaemia may have a dysregulated immune function present at an early age, resulting in more episodes of symptomatic infections compared with healthy controls. However, confounding by other infectious measures such as birth order and day care attendance could not be ruled out. Finally, the results are only relevant to the medically diagnosed infections.","['National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC. jeffreychang@nhri.org.tw']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice lacking Klf1 die in utero prior to E15 from severe anemia due to the inadequate expression of genes controlling hemoglobin production, cell membrane and cytoskeletal integrity, and the cell cycle. We have recently described the full repertoire of KLF1 binding sites in vivo by performing KLF1 ChIP-seq in primary erythroid tissue (E14.5 fetal liver). Here we describe the KLF1-dependent erythroid transcriptome by comparing mRNA-seq from Klf1(+/+) and Klf1(-/-) erythroid tissue. This has revealed novel target genes not previously obtainable by traditional microarray technology, and provided novel insights into the function of KLF1 as a transcriptional activator. We define a cis-regulatory module bound by KLF1, GATA1, TAL1, and EP300 that coordinates a core set of erythroid genes. We also describe a novel set of erythroid-specific promoters that drive high-level expression of otherwise ubiquitously expressed genes in erythroid cells. Our study has identified two novel lncRNAs that are dynamically expressed during erythroid differentiation, and discovered a role for KLF1 in directing apoptotic gene expression to drive the terminal stages of erythroid maturation.","['Mater Medical Research Institute, Mater Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland 4101, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its host range and cytopathicity are due to a mutation, S82F, at a site critical for binding to the CAT-1 receptor. To identify residues that affect affinity for receptor variants, virus with S82F was passed in restrictive cells. The env genes of the adapted viruses contained 18 novel mutations, including one, E114G, present in 6 of 30 sequenced envs. MoMLV-E114G efficiently infected all mouse cells as well as ecotropic MLV resistant Chinese hamster cells. Virus with E114G and S82F induced large multinucleated syncytia in NIH 3T3 and SC-1 cells as well as M. dunni cells. Inoculation of Mo-S82F,E114G into mice produced lymphomas typical of MoMLV. Residues at env position 114 are thus important determinants of host range, and E114G suppresses host range restriction due to S82F, but does not affect S82F-governed cytopathicity.","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA. john.ferrarone@gmail.com']",,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],['ZIA AI000300-30/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS398578'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daily observations and the atmospheric concentrations of yellow sand (YS) aerosol have been increasing. In this study, YS samples collected from three sites of Japan during ADSE in 2009-2010 were used. The particles were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray fluorescence-energy dispersive spectrometer (XRF-EDS). We investigate ability of YS extract on enhancing the chemical mediator release and cytokine production from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. The dust particles at Fukuoka and Tsukuba were abundant in aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), potassium (K) and titan (Ti) than those at Naha. Concentration of the trace endotoxin and Cryptomeria japonica pollen allergen (Cry j 1) were measured in YS extract. After exposure of RBL-2H3 cells to YS extract, the beta-hexosaminidase (beta-hex) release, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production were enhanced in RBL-2H3 cells. This process depends on endotoxin, Cry j 1 and other allergen present in the YS extract. YS water extract also show a strong cytotoxic effect on the cells. This data suggest that low levels of endotoxin and Cry j 1 in YS may cause allergy during the ADSE.","['Alliance for Research on North Africa, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba City, Ibaraki 305-8572, Japan.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Gold(III) compounds constitute an emerging class of biologically active substances, of special interest as potential anticancer agents. In this work three gold(III) complexes of the fluoroquinolones antimicrobial agents norfloxacin (NOR), levofloxacin (LEVO) and sparfloxacin (SPAR) were prepared and characterized with physicochemical and spectroscopic techniques. In these complexes, NOR, LEVO and SPAR act as bidentate neutral ligands bound to gold(III) through the nitrogen atoms of the piperazine ring, which is an unusual mode of coordination for this class of compounds. Two chloride ions occupy the remaining coordination sites. The cytotoxic activity of the fluoroquinolones and their gold(III) complexes was tested against the A20 (murine lymphoma), B16-F10 (murine melanoma) and K562 (human myeloid leukemia) tumor cell lines as well as the L919 (murine lung fibroblasts) and MCR-5 (human lung fibroblasts) normal cells lines. All complexes were more active than their corresponding free ligands. Complex [AuCl(2)(LEVO)]Cl was selected for DNA fragmentation and cell cycle analysis. Spectroscopic titration with calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) showed that the complexes can bind weakly to CT DNA, probably by an external contact (electrostatic or groove binding). The complexes exhibit good binding propensity to bovine serum albumin (BSA) having relatively high binding constant values.","['Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Av.

Maintaining the preliminary progenitor phenotype and good proliferation capacity of EPCs is key to their use in treating cardiovascular ischemic diseases. However, transcriptional regulation in EPCs remains largely unknown. We investigated the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) combined with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on EPCs and the potential roles of Kruppel-like transcription factors (KLFs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Co-treatment with LIF and VEGF (100 ng/ml each) (V+L) could increase EPC colony-forming units and CD34 expression, which reflects the EPC progenitor phenotype and alleviated differentiation of EPCs. The effect was associated with Akt activation and increased expression of KLF4. Upregulation of KLF4 induced by V+L could be inhibited by transfection with dominant-negative Akt adenovirus. Furthermore, overexpression of KLF4 in EPCs enhanced the expression of CD34 and alleviated cell differentiation but did not increase the phosphorylation of Akt. CONCLUSIONS: LIF combined with VEGF can maintain the preliminary, progenitor phenotype of EPCs and alleviate cell differentiation by upregulating KLF4, which may provide new insights into transcriptional regulation in EPCs.","['Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191 China. lixiaoxia@bjmu.edu.cn']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 23.,"Flow cytometry is a powerful tool for quantitative biology because it can perform single-cell analysis of large cell populations using multiple parameters. Results are often visualized as a two-dimensional scatter or contour plot. Because these plots can be relatively diffuse, it is not always straightforward to discern a relationship between measured parameters. We have demonstrated that quantitative trends can be fit to the single-cell data generated from a heterogeneous population. We engineered Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells to express a broad range of oncogenic Ras levels. Instead of individual cultures with individual expression levels, a continuous range of levels was expressed by different cells in one heterogeneous culture. We then stained cells for downstream Erk phosphorylation to monitor MAPK signaling or employed an E2F-responsive genetic reporter to monitor cell-cycle activity. Subsequent analysis by flow cytometry and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) revealed that increasing Ras oncogene expression led to increasing MAPK signaling. In contrast, E2F activity peaked at an optimal, intermediate level of Ras.

Guidelines for staging, treatment and follow-up are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To better define staging procedures, treatment results and clinical course in adult patients with LCH first presenting in the skin. METHODS: Eighteen adult patients with LCH first presenting in the skin were collected from five centres collaborating in the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group. Clinical records and (skin) biopsy specimens were reviewed and follow-up data were obtained. A literature search on adult patients with LCH presenting in the skin was performed. RESULTS: Staging procedures showed extracutaneous disease in three of 16 patients who were adequately staged. One patient had a histologically confirmed lytic LCH bone lesion, while two patients had a myelodysplastic syndrome. During follow-up two of 18 patients developed extracutaneous localizations of LCH. Five patients developed a second haematological malignancy, including (myelo)monocytic leukaemia (two cases), histiocytic sarcoma (one case), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (one case) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (one case). Review of the literature revealed six other adult patients with a second haematological malignancy preceding or following a diagnosis of LCH. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest an increased risk of a second haematological malignancy in adult patients with LCH presenting in the skin. Extensive staging at presentation and long-term follow-up are therefore warranted in such patients.","['Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",,['(c) 2012 The Authors.

Because cyclophosphamide is highly active in BL and can be dose-escalated without stem-cell rescue, we designed a short, cyclophosphamide-intensive regimen without anthracyclines for patients aged >/= 30 with untreated, non-HIV-associated BL/atypical BL. Two cycles involving cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m(2), vincristine, rituximab, prednisone, methotrexate 3 g/m(2), and intrathecal cytarabine were delivered 2 weeks apart, followed by intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day for 4 days) and rituximab. Of 21 patients, median age 53 (range, 34-75), 71% had stage IV, 95% were high-risk and 29% had performance status 3-4. Response occurred in all evaluable patients post-cycle 2 and in 76% post-intensification. Five non-relapse deaths occurred (four before intensification). The estimated 1-year and 3-year event-free survival was 52%; 1-year and 3-year overall survival was 57%. Seventeen (81%) received intensification (median 30 days to intensification).

Cancer risk increases with age, but associations of ESRD with specific malignancies are incompletely studied for older individuals. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study (1,029,695 cancer and 99,610 controls) among the U.S. elderly using SEER-Medicare linked data. We defined ESRD as presence of dialysis claims in the 3 months prior to selection. RESULTS: Although ESRD was not associated with excess cancer risk overall (odds ratio 1.02; 95%CI 0.91-1.14), risk was specifically increased for cancers of the stomach (1.45; 1.16-1.81), small intestine (1.92; 1.27-2.92), colon (1.17; 1.00-1.36), liver (1.53; 1.16-2.01), biliary tract (1.78; 1.20-2.65), lung (1.17; 1.02-1.34), cervix (2.12; 1.39-3.23), kidney (2.42; 2.01-2.92), and for multiple myeloma (1.77; 1.40-2.24) and chronic myeloid leukemia (1.74; 1.08-2.80). The association between liver cancer and ESRD was attenuated upon adjustment for hepatitis B and C infection or diabetes mellitus. Multiple myeloma risk was highest with short ESRD duration (p < 0.0001), possibly reflecting reverse causality, while kidney cancer risk showed a borderline rise over time (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly individuals with ESRD, the excess risks for some cancers may reflect immune dysfunction or a high prevalence of other risk factors, such as viral infections or diabetes mellitus. Our results underscore the need for studying biological pathways of carcinogenesis in ESRD.","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD, USA. fatma.shebl@yale.edu']",,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tribbles-1 is a homolog protein of the Drosophila Tribbles. In Drosophila, the Tribbles protein is involved in the cell-cycle progression during mitosis and in mammals initial data showed TRIB1 to be involved in cell proliferation. In mammals, TRIB1 lacks a catalytic domain and thus acts as an adaptor protein by interacting with several partners. The activity of TRIB1 seems to be very specific to the environment and the cells type in which it is expressed, and a role for this molecule has been mainly described in several pathological states including various cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia and ovarian cancer. Further evidence has also linked TRIB1 to the control of plasmalipid homeostasis thus indicating the role of this molecule as a risk factor for myocardial infarction. Finally, TRIB1 is shown to be up-regulated during inflammatory events such as chronic inflammation of atherosclerotic arteries or chronic antibody-mediated rejection of transplanted organs. Here we provide a review of the current state of the scientific literature for TRIB1, highlighting its role in diverse pathologies and inflammatory states. A better understanding of the role of this protein as both a target as well as a biological marker in diseases should drive the development of new therapeutic strategies.","['UMR643, INSERM, Nantes 44000, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involvement of interferon-alpha and cycloferon in apoptosis regulation of hypothalamic neurons of mice during stress and aging was studied. We determined the expression of apoptosis markers (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax) in comparison with apoptosis level. We have found that immune modulators suppress activity of nonapeptidergic neurons. Thus, interferon-alpha treatment reduces synthesis of Bcl-2; cycloferon treatment inhibits expression of Bax and Bcl-2. So the role of immune modulators in neuron apoptosis depends on the stage of ontogenesis and type of immune modulator. Cycloferon is able to reduce the level of age-dependent apoptosis of neurons in aging, but under stress condition both interferon-alpha and cycloferon act as protectors of cell death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The elements of the networks are signaling proteins synthesized in hypoxic microenvironment such as the vascular endothelial growth factor, HIF-1alpha, hepatocyte growth factor, and molecules nitric oxide and H(2)O(2). The signals from upstream or rebound downstream pathways are amplified by the short or wide positive feedback loops, hyperstimulating AKT-inducing cancer extreme robustness. Targeting the phosphorylated AKT locus by an oxidant/antioxidant modulation induces collapse of positive feedback loops and establishment of negative feedback loops leading to stability of the system and disappearance of cancer extreme robustness.

Epub 2012 Jul 26.,"Disseminated neoplasia (DN), an oyster disease resembling leukaemia, has been reported in a number of species of marine bivalve molluscs. The disease is characterised by a proliferation of abnormal circulating cells of unknown origin resulting in the invasion of tissues and organs, frequently with a fatal end of the affected individuals. To obtain a more comprehensive view of bivalve cancer processes, suppressive subtracted hybridisation (SSH) and quantitative RT-PCR (q-PCR) approaches were combined to investigate changes in the transcriptome of Ostrea edulis haemolymph cells associated to DN. Two SSH libraries were constructed and 587 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced, obtaining 329 ESTs which showed expression changes in neoplastic process. Transcription expression analyses (q-PCR) were done for a total of 24 genes that could be relevant in neoplastic process, including genes with role in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis or chromosomal defects. Most of those genes had not been reported in association with cancer in non-vertebrate organisms. The over-expression and under-expression of some of those genes in DN-affected oysters was in agreement with observations in vertebrate cancer. The results herein reported contribute to cancer understanding in bivalve molluscs.","['Centro de Investigacions Marinas, Conselleria do Medio Rural e do Mar, Xunta de Galicia, Aptdo 13, 36620 Vilanova de Arousa, Spain. lmartin@cimacoron.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 26.,"This review is designed to provide an overview of the current literature concerning vascular endothelial growth factor signaling (VEGF) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant VEGF signaling operates in the bone marrow of AML patients and is related to a poor prognosis. The altered signaling pathway demonstrated to interfere in several autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways. VEGF signaling promotes autocrine AML blast cell proliferation, survival, and chemotherapy resistance. In addition, VEGF signaling can mediate paracrine vascular endothelial cell-controlled angiogenesis in AML. Both effects presumably explain the association of high VEGF levels and poor therapeutic outcome. More recently, researches focusing on bone marrow stem cell niches demonstrate a role for VEGF signaling in the preservation of several cell types within these niches. The bone marrow niches are proposed to be a protective microenvironment for AML cells that could be responsible for relapses in AML patients. This implies the need of sophisticated VEGF-targeted therapeutics in AML therapy strategies. This review highlights our current understanding of aberrant VEGF signaling in AML, appoints the interference of VEGF signaling in the AML-associated microenvironment, and reflects the novelty of current VEGF-targeted therapeutics used in clinical trails for the treatment of AML.","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB, Groningen, The Netherlands. k.r.kampen@umcg.nl""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 26.,"PURPOSE: In our previous publication, we have shown that dihydroartemisinin could significantly inhibit the growth of CML K562 cells by its anti-proliferative and inducing apoptotic effects. Given the pivotal effect of Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase and its downstream signal factors on CML cell proliferation and survival, we extend our study to investigate the effect of DHA on Bcr/Abl and related signal factors to further illuminate the possible mechanisms of the effect of DHA on CML cells. METHODS: The expression of Bcr/Abl was analyzed with PCR and Western blotting methods at both mRNA and protein levels. Measurement of protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation activity of Bcr/Abl, AKT, ERK1/2, NF-kappaB and cytochrome c were performed with Western blotting and immunoprecipitation methods. Using the activity kits analyzed the activity of caspase 9 and caspase 3. RESULTS: The treatment with DHA results in a significant suppression on Bcr/Abl expression and leads to a concentration-dependent reduction on the Bcr/Abl tyrosine activity. Moreover, it also results in a strong influence on the downstream signal factors of Bcr/Abl, which includes inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of AKT and ERK1/2, suppression of NF-kappaB protein expression, promotion of the cytochrome c release and the consequential activation of caspase 3/9 in CML K562 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together with our previous report, our data show that the growth inhibitory effect of DHA on CML cells might be due to the influence on Bcr/Abl expression and its downstream signal factors. DHA might be a potential novel anti-CML drug candidate and worthy of further study.","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. junleepost@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not known whether activation and/or repression of specific genes by Oct4 is relevant to these functions. Here, we show that fusion proteins containing the coding sequence of Oct4 or Xlpou91 (the Xenopus homolog of Oct4) fused to activating regions, but not those fused to repressing regions, behave as Oct4, suppressing differentiation and promoting maintenance of undifferentiated phenotypes in vivo and in vitro. An Oct4 activation domain fusion supported embryonic stem cell self-renewal in vitro at lower concentrations than that required for Oct4 while alleviating the ordinary requirement for the cytokine LIF. At still lower levels of the fusion, LIF dependence was restored. We conclude that the necessary and sufficient function of Oct4 in promoting pluripotency is to activate specific target genes.","['MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine - Institute for Stem Cell Research, School of Biological Sciences, 5 Little France Drive, University of Edinburgh, EH16 4UU Edinburgh, UK.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 The Authors.

Comparison of the genome from K562 cells and normal human genome has been very useful strategy, in uncovering eight genes, implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These genes carry mutations in K562 genome and the role of these mutations in the progression and treatment of AML is still not known. Consequences of these mutations on drug DNA binding are also not known exactly. In the present study, mutation induced structural changes in K562 genome, compared to normal genome, are identified by Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. These structural changes in native K562 DNA favor stronger binding with binding constants 2.0 x 10(8) and 1.9 x 10(9) M(-)(1) with antileukemic drugs adriamycin and daunomycin (DNM), respectively, compared to normal DNA. On binding, these drugs disrupt the native B form structure of normal DNA to a greater extent, compared to A-like structure of K562 DNA. Fluorescence and absorption studies reveal higher intercalation as well as mixed groove binding of these drugs with K562 DNA compared to normal DNA. Among the drugs, DNM has higher affinity for K562 DNA.","['School of Biotechnology and Biological Sciences, West Bengal University of Technology, BF-142, Sector I, Salt Lake, 700 064 Kolkata, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the unusual microscopic pattern of a granuloma annulare (GA)-like eruption co-existing with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). METHODS: We reviewed the histopathology and immunophenotype of skin biopsies from two patients with B-CLL and cutaneous lesions resembling GA. RESULTS: Both patients had symptomatic cutaneous lesions clinically resembling GA; one had lesions refractory to standard dermatologic therapy. Histopathology showed GA-like palisaded histiocytic infiltration, with subtle collections of lymphocytes interspersed among the granulomatous inflammation. Immunohistochemistry showed strong expression of CD20 and CD79a, with aberrant CD5 co-expression, confirming cutaneous involvement by B-CLL. CONCLUSIONS: Co-existence of a GA-like infiltrate and cutaneous B-CLL raises the possibility that granulomatous inflammation occurs as a secondary response to dermal infiltration by leukemic cells. Because histopathologic findings can be subtle, knowledge of this association is essential to avoid overlooking the diagnosis. Regardless of whether histopathology reflects a reactive or primary phenomenon, documentation of cutaneous involvement by B-CLL may serve as a rationale for specific treatment of the underlying B-CLL in patients with skin lesions unresponsive to dermatologic therapy and for whom there is no other justification for leukemia-targeted therapy.","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Sep 8.,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a death ligand with selective antitumor activity. However, many primary tumors are TRAIL resistant. Previous studies reported that roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, sensitized various solid cancer cells to TRAIL. We show that roscovitine and TRAIL demonstrate synergistic cytotoxicity in hematologic malignant cell lines and primary cells. Pretreatment of TRAIL-resistant leukemia cells with roscovitine induced enhanced cleavage of death-inducing signaling complex-bound proximal caspases after exposure to TRAIL. We observed increased levels of both pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins at the mitochondria following exposure to roscovitine. These results suggest that roscovitine induces priming of cancer cells for death by binding antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins to proapoptotic BH3-only proteins at the mitochondria, thereby decreasing the threshold for diverse proapoptotic stimuli. We propose that the mitochondrial priming and enhanced processing of apical caspases represent major molecular mechanisms of roscovitine-induced sensitization to TRAIL in leukemia/lymphoma cells.","['Institute of Pathological Physiology, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 26.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of malnutrition on oxidative burst functions (OBF) of neutrophils in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with ALL and thirty healthy controls were enrolled to the study. Thirteen patients with ALL were found to have malnutrition. While neutrophil OBF of ALL patients without malnutrition were studied both before induction chemotherapy and 3 months after, the same functions in ALL patients with malnutrition were studied both before induction chemotherapy and when the nutritional status improved. Control group were studied at admission and 3 months later. RESULTS: The OBF of ALL patients with and without malnutrition before induction chemotherapy were found to be significantly lower than the control group (P = 0.009), whereas the OBF were found to be similar in both patient groups with ALL (P = 0.27). The median infection episode rate and the duration of antibiotics therapy during the study period were similar in both patient groups with ALL. The repeated OBF of both patient groups with ALL were shown to increase to similar values with the control group in the third month of chemotherapy (P = 0.002). The median infection episode rate during the first month of chemotherapy was shown to decrease significantly during the third month of chemotherapy in both patient with ALL groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We have not been able to demonstrate an overt effect of malnutrition on OBF. However, our results still need to be verified via further larger scaled studies of OBF in leukemic children with and without malnutrition.","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Bezmialem Vakif University Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Clinics, Bakirkoy Government Maternity and Children Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Clinics, Goztepe Government Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Acibadem University Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Internal Medicine Hematology-Immunology Department, Marmara University Medical Center, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Internal Medicine Hematology-Immunology Department, Marmara University Medical Center, Istanbul, Turkey.', ""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ, USA.""]",,['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'malnutrition', 'oxidative burst']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients present with various cytopenias including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, there is an association of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia with rheumatoid arthritis. It is believed that LGL leukemia begins as an antigen-driven immune response with subsequent constitutive activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes or natural killer cells through PDGF and IL-15 contributing to their survival. Consequently, this leads to a dysregulation of apoptosis and dysfunction of the activation-induced cell death pathway. Treatment of LGL leukemia is based on a low-dose immunosuppressive regimen using methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. However, no standard of therapy has been established, as large prospective trials have not been conducted. In addition, some patients are refractory to treatment. The lack of a curative therapy for LGL leukemia means that new treatment options are needed. Insight into the various dysregulated signaling pathways in LGL leukemia may provide novel therapeutic treatment modalities.","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Experimental Therapeutics, Room 4427, 500 University Drive, PO Box 850, Hershey, PA 17033-0850, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA098472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS406046'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The attractiveness of PKs and LKs as drug able targets is enhanced by the fact that they are enzymes whose biological activity can be turned off by drugs that block their catalytic site. In the last few years small molecular kinase inhibitors (KIs) have been synthesized and become available for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The first KI, introduced into clinical practice in 1998, was imatinib mesylate, which became the first choice drug in chronic myeloid leukemia. More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263). These agents are currently evaluated in early clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other diseases. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors, flavopiridol (alvocidib), BMS-387032 (SNS-032), sunitinib and sorafenib are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory CLL. Multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors including vandetanib (ZD6474) bosutinib (SKI-606), TKI258 (CHIR-258), pazopanib (GW786034) and axitinib (AG013736) have been also developed for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K ) are a family of lipid kinases that mediate signals from cell surface receptors. CAL-101 (GS-1101) is an oral PI3Kdelta-specific inhibitor which has shown preclinical and clinical activity against CLL. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and toxicity of PK and LK inhibitors in CLL.","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It showed high in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities against murine leukemia P338 and colon adenocarcinoma 38. Mechanism of action of BAT is still not completely clear. It was reported, that BAT is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and induces unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in non-proliferating cells. Low solubility of BAT in water, high toxicity and necessity of high drug dosing are major limitations of its use as a chemotherapeutic drug. As a result, new BAT analogs were synthesized to improve its pharmacological properties. The modifications of BAT chemical structure include various substituents introduced to isoindoloquinazoline moiety (Cl, Br, NO(2), CH(2), NH(2), Me, CO(2)Me, OMe). It has been shown that the desamino derivative and the 8-aza analog of BAT retained the ability to inhibit topoisomerase II but did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis. While less active than BAT, these analogs were cytotoxic toward CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. The isoindolo [2,1-a]benzimidazole derivatives were inactive as topoisomerase II inhibitors and, in general, failed to exhibit comparable antitumor activity or to induce unscheduled DNA synthesis. Batracylin was acylated with aminoacids, dipeptides, tripeptides to increase its solubility in water. Other modifications include introduction of nitrogen atom to ring A or D, extension of polycyclic ring 4, reduction of ring B from six- to five-membered one, and obtaining of benzimidazole, indole or derivatives containing a fucose ring. A series of novel BAT analogs bearing sugar residues and thiocarbonyl aminoacids, which provided better solubility in water and high cytostatic activity have been designed. Also, new azabatracylines, where aniline ring was replaced by pyridine or other substituted quinazolines, have been obtained. This paper reviews the most important approaches in batracylin synthesis and its analogs and presents structure-reactivity relationships for these compounds.","['Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Organic Chemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Narutowicza St 11/12, PL 80-233 Gdansk, Poland. krydzier@pg.gda.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that the transcription factors HoxA9, Meis1, Pbx1 and Pbx2 bind in vivo to the c-myb locus and maintain its expression through different mechanisms in HPCs and leukemic cells. Our analysis also points to a critical role for Pbx2 in deregulating c-myb expression in murine myeloid cells cotransformed by the cooperative activity of HoxA9 and Meis1.

In this study, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the promotion of survival and chemoresistance of human CLL cells in coculture with human BM-mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) of both autologous and allogeneic origin. The presence of BM-MSCs rescued CLL cells from apoptosis both spontaneously and following induction with various drugs, including Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Bendamustine, Prednisone and Hydrocortisone. The treatment with a combination of anti-Notch-1, Notch-2 and Notch-4 antibodies or gamma-secretase inhibitor XII (GSI XII) reverted this protective effect by day 3, even in presence of the above-mentioned drugs. Overall, our findings show that stromal cell-mediated Notch-1, Notch-2 and Notch-4 signaling has a role in CLL survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, its blocking could be an additional tool to overcome drug resistance and improve the therapeutic strategies for CLL.","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Notch signaling', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'hBM-MSCs', 'human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these, the best known is p(c-Mybex9b), which contains 121 additional amino acids between exon 9 and 10, in a domain involved in protein-protein interactions and negative regulation. In hematopoietic cells, expression of p(c-Mybex9b) accounts for 10-15% of total c-Myb; these levels may be biologically relevant because modest changes in c-Myb expression affects proliferation and survival of leukemic cells and lineage choice and frequency of normal hematopoietic progenitors. In this study, we assessed biochemical activities of p(c-Mybex9b) and the consequences of perturbing its expression in K562 and primary chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitor cells. Compared with p75(c-Myb), p(c-Mybex9b) is more stable and more effective in transactivating Myb-regulated promoters. Ectopic expression of p(c-Mybex9b) enhanced proliferation and colony formation and reduced imatinib (IM) sensitivity of K562 cells; conversely, specific downregulation of p(c-Mybex9b) reduced proliferation and colony formation, enhanced IM sensitivity of K562 cells and markedly suppressed colony formation of CML CD34(+) cells, without affecting the levels of p75(c-Myb).

Inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), JAK2 and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been tested in clinical studies, but showed only moderate single-agent activity. High efficacy of the HDACi pracinostat treating AML and synergy with the JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib is demonstrated. Both compounds inhibit JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling in AML cells with JAK2(V617F) mutations, but also diminish FLT3 signaling, particularly in FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) cell lines. In vitro, this combination led to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The synergy translated in vivo in two different AML models, the SET-2 megakaryoblastic AML mouse model carrying a JAK2(V617F) mutation, and the MOLM-13 model of FLT3-ITD-driven AML. Pracinostat and pacritinib in combination showed synergy on tumor growth, reduction of metastases and synergistically decreased JAK2 or FLT signaling, depending on the cellular context. In addition, several plasma cytokines/growth factors/chemokines triggered by the tumor growth were normalized, providing a rationale for combination therapy with an HDACi and a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of AML patients, particularly those with FLT3 or JAK2 mutations.","['Department of Biology, S*BIO Pte.

We used menadione and hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress and two flavonoids, quercetin, and epigallocatechin gallate, applied alone or in combination with menadione or H(2)O(2). 62 MeV proton beams were used to irradiate cells under a uniform dose of 2 or 10 Gy, respectively. We assessed apoptosis, cell cycle distributions, and DL. Menadione, H(2)O(2) and quercetin were potent inducers of apoptosis and DL inhibitors. Quercetin decreased clonogenic survival and the NAD(P)H level in a dose-dependent manner. Proton irradiation with 2 Gy but not 10 Gy increased the apoptotic rate. However, both doses induced a substantial G(2)/M arrest. Quercetin reduced apoptosis and prolonged the G(2)/M arrest induced by radiation. DL spectroscopy indicated that proton irradiation disrupted the electron flow within Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus explaining the massive necrosis induced by 10 Gy of protons and also suggested an equivalent action of menadione and quercetin at the level of the Fe/S center N2, which may be mediated by their binding to a common site within Complex I, probably the rotenone-binding site.","['Department of Biophysics, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania. baran@ifin.nipne.ro']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 19.,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines with little or no effect on normal cells. However, its effect is limited as some cancers including pancreatic cancer show de novo resistance to TRAIL induced apoptosis. In this study we report that GSK-3 inhibition using the pharmacologic agent AR-18, enhanced TRAIL sensitivity in a range of pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines. This sensitization was found to be caspase-dependent, and both pharmacological and genetic knock-down of GSK-3 isoforms resulted in apoptotic features as shown by cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and disturbance of mitochondrial membrane potential point to a mitochondrial amplification loop for TRAIL-induced apoptosis after GSK-3 inhibition. Consistent with this, overexpression of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial targets such as Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 rescued PANC-1 and PPC-1 cells from TRAIL sensitization. However, overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA also inhibited the sensitizing effects of GSK-3 inhibitor, suggesting an additional role for GSK-3 that inhibits death receptor signaling. Acute treatment of mice bearing PANC-1 xenografts with a combination of AR-18 and TRAIL also resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, as measured by caspase-3 cleavage. Sensitization to TRAIL occurred despite an increase in beta-catenin due to GSK-3 inhibition, suggesting that the approach might be effective even in cancers with dysregulated beta-catenin. These results suggest that GSK-3 inhibitors might be effectively combined with TRAIL for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","['Division of Applied Molecular Oncology, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, zebrafish are small in size, optically clear during development, and amenable to genetic manipulation.

IR is also a potential source of DNA damage. High LET IR produces structurally different forms of DNA damage and has emerged as potential treatment of metastatic and hematopoietic malignancies. Therefore, understanding mechanisms of resistance is valuable. We created stable myeloid leukemia HL60 cell clones radioresistant to either gamma-rays or alpha-particles to understand possible mechanisms in radioresistance. Cross-resistance to each type of IR was observed, but resistance to clustered, complex alpha-particle damage was substantially lower than to equivalent doses of gamma-rays. The resistant phenotype was driven by changes in: apoptosis; late G2/M checkpoint accumulation that was indicative of increased genomic instability; stronger dependence on homology-directed repair; and more robust repair of DNA double-strand breaks and sublethal-type damage induced by gamma-rays, but not by alpha-particles. The more potent cytotoxicity of alpha-particles warrants their continued investigation as therapies for leukemia and other cancers.","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",,,"['P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM073546/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 24.,"Oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor are pleiotropic cytokines that belong to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family. These cytokines play a crucial role in diverse biological events like inflammation, neuroprotection, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and development. The family is grouped together based on structural similarities and their ability to activate the transmembrane receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130). The common structure among these cytokines defines the spacing and the orientation of binding sites for cell surface receptors. OSM is unique in this family as it can signal using heterodimers of gp130 with either leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) (type I) or oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) (type II). We have identified a unique helical loop on OSM between its B and C helices that is not found on other IL-6 family cytokines. This loop is located near the ""FXXK"" motif in active site III, which is essential for OSM's binding to both LIFR and OSMR. In this study, we show that the BC loop does not play a role in OSM's unique ability to bind OSMR. Shortening of the loop enhanced OSM's interaction with OSMR and LIFR as shown by kinetic and equilibrium binding analysis, suggesting the loop may hinder receptor interactions. As a consequence of improved binding, these structurally modified OSMs exhibited enhanced biological activity, including suppressed proliferation of A375 melanoma cells.","['Department of Bioengineering, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma 73019, USA.']",,,"['P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY021721/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY016459/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using quantitative real-time PCR, the expression levels of a subset of intragenic miRNAs and their host genes were examined in diverse myeloid leukemia cell lines, and their regulation in response to pharmacological stimuli was also evaluated. Expression of miR-22 strongly correlated with both myeloid leukemia subtypes and the expression of its host gene C17orf91 (p < 0.05). The latter was absent in hematopoietic progenitors but abundant in erythroid and monocytic lineages.

Therefore, in an attempt to investigate the complex landscape of mutations, changes in expression profiles and alternative splicing (AS) events that can be observed in such disease, the leukemia transcriptome of a BCR-ABL1-positive ALL patient at diagnosis and at relapse was sequenced using a whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) approach. A total of 13.9 and 15.8 million sequence reads was generated from de novo and relapsed samples, respectively, and aligned to the human genome reference sequence. This led to the identification of five validated missense mutations in genes involved in metabolic processes (DPEP1, TMEM46), transport (MVP), cell cycle regulation (ABL1) and catalytic activity (CTSZ), two of which resulted in acquired relapse variants. In all, 6390 and 4671 putative AS events were also detected, as well as expression levels for 18 315 and 18 795 genes, 28% of which were differentially expressed in the two disease phases.

To a major part this is attributed to drug resistance of FLT3-ITD-positive leukemic cells. Against this background, we have devised an antibody array approach to identify proteins, which are differentially expressed by hematopoietic cells in relation to activated FLT3 signaling. Selective upregulation of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) was found in FLT3-ITD-positive cell lines and primary mononuclear cells from AML patients as compared with FLT3-wild-type controls. Upregulation of MCL-1 was dependent on FLT3 signaling as confirmed by its reversion upon pharmacological inhibition of FLT3 activity by the kinase inhibitor PKC412 as well as siRNA-mediated suppression of FLT3. Heterologously expressed MCL-1 substituted for FLT3 signaling by conferring resistance of hematopoietic cells to antileukemia drugs such as cytarabine and daunorubicin, and to the proapoptotic BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Conversely, suppression of endogenous MCL-1 by siRNA or by flavopiridol treatment sensitized FLT3-ITD-expressing hematopoietic cells to cytotoxic and targeted therapeutics. In conclusion, MCL-1 is an essential effector of FLT3-ITD-mediated drug resistance. Therapeutic targeting of MCL-1 is a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As ETP-ALL represents a subgroup of early T-ALL we particularly focused on this cohort and identified 178 adult patients enrolled in the German Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Multicenter studies (05/93-07/03). Of these, 32% (57/178) were classified as ETP-ALL based on their characteristic immunophenotype.

The molecular characterization of adult ETP-ALL revealed distinct alterations with overexpression of stem cell-related genes (BAALC, IGFBP7, MN1, WT1). Interestingly, we found a low rate of NOTCH1 mutations and no FBXW7 mutations in adult ETP-ALL. In contrast, FLT3 mutations, rare in the overall cohort of T-ALL, were very frequent and nearly exclusively found in ETP-ALL characterized by a specific immunophenotype.

Recent studies by our group and others have demonstrated that Fli-1 plays a key role in tumorigenesis, and disrupting its oncogenic function may serve as a potential treatment option for malignancies associated with its overexpression. Herein, we describe the discovery of 30 anti-Fli-1 compounds, characterized into six functional groups. Treatment of murine and human leukemic cell lines with select compounds inhibits Fli-1 protein or mRNA expression, resulting in proliferation arrest and apoptosis. This anti-cancer effect was mediated, at least in part through direct inhibition of Fli-1 function, as anti-Fli-1 drug treatment inhibited Fli-1 DNA binding to target genes, such as SHIP-1 and gata-1, governing hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation. Furthermore, treatment with select Fli-1 inhibitors revealed a positive relationship between the loss of DNA-binding activity and Fli-1 phosphorylation. Accordingly, anti-Fli-1 drug treatment significantly inhibited leukemogenesis in a murine erythroleukemia model overexpressing Fli-1. This study demonstrates the ability of this drug-screening strategy to isolate effective anti-Fli-1 inhibitors and highlights their potential use for the treatment of malignancies overexpressing this oncogene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated calpain activity has been associated with many pathological states. Calpain inhibition can be protective or lethal depending on the context. Previous work has shown that c-myc transformation regulates calpain activity by suppressing calpastatin, the endogenous negative regulator of calpain. Here, we have investigated calpain activity in primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blast cells. Calpain activity was heterogeneous and greatly elevated over a wide range in AML blast cells, with no correlation to FAB classification. Activity was particularly elevated in the CD34+CD38- enriched fraction compared with the CD34+CD38+ fraction. Treatment of the cells with the specific calpain inhibitor, PD150606, induced significant apoptosis in AML blast cells but not in normal equivalent cells. Sensitivity to calpain inhibition correlated with calpain activity and preferentially targeted CD34+CD38- cells. There was no correlation between calpain activity and p-ERK levels, suggesting the ras pathway may not be a major contributor to calpain activity in AML. A significant negative correlation existed between calpain activity and calpastatin, suggesting calpastatin is the major regulator of activity in these cells. Analysis of previously published microarray data from a variety of AML patients demonstrated a significant negative correlation between calpastatin and c-myc expression. Patients who achieved a complete remission had significantly lower calpain activity than those who had no response to treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate elevated calpain activity in AML, anti-leukemic activity of calpain inhibition and prognostic potential of calpain activity measurement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate further purification of HSCs and for potential targetable differences between the very primitive normal and CML stem/PCs, we have phenotypically compared the normal and CML Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA- HSC/PC populations. The additional antigens analyzed were HLA-DR, the receptor tyrosine kinases c-kit and Tie2, the interleukin-3 cytokine receptor, CD33 and the activation antigen CD69, the latter of which was recently reported to be selectively elevated in cell lines expressing the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Notably, we found a strikingly low percentage of cells from the HSC/PC sub-population isolated from CML patients that were found to express the c-kit receptor (<1%) compared with the percentages of HSC/PCs expressing the c-kitR isolated from umbilical cord blood (50%) and mobilized peripheral blood (10%). Surprisingly, Tie2 receptor expression within the HSC/PC subset was extremely low from both normal and CML samples. Using in vivo transplantation studies, we provide evidence that HLA-DR, c-kitR, Tie2 and IL-3R may not be suitable markers for further partitioning of HSCs from the Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA- sub-population.",,,,['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of drug resistance, we established K562 cell line models resistant to nilotinib and imatinib. Microarray-based transcriptome profiling of resistant cells revealed that nilotinib- and imatinib-resistant cells showed the upregulation of kinase-encoding genes (AURKC, FYN, SYK, BTK and YES1). Among them, the upregulation of AURKC and FYN was observed both in nilotinib- and imatinib-resistant cells irrespective of exposure doses, while SYK, BTK and YES1 showed dose-dependent upregulation of expression. Upregulation of EGF and JAG1 oncogenes as well as genes encoding ATP-dependent drug efflux pump proteins such as ABCB1 was also observed in the resistant cells, which may confer alternative survival benefits. Functional gene set analysis revealed that molecular categories of 'ATPase activity', 'cell adhesion' or 'tyrosine kinase activity' were commonly activated in the resistant clones. Taken together, the transcriptome analysis of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)-resistant clones provides the insights into the mechanism of drug resistance, which can facilitate the development of an effective screening method as well as therapeutic intervention to deal with TKI resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, we found that treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with the glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone (Dex) resulted in profound inhibition of glycolysis. We thus demonstrate that Dex reduced glucose consumption, glucose utilization and glucose uptake by leukemic cells. Furthermore, Dex treatment decreased the levels of the plasma membrane-associated glucose transporter GLUT1, thus revealing the mechanism for the inhibition of glucose uptake. Inhibition of glucose uptake correlated with induction of cell death in ALL cell lines and in leukemic blasts from ALL patients cultured ex vivo. Addition of di-methyl succinate could partially overcome cell death induced by Dex in RS4;11 cells, thereby further supporting the notion that inhibition of glycolysis contributes to the induction of apoptosis. Finally, Dex killed RS4;11 cells significantly more efficiently when cultured in lower glucose concentrations suggesting that modulation of glucose levels might influence the effectiveness of GC treatment in ALL. In summary, our data show that GC treatment blocks glucose uptake by leukemic cells leading to inhibition of glycolysis and that these effects play an important role in the induction of cell death by these drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PFT-mu also led to an increase of the active form of caspase-3 and reduced the intracellular concentrations of AKT and ERK1/2 in NALM-6 cells. Moreover, PFT-mu enhanced cytotoxicity of cytarabine, 17-(allylamino)-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, and sorafenib in NALM-6, TOM-1 and KG-1a cells.

AMD3100 is an inhibitor of CXCR4 currently used to mobilize cancer cells. CXCR4 is a target of microRNA (miR)-146a that may represent a new tool to inhibit CXCR4 expression. We then investigated CXCR4 regulation by miR-146a in primary AMLs and found an inverse correlation between miR-146a and CXCR4 protein expression levels in all AML subtypes. As the lowest miR-146a expression levels were observed in M5 AML, we analyzed the control of CXCR4 expression by miR-146a in normal and leukemic monocytic cells and showed that the regulatory miR-146a/CXCR4 pathway operates during monocytopoiesis, but is deregulated in AMLs. AMD3100 treatment and miR-146a overexpression were used to inhibit CXCR4 in leukemic cells. AMD3100 treatment induces the decrease of CXCR4 protein expression, associated with miR-146a increase, and increases sensitivity of leukemic blast cells to cytotoxic drugs, this effect being further enhanced by miR-146a overexpression.

In order to examine the mechanisms of resistance due to quiescence and the effect of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, everolimus, for such a resistant population, we used Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient cells serially xenotransplanted into NOD/SCID/IL2rgamma(null) (NOG) mice. Spleen cells from leukemic mice showed a higher percentage of slow-cycling G(0) cells in the CD34(+)CD38(-) population compared with the CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(-) populations. After ex vivo imatinib treatment, more residual cells were observed in the CD34(+)CD38(-) population than in the other populations. Although slow-cycling G(0) cells were insensitive to imatinib in spite of BCR-ABL and CrkL dephosphorylation, combination treatment with everolimus induced substantial cell death, including that of the CD34(+)CD38(-) population, with p70-S6 K dephosphorylation and decrease of MCL-1 expression. The leukemic non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mouse system with the in vivo combination treatment with imatinib and everolimus showed a decrease of tumor burden including CD34(+) cells. These results imply that treatment with everolimus can overcome resistance to imatinib in Ph(+) leukemia due to quiescence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 25.,"Accurate and standardized methods for the quantitative measurement of BCR-ABL1 are a prerequisite for monitoring of treatment response in t(9;22)-positive leukemia. Here, we describe a novel multiplex assay system based on the proven TaqMan and Armored RNA technologies and optimized for sensitive detection of three BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts and ABL1 in a single reaction. Analytical experiments confirmed the absence of significant competition between the simultaneous amplification reactions and established the sensitivity, linearity and precision of the assay. Comparative studies with 115 clinical specimens resulted in high qualitative and quantitative agreement with independent singleplex laboratory-developed tests routinely used in clinical testing. Direct comparison with a reference laboratory calibrated to the international scale (IS) demonstrated minimal analytical bias between methods and an overall accuracy and precision within the performance range required for quantitative measurement of BCR-ABL1 on the IS. We conclude that detection of e1a2, b2a2, b3a2 and ABL1 can be achieved in a multiplex assay format compatible with IS reporting. Further clinical validation of the assay could improve the operational efficiency of clinical laboratories, increase their adherence to current recommendations for b2a2/b3a2 reporting on the IS and provide for the first time an opportunity to standardize e1a2-monitoring results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 25.,"Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is an important regulator of cell survival and has been shown to be constitutively active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Recently, a novel NF-kappaB inhibitor, IMD-0354 (N-(3, 5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxy-benzamide), was shown to specifically inhibit the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha by IkB kinases, thus preventing NF-kappaB release. In this study, we investigated if IMD-0354 can inhibit NF-kappaB activation and induce apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro. The rate of increase in apoptosis, drug sensitivity and DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB were studied using Annexin V stainings, the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively. Finally, the impact of IMD-0354 treatment on the expression of a set of apoptosis-related genes was investigated. The results clearly show that IMD-0354 induced apoptosis (mean 26%, range 8-48%) in CLL cells, independent of immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene mutational status, and showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect. IMD-0354 treatment also significantly lowered the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in CLL cells. In addition, we identified differences in expression levels of pro- and antiapoptotic genes following IMD-0354 treatment. In summary, our novel findings show that IMD-0354 can induce apoptosis in CLL cells, and thus merits further investigation as an anticancer agent in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain lead to the constitutive activation of the FLT3 kinase inducing the activation of multiple genes, which may result in the expression of leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs). We analyzed the regulation of LAA in FLT3-wild-type (WT)- and FLT3-ITD(+) myeloid cells to identify potential targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy for AML patients. Antigens, such as PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin, WT-1 and PRAME, were upregulated by constitutively active FLT3-ITD as well as FLT3-WT activated by FLT3 ligand (FL). Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) clones against PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin and an AML-directed CTL clone recognized AML cell lines and primary AML blasts expressing FLT3-ITD, as well as FLT3-WT(+) myeloid dendritic cells in the presence of FL. Downregulation of FLT3 led to the abolishment of CTL recognition. Comparing our findings concerning LAA upregulation by the FLT3 kinase with those already made for the Bcr-Abl kinase, we found analogies in the LAA expression pattern. Antigens upregulated by both FLT3 and Bcr-Abl may be promising targets for the development of immunotherapeutical approaches against myeloid leukemia of different origin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We treated 24 selected elderly AML patients with all-trans retinoic acid for 2 days before adding theophylline and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00175812; EudraCT no. 2004-001663-22), and sampled 11 patients for peripheral blood at day 0, 2 and 7 for single-cell analysis of basal level and signal-transduction responses to relevant myeloid growth factors (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, Flt3L, stem cell factor, erythropoietin, CXCL-12) on 10 signaling molecules (CREB, STAT1/3/5, p38, Erk1/2, Akt, c-Cbl, ZAP70/Syk and rpS6). Pretreatment analysis by unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis divided the patients into three distinguishable signaling clusters (non-potentiated, potentiated basal and potentiated signaling). Signal-transduction pathways were modulated during therapy and patients moved between the clusters. Patients with multiple leukemic clones demonstrated distinct stimulation responses and therapy-induced modulation. Individual signaling profiles together with clinical and hematological information may be used to early identify AML patients in whom epigenetic and signal-transduction targeted therapy is beneficial.",,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00175812'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study explored the molecular mechanisms by which imatinib caused methylation on the promoter region of this tumor suppressor gene in leukemia cells. Real-time reverse transcription PCR found that long-term exposure of chronic eosinophilic leukemia EOL-1 cells expressing FIP1L1/platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha to imatinib induced expression of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and histone-methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a family of polycomb group, thereby increasing methylation of the gene. Immunoprecipitation assay found the increased complex formation of DNMT3A and EZH2 proteins in these cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that amounts of both DNMT3A and EZH2 proteins bound around the promoter region of PTEN gene were increased in EOL-1 cells after exposure to imatinib. Furthermore, we found that levels of DNMT3A and EZH2 were strikingly increased in leukemia cells isolated from individuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia (n=1) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=2), who relapsed after treatment with imatinib compared with those isolated at their initial presentation. Taken together, imatinib could cause drug-resistance via recruitment of polycomb gene complex to the promoter region of the PTEN and downregulation of this gene's transcripts in leukemia patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pacritinib (SB1518) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with equipotent activity against FLT3 (IC(50)=22 n) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2, IC(50)=23 n). Pacritinib inhibits FLT3 phosphorylation and downstream STAT, MAPK and PI3 K signaling in FLT3-internal-tandem duplication (ITD), FLT3-wt cells and primary AML blast cells. Oral administration of pacritinib in murine models of FLT3-ITD-driven AML led to significant inhibition of primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. Upregulation of JAK2 in FLT3-TKI-resistant AML cells was identified as a potential mechanism of resistance to selective FLT3 inhibition. This resistance could be overcome by the combined FLT3 and JAK2 activities of pacritinib in this cellular model. Our findings provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of pacritinib in AML including patients resistant to FLT3-TKI therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation is observed in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML M6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and malignant lymphoma. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the four and a half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2) was identified as a CALM interacting protein. Recently, high expression of FHL2 in breast, gastric, colon, lung as well as in prostate cancer was shown to be associated with an adverse prognosis. The interaction between CALM and FHL2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The FHL2 interaction domain of CALM was mapped to amino acids 294-335 of CALM. The transcriptional activation capacity of FHL2 was reduced by CALM, but not by CALM/AF10, which suggests that regulation of FHL2 by CALM might be disturbed in CALM/AF10-positive leukemia. Extremely high expression of FHL2 was seen in acute erythroid leukemia (AML M6). FHL2 was also highly expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia and in AML with complex aberrant karyotype. These results suggest that FHL2 may play an important role in leukemogenesis, especially in the case of AML M6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resistance to graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects may be responsible for the poor effect of allo-HSCT on MLL-AFF1-positive ALL. Cytotoxic effector mechanisms mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was reported to contribute to the GVL effect. We showed that MLL-AFF1-positive ALL cell lines are resistant to TNF-alpha. To examine the mechanism of resistance to TNF-alpha of MLL-AFF1-positive leukemia, we focused on S100A6 as a possible factor. Upregulation of S100A6 expression and inhibition of the p53-caspase 8-caspase 3 pathway were observed only in MLL-AFF1-positive ALL cell lines in the presence of TNF-alpha. The effect of S100A6 on resistance to TNF-alpha by inhibition of the p53-caspase 8-caspase 3 pathway of MLL-AFF1-positive ALL cell lines were also confirmed by analysis using small interfering RNA against S100A6. This pathway was also confirmed in previously established MLL-AFF1 transgenic mice. These results suggest that MLL-AFF1-positive ALL escapes from TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis by upregulation of S100A6 expression, followed by interfering with p53-caspase 8-caspase 3 pathway. These results suggest that S100A6 may be a promising therapeutic target for MLL-AFF1-positive ALL in combination with allo-HSCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The newly solved co-crystal structure illustrating the menin-MLL interaction, coupled with the role of menin in recruiting both WT MLL and MLL-FPs to target genes, highlights menin as a scaffold protein and a central hub controlling this type of leukemia. The menin/WT MLL/MLL-FP hub may also cooperate with several signaling pathways, including Wnt, GSK3, and bromodomain-containing Brd4-related pathways to sustain MLL-FP-induced leukemogenesis, revealing new therapeutic targets to improve the treatment of MLL-FP leukemias.","['Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Abramson Cancer Center, The University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.']","['R01 CA113962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK085121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",['NIHMS422814'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predominantly studied in cancer, MDSCs suppress T cells utilizing various mechanisms. In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) therapy-related toxicity and alloreactivity increase inflammatory cytokines that might favor an MDSC accumulation. To address this question, circulating CD14(+)HLA-DR(low/neg) cells were studied retrospectively in 51 allo-HSCT patients. These cells represent one of the few well-described human MDSC subsets under physiological and pathological conditions. The frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(low/neg) cells was significantly increased after allo-HSCT, especially in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease. Compared to healthy donor cells they were pSTAT1(low) (phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)(high). Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-6, which both have been linked to MDSC induction, correlated positively with the frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(low/neg) cells. In vitro dysfunction of patient T cells, such as reduced proliferative capacity or CD3zeta-chain expression, was rescued by blocking the IDO activity of CD14(+)HLA-DR(low/neg) cells.

Epub 2012 Jul 25.,"The transcriptional regulator ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI-1) has mainly been studied for its role in myeloid malignancies, in which high EVI-1 levels are associated with particularly aggressive disease. The role of EVI-1 in lymphoid cells, however, is largely unknown. Here we show that EVI-1 is indeed expressed in lymphoid malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Expression data from pediatric ALL further suggest that high EVI-1 levels are associated with poor prognosis. Suppression of EVI-1 expression by RNA interference reduces cell growth and enhances apoptosis sensitivity in response to various stimuli in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. At the molecular level, EVI-1 modulates expression of several apoptosis-related genes (such as BCL2, BCL-x, XIAP, NOXA, PUMA, TRAIL-R1). Furthermore, EVI-1 knockdown strongly impairs in vivo engraftment of lymphoblastic leukemia cells upon transplantation in immune-permissive NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma(null) mice, conferring a survival benefit when compared with mice transplanted with control cells. Thus, our data show that EVI-1 is expressed not only in myeloid but also in lymphoid leukemias, and contributes to the leukemogenic potential and apoptosis resistance of ALL cells.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tuebingen Medical Center II, Tuebingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that B7-H1 expression on patient myeloma cells and human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) was upregulated by cultivating the cells with autologous stromal cells and the human stromal cell line HS-5. Among major cytokines produced by HS-5 cells, interleukin (IL)-6-induced B7-H1 expression on HMCLs. Moreover, HS-5 cell-mediated B7-H1 expression was downregulated by inhibiting IL-6. B7-H1(+) HMCLs were more proliferative and less susceptible to antimyeloma chemotherapy compared with B7-H1(-) HMCLs. Moreover, the former cells showed higher levels of Bcl-2 and FasL expression than the latter. Finally, B7-H1 molecules on HMCLs induced T-cell apoptosis and anergy of tumor-specific T cells. Consistent with these in vitro observations, patients whose myeloma cells expressed high levels of B7-H1 had higher myeloma cell percentages in the bone marrow (BM) and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels compared with other myeloma patients. In addition, B7-H1 expression levels were often upregulated after myeloma patients relapsed or became refractory to therapy. Our data indicate that the BM microenvironment upregulates B7-H1 expression on myeloma cells, which links to the two biological actions of inducing T-cell downregulation and enhancing aggressive myeloma-cell characteristics. Modulating the B7-H1 pathway may be worthwhile in myeloma.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, calactin treatment showed that a decrease in the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins Cyclin B1, Cdk1, and Cdc25C was consistent with a G2/M phase arrest. Furthermore, calactin induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and PARP cleavage.

RNA and protein from all four catalytic isoforms of PI3K (p110alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) were expressed in 38 AML samples, which also showed expression of phosphorylated Akt Ser473, indicating PI3K activation. Initial treatment of 12 AML samples with inhibitors targeting each of the four isoforms demonstrated that p110alpha and delta inhibition are more effective in killing AML blast colony-forming cells (CFC) than p110beta or gamma inhibition. In subsequent experiments, AML CFC from 46 patient samples were treated with the p110alpha and delta selective inhibitors, PI3Kalpha inhibitor 2 or PCN5603, and dose-dependent progenitor kill and inhibition of phosphorylated Akt Ser473 expression was observed. AML samples were more sensitive to PI3Kalpha inhibitor 2 and PCN5603 killing than normal bone marrow or normal peripheral blood CFC (median IC(50) for AML and normal CFCs treated with PI3Kalpha inhibitor 2, 1.8 and 4.3 muM, respectively, and for PCN5603, 1.9 and 6.2 muM, respectively). Furthermore, treatment of AML cells with PCN5603 also decreased survival of more primitive leukemia progenitors identified in long-term culture (AML long-term culture initiating cells), while less toxicity toward normal bone marrow long-term culture initiating cells was observed.

The post-transplant period was complicated with chronic graft-versus-host disease. At 10 months post-transplant, she presented with a vulvar mass of six weeks duration. Excisional biopsy of the vulvar mass confirmed the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma as extramedullary relapse. Bone marrow biopsy was without evidence of leukemia. Involvement of the vulva, vaginal and adjacent cervical area only was confirmed. She received re-induction chemotherapy with clinical regression of both the vulvar, vaginal and the cervical masses; this was followed by radiation therapy to an extramedullary site.

MuLV glyco-gag, gPr80Gag, promotes retrovirus replication and disease progression. Although virtually all infectious MuLVs encode glyco-gag, XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) lacks the classical gPr80Gag sequence. We examined XMRV to determine if its leader sequence contains glyco-gag activity, whether the presence of conventional gPr80Gag affects replication of XMRV, and we describe the evolution of glyco-gag-deficient MuLVs in Mus. RESULTS: We introduced several mutations disrupting two putative but noncanonical glyco-gag proteins in the leader sequence region in XMRV and found that those mutations did not affect virus release nor susceptibility to the antiviral activity of hA3G (human APOBEC3G). A chimeric XMRV encoding the Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) leader sequence (MXMRV) demonstrated that M-MuLV glyco-gag facilitated MXMRV release and increased infectivity. Infectivity assays with several cell lines showed that glyco-gag increases XMRV infectivity in all cell lines tested, but the level of this increase varies in different cell lines. Because MuLV glyco-gag counteracts mouse APOBEC3, we investigated whether M-MuLV glyco-gag enhances XMRV infection by counteracting human APOBEC3. Comparison of hAPOBEC3 isoforms expressed in different cell lines indicated that hA3B was the most likely candidate for a restrictive hA3. However over-expression of hA3B showed no enhanced restriction of infection by XMRV compared to MXMRV. Endogenous MuLVs in the sequenced mouse genome were screened for canonical glyco-gag, which was identified in two clades of xenotropic MuLVs (X-MuLVs) and ecotropic MuLVs, but not in other X-MuLVs or in any polytropic MuLVs. CONCLUSIONS: M-MuLV glyco-gag facilitates XMRV replication, and the leader sequence region in XMRV does not encode proteins equivalent to M-MuLV glyco-gag. The fact that the ability of glyco-gag to enhance XMRV infection varies in different cell lines suggests a glyco-gag sensitive restrictive factor that further reduces XMRV infectivity. The M-MuLV glyco-gag enhancement for XMRV replication is through a hAPOBEC3 independent mechanism. The absence of glyco-gag in MuLVs carried by western European mice suggests that loss of this sequence is a relatively recent event with limited subspecies distribution.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3905, USA.']",,,"['P30 CA062203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 23.,"The interactions between the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is known to promote survival of AML cells. In this study, we used reverse phase-protein array (RPPA) technology to measure changes in multiple proteins induced by stroma in leukemic cells. We then investigated the potential of an mTOR kinase inhibitor, PP242, to disrupt leukemia/stroma interactions, and examined the effects of PP242 in vivo using a mouse model. Using RPPA, we confirmed that multiple survival signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), were up-regulated in primary AML cells cocultured with stroma. PP242 effectively induced apoptosis in primary samples cultured with or without stroma. Mechanistically, PP242 attenuated the activities of mTORC1 and mTORC2, sequentially inhibited phosphorylated AKT, S6K, and 4EBP1, and concurrently suppressed chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression in primary leukemic cells and in stromal cells cultured alone or cocultured with leukemic cells. In the in vivo leukemia mouse model, PP242 inhibited mTOR signaling in leukemic cells and demonstrated a greater antileukemia effect than rapamycin. Our findings indicate that disrupting mTOR/AKT signaling with a selective mTOR kinase inhibitor can effectively target leukemic cells within the BM microenvironment.","['Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,,"['P01 CA0055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 23.,"Multidrug resistance (MDR), which is mediated by multiple drug efflux ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, is a critical issue in the treatment of acute leukemia, with permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, and breast cancer resistance protein (i.e., ABCG2) consistently being shown to be key effectors of MDR in cell line studies. Studies have demonstrated that intrinsic MDR can arise as a result of specific gene expression profiles and that drug-induced overexpression of P-gp and other MDR proteins can result in acquired resistance, with multiple ABC transporters having been shown to be overexpressed in cell lines selected for resistance to multiple drugs used to treat acute leukemia. Furthermore, numerous anticancer drugs, including agents commonly used for the treatment of acute leukemia (e.g., doxorubicin, vincristine, mitoxantrone, and methotrexate), have been shown to be P-gp substrates or to be susceptible to efflux mediated by other MDR proteins, and multiple clinical studies have demonstrated associations between P-gp or other MDR protein expression and responses to therapy or survival rates in acute leukemia. Here we review the importance of MDR in cancer, with a focus on acute leukemia, and we highlight the need for rapid accurate assessment of MDR status for optimal treatment selection. We also address the latest research on overcoming MDR, from inhibition of P-gp and other MDR proteins through various approaches (including direct antagonism and gene silencing) to the design of novel agents or novel delivery systems for existing therapeutic agents, to evade cellular efflux.","['Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. cindy.xia@mpi.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 40101 was conducted using a phase III factorial design to define whether six cycles of a chemotherapy regimen are superior to four cycles. We also sought to determine whether paclitaxel (T) is as efficacious as doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC), but with reduced toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2008, the study enrolled women with operable breast cancer and zero to three positive nodes. Patients were randomly assigned to either four or six cycles of either AC or T. Study stratifiers were estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and menopausal status. After 2003, all treatment was administered in dose-dense fashion. The primary efficacy end point was relapse-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: A total of 3,171 patients were enrolled; 94% were node-negative and 6% had one to three positive nodes. At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the 4-year RFS was 90.9% and 91.8% for six and four cycles, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of six to four cycles regarding RFS was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.28; P=.77). The 4-year OS was 95.3% and 96.3% for six and four cycles, respectively, with an HR of six to four cycles of 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.49; P=.44). There was no interaction between treatment duration and chemotherapy regimen, ER/PgR, or HER2 status on RFS or OS. CONCLUSION: For women with resected primary breast cancer and zero to three positive nodes, we found no evidence that extending chemotherapy regimens of AC or single-agent T from four to six cycles improves clinical outcome.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

Epub 2012 Jul 23.,"Cancer-associated thrombosis often lacks a clear etiology. However, it is linked to a poor prognosis and represents the second-leading cause of death in cancer patients. Recent studies have shown that chromatin released into blood, through the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is procoagulant and prothrombotic. Using a murine model of chronic myelogenous leukemia, we show that malignant and nonmalignant neutrophils are more prone to NET formation. This increased sensitivity toward NET generation is also observed in mammary and lung carcinoma models, suggesting that cancers, through a systemic effect on the host, can induce an increase in peripheral blood neutrophils, which are predisposed to NET formation. In addition, in the late stages of the breast carcinoma model, NETosis occurs concomitant with the appearance of venous thrombi in the lung. Moreover, simulation of a minor systemic infection in tumor-bearing, but not control, mice results in the release of large quantities of chromatin and a prothrombotic state. The increase in neutrophil count and their priming is mediated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which accumulates in the blood of tumor-bearing mice.

Over 6 years, we diagnosed 221 patients (211 adults and 10 children) with AML, indicating an incidence of AML in Miyazaki Prefecture of 3.2 per 100,000 per year. In 193 adult patients with non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the proportion of patients with myelodysplasia, unfavorable risk karyotypes, antecedent hematologic diseases, prior chemotherapy for other malignancies, and small proportion of blasts in the marrow was higher in patients >/=65 years, and patients with poor performance status (PS) and higher WBC counts at diagnosis were more prevalent among patients >/=75 years. One-third of the adult non-APL patients met the inclusion criteria usually applied in clinical trials: de novo AML, age </=64 years with PS 0-2 and no key organ dysfunction. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of adult non-APL patients was 21.1 % (patients </=64 years, 33.8 %; 65-74 years, 21.6 %; >/=75 years, 0 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that French-American-British subtypes M0, M6, and M7, poor PS (3, 4), unfavorable risk karyotypes, and higher WBC counts at diagnosis were independent adverse prognostic factors associated with OS. This analysis provides real world data.","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to insufficient study of mutations in the KIT gene, the diagnosis and rate of recurrence of these mutations with divergent subtypes in AML cases in India is of concern. In order to find out the frequency of mutations of KIT gene exon 8 in 109 AML cases, we have performed polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by DNA sequencing and have identified 24 mutations in exon 8 in 13 cases, including deletions at codon 418 (n = 3), 419 (n = 11) and 420 (n = 5) as well as point mutations at codon 417 (n = 1) and 421 (n = 4). In eleven AML cases, exon 8 deletion and point mutations involved the loss at codon Asp419 immoderately conserved cross species placed in the receptor extracellular domain. Frequency elevation of the KIT proto-oncogene exon 8 deletion and point mutations in AML cases allude a crucial function for this region of the receptor extracellular domain. Thus, we report the incidence of acquired mutations in exon 8, with consistent loss at codon Asp419, in 10.09 % of AML cases in a selected Indian population.","[""Department of Biotechnology, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. rizwan59elmc@gmail.com""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proviral load is an important biological marker for understanding HTLV-1 pathogenesis and elucidating whether or not the virus is related to the clinical manifestation of the disease. This study describes the oral health profile of HTLV-1 carriers and HAM/TSP patients in order to investigate the association between the proviral load in saliva and the severity of the periodontal disease and to examine virus intra-host variations from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and saliva cells. It is a cross-sectional analytical study of 90 individuals carried out from November 2006 to May 2008. Of the patients, 60 were HTLV-1 positive and 30 were negative. Individuals from the HTLV-1 positive and negative groups had similar mean age and social-economic status. Data were analyzed using two available statistical software packages, STATA 8.0 and SPSS 11.0 to conduct frequency analysis. Differences of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. HTLV-1 patients had poorer oral health status when compared to seronegative individuals. A weak positive correlation between blood and saliva proviral loads was observed. The mean values of proviral load in blood and saliva in patients with HAM/TSP was greater than those in HTLV-1 carriers. The HTLV-1 molecular analysis from PBMC and saliva specimens suggests that HTLV-1 in saliva is due to lymphocyte infiltration from peripheral blood. A direct relationship between the proviral load in saliva and oral manifestations was observed.","['Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we evaluated 59 TETs and identified recurrent patterns of copy number (CN) aberrations in different histotypes. GISTIC algorithm revealed the presence of 126 significant peaks of CN aberration, which included 13 cancer-related genes. Among these peaks, CN gain of BCL2 and CN loss of CDKN2A/B were the only genes in the respective regions of CN aberration and were associated with poor outcome. TET cell lines were sensitive to siRNA knockdown of the anti-apoptotic molecules BCL2 and MCL1. Gx15-070, a pan-BCL2 inhibitor, induced autophagy-dependent necroptosis in TET cells via a mechanism involving mTOR pathways, and inhibited TET xenograft growth. ABT263, an inhibitor of BCL2/BCL-XL/BCL-W, reduced proliferation in TET cells when administered in combination with sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor able to downregulate MCL1. Immunohistochemistry on 132 TETs demonstrated that CN loss of CDKN2A correlated with lack of expression of its related protein p16(INK4) and identified tumors with poor prognosis. The molecular markers BCL2 and CDKN2A may be of potential value in diagnosis and prognosis of TETs. Our study provides the first preclinical evidence that deregulated anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins may represent suitable targets for TET treatment.","['Medical Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GC-induced apoptosis involves an intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway. BIM (BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a BCL-2 homology 3-only pro-apoptotic protein, is upregulated by dexamethasone (Dex) treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and has an essential role in Dex-induced apoptosis. It has been indicated that Dex-induced BIM is regulated mainly by transcription, however, the molecular mechanisms including responsible transcription factors are unclear. In this study, we found that Dex treatment induced transcription factor Runx2 and c-Jun in parallel with BIM induction. Dex-induced BIM and apoptosis were decreased in cells harboring dominant-negative c-Jun and were increased in cells with c-Jun overexpression. Cells harboring short hairpin RNA for Runx2 also decreased BIM induction and apoptosis. On the Bim promoter, c-Jun bound to and activated the AP-1-binding site at about -2.7 kb from the transcription start site. Treatment with RU486, a GC receptor antagonist, blocked Dex-induced Runx2, c-Jun and BIM induction, as well as apoptosis. Furthermore, pretreatment with SB203580, a p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, decreased Dex-induced Runx2, c-Jun and BIM, suggesting that p38-MAPK activation is upstream of the induction of these molecules. In conclusion, we identified the critical signaling pathway for GC-induced apoptosis, and targeting these molecules may be an alternative approach to overcome GC-resistance in leukemia treatment.","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",,,"['P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134473/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA134473/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 23.,"Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in acute leukemia, even in patients transplanted in morphologic CR. Various techniques now enable the sensitive quantification of 'minimal' amounts of residual disease (MRD) in patients with acute leukemia in remission. Numerous studies convincingly demonstrate that MRD at the time of transplantation is a powerful, independent predictor of subsequent relapse, with current detection levels of one leukemic cell in 10(5)-10(6) normal cells being prognostically relevant. This recognition provides the rationale to assign patients with detectable MRD (that is, 'MRD(+)' patients) to intensified therapies before, during, or after transplantation, although data supporting these strategies are still sparse. Limited evidence from observational studies suggests that outcomes with autologous HCT are so poor that MRD(+) patients should preferentially be assigned to allogeneic HCT, which can cure a subgroup of these patients, particularly if unmanipulated (T-cell replete) grafts and/or minimized immunosuppression are used to optimize the graft-vs-leukemia effect. Emerging data suggest that additional therapy with non-cross-resistant agents to decrease residual tumor burden before transplantation in MRD(+) patients might be beneficial. Further, other studies hint at immunotherapy (for example, rapid withdrawal of immunosuppression and/or donor lymphocyte infusions) as a means to prevent overt relapse if patients remain, or become, MRD(+) after HCT. Ultimately, controlled clinical studies are needed to define the value of MRD-directed therapies, and patients should be encouraged to enter such trials.","['Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",,,['P30-CA015704-35S6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the activity and specificity of the HPSE promoter in tumor cells remains unclear. The core fragment of the HPSE promoter was amplified and cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP-1 vector. The recombinant plasmid pEGFP-Hp was transfected into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV304) and human hepatoma carcinoma (HepG2), laryngocarcinoma (Hep2) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cell lines. The vectors pEGFP-1 and pEGFPN1 were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The activity and expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) were analyzed. Results showed that the sequence of the amplified HPSE promoter was in agreement with the GenBank data. The recombinant plasmid pEGFP-Hp was consistent with the expected result. No GFP expression was observed in the transfected cells in the pEGFP-1 group, but a high expression was observed in the pEGFP-N1 group. As regards the pEGFP-Hp group, less fluorescence was revealed in ECV cells with a relatively high fluorescence in tumor cells. The average transfection efficiencies of pEGFP-Hp in the ECV304, HepG2, Hep2 and K562 cell lines were 3.9, 21.3, 10.8 and 6.5%, respectively, while those of pEGFP-Nl were 17.1, 24.0, 14.0 and 11.0%, respectively. The HPSE gene promoter drives the expression of downstream genes in a eukaryotic vector, specifically in tumor cell lines, but its activity is relatively weak.","['Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Affiliated Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, Anhui 241001, PR China. drcxp@sohu.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YYK1 induced cytotoxic effects, cell morphological changes, decreased the cell number and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in HL-60 cells. YYK1-induced apoptosis was confirmed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Results from colorimetric assays and western blot analysis indicated that activities of caspase-7/-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 were increased in YYK1-treated HL-60 cells. Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of extrinsic apoptotic proteins (Fas/CD95, FasL and FADD), intrinsic related proteins (cytochrome c, Apaf-1, AIF and Endo G), the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and phosphorylated p38 MAPK were increased in HL-60 cells after YYK1 treatment. Cell apoptosis was significantly reduced after pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a ROS scavenger) or diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI; a NADPH oxidase inhibitor). Blockage of p38 MAPK signaling by SB202190 abolished YYK1-induced Fas/CD95 upregulation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. We conclude that YYK1 induces both of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways via ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK signaling in HL-60 human leukemia cells in vitro.","['Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Pharmacology, China Medical University, and Chinese Medicine Research and Development Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan, ROC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, molecular targeted agents have shown significant improvement in clinical outcomes; for example, in chronic myelogeneous leukemia with imatinib, breast cancer with trastuzumab, colon cancer with bevacizumab and cetuximab, and renal cell cancer with sorafenib and sunitinib. In HNSCC, the epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab has shown promising results in combination with radiation. Targeted agents including cetuximab induce stresses to activate prosurvival autophagy. Combining autophagy inhibitors with agents that induce autophagy as a prosurvival response may therefore increase their therapeutic efficacy. Whether autophagy contributes to the prosurvival response or to the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs is largely unknown. This review will discuss the possible role of autophagy as a novel target for anticancer therapy agents in HNSCC.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Sendai, Japan. riki@dent.tohoku.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise mechanisms induced by oridonin in human erythroleukemia are yet to be clarified. The present study aimed to elucidate possible oridonin-induced apoptotic mechanisms in OCIM2 cells, as well as the possible mechanisms whereby OCIM2 cells are relatively resistant to oridonin. Results in the present study showed that oridonin significantly inhibited OCIM2 and OCI-AML3 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while expressing a much higher IC50 in OCIM2, compared to OCI-AML3. These results also indicated that oridonin induced OCIM2 cell apoptosis, associated with p65 and Bax, while activating caspases-9, -6 and -3. However, p65 was only partly translocated into the nucleus, while most of the p65 was retained in the cytoplasm. Moreover, nucleoporin 214 (Nup214) and nucleoporin 88 (Nup88) were downregulated at the transcriptional and protein levels, subsequent to oridonin treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that oridonin has the potential to induce OCIM2 cell-apoptosis, involving NF-kappaB activation, whereas the downregulation of Nup88 and Nup214 may protect OCIM2 through the regulation of the nucleocytoplasmic transport of p65.","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the pro-apoptotic role of miR-125b and its underlying mechanisms are unexplored. In this study, both gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that miR-125b expression not only induced spontaneous apoptosis in various cell lines derived from the liver, lung and colorectal cancers, but also sensitized cancer cells to diverse apoptotic stimuli, including nutrient starvation and chemotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-125b was a frequent event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and the miR-125b level was positively associated with the rate of apoptosis in HCC tissues. Subsequent investigations identified Mcl-1, Bcl-w and interleukin (IL)-6R as direct targets of miR-125b. Restoration of miR-125b expression not only diminished the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-w directly but also indirectly reduced the Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL levels by attenuating IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling. Consistent with these findings, introduction of miR-125b reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted the cleavage of pro-caspase-3. These data indicate that miR-125b may promote apoptosis by suppressing the anti-apoptotic molecules of the Bcl-2 family and miR-125b downregulation may facilitate tumor development by conferring upon cells the capability to survive under conditions of nutrient deprivation and chemotherapeutic treatment. Our findings highlight the importance of miR-125b in the regulation of apoptosis and suggest miR-125b as an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy.","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority of these lesions represents benign thymic hypertrophy and regress after treatment of the hyperthyroidism. A small percentage of these cases however represent neoplastic/malignant diseases which require further treatment. CASES: 12 year old boy with one year history of refractory Graves disease was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass and underwent curative thyroidectomy for sustained hyperthyroidism. Cervical lymphadenopathy was detected during the procedure and biopsy was obtained. A 23 year old woman who presented with a one month history of hyperthyroid symptoms, was diagnosed with Graves disease and also was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass on imaging. Biopsy of the anterior mediastinal mass was obtained and subsequently the patient underwent robotic thymectomy. Histologic examination and immunophenotyping of the cervical lymph node in a 12 year old boy revealed neoplastic proliferation of T lymphoblasts diagnostic of T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Examination of the anterior mediastinal mass biopsy in the 23 year old woman revealed type B1 thymoma which was confirmed after examination of the subsequent robotic thymectomy specimen. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and the third reported case of thymoma associated with sustained hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease. These cases indicate that an anterior mediastinal mass in a patient with active Graves disease may be due to a neoplastic cause, which may require definitive treatment. Caution should be exercised when dismissing a mediastinal mass as benign thymic hyperplasia in patients with active Graves disease.","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Vidant Medical Center and Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA. ridas.juskevicius@vidanthealth.com.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 21.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is often recommended for patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in second or later complete remission (>/=CR2) and sometimes in high-risk (HR) patients in first complete remission (CR1). Between January 1995 and July 2009, 53 patients with HR T-ALL underwent allo-SCT at our institution. Median age was 18 years (range, 14-51). Thirty-two patients (60.3%) were in CR1, 18 (34%) were in >/=CR2, and 3 (5.7%) were in relapse. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality at 5 years was 22.5%. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 40.2%, and that of chronic GVHD was 43.7%. The majority of relapses (88.9%) occurred within 1 year after SCT. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 5 years was 35.6%. CIR was 29.8% in patients in CR1, 35.3% in patients in >/=CR2 and all patients transplanted in relapse had disease recurrence post-allo-SCT (P = .000). Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years were 43.5% and 41.8%, respectively. The 5-year OS was 53.5% (95% CI 34.5%-72.5%) and 5-year DFS was 52% (95% CI 33%-71%) in patients who underwent allo-SCT in CR1, compared with 31.9% (95% CI, 9%-54.8%) and 29.4% (95% CI 7.6%-51.2%) in those who underwent allo-SCT in >/=CR2. On multivariate analysis, disease status at SCT remained significantly associated with OS (P = .007), DFS (P = .002), and CIR (P = .000). The presence of extramedullary disease at diagnosis had no effect on the different outcomes. Grade II-IV acute GVHD was significantly associated with a lower OS (P = .006) and DFS (P = .01). Our data indicate that allo-SCT represents an effective treatment for HR T-ALL, particularly when performed in CR1.","['Adult Hematology/HSCT, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. mmbakr@hotmail.com']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 21.,"The ability to identify patients at particularly low risk for invasive aspergillosis (IA) would facilitate more efficient targeting of antifungal prophylaxis. We measured baseline serum immunoglobulin responses against 6 purified recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus proteins before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or chemotherapy in 73 subjects, including 19 patients who subsequently developed proven or probable IA and 54 uninfected controls. We also assessed responses at the time of IA diagnosis and 4 weeks later (acute and convalescent sera, respectively). Baseline IgG responses against enolase, Ahp1, Hsp90, Crf1, and Cdc37 were significantly higher in the patients with IA compared with controls (P < .05). Cutoff concentrations identified by receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis were 67%-84% sensitive and 52%-67% specific. In a population with a 15% likelihood of developing IA, positive and negative predictive values would be 22%-26% and 92%-95%, respectively. Positive IgG responses against Hsp90, Pep2, Crf1, and Cdc37 were specifically associated with early-onset IA (<40 days) rather than late-onset IA (P </= .009). Increased IgG concentrations against Hsp90, Pep2, and Crf1 in convalescent sera versus baseline sera were more likely in the patients with IA who survived (P </= .01). IgG responses in acute sera were not correlated with outcomes, and IgM and IgA responses did not differ in baseline, acute, or convalescent sera between the patients and controls. In conclusion, baseline IgG responses against Aspergillus proteins may be useful screening tests for patients at low risk for IA. Our data suggest that some patients with IA have significant colonization or ongoing Aspergillus infections before immunosuppression. As such, IA may reflect unique predispositions to infection and/or progression from endogenous sources.","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

We describe the case of a patient with a rapidly growing, painless gynecomastia-like nodule in the left breast. On ultrasonography, the nodule was suspicious for breast carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A breast biopsy from a 54-year-old Caucasian man showed the morphoimmunophenotypical features of grade 3 follicular lymphoma. Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed a t(14,18) translocation suggesting breast involvement by a systemic lymphoma rather than a primary breast lymphoma. The histological diagnosis was subsequently confirmed after nodule excision. Mediastinal and abdominal node involvement was then identified on computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans during staging examinations. Our patient was treated with chemotherapy. After three years our patient experienced a right retro-areolar relapse. He then received two further cycles of chemotherapy but developed a myeloid acute leukemia and, as a result of this, he subsequently died. CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of breast lymphomas, especially in men, and the problems related to the therapeutic choices with these tumors require molecular techniques in association with classical histological diagnosis.","['Pathology Unit, National Cancer Institute, Pascale Foundation, Naples, Italy. monicantile@libero.it.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are clonal diseases arising in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. Mutations responsible for these diseases occur in several genes whose encoded proteins belong principally to five classes: signaling pathways proteins (e.g. CBL, FLT3, JAK2, RAS), transcription factors (e.g. CEBPA, ETV6, RUNX1), epigenetic regulators (e.g. ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, SUZ12, TET2, UTX), tumor suppressors (e.g. TP53), and components of the spliceosome (e.g. SF3B1, SRSF2). Large-scale sequencing efforts will soon lead to the establishment of a comprehensive repertoire of these mutations, allowing for a better definition and classification of myeloid malignancies, the identification of new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets, and the development of novel therapies. Given the importance of epigenetic deregulation in myeloid diseases, the use of drugs targeting epigenetic regulators appears as a most promising therapeutic approach.","[""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire; UMR1068 Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 27 Bd, Lei Roure, BP 30059, Marseille, 13273, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This resistance has been associated with the overexpression of ABCB1, which gives rise to the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon. MDR is characterized by resistance to nonrelated drugs, and P-glycoprotein (encoded by ABCB1) has been implicated as the major cause of its emergence. Wnt signaling has been demonstrated to be important in several aspects of CML. Recently, Wnt signaling was linked to ABCB1 regulation through its canonical pathway, which is mediated by beta-catenin, in other types of cancer. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the regulation of ABCB1 transcription in CML, as the basal promoter of ABCB1 has several beta-catenin binding sites. beta-catenin is the mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, which is important for CML progression. METHODS: In this work we used the K562 cell line and its derived MDR-resistant cell line Lucena (K562/VCR) as CML study models. Real time PCR (RT-qPCR), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), flow cytometry (FACS), western blot, immunofluorescence, RNA knockdown (siRNA) and Luciferase reporter approaches were used. RESULTS: beta-catenin was present in the protein complex on the basal promoter of ABCB1 in both cell lines in vitro, but its binding was more pronounced in the resistant cell line in vivo. Lucena cells also exhibited higher beta-catenin levels compared to its parental cell line. Wnt1 and beta-catenin depletion and overexpression of nuclear beta-catenin, together with TCF binding sites activation demonstrated that ABCB1 is positively regulated by the canonical pathway of Wnt signaling.

All three patients developed chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and received massive immunosuppressive therapy. The CMV retinitis was treated with ganciclovir. Clinical improvement was observed in the two SCID patients. The AML patient whose acute inflammatory retinitis was controlled, nevertheless developed optic atrophy in both eyes and VEP and ERG responses disappeared. The incidence of cytomegalovirus retinitis in our pediatric population of bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients in the last three years was higher than expected: 3/85 (3.5%). Alertness to the possibility of intraocular complications is advocated. Early detection of CMV retinitis and intensive treatment with ganciclovir can save vision.

RESULTS: The GSPs had obvious cytotoxicity on three cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manners. However, inhibition rate of different cell line were quite different, the strongest one was human leukemia K562 cells and the others were weak. The sensitization ranges calculated by univariate analysis were 6.25-12.5 microg/mL for human leukemia K562 cells. Sensitization enhancement ratio was 1.94 using curve fitting method for K562 cells. CONCLUSION: GSPs can obviously enhance the radiosensitivity of cancer cells in vitro. The mechanism of sensitization effect may be related to the effects of GSPs on oxygen balance and cell cycle.","['Stomaological hospital, Lanzhou university, Lanzhou 730000, China. panxj@lzu.edu.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wild-type Zbtb16 gene encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the POK (POZ and Kruppel) family of transcriptional repressors. In addition to nine Kruppel-type sequence-specific zinc fingers, which make it a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger protein family, the PLZF protein contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and RD2 domain. PLZF has been shown to be involved in major developmental and biological processes, such as spermatogenesis, hind limb formation, hematopoiesis, and immune regulation. PLZF is localized mainly in the nucleus where it exerts its transcriptional repression function, and many post-translational modifications affect this ability and also have an impact on its cytoplasmic/nuclear dissociation. PLZF achieves its transcriptional regulation by binding to many secondary molecules to form large multi-protein complexes that bind to the regulatory elements in the promoter region of the target genes. These complexes are also capable of physically interacting with its target proteins. Recently, PLZF has become implicated in carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor gene, since it regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis in many cell types. This review will examine the major advances in our knowledge of PLZF biological activities that augment its value as a therapeutic target, particularly in cancer and immunological diseases.","['Centre for Cancer Research, Monash Institute of Medical Research, Monash University Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PLZF', 'apoptosis', 'cancer', 'cell cycle', 'cytokines', 'leukemia', 'stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) impairs early adaptive immune responses to Friend virus (FV) coinfection. To investigate the mechanism of this impairment, we examined LDV-induced innate immune responses and found LDV-specific induction of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. LDV-induced IFN-alpha had little effect on FV infection or immune responses, but unexpectedly, LDV-induced IFN-gamma production dampened Th1 adaptive immune responses and enhanced FV infection. Two distinct effects were identified. First, LDV-induced IFN-gamma signaling indirectly modulated FV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Second, intrinsic IFN-gamma signaling in B cells promoted polyclonal B cell activation and enhanced early FV infection, despite promotion of germinal center formation and neutralizing Ab production. Results from this model reveal that IFN-gamma production can have detrimental effects on early adaptive immune responses and virus control.","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.']",,,"['MC_U117581330/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'ZIA AI000753-16/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'U117581330/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['NIHMS389053'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the functions of CCT complex have not been established globally, especially when translocating into nuclear. The purpose of this study is to explore the function of CCT in nuclear and present a strategy in clinical proteomics studies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) combined with mass spectrometry was applied to separate and identify CCT protein complexes. RESULTS: We isolated the CCT complex in K562 nucleus and identified a novel CCT complex containing 40 protein components involved in protein folding, RNA processing, apoptosis, and cell metabolism. The interactions between four candidate proteins and CCT were confirmed by immunoblotting. Computational biological analyses and independent biochemical assays validated the overall quality of interactions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results support clues that CCT might play an unexpected role in various biological processes including RNA processing. And we envision future applications for this system searching for new clues of CCT in disease and readily be applied to the clinic.","['Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.']",,"['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Epub 2012 Aug 16.,"Synergistic killing was achieved when Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) cell lines were incubated with ABT-263 and an immunotoxin directed to the transferrin receptor. SCLC lines are variably sensitive to the BH-3 only peptide mimetic, ABT-263. To determine their sensitivity to toxin-based reagents, we incubated four representative SCLC lines with a model Pseudomonas exotoxin-based immunotoxin directed to the transferrin receptor. Remarkably in 4-of-4 lines, there was little evidence of immunotoxin-mediated cytotoxicity despite near complete inhibition of protein synthesis. However, when combinations of ABT-263 and immunotoxin were added to the ABT-263-resistant cell lines (H196 and H69AR), there was synergistic killing as evidenced by increased activation of caspase 3/7, annexin V staining, and loss of cell integrity. Synergistic killing was evident at 6 hr and correlated with loss of Mcl-1. This synergy was also noted when the closely related compound ABT-737 was combined with the same immunotoxin. To establish that the synergy seen in tissue culture could be achieved in vivo, H69AR cells were grown as tumors in nude mice and shown to be susceptible to the killing action of an immunotoxin-ABT-737 combination but not to either agent alone.

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional potential of fermented pepino extract (PE) milk by Lactobacillus strains containing the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) gene. Three Lactobacillus strains were selected, including L. brevis BCRC 12310, L. casei BCRC 14082 and L. salivarius subsp. salivarius BCRC 14759. The contents of free amino acids, total phenolics content, total carotenoids and the associated functional and antioxidant abilities were analyzed, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition activity, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging ability and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Cell proliferation of fermented PE milk was also evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. RESULTS: Compared to the unfermented PE, fermented PE milk from Lactobacillus strains with the GAD gene showed higher levels of total phenolics, gamma-aminobutyric acid, ACE inhibitory activity, DPPH, and ORAC. The viability of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) determined by the MTT method decreased significantly when the cells were incubated with the PE and the fermented PE milk extracts. CONCLUSION: The consumption of fermented PE milk from Lactobacillus strains with the GAD gene is expected to benefit health. Further application as a health food is worthy of investigation.

We examined the association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers involved in the DNA repair enzyme pathway (ERCC1/2/4/5, XRCC1/2/4/5) and the clinical outcomes following an imatinib therapy in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. A total of 169 Korean patients were included. Of the 19 SNPs from these patients, those with the TT genotype of ERCC1 (rs11615) showed a higher probability of achieving major cytogenetic response [P = 0.002, HR 5.14 (95 % CI 1.83-14.43)], complete cytogenetic response [P = 0.012, HR 3.47 (95 % CI 1.31-9.17)], and major molecular response [P = 0.001, HR 5.71 (95 % CI 2.13-15.30)] than those with CC or CT genotypes. This suggests that SNP markers on ERCC1 may predict the response to imatinib therapy, which proposes the potential involvement of the DNA repair machinery in the mechanism of imatinib action in chronic phase CML.","['Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been achieved by a continuously intensified therapy and progress in supportive care to prevent and treat complications. In Germany, the AML-BFM trials 98 (n=413) and 2004 (n=499) enrolled 912 children and adolescents as protocol patients (1998-2010). The 5-year-overall survival was 71+/-2%. In the previous studies prognosis and subsequent treatment stratification based on morphology, cytochemistry and white blood cell count. Today, the identification of new genetic aberrations in AML enables a genetically determined estimation of prognosis, although treatment response must be considered for treatment stratification. The group with a favorable prognosis summarized AML with t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), t(1;11), and AML with normal karyotype and NPM1-mutation (n=253; EFS 74+/-3%, OS 88+/-2%).

We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of fractionated doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) combined with a standard 3 + 7 induction regimen in young patients with AML in first relapse. Salvage regimen consisted of GO 3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, and 7; cytarabine, 200 mg/m(2) on days 1-7; and daunorubicine, 60 mg/m(2); or idarubicine, 12 mg/m(2) on days 1-3. Fourteen patients were treated between April 2008 and April 2011. Median age was 46 years (29-58), median white blood cell count is 3.4 10(9)/L (0.9-19), and median first complete remission (CR) duration is 11 months (1-42). All the patients had previously received high or intermediate doses of cytarabine as consolidation therapy. Salvage treatment was performed as scheduled for the 14 patients, using daunorubicine in 12 patients and idarubicine in two. Overall response rate was 79 % with six CR and five CR with incomplete platelet recovery. Median times to neutrophil (>0.5 10(9)/L) and platelet (>20 10(9)/L) recovery were 29 days (23-32) and 36 days (28-48), respectively. Allogeneic transplantation was performed in the 11 responding patients within a median time of 4 months (3-10). Three mild and one moderate veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred after salvage and two moderate VOD after transplantation. Median and 2-year overall survival (OS) were 10 months and 42 %, respectively. For responders, estimated 2-year OS was 53 % (median OS not reached). This salvage regimen seems safe and effective in younger patients with AML in first relapse allowing allogeneic transplantation in CR2 for most patients.","[""Service d'hematologie clinique, Hopital d'Instruction des Armees Percy, 101 Av Henri Barbusse, 92141 Clamart, France. jvmalf@free.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zebularine but not RG108 caused dose- and time-dependent cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. However, co-treatment with either drug at a non-toxic dose and all trans retinoic acid (RA) reinforced differentiation to granulocytes, while 24 or 48 h-pretreatment with zebularine or RG108 followed by RA alone or in the presence of HDAC inhibitors (sodium phenyl butyrate or BML-210) significantly accelerated and enhanced cell maturation to granulocytes. This occurs in parallel with the expression of a surface biomarker, CD11b, and early changes in histone H4 acetylation and histone H3K4me3 methylation. The application of both drugs to HL-60 cells in continuous or sequential fashion decreased DNMT1 expression, and induced E-cadherin promoter demethylation and reactivation at both the mRNA and the protein levels in association with the induction of granulocytic differentiation. The results confirmed the utility of zebularine and RG108 in combinations with RA and HDAC inhibitors to reinforce differentiation effects in promyelocytic leukemia.","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-six CML patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance received nilotinib treatment at the dose of 400 mg once or twice daily. The patients were followed up for nearly 5 years with regular monitoring of the hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular biological markers and recording of the clinical manifestations and biochemical indicators to evaluate the therapeutic effect and adverse events. RESULTS: The median duration of nilotinib therapy was 17 (1-56) months, and the patients were follow up for a median of 51 months. At the last follow-up, 16 (61.5%) patients achieved a complete hematologic response, 13 (50.0%) achieved a major cytogenetic response, 9 (34.6%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response, and 7 (26.9%) achieved a major molecular response accumulatively. Nonhematologic adverse events were mostly of grade l or 2. The most common adverse effects possibly related to nilotinib were increased bilirubin (69.2%) and rash (57.7%). Grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse events included thrombocytopenia (53.8%), neutropenia (26.9%) and anemia (19.2%). The patients in chronic and remission phase had better efficacy and fewer hematological side effects than those in advanced phase. CONCLUSION: Nilotinib is an effective and safe treatment option for imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML patients, especially for those in chronic and remission phase.","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. wyq1973@163.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"The inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP1 is a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is constitutively activated in 50-70% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Ten different missense mutations in SHIP1 have been described in 3% of AML patients suggesting a functional role of SHIP1 in AML. Here, we report the identification of two new SHIP1 mutations T162P and R225W that were detected in 2 and 1 out of 96 AML patients, respectively. The functional analysis of all 12 AML-associated SHIP1 mutations, one ALL-associated SHIP1 mutation (Q1076X) and a missense SNP (H1168Y) revealed that two mutations i.e. Y643H and P1039S abrogated the ability of SHIP1 to reduce constitutive PI3K/AKT signaling in Jurkat cells. The loss of function of SHIP1 mutant Y643H which is localized in the inositol phosphatase domain was due to a reduction of the specific activity by 84%. Because all other SHIP1 mutants had a normal enzymatic activity, we assumed that these SHIP1 mutants may be functionally impaired due to a loss of interaction with plasma membrane receptors or adapter proteins. In agreement with this model, we found that the SHIP1 mutant F28L located in the FLVR motif of the SH2 domain was incapable of binding tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including the GM-CSF receptor and that the SHIP1 mutant Q1076X lost its ability to bind to the C-terminal SH3 domain of the adapter protein Grb2. In addition, SHIP1 mutant P1039S which does not reduce PI3K/AKT signaling anymore is located in a PXXP SH3 domain consensus binding motif suggesting that mutation of the conserved proline residue interferes with binding of SHIP1 to a so far unidentified SH3 domain containing protein. In summary, our data indicate that SHIP1 mutations detected in human leukemia patients impair the negative regulatory function of SHIP1 on PI3K/AKT signaling in leukemia cells either directly by reduced enzymatic activity or indirectly by disturbed protein interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane receptors or adapter proteins. These results further support a functional role of SHIP1 as tumor suppressor protein in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Center of Experimental Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation of serum CRP with clinical and laboratory parameters proven to be related to the cause of infection in pediatric cancer patients. METHODS: We studied prospectively for a 12-month period, 37 pediatric cancer patients, who presented with 70 episodes of febrile illness (38 bacterial and 13 viral infections). At fever's onset and 48 h later, infection indices, such as CRP, WBC, ANC were measured in the peripheral blood. Moreover we calculated the change rate of CRP over 48 h [CRP/t=(CRP48h-initial CRP)/t (t=2 days)]. Cultures of biological fluids, PCR and antibody detection of infectious agents were also obtained. RESULTS: When comparing patients with viral vs. bacterial infections, mean CRP levels on admission (11.0 vs. 33.1mg/L, p=0.005) and at 48 h (13.4 vs. 71.9 mg/L, p=0.0007), and CRP/t (0.9 vs. 18.8 mg/L/day, p=0.030) were significantly lower in the group with viral infection. At 48 h - follow-up, patients with positive culture had higher CRP levels (57.3 vs. 43.3mg/L, p=0.048) and higher CRP/t (15.9 vs. 7.7 mg/L/day, p=0.025), compared to those without proven infection. CRP/t at 48 h was correlated with both the fever duration (r=0.27, p=0.027) and maximum temperature (Tmax) during the febrile episode (r=0.30, p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Single CRP values on fever initiation can differentiate between viral and bacterial infections in febrile pediatric cancer patients. Moreover the change rate of CRP over time (CRP/t) is offered as a prognostic index of bacterial infection and a marker of the total duration of fever and Tmax.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Aghia Sofia Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece. riginagr@yahoo.gr""]",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

While relationships between psychosocial factors, immune function, and clinical outcomes have been documented in other cancer populations, similar studies of cancer patients undergoing HSCT have not yet been conducted. The clinical significance of these relationships may be particularly salient in this population given the critical role of a timely immune recovery and optimal immune regulation in preventing infections, mitigating risk for graft-versus-host disease, and eliminating malignant cells, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Evidence for the potential role of biobehavioral processes following HSCT is reviewed, mechanisms by which psychosocial factors may influence immune processes relevant to post-transplant outcomes are discussed, and a framework to ground future psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) research in this area is provided.

Leukemia stem cells (LSC) might originate from malignant transformation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), or alternatively, from progenitors in which the acquired mutations have re-installed a dysregulated self-renewal program. Since LSC, similar to their normal counterparts, divide extreme slowly, this might account for the ineffectiveness of conventional chemotherapy in inducing long-term cure. The present review will focus on the detection of LSC, their cellular and molecular biology, their genetic heterogeneity and on correlative studies that have demonstrated the clinical significance of estimating LSC burden. For long-term cure of AML, it is of importance to define LSC candidates and to understand their biology compared to normal HSC. Finally, we will discuss the perspectives of developing treatment strategies for eradication of LSC.","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the gene expression of B cells in 112 CLL patients divided into three classes: class 1 with MTZAP70(-), class 2 with UMZAP70(+), and class 3 included both UMZAP70(-) and MTZAP70(+). RESULTS: We found LPL, AGPAT2, MBOAT1, CHPT1, AGPAT4, PLD1 genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid metabolism overexpressed in UMZAP70(+). In addition, this study identified ARSD, a gene belonging to the sphingolipid metabolism, as a new gene significantly overexpressed in UMZAP70(+) compared to MTZAP70(-). Western blots confirmed that ARSD protein levels were significantly different between the 3 classes of patients and normal controls. Statistical analysis identified a significant correlation between ARSD and IGVH; however, both ARSD protein level and IGVH were independently associated with the need for therapy of CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: ARSD is a novel prognostic factor as the time to start therapy is shorter in patients with high levels of ARSD protein and sphingolipid metabolism could represent a new biological mechanism in CLL.","['Department of Oncology, Division of Hematology, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy. alessandra.trojani@ospedaleniguarda.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"TrxG and PcG complexes play key roles in the epigenetic regulation of development through H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification at specific sites throughout the human genome, but how these sites are selected is poorly understood. We find that in pluripotent cells, clustered CpG-islands at genes predict occupancy of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and these ""bivalent"" chromatin domains precisely span the boundaries of CpG-island clusters. These relationships are specific to pluripotent stem cells and are not retained at H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 sites unique to differentiated cells. We show that putative transcripts from clustered CpG-islands predict stem-loop structures characteristic of those bound by PcG complexes, consistent with the possibility that RNA facilitates PcG recruitment or maintenance at these sites. These studies suggest that CpG-island structure plays a fundamental role in establishing developmentally important chromatin structures in the pluripotent genome, and a subordinate role in establishing TrxG/PcG chromatin structure at sites unique to differentiated cells.","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Serum DNA of 112 mothers to leukemic children was amplified using whole genome amplification. Sequencing identified one TT virus (TTV) isolate belonging to a known type and two putatively new TTVs. For 22 mothers, we also performed TTV amplification by general primer PCR before sequencing. This detected 39 TTVs, two of which were identical to the TTVs found after whole genome amplification. Altogether, we found 40 TTV isolates, 29 of which were putatively new types (similarities ranging from 89% to 69%).

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"CD10 is an important cell marker in the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and of breast myoepithelial (ME) cells in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the value of CD10 as a marker of canine ME cells using immunohistochemistry on routinely processed normal, dysplastic and neoplastic mammary tissue. Five different CD10 positive cell types were identified on the basis of cell morphology, pattern of immunoreactivity, and on the co-expression of additional cell lineage-specific markers. Type 1 cells were typical fusiform cells with a ME cell phenotype (calponin- and cytokeratin [CK] 14-positive, CK8/18-negative). Type 2 cells were typical or atypical polyhedral cells with a luminal epithelial (LE) cell phenotype (calponin- and CK14-negative, CK8/18-positive). Type 3 cells had a type 1 phenotype with variable morphology, and type 4 were atypical neoplastic cells with a mixed ME/LE phenotype. Type 5 cells were typical fusiform cells with a stromal phenotype. Type 1 cells were considered normal ME cells and were found in all sample types; type 2 cells were considered normal or neoplastic LE cells and were also found in all sample types; types 3 and 4 cells were restricted to tumour samples and to malignant tumours, respectively, and type 5 cells were found in all sample types, although predominantly in neoplastic tissue. The findings indicate that the CD10 antigen is a sensitive (although not specific) marker of canine ME cells in normal, dysplastic and neoplastic mammary tissue. Differences in the distribution and staining intensity of CD10-positive cells suggest a number of potential roles for this protein in the pathogenesis of canine mammary neoplasia.","['Department of Comparative Pathology, Veterinary Faculty, University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain. v32sancr@uco.es']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"Human T-lymphotrophic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infects approximately 15-20 million people worldwide, with endemic areas in Japan, the Caribbean, and Africa. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids containing infected cells most often from mother to child through breast milk or via blood transfusion. After prolonged latency periods, approximately 3-5% of HTLV-1 infected individuals will develop either adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, or other lymphocyte-mediated disorders such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. The genome of this complex retrovirus contains typical gag, pol, and env genes, but also unique nonstructural proteins encoded from the pX region. These nonstructural genes encode the Tax and Rex regulatory proteins, as well as novel proteins essential for viral spread in vivo such as p30, p12, p13 and the antisense-encoded HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ). While progress has been made in knowledge of viral determinants of cell transformation and host immune responses, host and viral determinants of HTLV-1 transmission and spread during the early phases of infection are unclear. Improvements in the molecular tools to test these viral determinants in cellular and animal models have provided new insights into the early events of HTLV-1 infection.

Epub 2012 Jul 19.,"The long-term evolution of familial myeloproliferative neoplasms was studied in 93 families with 227 subjects including 97 with polycythemia vera (PV), 105 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 14 primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and 11 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In PV patients, with 12years of median follow-up, overall survival was 83% at 10years and 37% at 20years. A high JAK2(V617F) allele burden was correlated with the transformation to myelofibrosis (p<0.0001), but not with the transformation to acute leukemia. Among the 105 ET, with 8years of median follow-up, overall survival was 83% at 10years and 57% at 20years. Progression to acute leukemia and progression to myelofibrosis were 10% and 13%. There was a trend toward a more frequent evolution to myelofibrosis when the JAK2(V617F) mutated allele burden was >50% (p=0.09), but not to AML. Hematologic transformation of the MPN was responsible for 69% of the deaths, cerebral stroke for 7% and 4% died of myocardial infarction. Eleven JAK2(V617F) mutated patients developed 13 deep splanchnic thromboses in PV and ET. Finally whereas patients with familial PV and ET have a comparable prognosis to non-familial MPN, the JAK2(V617F) mutation was associated with a more frequent occurrence of thrombosis in the entire population.","['Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Saint-Antoine, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are in advanced clinical development as cancer therapeutic agents. However, first generation HDACIs such as butyrate and valproate are simple short chain aliphatic compounds with moieties resembling acetyl groups, and have a broad spectrum of activity against HDACs. More complex second generation HDACIs undergoing clinical trials, such as the benzamide group compounds MS-275 and MGCD0103, are specific primarily for HDAC1 and HDAC2. To expand the repertoire of available HDACIs and HDAC specificities we created a novel benzamide-based compound named MI-192. When tested against purified recombinant HDACs, MI-192 had marked selectivity for the class I enzymes, HDAC2 and HDAC3. Screening in the NCI60 screen demonstrated that MI-192 had greatly enhanced efficacy against cells of leukaemic origin. When tested in culture against the acute myeloid leukaemic cell lines U937, HL60 and Kasumi-1, MI-192 induced differentiation and was cytotoxic through promotion of apoptosis. MI-192 therefore justifies further investigation and development as a potential therapeutic agent for use in leukaemia.","['Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, UK.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2012 Jul 19.,"The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are the standard of care for treating patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Compared with interferon-based treatment, the previous standard of care, imatinib is associated with significantly higher cytogenetic response rates and prolonged overall survival. Nilotinib and dasatinib, both newer and more potent TKIs, significantly improve cytogenetic and molecular response rates compared with imatinib. Despite significant advances in CML treatment enabled by the TKIs, a fraction of patients who receive frontline treatment with a TKI demonstrate inadequate response. The reasons for this vary, but in many cases, inadequate response can be attributed to non-adherence to the treatment regimen, intolerance to the drug, intrinsic or acquired resistance to the drug, or a combination of reasons. More often than not, strategies to improve response necessitate a change in treatment plan, either a dose adjustment or a switch to an alternate drug, particularly in the case of drug intolerance or drug resistance. Improved physician-patient communication and patient education are effective strategies to address issues relating to adherence and intolerance. Because inadequate response to TKI treatment correlates with poor long-term outcomes, it is imperative that patients who experience intolerance or who fail to achieve appropriate responses are carefully evaluated so that appropriate treatment modifications can be made to maximize the likelihood of positive long-term outcome.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Room 4214 CC, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States. dbixby@umich.edu']",,['Copyright (c) 2012.

We describe a case of congenital acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and invasive fungal rhinosinusitis involving Acremonium and Phoma species, not previously reported in invasive pediatric fungal rhinosinusitis, and review all published cases of human Phoma infections. METHODS: A literature and institutional review for Phoma spp. was completed including patient demographics, infection site, immune status, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: A female neonate with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with hyperleukocytosis and advanced invasive Phoma and Acremonium spp. rhinosinusitis. Despite aggressive medical and surgical therapy, the disease progressed to a rhinocerebral infection with a fatal outcome. Twenty cases of Phoma spp. were found in a complete literature search, including 6 females and 14 males from 18 months to 77 years old. Infections were superficial in fifteen patients and involved deeper tissue in five patients, with sites including cutaneous, subcutaneous and deep tissue sites (eye, lung, extremity deep tissue compartments). CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the risks and grave prognosis of fulminant invasive fungal rhinosinusitis in the context of congenital leukemia, and the potential for rare fungal species in neonates with immunosuppression.","['University of Connecticut Health Center, Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT 06030-6228, United States. corrie.roehm@gmail.com']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), normal karyotypes are common, and genomic instability is unusual. To better understand clonal evolution in AML, we sequenced the genomes of M3-AML samples with a known initiating event (PML-RARA) versus the genomes of normal karyotype M1-AML samples and the exomes of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy people. Collectively, the data suggest that most of the mutations found in AML genomes are actually random events that occurred in HSPCs before they acquired the initiating mutation; the mutational history of that cell is ""captured"" as the clone expands. In many cases, only one or two additional, cooperating mutations are needed to generate the malignant founding clone. Cells from the founding clone can acquire additional cooperating mutations, yielding subclones that can contribute to disease progression and/or relapse.","['Department of Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

From a systems biology perspective, Proteins/genes interactions encode the key mechanisms distinguishing disease and health, and such mechanisms can be uncovered through network analysis. An effective network analysis tool should integrate different content-specific PPI databases into a comprehensive network format with a user-friendly platform to identify key functional modules/pathways and the underlying mechanisms of disease and toxicity. RESULTS: atBioNet integrates seven publicly available PPI databases into a network-specific knowledge base. Knowledge expansion is achieved by expanding a user supplied proteins/genes list with interactions from its integrated PPI network. The statistically significant functional modules are determined by applying a fast network-clustering algorithm (SCAN: a Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks). The functional modules can be visualized either separately or together in the context of the whole network. Integration of pathway information enables enrichment analysis and assessment of the biological function of modules. Three case studies are presented using publicly available disease gene signatures as a basis to discover new biomarkers for acute leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and breast cancer. The results demonstrated that atBioNet can not only identify functional modules and pathways related to the studied diseases, but this information can also be used to hypothesize novel biomarkers for future analysis. CONCLUSION: atBioNet is a free web-based network analysis tool that provides a systematic insight into proteins/genes interactions through examining significant functional modules. The identified functional modules are useful for determining underlying mechanisms of disease and biomarker discovery.

We performed a phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in patients with MDS in Japan. Patients with MDS with red cell transfusion dependence or 5-30% blasts in marrow and with an International Prognostic Scoring System score of intermediate-1 or higher were eligible. Patients received intravenous decitabine at 15 or 20 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days every 4 weeks. A total of 37 patients were enrolled. Three patients received 15 mg/m(2) and experienced no dose limiting toxicity during the first cycle. Thirty-four patients received 20 mg/m(2) . Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicities included cerebral infarction (n = 1), subdural hematoma (n = 1), elevated blood glucose (n = 1), and pulmonary hypertension (n = 1). At 20 mg/m(2) , complete response, partial response, and hematologic improvement were observed in 7 (20.6%), 2 (5.9%), and 7 (20.6%) patients, respectively. Complete cytogenetic response was observed in 30% of evaluable 20 patients. The median number of cycles to clinical response was 4 (range 4-8), and duration of remission was 474+ days (range 294-598+). The 2-year rate of acute myeloid leukemia-free survival was 52%. Correlative studies revealed hypomethylation in multiple genes in peripheral blood cells after treatment. Hypomethylation was generally more profound in CD15 + peripheral blood cells, which reflects myeloid cells, than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In summary, decitabine was safe and demonstrated efficacy in Japanese patients with high-risk MDS.

Epub 2012 Jul 17.,"The use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to repair diseased or injured brain is promising technology with significant humanitarian, societal and economic impact. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The generation of this cell type will fulfill a currently unmet therapeutic need. We report on the isolation and perpetuation of a midbrain-specified self-renewable human neural stem cell line (hNSCs) from hESCs. These hNSCs grew as a monolayer and uniformly expressed the neural precursor markers nestin, vimentin and a radial glial phenotype. We describe a process to direct the differentiation of these hNSCs towards the DA lineage. Glial conditioned media acted synergistically with fibroblastic growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor to induce the expression of the DA marker, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), in the hNSC progeny. The glial-derived neurotrophic factor did not fully mimic the effects of conditioned media. The hNSCs expressed the midbrain-specific transcription factors Nurr1 and Pitx3. The inductive effects did not modify the level of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) transcript, a marker for GABAergic neurons, while the TH transcript increased 10-fold. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that the TH-expressing cells did not co-localize with GAD. The transplantation of these DA-induced hNSCs into the non-human primate MPTP model of PD demonstrated that the cells maintain their DA-induced phenotype, extend neurite outgrowths and express synaptic markers.","['Department of Neurosurgery, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America. mdaadi@stanford.edu']",,,['R55 NS040822/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 16.,"Clinical development of imatinib in CML established continuous target inhibition as a paradigm for successful tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. However, recent reports suggested that transient potent target inhibition of BCR-ABL by high-dose TKI (HD-TKI) pulse-exposure is sufficient to irreversibly commit cells to apoptosis. Here, we report a novel mechanism of prolonged intracellular TKI activity upon HD-TKI pulse-exposure (imatinib, dasatinib) in BCR-ABL-positive cells. Comprehensive mechanistic exploration revealed dramatic intracellular accumulation of TKIs which closely correlated with induction of apoptosis. Cells were rescued from apoptosis upon HD-TKI pulse either by repetitive drug wash-out or by overexpression of ABC-family drug transporters. Inhibition of ABCB1 restored sensitivity to HD-TKI pulse-exposure. Thus, our data provide evidence that intracellular drug retention crucially determines biological activity of imatinib and dasatinib. These studies may refine our current thinking on critical requirements of TKI dose and duration of target inhibition for biological activity of TKIs.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Otto-von-Guericke-University, Magdeburg, Germany.']",,,['G0600782/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently showed that aberrant LEF1 expression induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice, and found high LEF1 expression in a subset of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients. Whether LEF1 expression associates with clinical and molecular patient characteristics and treatment outcomes remained unknown. We therefore studied LEF1 expression in 210 adults with CN-AML treated on German AML Cooperative Group trials using microarrays. High LEF1 expression (LEF1high) associated with significantly better relapse-free survival (RFS; P < .001), overall survival (OS; P < .001), and event-free survival (EFS; P < .001). In multivariable analyses adjusting for established prognosticators, LEF1high status remained associated with prolonged RFS (P = .007), OS (P = .01), and EFS (P = .003). In an independent validation cohort of 196 CN-AML patients provided by the German-Austrian AML Study Group, LEF1high patients had significantly longer OS (P = .02) and EFS (P = .04). We validated the prognostic relevance of LEF1 expression by quantitative PCR, thereby providing a clinically applicable platform to incorporate this marker into future risk-stratification systems for CN-AML. Gene-expression profiling and immunophenotyping revealed up-regulation of lymphopoiesis-related genes and lymphoid cell-surface antigens in LEF1high patients. In summary, we provide evidence that high LEF1 expression is a novel favorable prognostic marker in CN-AML.","['Department of Internal Medicine III and Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven patients (6.4%) required permanent dasatinib discontinuation. Only presence of concomitant pulmonary disease ( p = 0.035) and initial daily dose of dasatinib (140 mg vs 100 mg, p = 0.014) were significantly associated with pleural effusions.

We observed that FK866 induced apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation in NB-4, OCI-AML3 and MOLM-13 cell lines. In contrast, the leukemia cell lines, K-562 and Kasumi, containing nonfunctional p53 were relatively unaffected by FK866 treatment. Importantly, direct inhibition of sirtuins significantly reduced the viability of NB-4, OCI-AML3 and MOLM-13 cell lines. Activation of p53 by FK866 involved increased acetylation of p53 at lysine 382 with subsequent increase in the expression of p21 and BAX. Further, knockdown of p53 attenuated the effects of FK866 on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, which was partly associated with decreased expression of p21 and BAX. Our results suggest the role of p53 acetylation pathway in the anti-leukemic effect of FK866.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Carl Neuberg Str-1, 30625 Hannover, Germany. thakur.basant@mh-hannover.de']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 20.,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are indispensable for the treatment of patients with hematological disorders such as leukemia. However, the amount of available transplantable HSCs is limited. Therefore, new approaches to multiply HSCs in the laboratory are needed. Promising biomimetic technologies for HSC expansion are currently developed. This feature article gives an insight into the significance of this approach and introduces the essential building blocks (cells, matrix, and scaffolds) of biomimetic materials. Some recent strategies are highlighted and the challenges and possible applications of such materials are discussed.","['Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Functional Interfaces, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344, Germany.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The species studied were: Annona pickelii Diels (Annonaceae), Annona salzmannii A. DC. (Annonaceae), Guatteria blepharophylla Mart. (Annonaceae), Guatteria hispida (R. E. Fr.) Erkens & Maas (Annonaceae), Hancornia speciosa Gomes (Apocynaceae), Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae), Kielmeyera rugosa Choisy (Clusiaceae), Lippia gracilis Schauer (Verbenaceae), and Hyptis calida Mart. Ex Benth (Lamiaceae). Different types of extractions from several parts of plants resulted in 43 extracts. Their cytotoxicity was tested against HCT-8 (colon carcinoma), MDA-MB-435 (melanoma), SF-295 (glioblastoma), and HL-60 (promielocitic leukemia) human tumor cell lines, using the thiazolyl blue test (MTT) assay. The active extracts were those obtained from G. blepharophylla, G. hispida, J. curcas, K. rugosa, and L. gracilis. In addition, seven compounds isolated from the active extracts were tested; among them, beta-pinene found in G. hispida and one coumarin isolated from K. rugora showed weak cytotoxic activity. In summary, this manuscript contributes to the understanding of the potentialities of Brazilian plants as sources of new anticancer drugs.","['Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Sergipe, Sao Cristovao, Sergipe, Brazil.']",,['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

This study, using a comparative transcriptomics approach, uncovered genomic expression patterns and molecular pathways that distinctively differentiated 56MESS and cisplatin in the eukaryote model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). Down-regulation of sulfur assimilation, cellular respiration, and energy metabolism were characteristics of 56MESS while up-regulation of these pathways and genes in cell cycle was the action of cisplatin. Furthermore, de novo purine biosynthesis and glycine metabolism were induced by 56MESS but suppressed by cisplatin. Different effects on intracellular concentrations of iron and copper were evident, with 56MESS more profoundly inducing genes controlling uptake of these ions than cisplatin. Finally, apart from 56MESS, additional metallointercalators including 56MEEN, 5MERR and 5MESS were subsequently identified to be more active in a cisplatin-resistant mouse leukaemia L1210cisR cell line than cisplatin, which provides multiple lead compounds for future drug development.","['School of Medicine, University of Western Sydney, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith South DC, NSW, 2751, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Posaconazole has been approved for prophylaxis in HSCT. However, it is only available orally given three times per day. We evaluated once weekly intravenous amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), given its broad-spectrum antifungal activity and prolonged half-life (172 hr), as an alternative prophylaxis in HSCT. METHODS: We prospectively randomized allogeneic HSCT patients to receive 7.5 mg/kg of intravenous ABLC weekly or 200 mg of posaconazole orally three times per day as prophylaxis for up to 6 weeks. Endpoints were the incidence of IFI and drug-related toxicities. ABLC was discontinued if creatinine level increased to two times the baseline or greater. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were randomized; 40 received at least one dose of the drug and were included in the analysis: 19 received ABLC and 21 received posaconazole. All patients received tacrolimus. Apache II score, neutropenia, and creatinine, bilirubin, and alanine aminotransferase levels were similar in both groups at baseline. One patient in the ABLC arm and none in posaconazole arm developed IFI (5% vs. 0%, P=0.48). More patients in the ABLC arm doubled their serum creatinine (53% vs. 5%, P=0.001) necessitating discontinuation of the study drug. CONCLUSION: High-dose prophylactic ABLC in HSCT was associated with nephrotoxicity that could be aggravated by the concomitant use of other nephrotoxic agents. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of weekly high-dose ABLC as antifungal prophylaxis in patients at lower risk for nephrotoxicity.","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA. achaftar@mdanderson.org']",,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00750737'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 35% were wild-type (WT) for both genes (NOTCH1(WT)FBXW7(WT)), 38% single NOTCH1 mutant (NOTCH1(Single)FBXW7(WT)), 3% just FBXW7 mutant (NOTCH1(WT)FBXW7(MUT)) and 24% either double NOTCH1 mutant (NOTCH1(Double)FBXW7(WT)) or mutant in both genes (NOTCH1(MUT)FBXW7(MUT)), hereafter called as NOTCH1+/-FBXW7(Double). There was no difference between groups in early response to therapy, but NOTCH1+/-FBXW7(Double) patients were more likely to be associated with negative minimal residual disease (MRD) post-induction than NOTCH1(WT)FBXW7(WT) patients (71% versus 40%, P=0.004).

Epub 2012 Jul 18.,"BACKGROUND: Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias (t-AML), with balanced translocations affecting the 11q23 point in the myeloid/lymphoid leukemia (MLL) gene, are one of the most serious complications of treatments with topoisomerase II inhibitors. However, only a few reports of t-AML exist. We aimed to study if these translocations are cumulative-dose-dependent, their frequency in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and the relationship between their presence, the type of therapy and the response criteria. METHODS: This retrospective study included 120 patients with various malignancies (108 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 8 Hodgkin's disease and 4 neuroblastoma) in remission, being treated with topoisomerase 2 inhibitors; 74 had been diagnosed with therapy-related myelodysplasia and 46 did not have dysplasia. All bone marrow biopsy samples were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization for 11q23 point breakage in the MLL gene. RESULTS: MLL gene rearrangement frequency was 6% in dysplastic versus 2% in nondysplastic groups; p < 0.001. It was associated with a worse overall survival (mean 13 +/- 2 vs. 39 +/- 3 months, log-rank p value <0.0001). It was dose-dependent with a cut-off value of 290 mg/kg of topoisomerase II inhibitors as assessed by ROC curve (area under the curve 0.84 +/- 0.05, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that the MLL gene is etiopathogenetically relevant for hematological neoplasias transformation and survival.","['Department of Clinical Pathology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut, Egypt.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

Herein, we used S1, previously identified as a Mcl-1/Bcl-2 dual inhibitor and a pure BH3 mimetic, to explore the mechanism of Mcl-1's action and supply a strategy to challenge Mcl-1's protection. Apoptosis assay in SMMC-7721, HCT116, and K562 cells demonstrated that S1 can effectively challenge Mcl-1's anti-apoptotic effect. Notably, we discovered an unexpected dynamic change of Mcl-1 that directly correlates with resistance or commitment to apoptosis induced by both ABT-737 and S1. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Mcl-1 increase results from Bim trafficking from Bcl-2 to Mcl-1, while subsequent Bak released by S1 determines Mcl-1 decrease and full-blown apoptosis. Further experiments using Bak shRNA testified that Bak accounts for S1-induced apoptosis and Mcl-1 decrease. Consistently, Bax-deficient DU145 cells are sensitive to S1, whereas Bak-mutant MKN-28 cells are significantly more resistant. The in vitro model could be extended to an in vivo mouse xenograft model in which Mcl-1 confers resistance by increased protein level, and the release of Bak could serve as a biomarker of apoptosis.","[""State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 17.,"Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) is high after HLA-mismatched umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation (UCBT). In utero, exposure to noninherited maternal antigen (NIMA) is recognized by the fetus, which induces T regulator cells to that haplotype. It is plausible that UCBTs in which recipients are matched to donor NIMAs may alleviate some of the excess mortality associated with this treatment. To explore this concept, we used marginal matched-pair Cox regression analysis to compare outcomes in 48 NIMA-matched UCBTs (ie, the NIMA of the donor UCB unit matched to the patient) and in 116 non-NIMA-matched UCBTs. All patients had a hematologic malignancy and received a single UCB unit. Cases and controls were matched on age, disease, disease status, transplantation-conditioning regimen, HLA match, and infused cell dose. TRM was lower after NIMA-matched UCBTs compared with NIMA-mismatched UCBTs (relative risk, 0.48; P = .05; 18% versus 32% at 5 years posttransplantation). Consequently, overall survival was higher after NIMA-matched UCBT. The 5-year probability of overall survival was 55% after NIMA-matched UCBTs versus 38% after NIMA-mismatched UCBTs (P = .04). When faced with the choice of multiple HLA-mismatched UCB units containing adequate cell doses, selecting an NIMA-matched UCB unit may improve survival after mismatched UCBT.","['Eurocord, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Dec;18(12):1773-5.

The interaction between SIRPalpha and CD47 plays an important role in regulating the phagocytosis of leukemia cells and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) by macrophages. Blocking antibodies against CD47 have been shown to promote phagocytosis of LSCs by macrophages. Here, we consider an alternative way to interrupt the interaction between CD47 and SIRPalpha. We expressed the extracellular domains of the human SIRPalpha (hSIRP(ext)) and the human CD47 (hCD47(ext)) in Escherichia coli as Trx fusion proteins, and purified them by using affinity chromatography. We show that the purified fusion protein Trx-SIRP(ext) could interact in vitro with Trx-hCD47(ext). Moreover, Trx-SIRP(ext) could effectively bind to Jurkat T-ALL cells, which expressed CD47 at a high level. CD47(ext), on the other hand, bound to human macrophages. In vitro phagocytosis assay showed that these fusion proteins could enhance the phagocytosis of Jurkat cells by macrophage, with Trx-hSIRP(ext) showed a higher efficiency than Trx-CD47(ext). These results indicated that the soluble Trx-hSIRP(ext) and Trx-CD47(ext) polypeptides could be alternative molecules to interrupt CD47-SIRPalpha interaction between leukemia cells and macrophages, and might be potentially useful for the targeted therapy of leukemia.","[""Department of Hematology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China.""]",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In two previously reported cases of GCH in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) liver failure ensued. Autoimmune and infective causes have been implicated but its etiology remains unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female with CLL presented with acute hepatitis with negative viral and auto-immune serologies and without any prior toxic exposure. Liver biopsy showed typical histological features of GCH. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Her liver enzymes returned to baseline and have remained normal as of the last follow up almost 4 years later. CONCLUSIONS: Association of GCH with CLL may be under recognized. Clinical suspicion of GCH in CLL patients with serology-negative hepatitis, early liver biopsy and therapeutic intervention may influence outcome.

Epub 2012 Sep 8.,"Improved therapeutic options for relapsing patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are urgently needed. Poor outcomes following salvage therapy have been reported in those with short initial remission duration, adverse risk karyotype, prior allograft, older age, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) AML and prior high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) induction therapy. We present a cohort of 58 patients (aged 18-70) treated with fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and amsacrine (FLAG-amsacrine) as salvage chemotherapy for AML at first relapse. 83% had received prior HiDAC-based therapy. The overall complete remission (CR/CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]) rate was 59%, with median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of 6.9 and 10.6 months, respectively. FLAG-amsacrine was an effective bridge to allogeneic transplant with 38% successfully transplanted with excellent outcomes (median OS not reached). FLAG-amsacrine was also effective in elderly patients (>/= 60 years), with 61% achieving second remission. The regimen was well tolerated, with 30- and 42-day treatment-related mortality of 3.4% and 13.8%, respectively. Outcomes remained poor in those with short initial remission duration (<6 months). We conclude that FLAG-amsacrine is a useful salvage option for AML at first relapse.","['Department of Clinical Hematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Sep 10.,"Pleural effusions are rarely observed in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Therefore the underlying etiology of pleural effusions and the efficacy and safety of pleural procedures in this population has not been well studied. In a retrospective review of cases from 1997 to 2007, we identified 111 patients with acute leukemia or MDS/MPN who underwent pleural procedures. Clinical characteristics were reviewed, and survival outcomes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. A total of 270 pleural procedures were performed in 111 patients (69 AML, 27 ALL, 15 MDS/MPN). The main indications for pleural procedures were possible infection (49%) and respiratory symptoms (48%), and concomitant clinical symptoms included fever (34%), dyspnea (74%), chest pain (24%) and cough (37%). Most patients had active disease (61%). The most frequent etiology of pleural effusions was infection (47%), followed by malignancy (36%). Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 20 x 10(3)/microL) was present in 43% of the procedures, yet the procedural complication rate was only 1.9%. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age, AML, MDS/MPN and active disease status were associated with a shorter median overall survival. Infection and malignant involvement are the most common causes of pleural effusion in patients with acute leukemia or MDS. After optimizing platelet count and coagulopathy, thoracentesis may be performed safely and with high diagnostic yield in this population. Survival in these patients is determined by the response to treatment of the hematologic malignancy.","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-1402, USA. safaiz@mdanderson.org']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity of adriamycin (ADR) alone or in combination with CH or verapamil (VER) in K562 and K562/ADR cells was determined by MTT assay. Based on flow cytometric technology, the effect of CH or VER on the uptake and efflux of rhodamine123 (Rho123) and the accumulation of ADR in these cells was detected by measuring Rho123 or ADR-associated mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The effects of CH and VER on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in K562 and K562/ADR cells were also measured using a flow cytometry with PE-conjugated P-glycoprotein antibody. The results show that CH significantly enhanced the sensitivity of K562/ADR cells to ADR, 4 micromol x L(-1) of CH enhanced the sensitivity of K562/ADR cells to ADR by 7.43 folds, the reversal activity was 3.19 times higher than that of verapamil. However, CH had no effect on drug-sensitive K562 cells (P < 0.05). CH increased Rho123 and ADR accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner (2-8 micromol x L(-1)) and inhibited the efflux of Rho123 from these cells, but did not affect the accumulation and efflux of Rho123 from the wild-type drug-sensitive K562 cells. The inhibition effect of CH on P-gp expression in K562/ADR cells is in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The reversal activity of CH is possibility related to inhibition of P-gp function and expression, which lead to an increased intracellular accumulation of anticancer drugs.","['Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The envelope protein of the virus was made by insertion of the 13-amino-acid peptide ligand for hAPJ, flanked by linker sequences, into one of the variable loops of the receptor binding domain of SL3-2, a murine leukemia virus (MLV) that uses the xenotropic-polytropic virus receptor Xpr1 and which has a host range limited to murine cells. This envelope protein can utilize hAPJ as well as murine Xpr1 for entry into host cells with equal efficiencies. In addition, the SL3-AP virus replicates in cells expressing either of its receptors, hAPJ and murine Xpr1, and causes resistance to superinfection and downregulation of hAPJ in infected cells. Thus, SL3-AP is the first example of a retargeted replication-competent retrovirus, with replication characteristics and receptor interference properties similar to those of natural isolates.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 18.,"Moloney leukemia virus type 10 protein (MOV10) is an RNA helicase that is induced by type I interferon. It inhibits HIV replication at several steps of its replicative cycle. Of interest, MOV10 is a component of mRNA processing (P) bodies, which inhibit retrotransposition (RTP) of intracisternal A particles (IAP). In this report, we studied the effects of MOV10 on IAP RTP and its dependence on P bodies. Indeed, MOV10 inhibited IAP RTP. It decreased significantly not only the products of reverse transcriptase but also its endogenous activity. MOV10 also associated with IAP RNA. Furthermore, although it was found in IAP virus-like particles, it did not affect their incorporation of IAP RNA, primer tRNAPhe (phenylalanine tRNA), or IAP Gag. Concerning P bodies, the exogenously expressed MOV10 had no effect on their size and number, and the inhibition of IAP RTP persisted despite the depletion of their RCK subunit. Thus, by interfering with reverse transcription, MOV10 inhibits IAP RTP, and this inhibition is independent of P bodies.","['Department of Medicine, Rosalind Russell Medical Research Center, University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, California, USA.']",,,"['P50 GMO82250/PHS HHS/United States', 'P50 GM081879/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM082250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027763/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI090935/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 18.,"Retroviruses integrated into genomic DNA participate in long-range gene activation from as far away as several hundred kilobases. Hypotheses have been put forth to account for these phenomena, but data have not been provided to support a physical mechanism that explains long-range activation. In murine leukemia virus-induced myeloid leukemia in mice, integrated proviruses have been found upstream of c-myb in three regions, named Mml1, Mml2, and Mml3 (25, 50, and 70 kb upstream, respectively). The transcription factor c-Myb is an oncogene whose dysregulation and/or mutation can lead to human leukemia. We hypothesized that the murine c-myb upstream region contains regulatory elements accessed by the retrovirus. To identify regulatory sites in the murine c-myb upstream region, we looked by chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray technology (ChIP-on-chip) for histone modifications implicating gene activation in normal cells. H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K9/14ac were enriched at Mml1 and/or Mml2 in the myeloblastic cell line M1, which expresses c-myb. The enrichment of all of these histone marks decreased with differentiation-induced downregulation of the gene in M1 cells but increased and spread in tumor cells containing integrated provirus. Importantly, using chromosome conformation capture (3C)-quantitative PCR assays, interactions between the 5' region, including the promoter and all Mml sites (Mml1, Mml2, and Mml3), were detected due to DNA looping in M1 cells and tumor cells with provirus in Mml1, Mml2, or Mml3. Therefore, our study provides a new mechanism of retrovirus insertional mutagenesis whereby spatial chromatin organization allows distally located provirus, with its own enhancer elements, to access the 5' regulatory region of the gene.","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['GEO/GSE34770'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 17.,"BACKGROUND: Inclusion in clinical trials is generally viewed as best practice for most newly diagnosed childhood cancers, but the impact on population-based survival has rarely been examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The population-based data were analysed for 25 853 children (66% of all registered childhood cancers) diagnosed in Britain during 1978-2005 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumour, hepatoblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and germ-cell tumours. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by log-rank tests. Time trends were analysed by Cox regression. Separate analyses were done for children with ALL, medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma according to clinically relevant age thresholds. RESULTS: Survival increased significantly during 1978-2005 for every diagnostic category; the annual reduction in risk of death ranged from 2.7% (rhabdomyosarcoma) to 12.0% (gonadal germ-cell tumours). Survival increased steadily between trial eras for ALL (age 1-14 years) and neuroblastoma (age 1-14 years), but changed little since the mid-1980s for medulloblastoma (age 0-2 years), osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in survival between trial eras parallel those reported by the relevant clinical trials. The increasing level of participation in trials, facilitated by the organisation of specialist care, has underpinned the substantial improvements in survival seen at the population level.","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Department of Paediatrics.

As in acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype (CK-AML) TP53 alterations are the most common known molecular lesion, we further analyzed the p53-miR-34a axis in a large cohort of CK-AML with known TP53 status (TP53(altered), n=57; TP53(unaltered), n=31; altered indicates loss and/or mutation of TP53). Profiling microRNA (miRNA) expression delineated TP53 alteration-associated miRNA profiles, and identified miR-34a and miR-100 as the most significantly down- and upregulated miRNA, respectively. Moreover, we found a distinct miR-34a expression-linked gene expression profile enriched for genes belonging to p53-associated pathways, and implicated in cell cycle progression or apoptosis. Clinically, low miR-34a expression and TP53 alterations predicted for chemotherapy resistance and inferior outcome. Notably, in TP53(unaltered) CK-AML, high miR-34a expression predicted for inferior overall survival (OS), whereas in TP53(biallelic altered) CK-AML, high miR-34a expression pointed to better OS. Thus, detailed molecular profiling links impaired p53 to decreased miR-34a expression, but also identifies p53-independent miR-34a induction mechanisms as shown in TP53(biallelic altered) cell lines treated with 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin. An improved understanding of this mechanism might provide novel therapeutic options to restore miR-34a function and thereby induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in TP53(altered) CK-AML.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 18.,"BACKGROUND: Mutations at arginine 132 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) have recently been demonstrated to be recurrent gene alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Subsequently, this mutation was also found in a variety of other hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative diseases, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Only a few cases were so far identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To study the IDH status in ALL patients, we analyzed 54 adult and 34 pediatric ALL samples' IDH1/2 gene. RESULTS: Three adult cases and no pediatric case with an isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation were identified. No isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation was identified in the total of 88 samples. The frequency of the IDH1 mutation in adult ALL was 5.5%. Among the three IDH1-mutated patients, two had normal karyotype and expressed the myeloid lineage markers. All three patients with an IDH1 mutation relapsed or died within 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the IDH1 R132 mutation might be a recurrent gene alteration in ALL; patients carrying the mutation have a trend to aberrantly express myeloid antigen and the mutation may imply a dismal outcome.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, P.R.

To investigate whether the AIDA protocol, which combines idarubicin, mitoxantrone, and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) results in late cardiotoxicity, 34 APL patients in long-term remission were evaluated. The cumulative dose of idarubicin and mitoxantrone were 80 mg/m(2) and 50 mg/m(2), respectively. Median follow-up was 7 years. Segmental wall motion abnormalities (SWMAs) were detected in 11 AIDA patients who still presented with an ejection fraction (EF) within normal limits (EF 56% in the AIDA group vs 59% in the control group, P=.01). However, parameters of diastolic dysfunction were significantly impaired in the AIDA group (E/A ratio: 1.04 in the AIDA group vs 1.28 in the control group, P=.001; E/E' lateral ratio: 10.04 in the AIDA group vs 5.79 in the control group, P</=.001) as well as left atrial volume (52 mL in the AIDA group vs 35 mL in the control group, P<.001).

A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made, and the patient received hematopoietic stem cell transplants, twice, from different donors. The first donor was his brother and the second donor was an unrelated man. Human leukocyte antigens between donors and recipient were fully matched. His clinical course was stable without acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease or relapse of acute myeloid leukemia with tacrolimus after the second hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Six months after the second hematopoietic stem cell transplant, tacrolimus was decreased gradually and discontinued because of tacrolimus-induced liver dysfunction. Three months after discontinuing the tacrolimus, the patient developed edema in his leg. The results of a blood analysis showed that plasma albumin level was 21 g/L and plasma total cholesterol level was 11.5 mmol/L, while results from a urinalysis showed proteinuria of 5.6 g/d without hematuria. No abnormalities in the skin, mucosal tissues, and other organs suggestive of chronic graft-versus-host disease were seen. A renal biopsy was done to investigate the cause, which revealed renal disease. Electron microscopic analysis showed dense deposits in the subepithelial region in all glomeruli. Immunofluorescence analysis showed the deposition of IgG4 and C3c in the subepithelial space of all glomeruli. Membranous nephropathy was diagnosed. He then was administered prednisolone at a dosage of 45 mg/d (0.7 mg/kg/d). After prednisolone treatment, urine protein and hypoalbuminemia were markedly improved, and his leg edema disappeared. These results suggest that this membranous nephropathy may have been de novo membranous nephropathy after hematopoietic stem cell transplant because it developed after hematopoietic stem cell transplants without chronic graft-versus-host disease.","['Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 13.,"In recent years, graph theoretical analyses of neuroimaging data have increased our understanding of the organization of large-scale structural and functional brain networks. However, tools for pipeline application of graph theory for analyzing topology of brain networks is still lacking. In this report, we describe the development of a graph-analysis toolbox (GAT) that facilitates analysis and comparison of structural and functional network brain networks. GAT provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates construction and analysis of brain networks, comparison of regional and global topological properties between networks, analysis of network hub and modules, and analysis of resilience of the networks to random failure and targeted attacks. Area under a curve (AUC) and functional data analyses (FDA), in conjunction with permutation testing, is employed for testing the differences in network topologies; analyses that are less sensitive to the thresholding process. We demonstrated the capabilities of GAT by investigating the differences in the organization of regional gray-matter correlation networks in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and healthy matched Controls (CON). The results revealed an alteration in small-world characteristics of the brain networks in the ALL survivors; an observation that confirm our hypothesis suggesting widespread neurobiological injury in ALL survivors. Along with demonstration of the capabilities of the GAT, this is the first report of altered large-scale structural brain networks in ALL survivors.","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America. hosseiny@stanford.edu']",,,"['DP2 OD004445/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA134639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 HD054720/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '1 DP2 OD004445-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 12.,"HIV-1 exploits numerous host cellular pathways for productive infection. To identify novel factors involved in HIV-1 replication, HIV-1 integrase and matrix protein complexes were captured at 4 hours post infection for proteomic analysis using an affinity purification system. Leucine-rich PPR-motif containing (LRPPRC) protein, a cellular protein involved in mitochondrial function, cell metabolism, and cell-cycle progression was identified as one of the candidate HIV-1 factors. Co-immunoprecipitation RT-PCR experiments confirmed that LRPPRC associated with HIV-1 nucleic acids during the early steps of virus infection. To establish if LRPPRC was critical for HIV-1 infection, three independent LRPPRC knockdown cell lines were constructed (2.7, 3.6, and 4.1). Subcellular fractionation of these cell lines revealed differential knockdown of LRPPRC in subcellular compartments. LRPPRC was knocked down in the insoluble/cytoskeletal fractions of all three cell lines, but the 3.6 and 4.1 cells also showed a reduction in nuclear LRPPRC. Additionally, several cellular factors were downregulated and/or disrupted by loss of LRPPRC. HIV-1 infection was reduced in all three cell lines, but virus production and RNA encapsidation were unaffected, suggesting that LRPPRC was critical for the afferent stage of virus replication. Two of the three cell lines (3.6, 4.1) were refractory for murine leukemia virus infection, a virus dependent on cellular proliferation for productive infection. Consistent with this, these two cell lines exhibited reduced cellular growth with no loss of cellular viability or change in cell cycle phenotype. The early steps of virus infection were also differentially affected among the cell lines. A reduced level of preintegration complex formation was observed in all three cell lines, but viral DNA nuclear import was reduced only in the 3.6 and 4.1 cells. Combined, these data identify LRPPRC as a HIV-1 factor that is involved in HIV-1 replication through more than one mechanism.","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.']",,,"['C06 RR015468/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1R01AI080348/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR15635/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR015468-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI080348/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR015635/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 10.,"Uveal melanomas possess activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.","['Laboratory of New Drug Development, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America. hoa@mskcc.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 9.,"Nef functions as an immunosuppressive factor critical for HIV-1 replication, survival and development of AIDS following HIV-1 infection. What effects Nef exerts on differentiation and maturation of monocytes towards dendritic cells (DCs) remains greatly controversial. In this study, we used THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia cell line) as monocytic DC precursors to investigate how overexpression of HIV-1 Nef influences the processes of differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells. In striking contrast to negative controls, our results showed that morphological and phenotypical changes (CD11c, CD14, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR) occurred on recombinant THP-1 expressing HIV-1 Nef (short for Nef) upon co-stimulation of GM-CSF/IL-4 or GM-CSF/IL-4/TNF-alpha/ionomycin. Moreover, CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 were also down-regulated on Nef. It might be hypothesized that Nef prevents superinfection and signal transduction in HIV-1 infected monocytes. Collectively, our study demonstrates that long-lasting expression of Nef at high levels indeed retards differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells in terms of phenotype and morphology. We are hopeful that potentially, stable expression of intracellular Nef in vivo may function as a subtle mode to support long-lasting HIV-1 existence.","['Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Kunming, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 10.,"INTRODUCTION: The seroprevalence of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is very high among Brazilians (1:200). HTLV-1 associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is the most common neurological complication of HTLV-1 infection. HAM/TSP can present with an acute/subacute form of longitudinally extensive myelitis, which can be confused with lesions seen in aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) on MRI. Moreover, clinical attacks in patients with NMOSD have been shown to be preceded by viral infections in around 30% of cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of AQP4-Ab in patients with HAM/TSP. To evaluate the frequency of HTLV-1 infection in patients with NMOSD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 23 Brazilian patients with HAM/TSP, 20 asymptomatic HTLV-1+ serostatus patients, and 34 with NMOSD were tested for AQP4-Ab using a standardized recombinant cell based assay. In addition, all patients were tested for HTLV-1 by ELISA and Western blotting. RESULTS: 20/34 NMOSD patients were positive for AQP4-Ab but none of the HAM/TSP patients and none of the asymptomatic HTLV-1 infected individuals. Conversely, all AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD patients were negative for HTLV-1 antibodies. One patient with HAM/TSP developed optic neuritis in addition to subacute LETM; this patient was AQP4-Ab negative as well. Patients were found to be predominantly female and of African descent both in the NMOSD and in the HAM/TSP group; Osame scale and expanded disability status scale scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results argue both against a role of antibodies to AQP4 in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP and against an association between HTLV-1 infection and the development of AQP4-Ab. Moreover, the absence of HTLV-1 in all patients with NMOSD suggests that HTLV-1 is not a common trigger of acute attacks in patients with AQP4-Ab positive NMOSD in populations with high HTLV-1 seroprevalence.","['Neuroimmunology Unit, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Bioagents, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. fglehn@terra.com.br']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 13.,"The internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane region of the FLT3 receptor has been associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). How this elevated level of ROS contributes to the leukemic phenotype, however, remains poorly understood. In this work we show that ROS in the FLT3-ITD expressing AML cell line MV4-11 is reduced by treatment with PKC412, an inhibitor of FLT3, DPI, a flavoprotein inhibitor, and VAS2870, a Nox specific inhibitor, suggesting that ROS production is both FLT3 and NADPH oxidase dependent. The majority of these ROS co-localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as determined with the H(2)O(2)-specific aryl-boronate dye Peroxyorange 1, which also corresponds to co-localization of p22phox. Moreover, knocking down p22phox dramatically reduces H(2)O(2) after 24 hours in the ER, without affecting mitochondrial ROS. Significantly, the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 reduces H(2)O(2) in FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-13) through reduction of p22phox over 24 hours. Reduced p22phox is achieved by proteasomal degradation and is prevented upon GSK3-beta inhibition. Knockdown of p22phox resulted in reduced STAT5 signalling and reduced Pim-1 levels in the cells after 24 hours. Thus, we have shown that FLT3 driven H(2)O(2) production in AML cells is mediated by p22phox and is critical for STAT5 signalling.","['Tumour Biology Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Bioscience Research Institute, University College, Cork, Ireland.']",,,"['R01 GM079465/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM066698/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'GM 79465/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 15.,"BACKGROUND: The Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG), a region of North Eastern Italy, has passed legislation (Decree No 2324/2010) to regulate the banking of umbilical cord blood samples for personal, autologous, or family-directed use, and to implement the Agreement of the State-Regions Permanent Conference (Decree No 62/CSR/2010). This paper aims to identify the formalities and the reasons why families collect and bank their cord blood in foreign banks for both personal and private use. METHODS: To this end, at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health of Trieste (the regional capital city of the FVG), Italy, which assists about 1800 pregnant women a year, 129 questionnaires, drafted from January 2010 to December 2011 and concerning the granting of authorization to export samples, were examined. RESULTS: The collected data showed that 75% of involved families had resorted to anonymous public collection, which is available to anyone with therapeutic needs, and provided compatibility and hematologic protocols recognized by the scientific and international community (main indications: leukemia, hemoglobinopaties, and inherited hematologic and immunologic disorders). Conversely, 25.0% requested private storage at a foreign bank for personal or family-dedicated use. The principal motivation by disease was for treatment for diabetes (22.4%) and celiac disease (19.7%) (a multiorgan disease for which the FVG region has provided safeguards by approving a specific law granting support to families; Decree No 561/2007). For these two types of disease we found that information was received from the internet and not from general medical physicians, with a significant difference found using the chi(2) test (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The indication of treating these diseases with cord blood stem cell transplantation appears to be well grounded and encouraging, and has recently been corroborated by the international literature; however, the economic and social motivations promoting cord blood storage, for a fee, in the event of diseases that are still under study, require accurate information through general medical physicians on the actual possibilities of treatment.","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['North Eastern Italy', 'autologous cord blood harvesting', 'emerging hopes of therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 16.,"A complex interplay between gene and environment influences the vulnerability or the resilience to stressful events. In the acute escape deficit (AED) paradigm, rats exposed to an acute unavoidable stress (AUS) develop impaired reactivity to noxious stimuli. Here we assessed the behavioral and molecular changes in rats exposed to AUS. A genome-wide microarray experiment generated a comprehensive picture of changes in gene expression in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex of animals exposed or not to AUS. Exposure to AUS resulted in two distinct groups of rats with opposite behavioral profiles: one developing an AED, called ""stress vulnerable,"" and one that did not develop an AED, called ""stress resilient."" Genome-wide profiling revealed a low percentage of overlapping mechanisms in the two areas, suggesting that, in the presence of stress, resilience or vulnerability to AUS is sustained by specific changes in gene expression that can either buffer or promote the behavioral and molecular adverse consequences of stress. Specifically, we observed in the frontal cortex a downregulation of the transcript coding for interferon-beta and leukemia inhibitory factor in resilient rats and an upregulation of neuroendocrine related genes, growth hormone and prolactin, in vulnerable rats. In the hippocampus, the muscarinic M2 receptor was downregulated in vulnerable but upregulated in resilient rats. Our findings demonstrate that opposite behavioral responses did not correspond to opposite regulatory changes of the same genes, but resilience rather than vulnerability to stress was associated with specific changes, with little overlap, in the expression of patterns of genes.","['Department of Biomedical Sciences; University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic disruption of SHP2 or treatment of oncogene-bearing cells with a novel SHP2 inhibitor alone or in combination with the PI3K inhibitor corrects MPD by disrupting a protein complex involving p85alpha, SHP2, and Gab2. Importantly, a single tyrosine at position 719 in oncogenic KIT is sufficient to develop MPD by recruiting p85alpha, SHP2, and Gab2 complex to oncogenic KIT.

The cause of HES is unknown and shows clinical heterogeneity. FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion is a clonal marker for the diagnosis and treatment of HES. We prospectively studied 78 patients with chronic eosinophilia. In all cases, the most salient clinical and biological characteristics as well as the response to the therapy were analyzed. In addition, we performed conventional cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with three BACs covering the FIP1-like-1 (FIP1L1)/platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha gene (PDGFRA) fusion. Nineteen of 78 patients (24 %) presented criteria of HES. The majority of patients were male (18) with median age of 49 years (range 19-84 years). FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion was found in eight patients. Patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion presented with more bone marrow eosinophils and peripheral blood eosinophilia as well as anemia, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Using of low-dose imatinib mesylate (100 mg/day) a hematological and molecular remission in all patients displaying the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene was observed. Therefore, imatinib may be effective for use in the treatment of chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and patients should be treated before tissue damage.","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain. maryamarefi2002@yahoo.co.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we learn more, we hope to further categorize patients with normal karyotype AML into discrete risk categories that will help in treatment decision making and further elucidate the necessity for hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were significantly faster, whereas the incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly higher in the RD/1AG-MM-GVH group. The incidence of acute or chronic GVHD in the RD/1AG-MM-GVH group with in vivo T-cell depletion was comparable to that in the UCB group, which translated into a trend toward better overall survival, regardless of the presence of an HLA-B mismatch.

Intriguingly, Lyn can mediate both positive and negative signaling processes within the same or different cellular contexts. This duality is exemplified by the B-cell defect in Lyn-/- mice in which Lyn is essential for negative regulation of the B-cell receptor; conversely, B-cells expressing a dominant active mutant of Lyn (Lynup/up) have elevated activities of positive regulators of the B-cell receptor due to this hyperactive kinase. Lyn has well-established functions in most haematopoietic cells, viz. progenitors via influencing c-kit signaling, through to mature cell receptor/integrin signaling, e.g. erythrocytes, platelets, mast cells and macrophages. Consequently, there is an important role for this kinase in regulating hematopoietic abnormalities. Lyn is an important regulator of autoimmune diseases such as asthma and psoriasis, due to its profound ability to influence immune cell signaling. Lyn has also been found to be important for maintaining the leukemic phenotype of many different liquid cancers including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and B-cell lymphocytic leukaemia (BCLL). Lyn is also expressed in some solid tumors and here too it is establishing itself as a potential therapeutic target for prostate, glioblastoma, colon and more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. LAY To relay information, a cell uses enzymes that put molecular markers on specific proteins so they interact with other proteins or move to specific parts of the cell to have particular functions. A protein called Lyn is one of these enzymes that regulate information transfer within cells to modulate cell growth, survival and movement. Depending on which type of cell and the source of the information input, Lyn can positively or negatively regulate the information output. This ability of Lyn to be able to both turn on and turn off the relay of information inside cells makes it difficult to fully understand its precise function in each specific circumstance. Lyn has important functions for cells involved in blood development, including different while blood cells as well as red blood cells, and in particular for the immune cells that produce antibodies (B-cells), as exemplified by the major B-cell abnormalities that mice with mutations in the Lyn gene display. Certain types of leukaemia and lymphoma appear to have too much Lyn activity that in part causes the characteristics of these diseases, suggesting it may be a good target to develop new anti-leukaemia drugs. Furthermore, some specific types, and even specific subtypes, of solid cancers, e.g. prostate, brain and breast cancer can also have abnormal regulation of Lyn. Consequently, targeting this protein in these cancers could also prove to be beneficial.","['Cell Signalling Group, Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Rear 50 Murray Street, Perth, WA, 6000, Australia. evan.ingley@uwa.edu.au.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 17.,"The kinetic properties of two classical inhibitors of aspartic proteases (PRs), pepstatin A and acetyl-pepstatin, were compared in their interactions with HIV-1 and xenotropic murine leukemia virus related virus (XMRV) PRs. Both compounds are substantially weaker inhibitors of XMRV PR than of HIV-1 PR. Previous kinetic and structural studies characterized HIV-1 PR-acetyl-pepstatin and XMRV PR-pepstatin A complexes and suggested dramatically different binding modes. Interaction energies were calculated for the possible binding modes and suggested a strong preference for the one-inhibitor binding mode for HIV-1 PR-acetyl-pepstatin and the two-inhibitor binding mode for XMRV PR-pepstatin A interactions. Comparison of the molecular models suggested that in the case of XMRV PR the relatively unfavorable interactions at S3' and the favorable interactions at S4 and S4' sites with the statine residues may shift the ground state binding towards the two-inhibitor binding mode, whereas the single molecule ground state binding of statines to the HIV-1 PR appear to be more favorable. The preferred single molecular binding to HIV-1 PR allows the formation of the transition state complex, represented by substantially better binding constants. Intriguingly, the crystal structure of the complex of acetyl-pepstatin with XMRV PR has shown a mixed type of binding: the unusual binding mode of two molecules of the inhibitor to the enzyme, in a mode very similar to the previously determined complex with pepstatin A, together with the classical binding mode found for HIV-1 PR. The structure is thus in good agreement with the very similar interaction energies calculated for the two types of binding.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.']",,['(c) 2012 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2012 FEBS.'],"['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC010348-12/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS394288'],,,,['PDB/4EXH'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their classification is challenging, even with complete clinicopathological and genetic information. At a haematopathology workshop, experts had suggested the term 'high-grade B cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with blastoid features', and recommended further studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the clinicopathological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic findings of 24 high-grade B cell lymphomas, unclassifiable, with blastoid features. Fifteen patients presented de novo and seven patients had a history of lymphoma. Twenty patients (83%) presented with nodal disease. All tumours expressed pan-B cell antigens and 17 (89%) of 19 tumours assessed had a germinal centre B cell immunophenotype. Ten (63%) of 16 tumours assessed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) had MYC rearrangement, 13 of 18 (72%) carried IGH-BCL2 and nine of 15 (60%) had both (double-hit lymphoma). The median overall survival was 1.1 years. Using 2008 World Health Organization criteria, 15 cases were classified as B cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, and nine as DLBCL, small centroblastic variant. CONCLUSION: High-grade B cell lymphomas, unclassifiable, with blastoid features are clinically aggressive with poor survival. Most neoplasms have a germinal centre B cell phenotype. MYC rearrangements and IGH-BCL2 are common, and ~60% are double-hit lymphomas.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Limited.'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDCs in the former appear reactive, but in the latter are reported to be clonally related to the underlying myeloid neoplasm. Langerhans cells (LCs), another type of dendritic cell, also proliferate in both reactive dermatoses and, rarely, myeloproliferative disorders, such as acute leukaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a rare case of tumorous proliferation of PDCs and LCs in the systemic lymph nodes in a 55-year-old man with acute myeloid leukaemia. A microsatellite instability assay showed identical patterns of short tandem repeats in both microdissected PDC and LC components, along with blood blasts. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the combined proliferations of PDCs and LCs derive from the same haematopoietic stem cells, but that they differentiate divergently under the effect of different microenvironments.","['Department of Pathology, National Cheng Kung University and Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['Histopathology. 2013 May;62(6):967-72.

METHODS: Thirty-five inpatients or outpatients from the Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were recruited as the test group, while 10 healthy volunteers from the health medical center of the Affiliated Hospital, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were recruited as the control group. The ID4 gene promoter methylation states were detected using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) in the two groups. Inter-group comparison was performed and CMSTs were compared to analyze the correlation between CMSTs and the gene promoter methylation. RESULTS: Twenty-seven AML patients (77.1%) had methylation of ID4 gene, showing statistical difference when compared with the control group (P < 0.01). The ID4 methylation positive rate of ID4 gene promoter methylation was sequenced from low to high as qi and yin deficiency syndrome < inter-accumulation of blood stasis and phlegm syndrome < toxic heat inflaming syndrome, showing statistical difference when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The peripheral white blood cells and the bone marrow blast cells were higher in ID4 methylation positive patients than in the ID4 methylation negative control patients with statistical difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients of inter-accumulation of blood stasis and phlegm syndrome and toxic heat inflaming syndrome were more likely to have ID4 gene methylation. The ID4 methylation positive expression has verified the essence of evil domination in the early AML at the molecular level. It can also reflect the degree of malignancy of AML to some extent.","['Department of Hematology, Yantaishan Hospital, Shandong 264001.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-four patients failed to respond to nilotinib and were started on dasatinib as third-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy while 48 patients were switched to nilotinib after dasatinib failure. Overall, we obtained a cytogenetic response in 32 of 82 patients and major molecular response in 13 patients; disease progression occurred in 12 patients.

Epub 2012 Jul 16.,"Despite advances in immunosuppressive regimens, acute graft-versus-host disease remains a frequent complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Pathogenic donor T cells are dependent on correct attachment of small GTPases to the cell membrane, mediated by farnesyl- or geranylgeranyl residues, which, therefore, constitute potential targets for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. A mouse model was used to study the impact of a farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and a geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor on acute graft-versus-host disease, anti-cytomegalovirus T-cell responses and graft-versus-leukemia activity. Treatment of mice undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor reduced the histological severity of graft-versus-host disease and prolonged survival significantly. Mechanistically, farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor treatment resulted in reduced alloantigen-driven expansion of CD4 T cells. In vivo treatment led to increased thymic cellularity and polyclonality of the T-cell receptor repertoire by reducing thymic graft-versus-host disease. These effects were absent when squalene production was blocked. The farnesyl-transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitor did not compromise CD8 function against leukemia cells or reconstitution of T cells that were subsequently responsible for anti-murine cytomegalovirus responses. In summary, we observed an immunomodulatory effect of inhibitors of farnesyl-transferase and geranylgeranyl-transferase on graft-versus-host disease, with enhanced functional immune reconstitution. In the light of the modest toxicity of farnesyl-transferase inhibitors such as tipifarnib in patients and the potent reduction of graft-versus-host disease in mice, farnesyl-transferase and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitors could help to reduce graft-versus-host disease significantly without having a negative impact on immune reconstitution.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany.']",['Haematologica. 2013 Apr;98(4):e44-5.

Lintuzumab (SGN-33; HuM195) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD33, which is expressed on the majority of myeloblasts in acute myeloid leukemia. The primary objective of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to determine whether addition of lintuzumab to low-dose cytarabine would increase overall survival in adults aged 60 years and over with untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Randomization was stratified by age, previous hematologic disorder, and performance status. All patients received cytarabine (20 mg subcutaneously twice daily) on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle. Patients received lintuzumab (600 mg) or placebo intravenously once weekly in Cycle 1 and once every other week in Cycles 2-12. A total of 211 patients (107 lintuzumab, 104 placebo) were randomized. Median age was 70 years (range 60-90). Survival was not significantly prolonged with lintuzumab treatment (hazard ratio 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-1.28; P=0.7585). Median survival was similar between treatment arms (4.7 months lintuzumab vs. 5.1 months placebo) and in the subgroup of patients with high-risk cytogenetics (4.5 months). Infusion-related reactions, predominantly Grades 1-2, occurred more commonly in the lintuzumab arm (51% vs. 7% placebo); no other clinically significant difference in safety was noted. These results confirm that lintuzumab in combination with low-dose cytarabine did not prolong survival and that low-dose cytarabine remains a valid comparator for trials of non-intensive therapies in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia, regardless of cytogenetic profile.","['Leukemia Program, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA. sekerem@ccf.org']",,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00528333'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy of acute leukaemia is channelled towards the reduction and eradication of leukaemic cells. However, relapse is generally assumed to occur in residual host cells, which are refractory to or elude therapy. The cancer stem cell hypothesis has gained considerable importance in recent years and could interpret this behaviour. This persuasive theory states that cells within a tumour are organised in a hierarchy similar to that of normal tissues and are maintained by a small subset of cells responsible for tumour dormancy. These cells, defined as 'tumour initiating cells' (TICs), possess several properties of normal tissue stem cells. Recently, the TICs associated with AML have been shown to comprise distinct, hierarchically arranged classes similar to those observed for haematopoietic stem cells. We know now that the growth and survival of blasts in AML are driven by the same growth factors that stimulate normal cells. Furthermore, direct evidence of the role of membrane stem cell factor and its receptor c-Kit in cell-cell interactions and cell survival in primary AML blasts have been provided, defining the importance of juxtacrine stimulation. Inhibition of c-Kit signalling induces combinations of cell death: autophagy (compensatory mechanism towards survival) and apoptosis. While recent work confirmed that c-Kit inhibitors reduce cancer cell proliferation, it also demonstrated that future inappropriate prescriptions could cause normal tissue deterioration. The purpose of this paper was to review some of the salient features of leukaemic blasts in support of the proposal that research into neoplasia be increased. Rather than presenting the details of various studies, I have attempted to indicate general areas in which work has been done or is in progress. It is hoped that this survey of the subject will demonstrate a variety of opportunities for additional research in human neoplasia.","['Laboratory of Cancer and Hematopoiesis, Superior School of Medicine, National Polytechnic Institute, Plan de San Luis y Diaz Miron s/n, Col.

Epub 2012 Aug 1.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to an abundant class of highly conserved small (22nt) non-coding RNAs. MiRNA profiling studies indicate that their expression is highly cell type-dependent. DICER1 is an essential RNase III endoribonuclease for miRNA processing. Hematopoietic cell type- and developmental stage-specific Dicer1 deletion models show that miRNAs are essential regulators of cellular survival, differentiation and function. For instance, miRNA deficiency in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors of different origins results in decreased cell survival, dramatic developmental aberrations or dysfunctions in mice. We recently found that homozygous Dicer1 deletion in myeloid-committed progenitors results in an aberrant expression of stem cell genes and induces a regained self-renewal capacity. Moreover, Dicer1 deletion causes a block in macrophage development and myeloid dysplasia, a cellular condition that may be considered as a preleukemic state. However, Dicer1-null cells do not develop leukemia in mice, indicating that depletion of miRNAs is not enough for tumorigenesis. Surprisingly, we found that heterozygous Dicer1 deletion in myeloid-committed progenitors, but not Dicer1 knockout, collaborates with p53 deletion in leukemic progression and results in various types of leukemia. Our data indicate that Dicer1 is a haploinsufficient tumorsuppressor in hematopoietic neoplasms, which is consistent with the observed downregulation of miRNA expression in human leukemia samples.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray technology (ChIP-chip) analysis, we found that the H3K9-me2 target gene JAK2 was an important factor during differentiation of the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. Here, we report that the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a negatively regulated JAK2 transcription in histone methyltransferase activity and in a YY1-dependent manner during ATRA-mediated leukemia cell differentiation. We found that G9a knockdown repressed ATRA-mediated HL-60 cell differentiation. We demonstrated that G9a interacts with YY1 and is recruited to the JAK2 promoter along with corepressors, including histone deacetylase, that induced H3K9-me2. Repression of JAK2 transcription by G9a decreased H3Y41 phosphorylation and promoted inhibition of the recently identified JAK2-H3Y41P-HP1alpha pathway-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Research Center for Biomolecules and Biophysics, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The clinical features of 37 children with newly diagnosed APL hospitalized in our center during January 2005 to February 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULT: Thirty percent of patients were at low risk, 43% patients were at intermediate risk, 27% patients were at high risk. Sixty percent of patients had DIC. Retinoic acid syndrome (RAS) was present in 2 patients (6%). Death during induction occurred in 3 patients (8%). Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 83.7% of patients. The patients in high risk group had higher risk than those in intermediate and low risk group (P = 0.029). The time to achieve CR was not significantly different (P = 0.612). Idarubicin had no advantage compared with daunorubicin in time to achieve CR (P = 0.628). Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier statistical method, and 2 years event-free survival (EFS) rate was 81%, the 2-year EFS rate was 100% for low-risk group, 81% for intermediate-risk group, and 60% for high-risk group. CONCLUSION: Using combined chemotherapy with ATRA and anthracyclines had the following advantages: high CR rate, high long-time survival rate and low side effect. DIC remained the main complication among patients receiving induction treatment. Initial WBC count and platelet count are important prognostic factors which might be useful in prognostication and treatment planning.","[""Hematology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and forty seven cases of ALI/ARDS were hospitalized to our pediatric intensive care unit, and 32 cases were treated with continuous blood purification (CBP) from June, 2006 to May, 2011. The model for CBP was continuous veno-venous hemofiltration dialysis (CVVHDF). CBP treatment persisted for at least 8 hours and replacement + dialysis fluid dose was 35 - 100 ml/(kg.h). The clinical outcome measures included the mortality rate at 28th day, respiratory index (FiO2/PO2), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), mechanical ventilation parameters, vasoactive drug dose and lung X-ray changes. RESULTS: In totally 147 cases of ALI/ARDS, 89 cases (60.5%) were male and 58 (39.5%) were female, mean age was (43.4 +/- 36.7) months. Death occurred in 54 cases, the total mortality was 36.7%. The cause of ALI/ARDS was mainly severe pneumonia, severe sepsis, and leukemia or tumor diseases. There were significant differences in severity of illness between the CBP treatment group and non-CBP treatment group on Pediatric risk of score mortality (PRISM) III score (15.3 vs. 12.7, P < 0.05) and pediatric critical illness score (66.8 +/- 19.3 vs. 74.6 +/- 17.7, P < 0.05). The average duration of CBP treatment was 52 hours (12 hours to 232 hours). PaO2/FiO2 and Cdyn were improved after 2 hours CBP treatment compared with those before CBP treatment (P < 0.05), mechanical ventilation parameters including fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), peak inspiratory pressure (PiP) and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were reduced. The use of vasoactive drugs in patients with MODS and shock gradually declined. The average ventilator-free days of the two groups did not show significant difference (P > 0.05). The mortality on CBP treatment group and non-treatment group were 37.5% and 36.5%, respectively, the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CBP adjuvant treatment for ALI/ ARDS could reduce pulmonary edema, improve PaO2/FiO2 and Cdyn, and improve mechanical ventilation parameters. CBP may be a very promising treatment for ALI/ARDS in children.","[""Department of Critical Care Medicine, Critical Illness Institute, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200040, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty age-marched healthy children underwent MR imaging (T(1)WI, T(2)WI, STIR) and (1)H-MRS of lumber spine and ilium. The lumber spines and iliums were studied by observation of MR imaging and calculation of fat fraction (FF%).

The 17beta-estradiol (E2) protects pancreatic beta cells from apoptosis, mediated by the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha). The mRNA level and promoter activity of leukemia-related protein (LRP) 16 were significantly increased by E2 in ER-alpha and LRP16 was a co-activator of ER-alpha. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of LRP16 on fatty acid-induced apoptosis in MIN6 cells. METHODS: Cells with over-expressing LRP16 were obtained by lipidosome transfection. Insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were examined by radioimmunoassay. Western blotting was applied to detect protein expression. Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and flow cytometry. The forkhead boxO1 (FoxO1) subcellular localization was determined by immunocytochemical analysis. RESULTS: MIN6-LRP16 cells with overexpression of LRP16 were successfully established, and protein expression of LRP16 was 2.29-fold of that of control cells (MIN6-3.1, P < 0.05). Insulin content and GSIS in MIN6-LRP16 were substantially increased compared with those in control cells. When cells were stimulated with glucose, increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and serine-threonine kinase (Akt) were observed in MIN6-LRP16. When cells were under palmitate pressure, the TUNEL-positive rate in MIN6-LRP16 was (17.0 +/- 0.5)%, while it in MIN6-3.1 was (22.0 +/- 0.4)%. In palmitate-treated cells, attenuated Akt phosphorylation was observed, but the attenuation in Akt activity was partially restored in MIN6-LRP16 cells. Meanwhile, nuclear localization of FoxO1 in MIN6-LRP16 was apparently reduced compared with that in control cells. CONCLUSIONS: LRP16 regulated insulin content and GSIS in MIN6 cells by ERK1/2 and Akt activated way. Meanwhile, LRP16 overexpression protected MIN6 cells from fatty acid-induced apoptosis by partially restoring Akt phosphorylation and inhibiting FoxO1 nuclear redistribution. Therefore, LRP16 played important roles not only in insulin content and GSIS but also in the antilipotoxic effect mediated by Akt/FoxO1 signaling.","[""Department of Endocrinology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A structured questionnaire including information on demographics, residence, occupation, agricultural practices, pesticide exposure, family history, smoking, alcohol consumption and medical history, was used. Genotyping of 316 cases of LHC and 351 healthy controls by using standard laboratory methods was performed. To control for confounders, Binary and Multinomial Logistic Regression analyses were used. Possession of QQ genotype or presence of the Q allele were associated with increased risk of developing LHC (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.42-2.66 and OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.33-2.23 respectively). The QQ genotype in the recessive model was independently associated with LHC (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.40-2.65), leukaemia (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.13-3.49), lymphoma (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.21-3.90) and plasmacell disease (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.40-2.65) even after controlling for age, sex, pesticide exposure, smoking and family history (cancers, LHC and immunological disorders) as confounders.

Epub 2012 Jul 17.,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Human gamma-delta (gammadelta) T cells are potent effector lymphocytes of innate immunity involved in anti-tumor immune surveillance. However, the Vdelta1 gammadelta T-cell subset targeting multiple myeloma (MM) has not previously been investigated. METHODS: Vdelta1 T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors and patients with MM by immunomagnetic sorting and expanded with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) together with interleukin (IL)-2 in the presence of allogeneic feeders. Vdelta1 T cells were phenotyped by flow cytometry and used in a 4-h flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay. Cytokine release and blocking studies were performed. Primary myeloma cells were purified from MM patients' bone marrow aspirates. RESULTS: Vdelta1 T cells expanded from healthy donors displayed prominent cytotoxicity by specific lysis against patients' CD38 (+) CD138 (+) bone marrow-derived plasma cells. Vdelta1 T cells isolated from MM patients showed equally significant killing of myeloma cells as Vdelta1 T cells from normal donors. Vdelta1 T cells showed similarly potent cytotoxicity against myeloma cell lines U266 and RPMI8226 and plasma cell leukemia ARH77 in a dose-dependent manner. The interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion and Vdelta1 T-cell cytotoxicity against myeloma cells was mediated in part through the T-cell receptor (TCR) in addition to involvement of Natural killer-G2D molecule (NKG2D), DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1), intracellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, CD3 and CD2 receptors. In addition, Vdelta1 T cells were shown to exert anti-myeloma activity equal to that of Vdelta2 T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time that Vdelta1 T cells are highly myeloma-reactive and have therefore established Vdelta1 gammadelta T cells as a potential candidate for a novel tumor immunotherapy.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, University College Medical School London, UK. a.knight@medsch.ucl.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical presentation, bone marrow morphology, immunophenotyping and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement status were performed in 19 patients with T-LGLL. RESULTS: Of 19 patients, the most frequent hematological abnormalities were anemia and neutropenia (16/19 and 17/19 patients, respectively). Large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) were observed in 17 of 19 peripheral blood smears and 15 of 19 bone marrow aspirate specimens. Lymphocytosis (> 0.2) was present in 17 of 19 patients in their bone marrow aspirate specimens. Bone marrow biopsy specimens revealed lymphocytosis in 16 cases, with a mild to moderate increase of lymphocytes observed in 12 cases (12/16). The pattern of lymphoid distribution was interstitial in bone marrow sections. Intravascular distribution was seen in 8 cases. Lymphoid nodules were present in 4 cases. Flow cytometery showed an immunophenotype of CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(+) CD56(-) CD57(+) of the tumor cells in 13 cases. Of the other 6 cases, the immunophenotypes included CD8(-) (1 case), CD56(+) (2 cases) and CD57(-) (3 cases). Immunohistochemistry showed CD3+ (10/10), CD57+ (3/3), CD8+ (6/7), TIA-1+ (6/7), granzyme B+ (4/7), perforin + (1/7), CD4- (4/4) and CD56- (9/9). Clonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement by PCR was detected in 12 cases (12/17). CONCLUSIONS: Hematopathologic features of most T-LGLL are distinct. Morphologic, immunophenotypic and molecular analysis of both peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens are essential and complementary in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of T-LGLL.","['Department of Pathology, Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 16.,"Subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) is an oncogenic retrovirus primarily causing myeloid leukosis (ML) in broilers. Although ALV is well under control in a few countries including the USA, poultry industry in many parts of the world continues suffering from serious economic loss due to sporadic or widespread ALV infection, especially ALV-J infection. ALV-J infection of chickens is reportedly mediated by a cellular receptor. So far, however, no genetic variant of the receptor gene that confers resistance to ALV-J has been identified. To advance our understanding on epigenetic factors that are involved in the event of ALV-J infection, we examined the expression of miRNAs in livers of 10-week-old chickens uninfected or infected with ALV-J by miRNA microarray analysis. Our data showed there were 12 miRNAs differentially expressed in liver between the uninfected and infected groups (P<0.01). Of which, the expressions of seven miRNAs (gga-mir-221, gga-mir-222, gga-mir-1456, gga-mir-1704, gga-mir-1777, gga-mir-1790, and gga-mir-2127,) were upregulated by ALV-J infection and may be involved in oncogenicity. The other five miRNAs (gga-let-7b, gga-let-7i, gga-mir-125b, gga-mir-375, and gga-mir-458) were significantly downregulated. The downregulated miRNAs may play important roles in tumor suppression. This finding paves the way for further exploration of epigenetic influence on tumorigenicity upon ALV-J infection.","['College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This has made FLT3 an important marker for disease diagnosis and a highly attractive target for therapeutic drug development. This study is intended to generate a sensitive substrate for assays of the FLT3 enzymatic activity. METHODS: We expressed in Escherichia coli cells a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein designated GST-FLT3S, which contains a peptide sequence derived from an autophosphorylation site of FLT3. The protein was used to analyze tyrosine kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed FLT3 and crude cell extracts of bone marrow cells from AML patients. It was also employed to perform FLT3 kinase assays for FLT3 inhibitor screening. RESULTS: GST-FLT3S in solution or on beads was strongly phosphorylated by recombinant proteins carrying the catalytic domain of wild type FLT3 and FLT3D835 mutants, with the latter exhibiting much higher activity and efficiency. GST-FLT3S was also able to detect elevated tyrosine kinase activity in bone marrow cell extracts from AML patients. A small-scale inhibitor screening led to identification of several potent inhibitors of wild type and mutant forms of FLT3. CONCLUSIONS: GST-FLT3S is a sensitive protein substrate for FLT3 assays. It may find applications in diagnosis of diseases related to abnormal FLT3 activity and in inhibitor screening for drug development.","['Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']",,,"['HL079441/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL094591/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These burdens can be estimated in a variety of ways; ""Years of Life Lost"" (YLL) measures the severity of death in regard to the age it occurs, ""Disability-Adjusted Life-Years"" (DALY) estimates the effects of non-lethal disabilities incurred by disease and economic metrics focus on the losses to tax revenue, productivity or direct medical expenses. We compared research funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to a variety of burden metrics for the most common types of cancer to identify mismatches between spending and societal burden. METHODS: Research funding levels were obtained from the NCI website and information for societal health and economic burdens were collected from government databases and published reports. We calculated the funding levels per unit burden for a wide range of different cancers and burden metrics and compared these values to identify discrepancies. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a considerable mismatch between funding levels and burden. Some cancers are funded at levels far higher than their relative burden suggests (breast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia) while other cancers appear underfunded (bladder, esophageal, liver, oral, pancreatic, stomach, and uterine cancers). CONCLUSIONS: These discrepancies indicate that an improved method of health care research funding allocation should be investigated to better match funding levels to societal burden.","['Biological Sciences Department, California State University Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840, USA. ashley.carter@csulb.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is due to the failure of differentiated hematopoietic cells, derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), to functionally recapitulate the in vivo properties of bona fide adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). To better understand the limitations of differentiation programming at the molecular level, we have utilized differential gene expression analysis of highly purified cells that are enriched for hematopoietic repopulating activity across embryonic, fetal, and adult human samples, including in vivo explants of human HSPCs 8-weeks post-transplantation. We reveal that hESC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (eHPCs) fail to express critical transcription factors which are known to govern self-renewal and myeloid/lymphoid development and instead retain the expression of Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) factors which are more prevalent in embryonic cell types that include EZH1 and ASH1L, respectively. These molecular profiles indicate that the differential expression of the core epigenetic machinery comprising PcGs/TrxGs in eHPCs may serve as previously unexplored molecular targets that direct hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs toward functional HSPCs in humans.","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute (SCC-RI), McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.']",,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the association between in utero radiation exposure and risk of solid cancer and leukemia mortality among 8,000 offspring, born from 1948-1988, of female workers at the Mayak Nuclear Facility in Ozyorsk, Russia. Mother's cumulative gamma radiation uterine dose during pregnancy served as a surrogate for fetal dose. We used Poisson regression methods to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of solid cancer and leukemia mortality associated with in utero radiation exposure and to quantify excess relative risks (ERRs) as a function of dose. Using currently available dosimetry information, 3,226 (40%) offspring were exposed in utero (mean dose = 54.5 mGy). Based on 75 deaths from solid cancers (28 exposed) and 12 (6 exposed) deaths from leukemia, in utero exposure status was not significantly associated with solid cancer: RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.49; ERR/Gy = -0.1 (95% CI < -0.1 to 4.1), or leukemia mortality; RR = 1.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.27; ERR/Gy = -0.8 (95% CI < -0.8 to 46.9). These initial results provide no evidence that low-dose gamma in utero radiation exposure increases solid cancer or leukemia mortality risk, but the data are not inconsistent with such an increase. As the offspring cohort is relatively young, subsequent analyses based on larger case numbers are expected to provide more precise estimates of adult cancer mortality risk following in utero exposure to ionizing radiation.","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. schonfes@mail.nih.gov']",,,"['Z01 CP010133-13/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS408742'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cancer registry was started in 1970, but it was partial and was stopped mainly because no government body was responsible. Realizing the above situation, the Indonesian government established the Sub Directorate of Cancer Control within the Ministry of Health, with responsibility for developing a national cancer control program, including a cancer registry. A sustainable cancer registry was then started in 2007 within Jakarta Province, first hospital-based but then expanded to be population-based. Steps of cancer registration in Jakarta are data collection, data verification, data validation, data management and analysis, and data publication. Data collection is conducted by health facilities (hospitals, laboratories, primary health centers) at the district/municipal level, with reports to the provincial level. Data are collected passively by holding meetings every three months in the district/municipality. Verification of data is the responsibility of the medical doctor or pathologist in each data source. Data validation is conducted by a team in the cancer registry, consisting of district/municipal/province health officers, pathologists, and registrars. Data management and analyses are conducted by a cancer registry team at the provincial level, assisted by the national team. We use software named Indonesian Cancer Registry System (SRIKANDI) which is adopted from CanReg4 IARC. Data from the population-based cancer registry in Jakarta Province showed the leading cancers among females in 2005-2007 to be breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and among males are bronchus and lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, pharyngeal cancer, and prostate cancer.

The current study investigated the relationship between HMGB1 and the NALP3 inflammasome in THP-1 macrophages. HMGB1 was found unable to activate the NALP3 inflammasome and failed to induce the release of the IL-1beta and IL-18 in THP-1 macrophages. HMGB1 was also found significantly enhanced the activity of ATP to induce IL-1beta and IL-18 by the induction of increased expression of pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18. This process was dependent on activation of RAGE, MAPK p38 and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that HMGB1 promotes the synthesis of pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 in THP-1 macrophages by the activation of p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB through RAGE. HMGB1 likely plays an important role in the first step of the release of the IL-1beta and IL-18, preparing for other cytokines to induce excessive release of IL-1beta and IL-18 which promote inflammation and cancer progression.","['Institute of Integrated Traditional Medicine and Western Medicine, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HL-60/ADR cells were treated by 20, 40, 80 mumol/L baicalin followed by cell cycle analysis at 24h. The mRNA expression level of the apoptosis related gene, Bcl-2 and bad, were measured by RT-PCR on cells treated with 80 mumol/L baicalin at 12, 24 and 48hr. Western blot was performed to detect the changes in the expression of the proteins related to HL-60/ADR cell apoptosis and the signaling pathway before and after baicalin treatment, including Bcl-2, PARP, Bad, Caspase 3, Akt, p-Akt, NF-kappaB, p-NF-kappaB, mTOR and p-mTOR. RESULTS: Sub-G1 peak of HL-60/ADR cells appeared 24 h after 20 mumol/L baicalin treatment, and the ratio increased as baicalin concentration increased. Cell cycle analysis showed 44.9% G0/G1 phase cells 24 h after baicalin treatment compared to 39.6% in the control group. Cells treated with 80 mumol/L baicalin displayed a trend in decreasing of Bcl-2 mRNA expression over time. Expression level of the Bcl-2 and PARP proteins decreased significantly while that of the PARP, Caspase-3, and Bad proteins gradually increased. No significant difference in Akt expression was observed between treated and the control groups. However, the expression levels of p-Akt, NF-kappaB, p-NF-kappaB, mTOR and p-mTOR decreased significantly in a time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that baicalin may induce HL-60/ADR cell apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS is recognized to be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic anemia, infectious complications and bleeding diathesis, as well as a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, particularly in patients with a high IPSS score. The advent of use of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) has improved symptoms in MDS patients in addition to some data that suggest there might be an improvement in survival. G-CSF is an effective therapeutic option in MDS patients, and it should be considered for the management of refractory symptomatic cytopenias. G-CSF and EPO in combination can improve outcomes in appropriate MDS patients such as those with lower-risk MDS and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) . This article reviews use of growth factors for lower-risk MDS patients, and examines the data for G-CSF, EPO and thrombopietic growth factors (TPO) that are available or being developed as therapeutic modalities for this challenging disease.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Jamaica, NY, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on the clinical outcome of autologous CIK cells for patients with acute (AML) and chronic (CML) myeloid leukemia in remission. METHODS: Eleven of the 13 recruited AML patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (autoPBSCT) were given autologous CIK cell infusion upon engraftment post-transplant and followed-up for disease relapse. Eleven CML patients on Imatinib with residual disease detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were given infusion and monitored by quantitation of the bcr-abl transcript. RESULTS: Despite the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting T cells against various AML- and CML-associated peptides at sporadic time-points and demonstration of in vitro cytotoxicity of CIK cells against autologous and allogeneic AML targets, there was no survival benefit in AML patients post-autoPBSCT given CIK cells compared with historical controls. For CML patients, all continued to have a detectable bcr-abl transcript fluctuating within a range comparable to their pre-treatment baseline, although two had a transient but non-sustainable disappearance of bcr-abl transcript. There were no adverse reactions except for fever within the first day of infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our small series, while confirming safety, failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of autologous CIK cells given in its current form for AML and CML. Further manipulation of CIK cells to improve anti-leukemic potency and specificity, together with the preparation of patients to create a more conducive milieu for in vivo expansion and persistence of infused CIK cells, should be explored.","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.

Epub 2012 Jul 13.,"T cell expression of inhibitory proteins can be a critical component for the regulation of immunopathology owing to self-reactivity or potentially exuberant responses to pathogens, but it may also limit T cell responses to some malignancies, particularly if the tumor Ag being targeted is a self-protein. We found that the abrogation of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) in tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells improves the therapeutic outcome of adoptive immunotherapy in a mouse model of disseminated leukemia, with benefit observed in therapy employing transfer of CD8(+) T cells alone or in the context of also providing supplemental IL-2. SHP-1(-/-) and SHP-1(+/+) effector T cells were expanded in vitro for immunotherapy. Following transfer in vivo, the SHP-1(-/-) effector T cells exhibited enhanced short-term accumulation, followed by greater contraction, and they ultimately formed similar numbers of long-lived, functional memory cells. The increased therapeutic effectiveness of SHP-1(-/-) effector cells was also observed in recipients that expressed the tumor Ag as a self-antigen in the liver, without evidence of inducing autoimmune toxicity. SHP-1(-/-) effector CD8(+) T cells expressed higher levels of eomesodermin, which correlated with enhanced lysis of tumor cells. Furthermore, reduction of SHP-1 expression in tumor-reactive effector T cells by retroviral transduction with vectors that express SHP-1-specific small interfering RNA, a translatable strategy, also exhibited enhanced antitumor activity in vivo. These studies suggest that abrogating SHP-1 in effector T cells may improve the efficacy of tumor elimination by T cell therapy without affecting the ability of the effector cells to persist and provide a long-term response.","['Department of Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",,,"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32AI007411/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007411/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA117985/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA117985-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS386651'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that phosphorylation of MLL5 by Cdk1 is required for mitotic entry. In this paper, the function of MLL5 in mitotic regulation is further explored. SiRNA-mediated downregulation of MLL5 caused improper chromosome alignment at metaphase and resulted in failure of DNA segregation and cytokinesis. Mechanistic studies revealed that the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which plays a key role in chromosomal bi-orientation, was delocalized from the inner centromere region because of proteasome-mediated degradation in MLL5-depleted cells. Biochemical analyses further demonstrated that the central domain of MLL5 interacted with the C-terminus of Borealin, and the interaction is essential to maintain the stability of Borealin. Moreover, the mitotic defects in MLL5-depleted cells were rescued by overexpression of FLAG-MLL5, but not by a FLAG-MLL5 mutant that did not contain the central domain. Collectively, our results suggest that MLL5 functionally interacts with Borealin, facilitates the expression of CPC, and hence contributes to mitotic fidelity and genomic integrity.","['Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, 8 Medical Drive 117597, Singapore.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We monitored the peripheral blood count and the serum concentration of dasatinib over time. Interestingly, we found a transient fluctuation of blood cells, which correlated with the dasatinib level. The peripheral blood count before intake of dasatinib was compared with counts measured 2 h later in blood samples from 23 patients. Total white blood cells (WBCs) increased by 2,186 +/- 1,960/muL from baseline (P = 0.00002), whereas platelets decreased from a baseline of 185 +/- 47 x 10(3)/muL to 164 +/- 52 x 10(3)/muL (P = 0.0007). Similar phenomena were not observed in patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib. In addition, in contrast to imatinib, dasatinib strongly attenuated the expression of CD18, CD62P and CD63 by blood cells both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that this drug may influence the distribution of blood cells in vivo by regulating its specific adhesion molecule expression on blood cells.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8553, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of this approach relies on the identification of molecular pathways that selectively regulate CSC function. Using BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a disease model for CSCs, we show that BCR-ABL downregulates the Blk gene (encoding B-lymphoid kinase) through c-Myc in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in CML mice and that Blk functions as a tumor suppressor in LSCs but does not affect normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hematopoiesis. Blk suppresses LSC function through a pathway involving an upstream regulator, Pax5, and a downstream effector, p27. Inhibition of this Blk pathway accelerates CML development, whereas increased activity of the Blk pathway delays CML development. Blk also suppresses the proliferation of human CML stem cells.

However, efficient targeting of miRs in tumor cells in vivo remains a significant challenge for the development of miR-155-based therapeutics for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. In the present study, we show that an 8-mer locked nucleic acid anti-miR-155 oligonucleotide targeting the seed region of miR-155 inhibits WM and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell proliferation in vitro. Moreover, anti-miR-155 delivered systemically showed uptake in the BM CD19(+) cells of WM-engrafted mice, resulting in the up-regulation of several miR-155 target mRNAs in these cells, and decreased tumor growth significantly in vivo. We also found miR-155 levels to be elevated in stromal cells from WM patients compared with control samples. Interestingly, stromal cells from miR-155-knockout mice led to significant inhibition of WM tumor growth, indicating that miR-155 may also contribute to WM proliferation through BM microenvironmental cells. The results of the present study highlight the therapeutic potential of anti-miR-155-mediated inhibition of miR-155 in the treatment of WM.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 16.,"Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene is a gain-of-function mutation common in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It is associated with inferior prognosis and response to chemotherapy. Single base mutations at the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) also leads to a gain of function, although its prognostic significance is less well defined because of its rarity. The clinical benefits of FLT3 inhibition are generally limited to AML with FLT3-ITD. However, responses are transient and leukaemia progression invariably occurs. There is compelling evidence that leukaemia clones carrying both ITD and TKD mutations appear when resistance to FLT3 inhibitors occurs. Interestingly, the emergence of double ITD and TKD mutants can be recapitulated in vitro when FLT3-ITD+ leukaemia cell lines are treated with mutagens and FLT3 inhibitors. Furthermore, murine xenotransplantation models also suggest that, in some cases, the FTL3-ITD and TKD double mutants actually exist in minute amounts before treatment with FLT3 inhibitors, expand under the selection pressure of FLT3 inhibition and become the predominant resistant clone(s) during the drug-refractory phase. On the basis of this model of clonal evolution, a multipronged strategy using more potent FLT3 inhibitors, and a combinatorial approach targeting both FLT3-dependent and FLT3-independent pathways, will be needed to improve outcome.","['Division of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 17.,"Mutations that activate the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor are among the most prevalent mutations in acute myeloid leukemias. The oncogenic role of FLT3 mutants has been attributed to the abnormal activation of several downstream signaling pathways, such as STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2, and AKT. Here, we discovered that the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) pathway is also affected by internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3. Moreover, we also identified C/EBPalpha, a granulopoiesis-promoting transcription factor, as a substrate for CDK1. We further demonstrated that CDK1 phosphorylates C/EBPalpha on serine 21, which inhibits its differentiation-inducing function. Importantly, we found that inhibition of CDK1 activity relieves the differentiation block in cell lines with mutated FLT3 as well as in primary patient-derived peripheral blood samples. Clinical trials with CDK1 inhibitors are currently under way for various malignancies. Our data strongly suggest that targeting the CDK1 pathway might be applied in the treatment of FLT3ITD mutant leukemias, especially those resistant to FLT3 inhibitor therapies.","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",,,"['P01 DK080665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118316/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 118316/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This AlPcS-Dox conjugation was further confirmed by electrophoresis. The AlPcS-Dox conjugates enhanced the cellular uptake of AlPcS three times more than unconjugated AlPcS in both human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line 7701 and rat basophilic leukemia cell line.

SS18-SSX fusion oncogene expression characterizes human synovial sarcomas and drives oncogenesis in a mouse model. Elevated expression of BCL2 is considered a consistent feature of the synovial sarcoma expression profile. Our objective was to evaluate the expression of apoptotic pathway members in synovial sarcomas and interrogate the impact of modulating SS18-SSX expression on this pathway. We show in human and murine synovial sarcoma cells that SS18-SSX increases BCL2 expression, but represses other anti-apoptotic genes, including MCL1 and BCL2A1. This repression is achieved by directly suppressing expression via binding through activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) response element (CRE) in the promoters of these genes and recruiting TLE1/Groucho. The suppression of these two anti-apoptotic pathways silences the typical routes by which other tumors evade BH3-domain peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy. We show that mouse and human synovial sarcoma cells are sensitive in vitro to ABT-263, a BH3-peptidomimetic, much more than the other tested cancer cell lines. ABT-263 also enhances the sensitivity of these cells to doxorubicin, a traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy used for synovial sarcoma. We also demonstrate the capacity of ABT-263 to stunt synovial sarcomagenesis in vivo in a genetic mouse model. These data recommend pursuit of BH3-peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy in human synovial sarcomas.","['Department of Orthopaedics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-5331, USA.']",,,"['K08 CA138764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM021168/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TFF 105265/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'K08CA138764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS498323'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 16.,"Recent findings indicate that specific microRNAs (miRNAs), such as those of the miR-17-92 cluster, may be responsible for regulating endothelial gene expression during tumor angiogenesis. Secreted miRNAs enclosed in exosomes also have an important role in cell-cell communication. To elucidate whether miRNAs secreted from neoplastic cells transfer into endothelial cells and are functionally active in the recipient cells, we investigated the effect of exosomal miRNAs derived from leukemia cells (K562) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As K562 cells released the miR-17-92 cluster, especially miR-92a, into the extracellular environment, K562 cells, transfected with Cy3-labeled pre-miR-92a, were co-cultured with HUVECs. Cy3-miR-92a derived from K562 cells was detected in the cytoplasm of HUVECs, and the Cy3-miR-92a co-localized with the signals of an exosomal marker, CD63. The expression of integrin alpha5, a target gene for miR-92a, was significantly reduced in HUVECs by exosomal miR-92a, indicating that exogenous miRNA via exosomal transport can function like endogenous miRNA in HUVECs. The most salient feature of this study is the exosome, derived from K562 cells with enforced miR-92a expression, did not affect the growth of HUVECs but did enhance endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Our results support the idea that exosomal miRNAs have an important role in neoplasia-to-endothelial cell communication.","['Department of Molecular Science, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. t_umezu@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations prompted us to explore whether rTM possessed cytoprotective effects on endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to rTM induced expression of antiapoptotic protein myeloid leukemia cell-1 through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in these cells. Additional studies found that exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to cyclosporine A and FK506, an immunosuppressant used for the individuals receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, induced apoptosis, which was attenuated when human umbilical vein endothelial cells were exposed to these agents in the presence of rTM. Further studies using deletion mutants of thrombomodulin (TM) identified that the epidermal growth factor domain of TM possessed cytoprotective effects. A single nucleotide substitution at codon 376 or 424 of TM, which impairs the ability of TM to produce activated protein C or bind to thrombin, respectively, did not hamper the cytoprotective effects of TM, which suggested that cytoprotective effects of rTM were distinctive from those of activated protein C. CONCLUSIONS: TM may be useful for prevention, as well as treatment of endothelial cell damage after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan. ikezoet@kochi-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the reactivity of alloreactive T cells specific for ubiquitously expressed MiHA against skin-derived primary human fibroblasts. We demonstrated that this reactivity was not merely determined by their antigen-specificity, but was highly dependent on adhesion molecule expression. ICAM-1 expression on the fibroblasts upregulated under proinflammatory conditions and induced during cross-talk with the T cells was demonstrated to be a crucial factor facilitating formation of high avidity interactions with the T cells and subsequent efficient target cell destruction. Furthermore, we provide supporting evidence for the role of ICAM-1 in vivo by demonstrating that ICAM-1 expression on nonhematopoietic target cells was dependent on the presence of infiltrating activated T cells, as was illustrated by restricted ICAM-1 expression at the sites of T cell infiltration in skin biopsies of patients with acute GVHD (aGVHD), by the absence of ICAM-1 expression in the same biopsies in areas without T cell infiltration and by the absence of ICAM-1 expression in biopsies of patients without GVHD independent of the presence of infiltrating nonactivated T cells. In conclusion, under noninflammatory conditions, nonhematopoietic tissues are unsusceptible to the GVHD reactivity of alloreactive T cells due to their inability to establish high avidity interactions.","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. eb.van_der_zouwen@lumc.nl']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 14.,"Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have been used in hematologic malignancies for the last decade. However, the mechanism of action of IMiDs is largely unknown. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of pivotal studies, recent advances in the application of IMiDs in cancer as well as their effects on hematopoietic stem cells including the risk of secondary malignancies. IMiDs have a well-established role as first-line therapy for patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Variant combinations of IMiDs with other chemotherapy reagents show promising outcomes in MM. Recent concerns on increased rate of secondary cancer in MM patients treated with maintenance lenalidomide were raised. But analysis of maintenance studies showed that the benefit of maintenance outweighs the risk of secondary cancers in MM. IMiDs also show efficacy in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and myelofibrosis (MF), but not in solid tumors. The major adverse effects are venous thromboembolism, neuropathy and cytopenias. IMiDs induce expansion and self-renewal of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and inhibit lineage maturation/differentiation by affecting critical transcription factors which might contribute to myelosuppression effect of IMiDs.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study is to present our experiences on endonasal treatment in immunocompromised pediatric hematology-oncology patients with AIFR. METHODS: Thirteen pediatric hematology-oncology patients treated for AIFR between March 2006 and December 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. We reviewed the following data for all patients: age, gender, predisposing disease, initial symptoms, pathological diagnosis, microbiological results, laboratory findings, surgical procedure, number of operations and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Nine of 13 patients with lesions confined to sinonasal cavity were operated with endoscopic approach. Open surgery was performed in four patients, three of them had palatal and buccal lesions and one had facial skin involvement. Endoscopic approach was also used for sinonasal lesions of these four patients. A total of 7 patients died: 4 patients with progression of the underlying disease, 2 patients with sepsis and 1 patient due to renal failure. Survival rate in surgically treated patients was found 46% (6/13 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Endonasal endoscopic approach is both feasible and efficient technique, also enables excellent local control with less morbidity compared to open surgery. This approach is suitable for patients who are diagnosed in the early stages of AIFR and also presents a less traumatic option for patients with poor health status. Open surgical procedure should be preferred in patients with disease extending out of the sinonasal cavity.","['Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Adana 01330, Turkey. ozgur_tarkan@yahoo.com']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The biopsies of the years 2006 and 2007 from the Institute of Pathology of the Jena University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed for clinicopathological parameters. In addition, the Mitelman database was retrieved for chromosomal aberrations. The analysis of 2820 reports from 1185 patients revealed that lymphomas, plasma cell myeloma and acute leukemia were most frequent. Males predominated in myeloproliferative neoplasms and lymphoma subtypes, particularly CLL, except for plasma cell myeloma and acute leukemia. A peak incidence was seen between 61 and 70 years of age with a varying pattern for single entities. The database search revealed that ALL, AML, CLL and CML were mainly diploid while Hodgkin lymphoma, mature B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma mostly carried hyperdiploid chromosome numbers. Numerical aberrations like chromosome 8 gains in hyperdiploid CML were prominent in specific subgroups. Molecular testing is exemplified in CML, plasma cell myeloma and hairy cell leukemia. The study highlights typical clinicopathological characteristics and new genetic findings in hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms with relevance for the new WHO classification and beyond. We hope that it may help in the differential diagnosis of bone marrow biopsies.","['Institute of Pathology of the Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"One of the first-line drugs for empirical antibiotic therapy in patients with hospital-acquired infections is meropenem. An often neglected problem in sepsis is that patients with a normal serum creatinine concentration (SCr) might display augmented renal clearance (ARC). Here we describe two cases of sepsis with subtherapeutic exposures with standard meropenem dosing in whom therapy could be optimised by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). A 37-year-old man with acute lymphatic leukaemia and sepsis had a normal SCr at the beginning of his Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay but showed decreased SCr of between 30 mumol/L and 40 mumol/L during his stay. He failed to achieve effective plasma concentrations with the meropenem standard dose of 3 g/day. Estimated glomerular filtration rate revealed values between 120 mL/min and 160 mL/min. He required a high meropenem daily dosage of 12 g that was far above the approved maximum dose. A 66-year-old patient undergoing surgery of a pulmonary aspergilloma presented SCr persistently <50 mumol/L, indicating ARC between 120 mL/min and 150 mL/min. This patient required 8 g of meropenem to achieve effective plasma concentrations. TDM may represent an invaluable approach to optimising drug exposure of beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with ARC in the ICU.

Epub 2012 Jun 26.,"Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae infects T lymphocytes and multiplies within them. Our previous studies have indicated that C. pneumoniae infection suppresses proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with Staphylococcus-enterotoxin B; however, the mechanism of suppression was unclear. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism involved in C. pneumoniae infection by using human acute T cell leukemia cell line, Jurkat E6-1. Proliferation of Jurkat cells was suppressed in an m.o.i.-dependent manner by C. pneumoniae infection. The suppression by the infection was particularly evident during the initial 24h of the infection, and down modulation of cyclin D3 protein levels were observed at the same time period by immunoblot analysis. The suppression of the Jurkat cell proliferation and the down modulation of cyclin D3 protein level were only induced by viable C. pneumoniae infection, not by exposure to UV-killed or heat-killed C. pneumoniae. Phosphorylations at Thr308 and Ser473 of AKT were induced by C. pneumoniae infection; however, phosphorylation at Thr389 of the downstream kinase, p70S6K was inhibited by unidentified mechanism associated with C. pneumoniae infection. Taking into account that G1 arrest of the C. pneumoniae infected Jurkat cells were not observed and that p70S6K is one of the most important regulators of protein synthesis, it was suggested that the suppression of Jurkat cell proliferation by C. pneumoniae was at least in part mediated by down modulation of protein synthesis through attenuation of Thr389 phosphorylation of p70S6K.","['Department of Biomedical Informatics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan. hiraii@glocol.osaka-u.ac.jp']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Epub 2012 Jul 12.,"Excessive growth of terminal hair around the elbows (hypertrichosis cubiti) has been reported both in isolation and in association with a variable spectrum of associated phenotypic features. We identified a cohort of six individuals with hypertrichosis cubiti associated with short stature, intellectual disability, and a distinctive facial appearance, consistent with a diagnosis of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS). Utilizing a whole-exome sequencing approach, we identified de novo mutations in MLL in five of the six individuals. MLL encodes a histone methyltransferase that regulates chromatin-mediated transcription through the catalysis of methylation of histone H3K4. Each of the five mutations is predicted to result in premature termination of the protein product. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transcripts arising from the mutant alleles are subject to nonsense-mediated decay. These findings define the genetic basis of WSS, provide additional evidence for the role of haploinsufficency of histone-modification enzymes in multiple-congenital-anomaly syndromes, and further illustrate the importance of the regulation of histone modification in development.","[""South West Thames Regional Genetics Service, St George's Hospital, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK.""]",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.

In this study, the antioxidant activity of these compounds was at first evaluated in membrane models, where caffeic acid behaved as a very effective chain-breaking antioxidant, whereas syringic and protocatechuic acids were only retardants of lipid peroxidation. However, all three compounds acted as good scavengers of reactive species in cultured cells subjected to exogenous oxidative stress produced by low level of H(2)O(2). Many tumour cells are characterised by increased ROS levels compared with their noncancerous counterparts. Therefore, we investigated whether phenolic acids, at low concentrations, comparable to those present in human plasma, were able to decrease basal reactive species. Results show that phenolic acids reduced ROS in a leukaemia cell line (HEL), whereas no effect was observed in normal cells, such as HUVEC. The compounds exhibited no toxicity to normal cells while they decreased proliferation in leukaemia cells, inducing apoptosis.

Epub 2012 Jul 6.,"The two related basic helix-loop-helix, TAL1 and LYL1, and their cofactor LIM-only-2 protein (LMO2) are present in blood and endothelial cells. While their crucial role in early hematopoiesis is well established, their function in endothelial cells and especially in angiogenesis is less understood. Here, we identified ANGIOPOIETIN-2 (ANG-2), which encodes a major regulator of angiogenesis, as a direct transcriptional target of TAL1, LYL1 and LMO2. Knockdown of any of the three transcription factors in human blood and lymphatic endothelial cells caused ANG-2 mRNA and protein down-regulation. Transient transfections showed that the full activity of the ANG-2 promoter required the integrity of a highly conserved Ebox-GATA composite element. Accordingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TAL1, LYL1, LMO2 and GATA2 occupied this region of ANG-2 promoter in human endothelial cells. Furthermore, we showed that LMO2 played a central role in assembling TAL1-E47, LYL1-LYL1 or/and LYL1-TAL1 dimers with GATA2. The resulting complexes were able to activate endogenous ANG-2 expression in endothelial cells as well as in non-endothelial cells. Finally, we showed that ANG-2 gene activation during angiogenesis concurred with the up-regulation of TAL1 and LMO2. Altogether, we identified ANG-2 as a bona fide target gene of LMO2-complexes with TAL1 and/or LYL1, highlighting a new function of the three hematopoietic factors in the endothelial lineage.","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier UMR 5535 CNRS, Montpellier, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 19.,"The goals of treating older patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are different than for younger patients. Few elderly patients are able to pursue an allogeneic stem cell transplant for potential cure of the disease. The focus for the treatment of older patients with MDS is therefore not curative, but rather alleviation of symptoms, improvement in quality of life, maintenance or improvement of functional status, and continued independent living. Prolongation of survival is only important if functional status and quality of life can be maintained, and there is greater risk of losing these outcomes in elderly patients. Azacitidine is an important drug for the treatment of older patients with MDS. Data from the AZA-001 trial has shown a survival benefit for patients with high-risk disease treated with azacitidine. Importantly, treatment has also been shown to improve quality of life for MDS patients. Subset analysis of the data has shown that the drug can be used safely in even the oldest patients with MDS and is superior to treatment with other established regimens, such as low-dose cytarabine. Given the delay between the initiation of treatment and the clinical response, patients may need aggressive supportive care with antiemetics, prophylactic antibiotics, and transfusions to maintain them through therapy. Azacitidine provides a better quality of response when it is used beyond the first response, so ongoing treatment is generally recommended in responding patients. A new oral preparation of the drug is in development that will make the treatment more feasible and comfortable for elderly patients.","['Leukemia Program, Weill Medical College of Cornell University and The New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA. ritchie@med.cornell.edu']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'geriatrics', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'supportive care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 12.,"The apolipoprotein-B-mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G or A3G) is a potent restrictive factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and many other retroviruses. It belongs to the cytidine deaminase family. Recent studies have shown that A3G significantly inhibits microRNA (miRNA)-mediated repression of translation. However, the mechanism underlying this action must be clarified. In this report, we have demonstrated that A3G counteracts miRNA-mediated repression of translation by inhibiting the interaction between moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein and Argonaute-2 (AGO2), causing either abnormal assembly or abnormal maturation of miRNA-inducing silencing complex (miRISC). Through a series of MOV10 deletions, we found that A3G binds to a domain at the C terminus in MOV10, where it competitively inhibits the binding of AGO2 to that same domain. The interaction between A3G and MOV10 relies on its association with a small RNA named 7SL RNA. The A3G mutant W127L, which is unable to bind to 7SL RNA, shows significantly incapability to counteract the miRNA-mediated repression of translation. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of miRISC activity. Although both A3G and MOV10 belong to the interferon antiviral system and inhibit HIV-1 and other retroviruses, their opposing effects on the cellular miRNA activity suggest that they play much more complicated regulatory roles in various cellular functions.","['Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China. chaoliulc@yahoo.com.cn']",,,"['R01 AI078812/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI078812/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, the efficacy of the common anticancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in cancer cells. While dose escalation of DOX can circumvent such resistance to a degree, this is precluded by the appearance of cardiotoxicity, a particularly debilitating condition in children. In vitro studies have established the ability of the natural phytochemical curcumin to overcome MDR; however, its widespread clinical application is restricted by poor solubility and low bioavailability. Building upon our recently developed polymer nanoparticle of curcumin (NanoCurc or NC) that significantly enhances the systemic bioavailability of curcumin, we synthesized a doxorubicin-curcumin composite nanoparticle formulation called NanoDoxCurc (NDC) for overcoming DOX resistance. Compared to DOX alone, NDC inhibited the MDR phenotype and caused striking growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo in several models of DOX-resistant cancers (multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, prostate and ovarian cancers, respectively). Notably, NDC-treated mice also demonstrated complete absence of cardiac toxicity, as assessed by echocardiography, or any bone marrow suppression, even at cumulative dosages where free DOX and pegylated liposomal DOX (Doxil(R)) resulted in demonstrable attenuation of cardiac function and hematological toxicities. This improvement in safety profile was achieved through a reduction of DOX-induced intracellular oxidative stress, as indicated by total glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase activity in cardiac tissue. A composite DOX-curcumin nanoparticle that overcomes both MDR-based DOX chemoresistance and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity holds promise for providing lasting and safe anticancer therapy.","['The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",,,"['R01 HL039752/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML in older adults differs biologically and clinically from that in younger ones, and is characterized by stronger intrinsic resistance and lower tolerance to chemotherapy. The effects of age on both patient- and disease-related factors result in a higher incidence of early death during chemotherapy, a lower rate of complete remission, and a reduced chance of long-term survival. Treatment options for older adults with AML include intensive chemotherapy, less-intensive chemotherapy, best supportive care, or enrolment in clinical trials. Given the heterogeneous nature of AML in older adults, therapeutic decisions need to be individualized after systematic assessment of disease biology and patient characteristics. Regardless of treatment, however, outcomes for older AML patients remain in general unsatisfactory. In contrast with the progress made for younger adults, the treatment of AML in older adults has not improved significantly in recent decades. Development of less toxic and more targeted agents may well provide treatment alternatives for a majority of these patients. The overall dismal outcome with currently available treatment approaches has encouraged older AML patients to participate in prospective clinical trials.","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, 1-98 Dengakugakubo, Kutsukake-cho, Toyoake, 470-1192, Japan. myanada@fujita-hu.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of 7 days of infusional cytarabine and 3 days of daunorubicin or idarubicin (7 + 3) has become the standard of care to induce CR, based on clinical trials conducted in the 1980s. Efforts to improve on the CR rate seen with the 7 + 3 regimen that translates into better overall patient survival have been disappointing. Here we review recent phase III studies of novel induction strategies that show promise in increasing the rate of CR and improving disease outcome.","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Leukemia Service, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",,,"['R25 CA020449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS543698'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer is a multigenic complex disease where multiple gene loci contribute to the phenotype. The ability to simultaneously monitor differential expression originating from each locus allows for a more accurate indication of degree of cancerous activity than either locus alone. Metal nanoparticles have been widely used as labels for in vitro identification and quantification of target sequences. Here we describe the synthesis of nanoparticles with different noble metal compositions in an alloy format that are then functionalized with thiol-modified ssDNA (nanoprobes). We also show how to use such nanoprobes in a non-cross-linking colorimetric method for the direct detection and quantification of specific mRNA targets, without the need for enzymatic amplification or reverse transcription steps. The different metals in the alloy provide for distinct absorption spectra due to their characteristic plasmon resonance peaks. The color multiplexing allows for simultaneous identification of several different mRNA targets involved in cancer development. Comparison of the absorption spectra of the nanoprobes mixtures taken before and after induced aggregation of metal nanoparticles allows to both identify and quantify each mRNA target. We describe the use of gold and gold:silver-alloy nanoprobes for the development of the non-cross-linking method to detect a specific BCR-ABL fusion gene (e.g., e1a2 and e14a2) mRNA target associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using 10 ng muL(-1) of unamplified total human RNA. This simple methodology takes less than 50 min to complete after total RNA extraction with comparable specificity and sensitivity to the more commonly used methods.","['CIGMH, Departamento de Ciencias da Vida, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 13.,"c-Abl is a proto-oncogene that is essential for mouse development and tissue homeostasis. Misregulation of c-Abl, as seen in the constitutively active BCR-ABL, is the leading cause of human chronic myeloid leukemia. However, how the Abl proteins execute their functions still remains largely unknown. Here, we report an important role for c-Abl in replicative senescence and immortalization by regulating the expression of two tumor suppressors that induce cellular senescence, p53 and p16(INK4a). Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we show that c-Abl (-/-) cells were more resistant to immortalization than wildtype cells using a standard 3T3 or 3T9 protocol. We could only immortalize three out of nine c-Abl (-/-) MEF cultures even when we increased the number of starting cells. This resistance was attributed to premature senescence and reduced survival in senescent c-Abl (-/-) cells due to an increase in p16(INK4a) and p53 expression. Deleting p53 allows c-Abl (-/-) p53 (-/-) MEFs to bypass senescence to be spontaneously immortalized. Cell immortalization, but not senescence, was generally accompanied by mutations in p53 in both wildtype and c-Abl (-/-) MEFs, although the spectrum is different from that of human tumors. The role for c-Abl in regulating cell senescence and immortalization might explain some of the developmental defects in c-Abl (-/-) mice and how BCR-ABL transforms cells.","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Shi Ji Tan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was confirmed that these concentrations did not influence cell viability. Viability of subsequently exposed to 1-20 microg/mL was not different from that of control cells not treated with VP-16. VP-16 caused cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase. On the other hand, 40487S arrested the cell cycle at S phase. Thymidine-synchronized cells, VP-16 showed cell cycle specificity for cell killing from early-S to mid-S phase. On the other hand, 40487S showed cell cycle-independent cytotoxicity. Exposure of cells to VP-16 after 40487S induced a greater cytotoxic effect on K-562 cells. The findings may lead to improvements in clinical combination chemotherapy.","['Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"Acute leukemias are characterized by deregulation of transcriptional networks that control the lineage specificity of gene expression. The aberrant overexpression of the Spi-1/PU.1 transcription factor leads to erythroleukemia. To determine how Spi-1 mechanistically influences the transcriptional program, we combined a ChIP-seq analysis with transcriptional profiling in cells from an erythroleukemic mouse model. We show that Spi-1 displays a selective DNA-binding that does not often cause transcriptional modulation. We report that Spi-1 controls transcriptional activation and repression partially through distinct Spi-1 recruitment to chromatin. We revealed several parameters impacting on Spi-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Gene activation is facilitated by Spi-1 occupancy close to transcriptional starting site of genes devoid of CGIs. Moreover, in those regions Spi-1 acts by binding to multiple motifs tightly clustered and with similar orientation. Finally, in contrast to the myeloid and lymphoid B cells in which Spi-1 exerts a physiological activity, in the erythroleukemic cells, lineage-specific cooperating factors do not play a prevalent role in Spi-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, our work describes a new mechanism of gene activation through clustered site occupancy of Spi-1 particularly relevant in regard to the strong expression of Spi-1 in the erythroleukemic cells.","['Institut Curie, Paris, F-75248, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 13.,"Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which inhibit the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, are involved in the survival of various hematopoietic lineages and are often dysregulated in hematopoietic malignancies. However, their involvement in the megakaryocytic lineage is not well understood. In the present paper, we describe the crucial anti-apoptotic role of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL in this lineage at multistages. The megakaryocytic lineage-specific deletion of both, in sharp contrast to only one of them, caused apoptotic loss of mature megakaryocytes in the fetal liver and systemic hemorrhage, leading to embryonic lethality. ABT-737, a Bcl-xL/Bcl-2/Bcl-w inhibitor, only caused thrombocytopenia in adult wild-type mice, but further induced massive mature megakaryocyte apoptosis in the Mcl-1 knockout mice, leading to severe hemorrhagic anemia. All these phenotypes were fully restored if Bak and Bax, downstream apoptosis executioners, were also deficient. In-vitro study revealed that the Jak pathway maintained Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL expression levels, preventing megakaryoblastic cell apoptosis. Similarly, both were involved in reticulated platelet survival, whereas platelet survival was dependent on Bcl-xL due to rapid proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. In conclusion, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL regulate the survival of the megakaryocytic lineage, which is critically important for preventing lethal or severe hemorrhage in both developing and adult mice.","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 26-year-old man received FK506 to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. He underwent an intravenous injection of FK506 the day before transplantation (day -1). He developed headache, hypertension, nausea and vomiting from day 2 to day 3. A computed tomography scan showed a low density area with unclear border in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. Thereafter, these symptoms improved with discontinuation of FK506, which was strongly suggestive of encephalopathy caused by FK506. The blood concentration of FK506 at the onset of encephalopathy was 21.7 ng/mL. Although this value was slightly higher than the standard therapeutic range (10-20 ng/mL), it was within clinically acceptable range in the early stage after stem cell transplantation. This indicates that even if the blood concentration of FK506 is within the therapeutic range, encephalopathy may develop.

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"OBJECTIVE: Experimental and clinical evidence suggest a therapeutic role for the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in fibrosing conditions. We evaluated published data on the safety and efficacy of imatinib for patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a severe autoimmune disease with significant morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A careful search for all original articles and abstracts on the use of imatinib in SSc published in English from 2008 through February 2012 was performed. Two additional patients from our center are also described. RESULTS: Five small observational clinical trials on the use of imatinib in severe SSc have been conducted and case reports and small series of refractory to current approaches patients have been reported, adding to a total of 108 patients having received this drug to date. In most of these patients imatinib was given for skin or pulmonary fibrosis. Encouraging results were reported in 3 of 4 studies, whereas the fifth study was prematurely terminated for safety reasons. Overall, clinical results are highly variable, ranging from ineffective or toxic responses to extremely encouraging clinical improvements in some severely ill patients. These discrepancies could partly reflect imatinib-related safety issues, in particular, SSc patients or idiosyncratic resistance to imatinib, as happens in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the drug's approved indications.

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"Human phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) 1 expression is strongly activated in response to interferon (IFN) treatment and viral infection, and PLSCR1 is necessary for the IFN-dependent induction of gene expression and antiviral activity. We show here that PLSCR1 directly interacts with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) Tax in vitro and in vivo. This interaction reduced the cytoplasmic distribution of Tax. PLSCR1 efficiently repressed the Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat and the NF-kappaB binding site reporter constructs in an interaction-dependent manner in COS-1 and Tax-producing HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. Furthermore, we show that PLSCR1 repressed the homodimerization of Tax in vitro. These data reveal for the first time that PLSCR1 specifically interacts with HTLV-1 Tax and negatively regulates its transactivation activity by altering the subcellular distribution and the homodimerization of Tax. PLSCR1 may play an important role in the IFN-mediated repression of Tax-dependent transactivation during HTLV-1 infection.","['Division of Persistent and Oncogenic Viruses, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890-8544, Japan. skusano@m2.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jun 19.,"A series of new 3-methylidenechroman-2-ones bearing various aromatic moieties and various substituents at position 4 were synthesized in a three step reaction sequence. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of phenols or naphthols using ethyl 3-methoxy-2-diethoxyphosphorylacrylate in the presence of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid gave 3-diethoxyphosphorylchromen-2-ones. These compounds were employed as Michael acceptors in the reaction with Grignard reagents to give adducts which were finally used as Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reagents for the olefination of formaldehyde. All obtained 3-methylidenechroman-2-ones were tested against two human leukemia cell lines NALM-6 and HL-60 as well as MCF-7 breast cancer and HT-29 colon cancer adenocarcinomas. Several obtained methylidenechromanones displayed high cytotoxic activity with IC(50) values below 1 muM, mainly against leukemia and MCF-7 cell lines. Investigation of structure-activity relationships revealed that the presence of additional, ortho-fused benzene ring and n-butyl or i-propyl group in position 4 enhances the activity. Selected methylidenechromanones were also tested on normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and chromanone 14o was found to be eightfold more toxic against MCF-7 than normal cells. Furthermore, antimicrobial assays revealed that chromanone 14n is highly active and bactericidal at concentration equal to MIC or 2MIC against nosocomial and community-associated staphylococci (MRSA) which are resistant to most or all available therapeutic classes of antimicrobial drugs.","['Institute of Organic Chemistry, Technical University of Lodz, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924 Lodz, Poland.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Acute myloid leukemias (AMLs) are heterogeneous blood malignancies characterized by a block at various stages of hematopoietic differentiation and there are more than 200 known chromosome translocations and mutations in leukemic cells of patients diagnosed with AML. Because of the multiplicity in the genetic lesions causing the disease, AMLs are particularly difficult to treat successfully. In particular, various AML cells to a variable degree respond to 1,25D-based differentiation and only one type of AML undergoes successfully ATRA-based differentiation therapy. In this paper we describe that AML cell line KG-1 is resistant to 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation, while sensitive to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. We show that KG-1 cells have very low level of VDR protein and that expression of VDR mRNA is upregulated by ATRA. We show for the first time that this regulation is cell context-specific, because in another AML cell line, HL60, VDR mRNA is downregulated by ATRA. ATRA-induced VDR protein in cytosol of KG-1 cells can be further activated by 1,25D to induce monocytic differentiation of these cells.","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, Tamka 2, 50-137 Wroclaw, Poland.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The therapeutic effect is a consequence of nucleolar disruption and activation of p53-dependent apoptotic signaling.

Abl transformation is associated with constitutive activation of JAK/STAT-dependent signaling. However, the mechanism by which Abl oncoproteins bypass SOCS inhibitory regulation remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that coexpression of Bcr-Abl with SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of these SOCS proteins. Interestingly, SOCS-1 is highly tyrosine phosphorylated in one of five primary chronic myelogenous leukemia samples. Bcr-Abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 occurs mainly on Tyr 155 and Tyr 204 residues of SOCS-1 and on Tyr 221 residue of SOCS-3. We observed that phosphorylation of these SOCS proteins was associated with their binding to Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 diminished their inhibitory effects on the activation of JAK and STAT5 and thereby enhanced JAK/STAT5 signaling. Strikingly, disrupting the tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 impaired the expression of Bcl-X(L) protein and sensitized K562 leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, selective mutation of tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 significantly blocked Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis in nude mice and inhibited Bcr-Abl-mediated murine bone marrow transformation. Together, these results reveal a mechanism of how Bcr-Abl may overcome SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibition to constitutively activate the JAK/STAT-dependent signaling, and suggest that Bcr-Abl may critically requires tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 to mediate tumorigenesis when these SOCS proteins are present in cells.","['CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']",,,['R37 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib, a bcr-abl inhibitor, has been approved clinically for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and demonstrated to be effective against solid tumors in vitro through Src inhibition. Here, we disclose that EGFR degradation mediated dasatinib-induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. HNSCC cells, including Ca9-22, FaDu, HSC3, SAS, SCC-25, and UMSCC1, were treated with dasatinib, and cell viability, apoptosis, and underlying signal transduction were evaluated. Dasatinib exhibited differential sensitivities against HNSCC cells. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were correlated with its inhibition on Akt, Erk, and Bcl-2, irrespective of Src inhibition. Accordingly, we found that down-regulation of EGFR was a determinant of dasatinib sensitivity. Lysosome inhibitor reversed dasatinib-induced EGFR down-regulation, and c-cbl activity was increased by dasatinib, indicating that dasatinib-induced EGFR down-regulation might be through c-cbl-mediated lysosome degradation. Increased EGFR activation by ligand administration rescued cells from dasatinib-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of EGFR enhanced its apoptotic effect. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) was demonstrated to play a role in Bcl-2 expression, and dasatinib inhibited ERalpha at the pretranslational level. ERalpha was associated with EGFR in dasatinib-treated HNSCC cells. Furthermore, the xenograft model showed that dasatinib inhibited HSC3 tumor growth through in vivo down-regulation of EGFR and ERalpha. In conclusion, degradation of EGFR is a novel mechanism responsible for dasatinib-induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells.","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,['Neoplasia. 2017 Mar;19(3):252-254.

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"The mechanisms by which beta1 integrins regulate chemoresistance of cancer cells are still poorly understood. In this study, we report that collagen/beta1 integrin signaling inhibits doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of Jurkat and HSB2 leukemic T-cells by up-regulating the expression and function of the ATP-binding cassette C 1 (ABCC1) transporter, also known as multidrug resistance-associated protein 1. We find that collagen but not fibronectin reduces intracellular doxorubicin content and up-regulates the expression levels of ABCC1. Inhibition and knockdown studies show that up-regulation of ABCC1 is necessary for collagen-mediated reduction of intracellular doxorubicin content and collagen-mediated inhibition of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We also demonstrate that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway is involved in collagen-induced reduction of intracellular doxorubicin accumulation, collagen-induced up-regulation of ABCC1 expression levels, and collagen-mediated cell survival. Finally, collagen-mediated up-regulation of ABCC1 expression and function also requires actin polymerization. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that collagen/beta1 integrin/ERK signaling up-regulates the expression and function of ABCC1 and suggest that its activation could represent an important pathway in cancer chemoresistance. Thus simultaneous targeting of collagen/beta1 integrin and ABCC1 may be more efficient in preventing drug resistance than targeting each pathway alone.","['Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie/Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.']",,,['MOP-98005/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"Many syndromes have a large number of differential diagnoses, a situation which calls for multiplex diagnostic systems. Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also named chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is a common disease of unknown etiology. A mouse retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus (XMRV), was found in ME/CFS patients and blood donors, but this was not corroborated. However, the paucity of serological investigations on XMRV in humans prompted us to develop a serological assay which cover many aspects of XMRV antigenicity. It is a novel suspension array method, using a multiplex IgG assay with nine recombinant proteins from the env and gag genes of XMRV and 38 peptides based on known epitopes of vertebrate gammaretroviruses. IgG antibodies were sought in 520 blood donors and 85 ME/CFS patients and in positive- and negative-control sera from animals. We found no differences in seroreactivity between blood donors and ME/CFS patients for any of the antigens. This did not support an association between ME/CFS and XMRV infection. The multiplex serological system had several advantages: (i) biotinylated protein G allowed us to run both human and animal sera, which is essential because of a lack of XMRV-positive humans; (ii) a novel quality control was a pan-peptide positive-control rabbit serum; and (iii) synthetic XMRV Gag peptides with degenerate positions covering most of the variation of murine leukemia-like viruses did not give higher background than nondegenerate analogs. The principle may be used for creation of variant tolerant peptide serologies. Thus, our system allows rational large-scale serological assays with built-in quality control.","['Section of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"The outcome of older (>/= 60 years) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is poor, and novel treatments are needed. In a phase 2 trial for older AML patients, low-dose (20 mg/m(2) per day for 10 days) decitabine, a DNA hypomethylating azanucleoside, produced 47% complete response rate with an excellent toxicity profile. To assess the genome-wide activity of decitabine, we profiled pretreatment and post treatment (day 25/course 1) methylomes of marrow samples from patients (n = 16) participating in the trial using deep-sequencing analysis of methylated DNA captured by methyl-binding protein (MBD2). Decitabine significantly reduced global methylation compared with pretreatment baseline (P = .001). Percent marrow blasts did not correlate with global methylation levels, suggesting that hypomethylation was related to the activity of decitabine rather than to a mere decrease in leukemia burden. Hypomethylation occurred predominantly in CpG islands and CpG island-associated regions (P ranged from .03 to .04) A significant concentration (P < .001) of the hypomehtylated CpG islands was found in chromosome subtelomeric regions, suggesting a differential activity of decitabine in distinct chromosome regions. Hypermethylation occurred much less frequently than hypomethylation and was associated with low CpG content regions. Decitabine-related methylation changes were concordant with those previously reported in distinct genes. In summary, our study supports the feasibility of methylome analyses as a pharmacodynamic endpoint for hypomethylating therapies.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, 460 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['Blood. 2012 Sep 20;120(12):2354-5.

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aberrant expression and mutations of transcription factors have been correlated with disease outcome. In the present study, we performed expression and mutation screening of GATA2, which is an essential transcription factor for regulation of myeloid lineage determination, in de novo pediatric AML patients. GATA2 mutations were detected in 5 of 230 patients, representing a frequency of 2.2% overall and 9.8% in cytogenetically normal AML. GATA2 expression analysis demonstrated that in 155 of 237 diagnostic samples (65%), GATA2 expression was higher than in normal BM. In complete remission, normalization of GATA2 expression was observed, whereas GATA2 expression levels stayed high in patients with resistant disease. High GATA2 expression at diagnosis was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.7, P = .045), event-free survival (HR = 2.1, P = .002), and disease-free survival (HR = 2.3, P = .004). The prognostic impact of GATA2 was particularly evident in specific AML subgroups. In patients with French-American-British M5 morphology, inv(16), or high WT1 expression, significant differences in survival were observed between patients with high versus normal GATA2 expression. We conclude that high GATA2 expression is a novel poor prognostic marker in pediatric AML, which may contribute to better risk-group stratification and risk-adapted therapy in the future.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre and Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"When seeking prognostic information for patients, modern technologies provide a huge amount of genomic measurements as a starting point. For single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), there may be more than one million covariates that need to be simultaneously considered with respect to a clinical endpoint. Although the underlying biological problem cannot be solved on the basis of clinical cohorts of only modest size, some important SNPs might still be identified. Sparse multivariable regression techniques have recently become available for automatically identifying prognostic molecular signatures that comprise relatively few covariates and provide reasonable prediction performance. For illustrating how such approaches can be adapted to the specific features of SNP data, we propose different variants of a component-wise likelihood-based boosting approach. The latter links SNP measurements to a time-to-event endpoint by a regression model that is built up in a large number of steps. The variants allow for strategic choices in dealing with SNPs that differ in variance because of their variation in minor allele frequencies. In addition, we propose a heuristic that allows computationally efficient handling of millions of covariates, thus opening the door for incorporating SNP x treatment interactions. We illustrate this using data from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. We judge the resulting models according to prediction error curves and using resampling data sets. We obtain increased stability by moving interpretation from the SNP to the gene level. By considering these different aspects, we outline a more general strategy for linking SNP measurements to a time-to-event endpoint by means of sparse multivariable regression models.","['Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany. binderh@uni-mainz.de']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is limited information about the immune responses induced by drugs, including those drugs that are metabolically activated. In this study, we constructed an in vitro assay system to assess the involvement of immune-related factors induced by metabolic activation of drugs. To investigate whether CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of 10 hepatotoxic drugs is associated with immune-related responses, human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were co-incubated with CYP3A4 Supersomes. Cluster of differentiation (CD) 86 and CD54 expression levels on THP-1 cells were upregulated by treatment with albendazole and amiodarone (AMD), respectively, in the presence of CYP3A4. Additionally, N-desethylamiodarone (DEA), a major metabolite of AMD, upregulated the CD54 expression of THP-1 cells with CYP3A4. The release of interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from THP-1 cells was significantly increased by the treatment of AMD or DEA with CYP3A4. Similarly, IL-8 and TNFalpha were also upregulated by the treatment of AMD and DEA with human liver microsomes, but were inhibited by adding ketoconazole to the cell culture. In this study, we first report that albendazole, AMD and DEA activate immune reaction when metabolically activated.","['Drug Metabolism and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose was to determine whether EN improves early outcome after MAC allo-SCT. METHODS: Early outcome was prospectively assessed in patients undergoing MAC allo-SCT. A total of 121 consecutive patients undergoing a first MAC allo-SCT for acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative syndrome were included. Patients who received cord blood were excluded. Enteral nutrition was systematically offered, although PN was provided when EN had been refused or was poorly tolerated. Among the patients, 94 received EN (EN group) and 27 did not (non-EN group). Overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of engraftment and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) within the first 100 days after transplantation were studied. Because EN and PN treatment assignments were not random, propensity score adjustments were performed on patient outcomes. RESULTS: Outcome was better in the EN group than in the non-EN group for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.42; P=0.0008), neutrophil (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.26-3.39; P=0.004), and platelet (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.004-3.70; P=0.049) engraftments and aGVHD development (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04-0.39; P=0.0004). In Cox model analysis, EN demonstrated a protective effect (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.77; P=0.019) on OS, whereas demonstrated a detrimental impact (HR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.02-17.12; P=0.047). Enteral nutrition was found to be an independent factor in neutrophil engraftment (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.24-3.81; P=0.007), whereas PN delayed platelet engraftment (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.99; P=0.046). Enteral nutrition was the only factor that was protective against grades 3 to 4 aGVHD development (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.72; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of EN is preferable to upfront PN in these patients.","['Unite Mobile de Soutien Nutritionnel, Univ Lille Nord de France, Lille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 1.,"Overcoming resistance to chemotherapy is the main therapeutic challenge in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Interactions between leukemia cells and the microenvironment promote leukemia cell survival and confer resistance to chemotherapy. Hypoxia is an integral component of bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1), a key regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia, regulates cell growth and metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1alpha expression, analyzed by Reverse Phase Protein Arrays in 92 specimens from newly diagnosed patients with pre-B-ALL, had a negative prognostic impact on survival (p = 0.0025). Inhibition of HIF-1alpha expression by locked mRNA antagonist (LNA) promoted chemosensitivity under hypoxic conditions, while pharmacological or genetic stabilization of HIF-1alpha under normoxia inhibited cell growth and reduced apoptosis induction by chemotherapeutic agents. Co-culture of pre-B ALL or REH cells with BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) under hypoxia resulted in further induction of HIF-1alpha protein and acquisition of the glycolytic phenotype, in part via stroma-induced AKT/mTOR signaling. mTOR blockade with everolimus reduced HIF-1alpha expression, diminished glucose uptake and glycolytic rate and partially restored the chemosensitivity of ALL cells under hypoxia/stroma co-cultures. Hence, mTOR inhibition or blockade of HIF-1alpha-mediated signaling may play an important role in chemosensitization of ALL cells under hypoxic conditions of the BM microenvironment.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA155056-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings of fine needle aspiration cytology of the cervical mass revealed large lymphoblasts with mitoses present. These findings strongly suggested the diagnosis of lymphosarcoma. Necropsy revealed a large mass in the cervical thymic region, which compressed the esophagus and trachea. Cranial masses in the frontal sinus and multiple extradural sites throughout the cranial vault were also recorded. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of thymic lymphosarcoma and demonstrated the brain involvement of neoplastic lymphoid cells in the cerebrum.

Epub 2012 Jul 10.,"The role of DNA methyl transferase I (DNMT1) in allergic inflammation was investigated. Antigen stimulation decreased expression of DNMT1 in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL2H3). The down regulation of DNMT1 induced expression of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). HDAC3 was necessary for allergic skin inflammation, such as such as triphasic cutaneous reaction and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The down regulation of DNMT1 resulted from activation of PKC and rac1 which were necessary for proteasome-dependent ubiquitination of DNMT1 by antigen stimulation. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species production, exerted negative effects on allergic skin inflammation. Antigen stimulation led to increased expression of Tip60, a histone acetyl transferase. Wild type, but not mutant form, Tip60 decreased expression of DNMT1 while increasing expression of HDAC3, suggesting role for acetylation in ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of DNMT1. In vivo down regulation of DNMT1 increased ear thickness, typical of allergic skin inflammation, induced vascular leakage and promoted angiogenesis in BALB/c mouse. The down regulation of DNMT1 enhanced angiogenic potential of rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) accompanied by activation of VEGR-2 and induced interaction between VEGR-2 and syk in RAEC. The enhanced angiogenic potential of RAEC was associated with the induction of VEGF by down regulation of DNMT1 in RBL2H3 cells. The down regulation of DNMT1 induced leukocytes-endothelial cell interaction and expression of various adhesion molecules. Aspirin exerted a negative effect on allergic skin inflammation by indirect regulation on DNMT1 via Tip60. Taken together, these results suggest novel role for DNMT1 in allergic skin inflammation.","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chunchon 200-701, Republic of Korea.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

MSI2 expression was significantly reduced in low and high-risk MDS compared with normal control samples. NUMB expression was significantly lower than that of MSI2 in both MDS and AML patient samples, but no differences in the expression levels for either gene were observed in healthy bone marrow cells. Finally, NUMB expression was significantly up-regulated during differentiation of normal and low-risk MDS CD34(+) cells through the erythroid lineage. Taken together, results suggest the involvement of NUMB in MDS erythropoiesis; its down-modulation may have a role in MDS progression.","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about the role of PTPs in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was therefore to establish a PTP expression profile in AML cells and to explore the possible role of FLT3 ITD (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplication), an important oncoprotein in AML for PTP gene expression. PTP mRNA expression was analyzed in AML cells from patients and in cell lines using a RT-qPCR platform for detection of transcripts of 92 PTP genes. PTP mRNA expression was also analyzed based on a public microarray data set for AML patients. Highly expressed PTPs in AML belong to all PTP subfamilies. Very abundantly expressed PTP genes include PTPRC, PTPN2, PTPN6, PTPN22, DUSP1, DUSP6, DUSP10, PTP4A1, PTP4A2, PTEN, and ACP1. PTP expression was further correlated with the presence of FLT3 ITD, focusing on a set of highly expressed dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Elevated expression of DUSP6 in patients harboring FLT3 ITD was detected in this analysis. The mechanism and functional role of FLT3 ITD-mediated upregulation of DUSP6 was then explored using pharmacological inhibitors of FLT3 ITD signal transduction and si/shRNA technology in human and murine cell lines. High DUSP6 expression was causally associated with the presence of FLT3 ITD and dependent on FLT3 ITD kinase activity and ERK signaling. DUSP6 depletion moderately increased ERK1/2 activity but attenuated FLT3 ITD-dependent cell proliferation of 32D cells. In conclusion, DUSP6 may play a contributing role to FLT3 ITD-mediated cell transformation.","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany. i5frbo@rz.uni-jena.de.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We herein report the synthesis and in vitro characterization of a library of coordination complex SH2 domain proteomimetics. Compounds were designed to interact with phosphopeptides via a two-point interaction, principally with pY, and to make secondary interactions with pY+2/3, thereby achieving sequence-selective discrimination.

This aberration results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a BCR/ABL fusion gene. The diagnosis of CML is based on the detection of BCR/ABL gene or Ph chromosome. Fusion proteins with different sizes are encoded depending on the breakpoint in the BCR gene. In general, 3 breakpoint cluster regions in the BCR gene have been described: major (M-bcr), minor (m-bcr), and micro (micro-bcr). The aim of this study was to search the BCR/ABL fusion gene in 60 Tunisian patients using multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and compare our results with those of conventional cytogenetics. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) samples, obtained at diagnosis, from 60 patients were analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR and conventional cytogenetics. RESULTS: 45 patients examined were positive for some type of BCR/ABL rearrangement. The majority of the patients (97.77%) expressed one of the p210 BCR-ABL transcripts (63% with b3a2 and 36% with b2a2) while only one patient showed a rare e19a2 transcript. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex RT-PCR is a fast and reliable technique for improved detection of typical and atypical BCR/ABL transcripts.","['Department of Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics and Reproductive Biology, Farhat Hached University Teaching Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia. aydabennour@yahoo.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to 90% of normal population changes to seropositive for BK virus by the age of 10 years. Whether this oncogenic virus is responsible for evolving ALL is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the excretion of urinary BK virus in newly diagnosed children with ALL compared with normal population. METHODS: This case-control study was carried out on 62 participants (32 ALL patients and 32 normal subjects), aged 1-18 years, in Saint Al-Zahra and Sayyed-Al-Shohada University Hospitals, Isfahan, Iran. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect the BK virus in specimens. PCR amplification was performed using specific primers of PEP-1 (5'-AGTCTTTAGGGTCTTCTACC-3') and PEP-2 (5'-GGTGCCAACCTATGGAACAG-3'). RESULTS: Thirty-five out of 62 participants (54.8%) were males and the remaining were females. The mean duration of disease was 9.6 +/- 9.69 months. Central nervous system (CNS) relapse was seen in 29% of the patients. Positive PCR for urine BK virus was seen in three children with ALL (9.7%). No positive result for urine BKV was achieved in the control group. However, Fisher's exact test did not show any significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). In addition, there was no significant correlation between BKV positivity and frequency of relapses. CONCLUSION: To demonstrate the role of BK virus in inducing ALL or increasing the number of relapses, prospective studies on larger scale of population and evaluating both serum and urine for BK virus are recommended.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Child Growth and Development Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Isfahan, Iran.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BK virus', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 35 (IL-35), a novel inhibitory cytokine secreted by regulatory T (Treg) cells is a novel potential target used for the therapeutic manipulation of Treg activity in order to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. To investigate the role and imbalance of Treg-related cytokines in the pathogenesis of AML, we measured the plasma concentration of three Treg-associated cytokines [IL-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)] and evaluated their clinical relevance. The concentration of IL-35, IL-10 and TGF-beta in plasma specimens from 55 patients with AML [27 newly diagnosed (ND) patients and 28 in complete remission (CR)] and 24 controls was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Significantly higher levels of plasma IL-35 and IL-10 were observed in AML ND patients compared with healthy controls or AML CR patients. IL-10 concentrations were positively correlated with TGF-beta, whereas no correlations were found between the other cytokines. IL-10 levels were positively correlated with white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil (NEU) count but there were no correlations between IL-35 and TGF-beta with WBC and NEU count. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that AML ND patients have increased plasma concentrations of IL-35, suggesting that this cytokine is involved in the pathophysiological process of the disease, and that further research is required to address this issue.","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

Epub 2012 Jun 26.,"BACKGROUND: Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is a well-known and effective treatment that can result in clinical remission for patients diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The biologic efficacy of As(2)O(3) in APL and solid tumor cells has been explained through its actions on anti-proliferation, anti-angiogenesis, and apoptotic signaling pathways. We theorize that As(2)O(3) activates a pathway that disrupts microtubule dynamics forming abnormal, nonfunctioning mitotic spindles, thus preventing cellular division. In this study, we investigated how As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis by causing microtubule dysfunction. METHODS: Cultured NB4 cells were treated with As(2)O(3), paclitaxel, and vincristine. Flow cytometric analysis was then performed. An MTT assay was used to determine drug-mediated cytotoxicity. For tubulin polymerization assay, each polymerized or soluble tubulin was measured. Microtubule assembly-disassembly was measured using a tubulin polymerization kit. Cellular microtubules were also observed with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: As(2)O(3) treatment disrupted tubulin assembly resulting in dysfunctional microtubules that cause death in APL cells. As(2)O(3) markedly enhanced the amount of depolymerized microtubules. The number of microtubule posttranslational modifications on an individual tubulin decreased with As(2)O(3) concentration. Immunocytochemistry revealed changes in the cellular microtubule network and formation of polymerized microtubules in As(2)O(3)-treated cells. CONCLUSION: The microtubules alterations found with As(2)O(3) treatment suggest that As(2)O(3) increases the depolymerized forms of tubulin in cells and that this is potentially due to arsenite's negative effects on spindle dynamics.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Antimitotic agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Tubulin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The East Asia region has one of the lowest incidence rates of malignant lymphoma. The incidence of malignant lymphoma around the world has been increasing at a rate of 3-4% over the last 4 decades, while some stabilization has been observed in developed countries in recent years. The reasons behind this lymphoma epidemic are poorly understood, although improving diagnostic accuracy, the recent AIDS epidemic, an aging world population and the increasing adoption of cancer-causing behaviors are suggested as contributing factors. Etiologies of malignant lymphoma include infectious agents, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, exposure to certain organic chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The distribution of many subtypes exhibit marked geographic variations. Compared to the West, T/natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas (T/NK-cell lymphoma) and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) are relatively more common, whereas other B-cell lymphomas, particularly follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, are less common in Asia. Some subtypes of T/NK-cell lymphomas defined by Epstein-Barr virus association are predominantly Asian diseases, if not exclusively so. Both ethnic and environmental factors play roles in such diversity.

Human retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), encode the regulatory proteins Rev and Rex, which form a bridge between the viral RNA and the export receptor CRM1. Recent studies show that these transport systems are not only involved in RNA export, but also in the encapsidation of genomic RNA; furthermore, they influence subsequent events in the cytoplasm, including the translation of the cognate mRNA, transport of Gag proteins to the plasma membrane, and the formation of virus particles.

To explore possible roles for ZO-1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we inactivated the ZO-1 locus by homologous recombination. The lack of ZO-1 was found to affect mESC self-renewal and differentiation in the presence of leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF) and Bmp4 or following removal of the growth factors. Our data suggest that ZO-1 suppresses Stat3 and Smad1/5/8 activities and sustains extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activity to promote mESC differentiation. Interestingly, Smad2, critical for human but not mESC self-renewal, was hyperactivated in ZO-1(-/-) mESCs and RhoA protein levels were concomitantly enhanced, suggesting attenuation of the noncanonical transforming growth factor beta (Tgfbeta)/Activin/Nodal pathway that mediates ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA via the TJ proteins Occludin, Par6, and Smurf1 and activation of the canonical Smad2-dependent pathway. Furthermore, Bmp4-induced differentiation of mESCs in the absence of LIF was suppressed in ZO-1(-/-) mESCs, but differentiation down the neural or cardiac lineages was not disturbed. These findings reveal novel roles for ZO-1 in mESC self-renewal, pluripotency, and differentiation by influencing several signaling networks that regulate these processes. Possible implications for the differing relevance of Smad2 in mESC and human ESC self-renewal and how ZO-1 may connect to the different pathways are discussed.","['Epithelial Cell Biology Laboratory, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"INTRODUCTION: Presently the techniques for making transgenic animals are cumbersome, required costly instruments and trained man-power. The ability of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to integrate foreign genes has provided the opportunity for developing alternate methods for generation of transgenic animals. One of the big challenges in this field is development of the methods to identify and purify donor SSCs by antibody mediated cell sorting. PURPOSE: The present study was aimed to identify goat subpopulations of SSCs using polyclonal antibodies against PGP9.5 and c-kit molecular markers as well as the growth characteristics of SSCs during short term culture. METHODS: One month old goats' testicular samples were subjected for immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical evaluations. The enzymatically isolated SSCs were cultured in DMEM plus FCS supplemented with (treatment) or without (control) growth factors (GDNF, LIF, FGF, and EGF) for 2 weeks. At the end of culture the morphological characteristics of SSCs colonies and immunocytochemical staining were evaluated. RESULTS: The number and size of colonies in treatment groups were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than corresponding values in controls. The presence of PGP 9.5 and c-kit antigens was confirmed in immunocytochemical evaluation. In immunocytochemical evaluation, the proportion of c-kit and PGP9.5 positive cells were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in control and treatment groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of PGP9.5 and c-kit antigens was confirmed in goat SSCs. Moreover, culture medium supplementation with growth factors could effectively retain the undifferentiation status of SSCs, reflected as a higher population of PGP9.5 positive cells, after short term culture.","['Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, P O Box: 19615-1177, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IKZF1 play multiple important roles on regulators of lymphocyte differentiation and hematological tumor suppressor. Our genome-wide association (GWA) studies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) independently identified genetic variants in IKZF1 associated with SLE, which are supported by other studies. Previous studies found that lower expression of IKZF1 may play critical roles in activating some signal pathways involved in SLE, such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)4 and interferon pathways. In addition, IKZF1 has been implicated in roles involved in some hematologic traits or abnormalities, such as erythrocyte measures, myelofibrosis, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which may be common clinical manifestations or co-occurrence hematological diseases of patients with SLE. All these findings suggest that IKZF1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SLE. In this article, we discuss the existing understanding of the role of IKZF1 on the physiological and pathological functions associated with SLE, providing insights that may assist in the development of new therapeutic strategies based on IKZF1 for patients with SLE.","[""Institute of Dermatology and Department of Dermatology, First Hospital of Anhui Medical University, 81 Meishan Road, Hefei, Anhui 230032, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 11.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematologic malignancy characterized by the BCR-ABL protein. BCR-ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of CML. Imatinib mesylate, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is effective in CML, but drug resistance and relapse occur. The coiled-coil (CC) domain located in BCR(1-72) mediates BCR-ABL tetramerization, which is essential for the activation of tyrosine kinase and transformation potential of BCR-ABL. CC domain is supposed to be a therapeutic target for CML. We purified a TAT-CC protein competively binding with the endogenous CC domain to reduce BCR-ABL kinase activity. We found that TAT-CC co-located and interacted with BCR-ABL in Ba/F3-p210 and K562 cells. It induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in these cells. It increased the sensitivity of these cells to imatinib and reduced the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, CRKL and STAT5. We confirmed that TAT-CC could attenuate the oncogenicity of Ba/F3-p210 cells and diminish the volume of K562 solid tumor in mice. We conclude targeting the CC may provide a complementary therapy to inhibit BCR-ABL oncogenicity.","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 gene at exon 4, NPM1 gene at exon 12 and FLT3-ITD at exon 14 and 15 in 163 newly diagnosed AML patients were detected by PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RESULTS: (1) IDH mutations were found in 25 patients (25/163), and all were heterozygous, of which IDH1 in 7 patients (4.29%) and IDH2 in 18 (11.04%). A total of 4 types of IDH1 mutations were identified (c.395G-->A, p.R132H, n = 4; c.394C-->A, p.R132S, n = 1; c.394C-->G, p.R132G, n = 1; c.315C-->T, n = 1). The IDH1 mutation caused substitutions of residue R132 except for one (c.315C-->T). All IDH2 mutations caused changes of R140 (c.419G-->A, p.R140Q, n = 18). The incidence of IDH2 mutation was significantly higher than that of IDH1 mutation (11.0% v 4.3%, P = 0.022). Both IDH1 and IDH2 mutation were detected in one patient, while IDH1 was synonymous substitution (c.315C-->T).

IDH mutation incidence was significantly higher in normal karyotype cases than in abnormal ones (20.5% vs 5.8%, P = 0.020). Patients with IDH mutations were significantly older than wildtype patients(P < 0.001), whereas, there were no statistically significant differences in gender, peripheral blood (PB) count at diagnosis between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IDH mutation is higher in patients with de novo AMLs, of which IDH2 mutation more frequently, and the patients associated with older age, normal karyotype at diagnosis.

METHODS: The JARID1B siRNA was transfected into HL-60 cells using Lipofectamine(TM) 2000(Lipo) vector. The proliferation inhibition by siRNA targeting JARID1B was detected by MTT, cells apoptosis by flow cytometry, the mRNA expression of JARID1B by RT-PCR, the protein expression of JARID1B, Bcl-2, procaspase-9, procaspase-3, c-myc and P27 and histone methylated H3K4 by Western blot. RESULTS: siRNA targeting JARID1B upregulated histone methylated H3K4 level, inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells, and induced the cells apoptosis. After transfection of siRNA targeting JARID1B at 0, 30, 60, 120 nmmol/L for 24 hours, the apoptotic rate were (11.0 +/- 3.6)%, (35.2 +/- 5.1)%, (52.7 +/- 3.8)%, and (62.0 +/- 5.7)% respectively (F = 70.27, P < 0.01). The protein expression of P27 was upregulated, and Bcl-2, procaspase-9, procaspase-3, c-myc was down regulated. CONCLUSIONS: JARID1B siRNA upregulates histone methylated H3K4. It reduces HL-60 cells proliferation and apoptosis by up regulating the p27 expression and down regulating the Bcl-2, procaspase-9, procaspase-3, c-myc expression.

METHODS: High titer viral particles of pQCXIP-EGFP-HO-1 were prepared, and K562/A02 cells stably transfected with HO-1 gene was established. The expression of HO-1 in K562/A02 cells was detected by RT-PCR. After treated with AMN107 for 24 h, HO-1 mRNA and protein expression by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively; Cell proliferation by MTT assay; bcr-abl fusion gene by RQ-PCR, and the apoptosis and cell cycle by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Recombinant retrovirus vector was constructed successfully and K562/A02/HO-1 cells were successfully set up. The expression of HO-1 in K562/A02 cells was expressed clearly. After three groups cells treated with AMN107 for 24 h, the expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein was significantly higher in gene-transfected group than in either empty vector or no-transfected group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The cell proliferation ofs was inhibited, but the cell viability was significantly higher in gene-transfected group than in other two groups. The difference was statistically significant(P < 0.05); After treated with 10 micromol/L AMN107 for 24 h, the CT values of bcr-abl fusion gene were (18.15 +/- 0.18) in K562/A02/HO-1 group, being significantly higher than that in K562/A02/LXSN (20.32 +/- 0.20) and K562/A02 (20.51 +/- 0.21) group, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); the apoptosis rate were (17.26 +/- 0.23)%, (39.47 +/- 0.17)%, and (41.84 +/- 0.09)%, respectively in three groups, and were (3.74 +/- 0.03)%, (5.91 +/- 0.08)% in K563/A02/HO-1 untreated with drug and K562/A02 untreated with drug group. The number of G(0)/G(1) phase and S phase cells markedly decreased. The cells were arrested in G(2)/M phase. But cell cycle in gene-transfected group did not change significantly.

METHODS: 835 donor-recipient pairs of CMDP data from 2005 to 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 typing were performed using SBT, SSOP and SSP methods. The diseases involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 288), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (n = 227), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (n = 187), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 52), non-hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) (n = 25), aplastic anemia(AA) (n = 42) and thalassemia (n = 14). Of 835 donor-recipient pairs, 362 were completely matched, 159 had a mismatch for a single allele, 125 had a mismatch for a single antigen, 95 had mismatched for both single allele and single antigen, 29 were mismatched at double allele, 20 at double antigen, 45 at multiple allele and antigen. The follow-up assessment was completed before March 2011. RESULTS: HLA-matched pairs had higher overall survival (OS) than HLA-mismatched pairs (79.83% vs 73.15%), but there was no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05). HLA mismatch for a single allele plus a single antigen was a significantly risk factor for OS, disease free survival (DFS) and transplant-related mortality (TRM). The OS from high to low in different diseases were thalassemia, AA, CML, MDS, AML, NHL, and ALL. OS of HLA locus mismatch were DRB1 (94.4%), DQB1 (83.3%), B (75%), A (74.4%) and C (71.4%), respectively. OS of single allele mismatch at HLA locus from high to low were DRB1, C, A, B and DQB1.HLA-A, B, C locus mismatch were statistically significantly associated with lower OS and grade II-IV acute GVHD compared with HLA-matched pairs (P < 0.05). The donor-recipient pairs with HLA-B*15:01/B*15:05, DRB1*12:01/DRB1*12:02, C*04:01/C*03:04, DQB1*03:02/DQB1*03:03 alleles mismatch were given priority. But the donor-recipient pairs with HLA-B*39:01/B*39:05, C*15:02/C*14:02, C*08:01/C*03:04, C*07:02/C*15:02 alleles mismatch were risk factors for influence of OS and aGVHD. CONCLUSION: The high resolution typing for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 can be identified nonpermissive mismatch, which is beneficial for the selection of a suitable donor improves survival on unrelated donor HSCT.","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mononuclear cell and neutrophil isolated from whole blood of 12 healthy volunteers were used as control group while APL cells obtained from 12 newly diagnosed APL patients at First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University from March 2007 to February 2009 were used as experimental group. APL cells were treated with 1 micromol/L ATO and 1 micromol/L DNR for 24 h. PS exposure of APL cells were measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. And the related procoagulant activity was detected by the assays of coagulation time and coagulation factor formation. Lactadherin was used as a probe for PS exposure and anticoagulant on the cells of 12 APL patients. RESULTS: ATO induced a decrease of PS exposure on APL cells by flow cytometry and no staining with lactadherin was observed under confocal microscopy. However, DNR induced the significantly elevated PS exposure and staining green with a rim pattern on membrane of APL cells was obtained. Coagulation time was (180 +/- 25) s and (220 +/- 41) s before and after treatment with ATO, respectively (P < 0.05). The formation of coagulation factors decreased after treatment with ATO (P < 0.05). While coagulation time was (180 +/- 25) s and (80 +/- 20) s before and after treatment with DNR, respectively (P < 0.05). The formation of coagulation factors increased after treatment with DNR (all P < 0.05). Lactadherin inhibited the procoagulant activities of DNR-treated APL cells (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Procoagulant activity is positively correlated with the exposed PS of APL cells. ATO and DNR inhibited and enhanced procoagulant activity with decreased and increased PS exposure, respectively.","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China. shi73661@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate, major molecular response (MMR) rate, complete molecular response (CMR) rate, overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were observed and compared in both groups. RESULTS: The CCyR rate was higher in the IM + IFN group than that in the IM group at 6 months (60.6% vs 41.6%, P < 0.05), but no difference was observed later on. The MMR + CMR rate was higher in the IM + IFN group than that in the IM group at 6 months and 12 months (71.2% vs 34.8%, 77.3% vs 52.8%, respectively, P < 0.05), but no difference after that. After stratification according to Sokal risk, the CCyR rate of low- and intermediate-risk patients was higher in the IM + IFN group than that in the IM group at 6 months (77.8% vs 52.6%, 75.0% vs 46.7%, P < 0.05), but not from 12 months on; the MMR + CMR rate of low- and intermediate-risk patients was higher in the IM + IFN group than that in the IM group at 6 months and 12 months (85.2% vs 36.8%, 90.0% vs 36.7%, P < 0.05; 88.9% vs 57.9%, 90.0% vs 56.7%, P < 0.05), but not from 24 months on. There was no significant difference in high-risk patients. OS in IM and IM + IFN group at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months was 100%, 100%, 96.8% and 90.0%, and 100%, 100%, 97.9% and 93.1%, respectively. PFS in IM and IM + IFN group at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months was 97.8%, 95.5%, 91.9% and 85.5%, and 98.5%, 95.5%, 91.5% and 86.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference in OS (u = 0.427, P = 0.514) or PFS (u = 0.556, P = 0.456). The side effects in both groups included pancytopenia, edema, weight gain, ostalgia, rash and muscle spasm. In addition, patients in the IM + IFN group suffered from flu-like symptoms, impaired liver function, abnormal thyroid function and extremity sensory disturbance. It seemed that grade III or IV pancytopenia occurred more commonly in the patients in the IM + IFN group, however, there was no statistically significance. CONCLUSIONS: The response to IM + IFN is more rapid than that to IM alone, especially for the low- and intermediate-risk patients.

The treatment response, transplantation-related mortality, events associated with infusion and relapse rate were analyzed. RESULTS: Two patients with grade II, 5 patients with grade III and 12 patients with grade IV aGVHD received a total of 58 infusions of MSCs. The mean total dose of MSCs was 2.13 (range 0.60 - 7.20)x10(6) cells per kg bodyweight. Seven patients received one infusion, 2 patients received two infusions, and 10 patients received three or more infusions. Eleven patients had a complete response and 4 had a partial response and 4 had no response. No patients had side-effects during or immediately after infusions, and no MSCs related tumorigenesis was detected to date. Eleven patients survived and 8 died, 4 for aGVHD, 1 for infection and 2 for aGVHD with concomitant infection and 1 for underlying leukemia relapse. The cell viability of freshly prepared MSCs is 93% (92% - 95%) by trypan blue staining. The cell viability of programmatically frozen and thawed MSCs is 72% (70% - 74%).

METHODS: The same group patients were diagnosed for MPAL by EGIL 1998 and WHO2008 criteria, respectively. The coincidence rate of diagnosis and therapeutic response of two diagnosis standards were compared. RESULTS: A cohort of 1835 de novo acute leukemia (AL) patients admitted to our hospital from February 1996 to October 2010 were retrospectively analyzed by applying both EGIL1998 and WHO2008 classification criteria. Seventy four patients were diagnosed with MPAL according to EGIL 1998, accounting for 4.0% of all AL cases. The main subtype is M/B (54 cases, 73.0%). While 81 patients were diagnosed as MPAL, accounting for 4.4% based on WHO 2008 criteria. The most common type is also M/B (63 cases, 77.8%). Fifty nine (79.7%) cases met both criteria. In the subtypes of M/B, M/T, M/B/T and B/T, the coincidence rate is 85.2% (46/54), 56.3% (9/16), 0(0/2) and 50.0% (1/2), respectively.

RESULTS: (1) Chromosome analysis: 35 (53.0%) of 66 cases who had metaphase were abnormal, and 24 cases had no metaphase. (2) FISH analysis: among the 31 cases who had normal karyotypes and 24 who had no metaphase detected by chromosome banding technique, 7 (22.6%) and 14 (58.3%) cases were abnormal detected by FISH, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences compared with chromosome analysis (P = 0.655).

RESULTS: ID1 gene transcript levels were detectable in BM mononuclear cells from 114 patients with AML, the median expression level of all samples was 8525 (range: 57 - 11 233 238). There was a statistically significant difference on expression level of ID1 gene among the three different cytogenetic prognosis groups, and the poor prognosis group (median: 36 840, range: 336 - 11 233 238) harbored the significantly higher level of ID1 gene than the intermediate prognosis group (Median: 6630, range: 66 - 1 840 798) (P = 0.006).

RESULTS: (1) Effects of age, body weight and BSA on imatinib plasma trough levels were not to be clinically significant. (2) Median imatinib plasma trough levels was 1271 (109-4329). Imatinib plasma trough level was related to dose of imatinib administration.

METHODS: Eighty CML patients in chronic phase receiving imatinib were enrolled in this study, including 56 males and 24 females with a median age of 39.5 (6 - 76) years. Imatinib was administered at a median dose of 400 (200 - 800) mg/d orally per day with a median course of 24 (3 - 90) months. The intracellular imatinib concentrations in bone marrow cells of 28 patients were simultaneously determined. Real-time quantitative PCR with a taqman probe was used to assess hOCT1 and ABCB1 mRNA expression on bone marrow cells of 36 patients. Imatinib trough concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a detectability of 2 - 10 000 microg/L. Serum alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was measured by immune turbidimetry on a BNProspec protein analyzer (Dade Behring, USA). All patients were divided into MMR, CCyR, PCyR or drug-resistant groups according to response. RESULTS: Plasma imatinib trough concentration of 80 patients was (1274.1 +/- 559.1) (109.0 - 3400.0) microg/L. The plasma imatinib trough concentration of 59 (73.8%) patients with a dose of 400 mg/d was (1252.0 +/- 569.5) (109 - 3400) microg/L, including 37 (62.7%) patients with concentrations of more than 1000 microg/L and 9 (15.2%) patients more than 800 microg/L. Plasma imatinib trough concentration in the MMR group \[(1531.9 +/- 634.1) microg/L\] was significant higher than in the PCyR \[(812.8 +/- 480.3) microg/L\] or drug-resistant group \[(875.2 +/- 243.1) microg/L\] (P < 0.05). Plasma imatinib trough concentration in the CCyR group \[(1288.4 +/- 498.2) microg/L\] was significant higher than in the PCyR group (P = 0.027). There was no significant difference between CCyR and MMR groups with regard to plasma imatinib trough concentration (P = 0.136). The intracellular imatinib concentration in bone marrow cells in the CCyR group \[12.6 (2.4 - 90.4) microg/L\] was significantly higher than drug-resistant \[6.6 (2.6 - 111.0) microg/L\] or PCyR \[2.7 (2.4 - 4.7) microg/L\] groups (P = 0.013). The hOCT1 mRNA expression on bone marrow cells in the CCyR group \[25.9(0.7 - 123.9) x 10(-5)\] was significantly higher than in drug-resistant \[7.8 (2.5 - 33.5) x 10(-5)\] or PCyR \[4.2 (1.4 - 11.9) x 10(-5)\] groups (P = 0.036). The ABCB1 mRNA expression on bone marrow cells in drug-resistant group \[136.7 (15.0 - 1604.9) x 10(-5)\] was significantly higher than in CCyR \[129.1 (12.9 - 783.3) x 10(-5)\] or PCyR \[34.4 (2.2 -108.2) x 10(-5)\] groups (P = 0.013). Plasma imatinib trough concentration was positively correlated with AGP (r = 0.446, P = 0.000) or dose (r = 0.346, P = 0.002). There were no significant correlations between plasma imatinib trough concentration and height, weight or body surface area (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences among different courses with regard to plasma imatinib trough concentration (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Clinical responses in CML patients were correlated with plasma and intracellular imatinib trough concentrations. Imatinib concentration was regulated by AGP and the activities of hOCT1 and ABCB1.","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach required quantitation of individual heavy/light chains (for example, IgGlambda in IgGkappa MGUS patients). Of 1384 MGUS patients from Southeastern Minnesota seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1960 to 1994, baseline serum samples obtained within 30 days of diagnosis were available in 999 persons. We identified HLC-pair suppression in 27% of MGUS patient samples compared with 11% of patients with suppression of uninvolved IgG, IgA or IgM. HLC-pair suppression was a significant risk factor for progression (hazard ratio (HR), 2.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-3.7; P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, HLC-pair suppression was an independent risk factor for progression to malignancy in combination with serum M-spike size, heavy chain isotype and free light chain ratio (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.00; P=0.018). The finding that HLC-pair suppression predicts progression in MGUS and occurs several years before malignant transformation has implications for myeloma biology.","['Division of Clinical Biochemistry and Immunology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Molecular targeted therapies have not been widely used for stem cell leukemia/lymphoma (SCLL). Ponatinib (AP24534), which potently inhibits native and mutant BCR-ABL, also targets the FGFR family. Using murine BaF3 cells, stably transformed with six different FGFR1 fusion genes, as well as human KG1 cells expressing activated chimeric FGFR1 and five newly established murine SCLL cell lines, we show that ponatinib (<50 nM) can effectively inhibit phosphoactivation of the fusion kinases and their downstream effectors, such as PLCgamma, Stat5 and Src. Ponatinib also significantly extended survival of mice transplanted with different SCLL cell lines. Ponatinib administered at 30 mg/kg daily also significantly delayed, or even prevented, tumorigenesis of KG1 cells in xenotransplanted mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ponatinib specifically inhibits cell growth and clonogenicity of normal human CD34+ progenitor cells transformed by chimeric FGFR1 fusion kinases. Overall, our data provide convincing evidence to suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR1 fusion kinases with ponatinib is likely to be beneficial for patients with SCLL and perhaps for other human disorders associated with dysregulated FGFR1 activity.","['Georgia Health Sciences University, Cancer Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA076167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA076167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS391602'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Canonical Wnt signaling is critical for the regulation of bone formation, however, recent evidence suggests that the non-canonical Wnt agonist Wnt5a stimulates human osteoblastogenesis through its co-receptor Ror2. The effects of MM cells on non-canonical Wnt signaling and the effect of the activation of this pathway on MM-induced osteoblast exhaustion are not known and were investigated in this study. We found that the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow hMSCs toward osteoprogenitor cells (PreOB) significantly increased Ror2 expression, and that MM cells inhibit Ror2 expression by PreOB in co-culture by inhibiting the non-canonical Wnt5a signaling. The activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway in hMSCs by means of Wnt5a treatment and the overexpression of Wnt5 or Ror2 by lentiviral vectors increased the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and blunted the inhibitory effect of MM in co-culture. Consistently, Wnt5a inhibition by specific small interfering RNA reduced the hMSC expression of osteogenic markers. Our findings demonstrate that the Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of MM-induced bone disease and that the activation of the non-canonical Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway in hMSCs increases osteogenic differentiation and may counterbalance the inhibitory effect of MM cells.","['Hematology and BMT Center, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 7.,"Vision is the most important sense for humans and it is irreversibly impaired by axonal damage of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the optic nerve due to the lack of axonal regeneration. The failure of regeneration is partially attributable to factors located in the inhibitory environment of the forming glial scar and myelin as well as an insufficient intrinsic ability for axonal regrowth. Moreover, RGCs undergo apoptotic cell death after optic nerve injury, eliminating any chance for regeneration. In this review, we discuss the different aspects that cause regenerative failure in the optic nerve. Moreover, we describe discoveries of the last two decades demonstrating that under certain circumstances mature RGCs can be transformed into an active regenerative state allowing these neurons to survive axotomy and to regenerate axons in the injured optic nerve. In this context we focus on the role of the cytokines ciliary neutrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), their receptors and the downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to overcome inhibitory signaling induced by molecules associated with optic nerve myelin and the glial scar as well as the regenerative outcome after combinatorial treatments. These findings are encouraging and may open the possibility that clinically meaningful regeneration may become achievable one day in the future.","['Department of Neurology, Experimental Neurology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Merowingerplatz 1a, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany. dietmar.fischer@uni-duesseldorf.de']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The venom was separated into nine fractions using size-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-100 sf. The effect of V. lebetina venom gel filtration fractions on the viability of studied cancer cells was different: high molecular mass fractions were the most effective on PC-3 cells. The viability of LNCaP cells was inhibited most strongly by the third fraction. The first and the second fractions contain different metalloproteinases including VLAIP that also most effectively reduced the viability of PC-3 cells. VLAIP decreased PC-3 cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner but did not induce apoptosis as shown by DNA fragmentation assay. VLAIP induced changes in cell shape, rounding up and detachment. VLAIP inhibited the PC-3 cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins collagen I, fibronectin and vitronectin but not to fibrinogen. VLAIP had no significant effect on the viability of LNCaP and K-562 cells. VLAIP was also capable to inhibit ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation dose-dependently.

Epub 2012 Jul 10.,"BACKGROUND: Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) has been identified as the cause of Merkel cell carcinoma. The increased incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Merkel cell cancer cohorts and the lymphotropic properties of the virus suggest a possible viral association with lymphomagenesis. To investigate this potential role, we explored seroreactivity against MCV VP1 capsids within the Epilymph case-control study in Spain. METHODS: Serum samples from 468 incident lymphomas, categorized into up to 11 entities, and 522 controls frequency matched by age, sex, and recruitment center were tested for MCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay using Virus-Like-Particles. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the OR and 95% confidence interval (CI) associated to MCV seroprevalence. Immunosuppressed subjects were excluded. RESULTS: MCV seroprevalence was 82% in controls and 85% in lymphoma cases. Among 11 lymphoma categories, MCV seropositivity was significantly higher in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL; 96.4%; OR = 6.1, 95%CI = 1.9-19.8), as compared with controls. MCV prevalences were also higher in follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and mature T-cell lymphoma but differences did not reach statistical significance. Lower prevalences were observed for multiple myeloma and other B-cell lymphoma. Exclusion of samples collected after start of treatment did not change the results. In a subset analysis, no significant association was observed between BKV and JCV seroprevalence and DLBCL. CONCLUSION: The association observed between serologic evidence of MCV exposure and DLBCL warrants further research. IMPACT: MCV might be involved in the pathway of DLBCL and other lymphomas.","[""Unit of Infections and Cancer, Cancer Epidemiology Research Programme, Catalan Institute of Oncology, IDIBELL, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain. crobles@iconcologia.net""]",,['(c)2012 AACR'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Different methylation status of PU.1 promoter region containing 20 CpG islands in normal individuals, CML chronic phase and blast crisis patients, complete cytogenetic remission patients after imatinib treatment, and blast crisis bone marrow K562 CML cells was detected by bisulfite sequencing. Semi-quantitative PCR was used to detect the PU.1 mRNA expression in normal controls, CML chronic phase and blast crisis patients, and blast crisis bone marrow K562 CML cells. Indirect immune fluorescence and Western blot were used to analyze the exprtession of PU.1 protein in normal individuals, CML chronic phase and blast crisis patients, and blast crisis bone marrow K562 CML cells. RESULTS: Aberrant methylation in the promoter region of transcription factor PU.1 was found in both CML chronic phase and blast crisis phase bone marrow cells, as well as in CML blast K562 cells. Down-expression of PU.1 mRNA and protein levels was found in above cells. No methylation in the promoter region of PU.1 was observed in normal individuals, and the PU.1 mRNA and protein expressions were not reduced at all. Furthermore, high methylation status of bone marrow cells was even observed in the CML patients who acquired complete cytogenetic remission. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that the epigenetic modification of PU.1 in CML patients and K562 cell line might be responsible for the down-expression of PU.1. The data suggest that aberrant methylation of PU.1 plays a role in CML pathogenesis, therefore, it might serve as a useful biomarker and potential target in therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug-related toxicities and prognostic factors were explored at the same time. METHODS: From Janurary 2003 to December 2009, 112 newly diagnosed LBL patients at the Hematology Center of Beijing Children's Hospital were enrolled in this study. The patients were treated with modified BFM-90-LBL protocol. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months (1 to 90 months), the patients were evaluated on day 33 and at the end of induction therapy. The bone marrow complete remission (CR) rates were 96.4% and 100%, respectively. Meanwhile, the complete remission (CR) rates of tumor were 77.7% and 94.5%, and the partial remission (PR) rates were 22.3% and 5.5%, respectively. The overall response rate was 100%. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 89.1% and 5-year OS was 87.0%. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was 85.4% and 5-year EFS was 83.3%. Eleven cases relapsed during the treatment (4 BM relapses, 3 CNS recurrences, 3 primary site and 1 lymph node of neck and BM). Eleven patients died (3 died of infection and 8 died of progressive disease after relapse). All patients experienced grade 3-4 hematological toxicity. Univariate analysis indicated that lack of CR at the end of induction therapy, immunophenotype, bulky tumor and course of disease had prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoblastic lymphoma in childhood and adolescence is highly aggressive. BCH-LBL-2003 protocol is very effective. The treatment-associated side effects were tolerable. Patients who didn't get CR at the end of induction therapy, with T-cell immunophenotype, with bulky disease and the course of disease less than 30 days may have a poor prognosis.","[""Hematology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the absence of somatic mutations within the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain genes (IGHV), the presence of ZAP-70 and a higher ability of the BCR to translate signals within the cell have been associated with an aggressive clinical course. Indeed, the stratification of patients with B-CLL based on BCR features suggests that heterogeneity of B-CLL clinical courses may reflect BCR signaling differences that have arisen during the evolution of leukemia. Therefore, characterizing BCR signaling profiles may help to identify signaling markers useful for patient stratification, disease monitoring and therapeutic targeting in B-CLL.","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. mariateresa.scupoli@univr.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to assess the immune response and safety of the vaccines and to compare the effects of the administration of single (1 ml) and double (2 ml) doses. The animals were separated into two groups and received either single or double doses of vaccines, followed by blood collection for serologic response for 400 days. No serious adverse event was observed, with the exception of abortion in one lioness, potentially caused by the incorrect use of the feline panleukopenia virus modified live vaccine. There was no significant difference between single and double doses for all vaccines. The recombinant vaccine against feline leukemia virus did not induce any serologic response. The vaccines against rabies and feline herpesvirus induced a significant immune response in the tigers and lions. The vaccine against calicivirus did not induce a significant increase in antibody titers in either tigers or lions. The vaccine against feline panleukopenia virus induced a significant immune response in tigers but not in lions.

To understand the current situation of case series of TCM for cancer, we performed this review. We included case series of cancer patients treated with TCM therapy. Electronic searches were conducted in four main Chinese databases until February 2011. A total of 1,217 reports of case series (92,945 patients) were included. The top five types of cancer were lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, leukemia, and esophageal cancer. Leukopenia and hiccup treated by TCM were the most common adverse reactions after surgery or induced by chemo/radiotherapy. More than half of the patients were treated with TCM therapies alone. The application of herbal medicines especially formula based on syndrome differentiation was highly prevalent, and the typical administration route was oral usage. 1,182 reports were published in a structured format. The quantity of TCM case series for cancer treatment is substantial. Further studies should focus on the most common types of cancer and the most frequently applied TCM therapies. We presented a recommendation from the methodological point of view for the format of reporting.","['Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China.']",,,['R24 AT001293/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both high-throughput chemical screening and facile detection of blood-cell-related phenotypes are feasible in embryonic/larval zebrafish. Two recent studies utilizing phenotypic chemical screens in zebrafish have identified several compounds that promote hematopoietic stem cell formation and reverse the hematopoietic phenotypes of a leukemia oncogene, respectively. These studies illustrate efficient drug discovery processes in zebrafish and reveal novel biological roles of prostaglandin E2 in hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells. Furthermore, the compounds discovered in zebrafish screens have become promising therapeutic candidates against leukemia and included in a clinical trial for enhancing hematopoietic stem cells during hematopoietic cell transplantation.","['Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.']",,,"['K01 AG031300/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, new therapeutic targets are required to treat patients not responding to available treatments. Ion channels play major roles in health and disease, including cancer. Actually, several ion channels have been suggested as potential tumor markers and therapeutic targets for different types of malignancies. One of most studied ion channels in cancer is the voltage-gated potassium channel Eag1 (ether a go-go 1), which has a high potential to be used as a cancer biomarker. Eag1 is expressed in most human tumors, in contrast to its restricted distribution in healthy tissues. Several findings suggest Eag1 as a potential early marker for cervical, colon, and breast cancer. In addition, because Eag1 amplification/expression is associated with poor survival in leukemia, colon and ovarian cancer patients, it has also been proposed as a prognosis marker. Moreover, inhibition of either expression or activity of Eag1 leads to reduced proliferation of cancer cells, making Eag1 a potential anticancer target. Using Eag1 in cancer detection programs could help to reduce mortality from this disease.","['Department of Pharmacology, Centro de Investigacion y Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Avenida Instituto Politecnico Nacional 2508, Mexico City 07360, Mexico. jarodrigu@cinvestav.mx']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cervical cancer', '*colon cancer', '*estrogens', '*ether a-go-go', '*human papilloma virus', '*leukemia', '*potassium channels', '*prognostic markers', '*tumor markers']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Participants were 76 Italian mothers (mean age = 37.30 years; SD = 6.07) of children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic (n = 69) or myeloid (n = 7) leukemia. Mothers had 12.05 years of education (SD = 3.87), and their incomes were average (52.1%), high (26%) and low (21.9%) for Italian norms, never in poverty. The pediatric patients with leukemia were equally distributed by gender with their mean age of 7.10 years (SD = 4.18). Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured by a 17-item checklist. Scales assessing anxiety, depression, physical (Brief Symptom Inventory 18) and cognitive functioning (Problem Scale), and life evaluation were also used. There were five assessment points: 1 week (T1), 1 month (T2), 6 months (T3), 12 months (T4) and 24 months post-diagnosis (T5). RESULTS: The main results indicated moderate presence of clinical PTSS (>/=9 symptoms: 24% at T2, 18% at T3, 16% at T4 and 19% at T5) that remained stable across time points, whereas Brief Symptom Inventory 18 Global score decreased and life evaluation improved. A series of hierarchical regression models identified cognitive functioning early after the diagnosis as the best predictive factor of PTSS across time points. CONCLUSION: Specific psychological interventions could be devised for mothers at risk for short and long-term PTSS just after the diagnosis.","['Haematology-Oncology Division, Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Padova, Italy. marta.tremolada@unipd.it']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) as a central functional component of a RUNX1 corepressor complex containing Sin3a and HDAC1 in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. PRMT6 is recruited by RUNX1 and mediates asymmetric histone H3 arginine-2 dimethylation (H3R2me2a) at megakaryocytic genes in progenitor cells. H3R2me2a keeps RUNX1 target genes in an intermediate state with concomitant H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 but not H3K4me3. Upon megakaryocytic differentiation PRMT6 binding is lost, the H3R2me2a mark decreases and a coactivator complex containing WDR5/MLL and p300/pCAF is recruited.

Secretory IgA antibodies in colostrum represent the first line of defence against harmful substances, but their potential spectra of reactivity with autoantigens remains unclear. Here, we characterised the repertoire of natural sectretory IgA autoantibodies in colostrum of healthy mothers. METHODS: The human colostrum samples from 39 healthy mothers were analyzed for autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence, dot blots, immunoblots and ELISA. RESULTS: We found that there is high diversity in reactivities of colostral IgA antibodies to autoantigens among individual samples. Using tissue sections and biochips commonly used for autoimmunity testing, we found that most samples reacted with monkey ovary (79.3%), monkey pancreatic tissue (78.6%), human HEp-2 cells (69%) and monkey adrenal gland (69.0%), fewer samples reacted with monkey liver tissue (47.2%), rat stomach (42.9%), monkey testicular tissue (41.4%), monkey salivary gland (39.3%), rat kidney (32.1%) and monkey cerebellar tissue (17.9%). At the protein level, we detected reactivity of IgA with 21 out of 25 (auto) antigens. The majority of the samples reacted with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, E3 ubiquitin ligase, cytosolic liver antigen, promyelocytic leukemia protein and nuclear pore glycoprotein-210. Using ELISA, we found reactivity of colostral IgA antibodies against examined extractable nuclear antigens, double stranded DNA, phospholipids and neutrophil cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: The broad spectrum of polyreactive natural autoantibodies present in human colostrum may contribute to proper development of mucosal immune system of the breastfed infant.","['Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 142 20, Prague 4-Krc, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A limited number of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) in combination with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and corticosteroids are facing a variety of biologics that are increasingly being used. Because of the high costs of biologics as well as the necessity for subcutaneous or intravenous administration, there is currently a growing interest in new and potent oral compounds such as the small molecules. Inflammatory pathways and mechanisms in signal transduction have been characterized in detail. Instead of neutralizing the action of a proinflammatory cytokine by antagonizing its biologic effect by an antibody, these small molecules interfere with the intracellular pathways of the inflammatory cascade. Intracellular kinases are among these enzymes which are crucially involved in intracellular signal transduction. Kinase inhibitors have been successfully used within the last few years in the treatment of various hematological malignancies, such as imatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. More recently, the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib has been evaluated as a potential new treatment option in RA and is awaiting approval. While an overview about JAK inhibition will be given elsewhere, other inhibitors such as spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor are currently in preclinical and clinical development.","['Med.

Because little research has been focused on refractory/relapsed (R/R) cases, we conducted a retrospective analysis for R/R ML-DS. Among ML-DS patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 in Japan, 26 relapsed (25 in the BM and 1 in the skin), and 3 refractory patients were enrolled. The male/female ratio was 18/11. The median age at initial diagnosis of ML-DS was 2 years, and the median time to relapse was 8.6 months. Each patient initially had been treated with ML-DS-specific protocols. Thirteen of the 26 patients achieved complete remission with various kinds of reinduction chemotherapies; 2 of 8 survived without further recurrence after receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 4 of 5 maintained complete remissions with chemotherapy alone. Treatment failures mostly were associated with disease progression rather than treatment-related toxicities. The 3-year OS rate was 25.9% +/- 8.5%. A longer duration from initial diagnosis to relapse was a significant favorable prognostic factor (P < .0001). We conclude that clinical outcome for patients with R/R ML-DS generally are unfavorable, even in those receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Novel methods to identify poor prognostic factors for ML-DS are necessary.","['Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan. ttaga@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived K562 and SVT-35 cells were treated with recombinant soluble TRAIL (rsTRAIL) alone or combined with HU for a time course, and the cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-4-sulfophenyl-2H-tetraz olium-phenazine methosulphate assay. Western blot was performed to analyze the activation of apoptosis-related protein kinases and the expression of apoptosis inhibitor molecules. RESULTS: The survival rates of SVT-35 and K562 cells treated with 1 mug/ml rsTRAIL for 24 hours were 32% and 93%, respectively. HU significantly increased the sensitivity of K562 cells to rsTRAIL cytotoxicity. Combination of rsTRAIL and HU resulted in the phosphorylation of rat sarcoma (RAS), mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and in the significant reduction of apoptosis-inhibited molecule Fas associated death domain protein-like interleukin-1 beta-convening enzyme inhibitory protein and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 in K562 cells. CONCLUSIONS: HU enhanced K562 cell sensitivity to rsTRAIL is mediated by Ras-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Expression of antiapoptotic proteins cellular Fas associated death domain protein-like interleukin-1 beta-convening enzyme inhibitory protein and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 is also down-regulated during this process.

Epub 2012 Jul 7.,"XIAP, the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, is the best example of an endogenous cellular suppressor of apoptosis. XIAP is effective because it directly limits the activity of several critical death-inducing caspases, notably caspase-3, -7 and -9, either by direct enzyme inhibition or through ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, XIAP acts simultaneously at several nodes in the apoptotic cascade, blocking both the intrinsic and extrinsic death pathways, and thereby preventing feed-forward amplification loops that would otherwise lead to cell death. XIAP over-expression, or increased activity, is associated with cancer progression, resistance to therapy and poor prognosis. Targeting XIAP gene expression by antisense oligonucleotides, or other approaches, demonstrates anti-cancer effects with XIAP down-regulation. These early preclinical studies led to the development of a clinical candidate mixed-backbone antisense oligonucleotide, AEG35156, against XIAP for the treatment of cancer. Published clinical results for the first-in-class and first-in-human trials of AEG35156 are summarized herein, including single agent and combination chemotherapy phase-I or -II trials for solid tumors, lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. These trials demonstrate the safety of AEG35156, as well as some initial promising signs of anti-cancer activity.","[""Apoptosis Research Centre, CHEO RI2, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, 401 Smyth Rd., Ottawa, ON, Canada K1H 8L1. eric@arc.cheo.ca""]",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Analysis of the immunophenotypes of 48 common ALL cases showed that the immunophenotypic patterns were highly heterogeneous, with the leukemic cell population differing from case to case.

It was revealed that both ConA and ConBr were markedly cytotoxic to cells using MTT and NAC assays. The IC(50) values were approximately 3 and 20 mug/mL for ConA and ConBr, respectively, for both MOLT-4 and HL-60 cells. However, in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, the lectins were not cytotoxic, even when tested at concentrations as high as 200 mug/ml. Using comet assay, the lectins produced a rate of DNA damage exceeding 80% in MOLT-4 and HL-60 cells. Fluorescence analysis revealed the morphology characteristic of apoptosis, with low concentrations of apoptotic bodies and fragmented DNA (5 mug/ml). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 cell cycle that is characteristic of DNA fragmentation, and a decrease in membrane integrity at high concentrations. Lastly, we evaluated the alterations in mitochondrial potential that reduced after treatment with lectins. Our results indicate that ConA and ConBr inhibited cell proliferation selectively in tumor cells and that apoptosis was the main death mechanism. Therefore, lectins can be considered a class of molecules with a high antitumor activity potential.","['Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2012 Jul 6.,"TRIB2 is a potent oncogene, elevated in a subset of human acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) with a mixed myeloid/lymphoid phenotype and NOTCH1 mutations. Although rare in AML, activating NOTCH1 mutations occur in 50% of all T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (T-ALL). TRIB2 is a NOTCH1 target gene that functions in the degradation of key proteins and modulation of MAPK signalling pathways, implicated in haematopoietic cell survival and proliferation. This study showed that TRIB2 expression level is highest in the lymphoid compartment of normal haematopoietic cells, specifically in T cells. Analysis of TRIB2 expression across 16 different subtypes of human leukaemia demonstrated that TRIB2 expression was higher in ALL phenotypes versus all other phenotypes including AML, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). A T cell profile was distinguished by high TRIB2 expression in normal and malignant haematopoiesis. High TRIB2 expression was seen in T-ALL with normal karyotype and correlated with NOTCH signalling pathways. High TRIB2 expression correlated with NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations in a paediatric T-ALL cohort, strongly linking NOTCH1 activation and high TRIB2 expression in paediatric T-ALL. The relationship between TRIB2 and T cell signalling pathways uniquely identifies leukaemia subtypes and will be useful in the advancement of our understanding of T cell and ALL biology.","['Department of Biochemsitry, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",,['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 21.,"AIMS: The 3D structures and functions of cysteine-rich receptors such as tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) are redox-modulated by dithiol-disulfide exchange. TNFR superfamily members participate in growth regulation in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and tissue stromal cells interact with leukemia cells, profoundly affecting their viability via release of redox-active components, including cysteine, thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), and Trx reductase. Trx1 was previously shown to enhance release of TNF, which acts as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor in CLL. The nature of the mechanism is not known, however. Here, we investigated whether Trx1 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a chaperone and Trx-family member, may interact with TNFRs. RESULTS: We found direct physical association between PDI and TNFR1 or TNFR2 by coclustering and affinity isolation. PDI (57 kDa) formed covalent/reduction-sensitive 69-kDa complexes with Trx1 (12 kDa) in a majority of CLL cell samples, detected at low levels only in control B-cells. Functionally, the TNF/TNFR signaling via the nuclear factor kappa B-driven autocrine loop was disrupted in a dose-dependent fashion by PDI-inhibitors bacitracin, anti-PDI, or anti-Trx1 antibodies, resulting in reduced viability. PDI was significantly overexpressed in immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) unmutated versus mutated CLL (p=0.0102), and amplified TNF release was observed in the former group. INNOVATION: This study points out a previously unrecognized physical and functional association of TNFRs with the redox-active proteins PDI and Trx1. CONCLUSION: We describe here a new level of TNF regulation, in which membrane TNFRs are redox controlled at the exofacial surface by PDI/Trx1. These findings shed new light on the observed survival benefit in CLL B-cells exerted by TNFR-superfamily ligands and point at potential therapeutic strategies.","['Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To study the in vitro anticancer activity of methanol extracts of the skin of Rhinella jimi Stevaux (Anura: Bufonidae). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The extract was obtained by cold methanol extraction for 96 h using dried skins (295 mg). The methanol skin extract was dried under reduced pressure, giving a 5.5% yield. In order to test for growth-inhibitory activity, in vitro tests were performed with the following cancer cell lines using concentrations ranging between 0.25-250 microg/mL of the extract by 48 h: K562 (leukemia), MCF-7 (breast), NCI-ADR (breast with MDR phenotype), UACC-62 (melanoma), NCI460 (lung), PCO3 (prostate), HT-29 (colon), OVCAR (ovary), and 786-0 (kidney). RESULTS: The methanol extract of R. jimi produced a growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner against the most of the assayed cell lines. In addition to the growth inhibition, the extract induced the cell death in the ovary and colon lines (EC(5)(0) 0.125 and 0.2 microg/mL, respectively), demonstrating 100% of inhibition with 2.5 microg/mL. However, prostate and leukemia cell lines demonstrated less sensitivity, with EC(5)(0) of 24 and 235 microg/mL, respectively. This is the first report about the anticancer activity by natural products from the skin of R. jimi. CONCLUSIONS: The methanol extracts of R. jimi significantly affected the growth of several cell lines, demonstrating that these compounds are a potential source of substances that could be utilized in cancer treatments.","['Universidade Federal da Paraiba - UFPB, Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: After 24 h exposure, neosergeolide strongly inhibited cancer cell proliferation (IC(5)(0) 0.1 microM), and its activity seemed to be selective to tumor cells because it had no antiproliferative effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at tested concentrations. Apoptosis was induced at submicromolar concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 microM) as evidenced by morphological changes, mitochondrial depolarization, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspases activation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Additionally, neosergeolide effects were prevented by cyclosporine A (CsA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, which reinforced the participation of intrinsic pathways in the apoptotic process induced by this natural quassinoid. Direct DNA damage was further confirmed by comet assay and cytokinesis-block micronucleus test. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The present study provided experimental evidence to support the underlying mechanism of action involved in the neosergeolide-mediated apoptosis. In addition, no antiproliferative effect or DNA damage effect of neosergeolide was evident in PBMC, highlighting its therapeutic potential.","['National Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Federal University of Ceara, CEP 60430-270, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil. nunim_br@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 9.,"The rabbit is a classical experimental animal species. A major limitation in using rabbits for biomedical research is the lack of germ-line-competent rabbit embryonic stem cells (rbESCs). We hypothesized that the use of homologous feeder cells and recombinant rabbit leukemia inhibitory factor (rbLIF) might improve the chance in deriving germ-line-competent rbES cells. In the present study, we established rabbit embryonic fibroblast (REF) feeder layers and synthesized recombinant rbLIF. We derived a total of seven putative rbESC lines, of which two lines (M5 and M23) were from culture Condition I using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as feeders supplemented with human LIF (hLIF) (MEF+hLIF). Another five lines (R4, R9, R15, R21, and R31) were derived from Condition II using REFs as feeder cells supplemented with rbLIF (REF+rbLIF). Similar derivation efficiency was observed between these two conditions (8.7% vs. 10.2%). In a separate experiment with 2x3 factorial design, we examined the effects of feeder cells (MEF vs. REF) and LIFs (mLIF, hLIF vs. rbLIF) on rbESC culture. Both Conditions I and II supported satisfactory rbESC culture, with similar or better population doubling time and colony-forming efficiency than other combinations of feeder cells with LIFs. Rabbit ESCs derived and maintained on both conditions displayed typical ESC characteristics, including ESC pluripotency marker expression (AP, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and SSEA4) and gene expression (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, c-Myc, Klf4, and Dppa5), and the capacity to differentiate into three primary germ layers in vitro. The present work is the first attempt to establish rbESC lines using homologous feeder cells and recombinant rbLIF, by which the rbESCs were derived and maintained normally. These cell lines are unique resources and may facilitate the derivation of germ-line-competent rbESCs.","['Renova Life Inc., University of Maryland, TAP program, College Park, MD 20740, USA.']",,,['5R44RR023774/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 9.,"Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as front-line therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease caused by the oncogenic kinase Bcr-Abl. Although the clinical success of IM set a new paradigm in molecular-targeted therapy, the emergence of IM resistance is a clinically significant problem. In an effort to obtain new insights into the mechanisms of adaptation and tolerance to IM, as well as the signaling pathways potentially affected by this drug, we performed a two-dimensional electrophoresis-based quantitative- and phospho-proteomic analysis in the eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We singled out proteins that were either differentially expressed or differentially phosphorylated in response to IM, using the phosphoselective dye Pro-Q((R)) Diamond, and identified 18 proteins in total. Ten were altered only at the content level (mostly decreased), while the remaining 8 possessed IM-repressed phosphorylation. These 18 proteins are mainly involved in cellular carbohydrate processes (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis), translation, protein folding, ion homeostasis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Remarkably, all 18 proteins have human functional homologs. A role for HSP70 proteins in the response to IM, as well as decreased glycolysis as a metabolic marker of IM action are suggested, consistent with findings from studies in human cell lines. The previously-proposed effect of IM as an inhibitor of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase function was supported by the identification of an underexpressed protein subunit of this complex. Taken together, these findings reinforce the role of yeast as a valuable eukaryotic model for pharmacological studies and identification of new drug targets, with potential clinical implications in drug reassignment or line extension under a personalized medicine perspective.","['Institute for Biotechnology and Bioengineering (IBB), Centre for Biological and Chemical Engineering, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Mar 22.,"OBJECTIVES: Delineation of EP4 receptor signalling properties in immature B cells. METHODS: WEHI 231 cells were used as a model of immature B lymphocytes. The effects of PGE2, EP4 receptor antagonist, EP4 receptor agonist, forskolin and adenylate cyclase inhibitor on proliferation of WEHI 231 cells were examined by MTS assay. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were examined by ELISA, whereas phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, IkappaB-alpha and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB subunit p105 were subjected to Western blot analysis. Translocation of NF-kappaB subunit p65 and EPRAP (EP4 receptor associated protein) was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Levels of early growth response factor (Egr)-1 mRNA were determined by quantitative PCR. KEY FINDINGS: We identified the EP4 receptor as the principal molecule mediating the growth-suppressive effect of prostaglandin E2 in WEHI 231 cells. EP4 receptor activation results in cAMP formation and the activation of protein kinase A, NF-kappaB1 p105 subunit stabilization and inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, followed by the accumulation of NF-kappaB p65 subunit in the cell cytoplasm, whereas the activation of PI3K is not involved in EP4 receptor signalling. Elevation of cAMP and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation are two possible mechanisms by which the EP4 receptor inhibits the proliferation of immature B lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Modulation of the EP4 receptor on immature B lymphocytes provides important insight into the observed action of PGE2 and opens new possibilities for the development of therapies for autoimmune diseases, leukaemia and lymphomas.","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",,['(c) 2012 The Authors.

However, the bioactivity of I3C on the apoptotic effects of murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells and promotion of immune responses in leukemia mice model are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of I3C on cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and immunomodulation in vivo. I3C decreased the viable WEHI-3 cells and caused morphological changes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. I3C also led to G0/G1 phase arrest, decreased the levels of cyclin A, cyclin D, and CDK2, and increased the level of p21(WAF1/CIP1). Flow cytometric analyses further proved that I3C promoted ROS and intracellular Ca(2+) production and decreased the levels of DeltaPsi(m) in WEHI-3 cells. Cells after exposure to I3C for 24 h showed DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Comet assay also indicated that I3C induced DNA damage in examined cells. I3C increased the levels of cytochrome c, FADD, GADD153, GRP78, and caspase-12 as well as induced activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9. Moreover, I3C attenuated NF-kappaB DNA binding activity in I3C-treated WEHI-3 cells as shown by EMSA and Western blotting analyses. In the in vivo study, we examined the effects of I3C on WEHI-3 leukemia mice. Results showed that I3C increased the level of T cells and decreased the level of macrophages. I3C also reduced the weights of liver and spleen, and it promoted phagocytosis by macrophages as compared to the nontreated leukemia mice group. On the basis of our results, I3C affects murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells both in vitro and in vivo.","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei 112, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although complement and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha potentially exert significant anti-tumour effects, both mediators may also promote tumour progression. It has been demonstrated that sublytic complement confers resistance on tumour cells not only against lytic complement, but also other danger molecules such as perforin. In low concentrations, TNF promotes survival of malignant cells rather than exerting cytotoxic activity. In this study, we tested if sublytic complement is able to interfere with TNF-mediated tumour cell killing. Our results demonstrate that either subcytotoxic concentrations of TNF or sublytic complement rescue prostate carcinoma cells (DU145) from TNF-alpha-mediated cell death. Upon pretreatment with low-dose TNF-alpha, but not upon pre-exposure to sublytic complement, TNF resistance was associated with the down-regulation of TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) expression. Complement-induced protection against TNF-mediated apoptosis accompanied the induction of anti-apoptotic proteins [B cell leukaemia/lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-xL] at an early stage followed by inhibition of the TNF-induced decrease in the amount of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Cell protection also accompanied the inhibition of caspase-8 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 cleavage and the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Our data extend our current view on the induction of tumour cell resistance against cytotoxic mediators supporting the role of the tumour microenvironment in mediating protection against the anti-cancer immune response.","['Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China.']",,"['(c) 2012 The Authors.

The results show that wild-type mice developed severe clinically overt polyarthritis. In contrast, LIF(-/-) mice showed a more than 50% reduction in clinical arthritis severity. Significantly lower histological scores were observed in LIF(-/-) mice compared to wild-type disease controls. LIF(-/-) mice had histopathological scores that were similar to normal healthy mice. IL-6 subfamily cytokine and receptor subunit expression remained unchanged. The expression levels for IL-6 were reduced significantly in all the diseased mice, whether wild-type or LIF(-/-) mice (P < 0.001), compared to healthy wild-type mice. We conclude that LIF contributes to the development of disease in the K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis. These results provide further evidence for the role of LIF in inflammation and cartilage bone resorption and provide impetus to test the effects of LIF blockade as a therapeutic strategy in rheumatoid arthritis.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, Australia.']",,"['(c) 2012 The Authors.

The soluble form of LR11 (sLR11) as well as the membrane-bound form plays a key role in the phenotype conversion of medial smooth muscle cells into intimal smooth muscle cells through the activation of urokinase receptor/integrin-mediated intracellular pathways. The levels of sLR11 in serum or CSF are increased in patients with atherosclerotic diseases, Alzheimer's disease or malignant diseases including acute leukemias. The recently developed ELISA system using two specific antibodies against LR11 made it possible to measure sLR11 quantitatively and stably for many samples. Thus, a novel clinical examination is expected to detect the pathological immature cells important for the pathophysiology of the above diseases. The soluble receptor-based clinical approach, together with basic studies about the structure-function relationship, may shed light on the development of novel target therapy against pathological immature cells in the science fields of so far independently categorized diseases.","['Department of Genome Research and Clinical Investigation, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba 260-8670, Japan. hbujo@faculty.chiba-u.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 20.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate levels of 37 native pathway proteins of the vitreous proteome from a subset of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients with and without subretinal fluid (SRF). METHODS: A total of 62 consecutive samples were aspirated from 12 patients with AMD, six who had SRF at baseline, and six who did not have SRF at any point during the study. Vitreous levels of the 37 native pathway proteins were analyzed in these patients using reverse phase protein microarray technology. At each visit, at which the 62 samples were taken, SRF and central retinal thickness were measured. These values were then compared to the relative intensity level of the 37 proteins screened. RESULTS: In the subset of AMD patients with SRF, the average matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), interleukin (IL)-12, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (cABL) Thr735, heme oxygenase-1, Musashi, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta Tyr751 (PDGFRbeta), IL-8, and BCL-2 associated death promoter (BAD) Ser112 levels in the vitreous were found to be significantly different with a 21%-82% increase in expression compared to those without SRF (p<0.0001). Within the SRF group, there was a positive correlation between the vitreous MMP-9 levels and the SRF level. MMP-9 levels in the vitreous proteome varied with the level of SRF but not retinal edema. Compared to patients without SRF, the patients with initial SRF had persistent or progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective case series sequentially monitoring the vitreous proteome in patients with wet AMD. The results suggest that MMP-9 is a proteomic biomarker of SRF accumulation, separate from macular edema.","['The National Retina Institute, Department of Ocular Proteomics, Towson MD 21204, USA. secker@ocularproteomics.com']",,,"['1R 43EY02182-01/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R21 EY018942-01A1/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 EY021082/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', '1R43EY021082-01/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 EY018942/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 7.,"Erythropoietin (EPO), the cytokine required for erythrocyte production, contributes to muscle progenitor cell proliferation and delay myogenic differentiation. However, the underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood. Here, we report that EPO changes the skeletal myogenic regulatory factor expression program and delays differentiation via induction of GATA-4 and the basic helix-loop-helix TAL1 and that knockdown of both factors promotes differentiation. EPO increases the Sirt1 level, a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, and also induces the NAD(+)/NADH ratio that further increases Sirt1 activity. Sirt1 knockdown reduced GATA-4 and TAL1 expression, impaired EPO effect on delayed myogenic differentiation, and the Sirt1 knockdown effect was abrogated when combined with overexpression of GATA-4 or TAL1. GATA-4 interacts with Sirt1 and targets Sirt1 to the myogenin promoter and represses myogenin expression, whereas TAL1 inhibits myogenin expression by decreasing MyoD binding to and activation of the myogenin promoter. Sirt1 was found to bind to the GATA-4 promoter to directly regulate GATA-4 expression and GATA-4 binds to the TAL1 promoter to regulate TAL1 expression positively. These data suggest that GATA-4, TAL1, and Sirt1 cross-talk each other to regulate myogenic differentiation and mediate EPO activity during myogenic differentiation with Sirt1 playing a role upstream of GATA-4 and TAL1. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role for GATA-4 and TAL1 to affect skeletal myogenic differentiation and EPO response via cross-talk with Sirt1.","['Molecular Medicine Branch, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1822, USA.']",,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 7.,"Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies are dynamic and heterogeneous nuclear protein complexes implicated in various important functions, most notably tumor suppression. PML is the structural component of PML nuclear bodies and has several nuclear splice isoforms that share a common N-terminal region but differ in their C termini. Previous studies have suggested that the coiled-coil motif within the N-terminal region is sufficient for PML nuclear body formation by mediating homo/multi-dimerization of PML molecules. However, it has not been investigated whether any of the C-terminal variants of PML may contribute to PML body assembly. Here we report that the unique C-terminal domains of PML-II and PML-V can target to PML-NBs independent of their N-terminal region. Strikingly, both domains can form nuclear bodies in the absence of endogenous PML. The C-terminal domain of PML-II interacts transiently with unknown binding sites at PML nuclear bodies, whereas the C-terminal domain of PML-V exhibits hyperstable binding to PML bodies via homo-dimerization. This strong interaction is mediated by a putative alpha-helix in the C terminus of PML-V. Moreover, nuclear bodies assembled from the C-terminal domain of PML-V also recruit additional PML body components, including Daxx and Sp100. These observations establish the C-terminal domain of PML-V as an additional important contributor to the assembly mechanism(s) of PML bodies.","['State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although beta-arrestins have more recently been implicated as scaffold proteins that interact with various mitogenic and developmental signals, the genetic role of beta-arrestins in driving oncogenesis is not known. Here we have investigated the role of beta-arrestin in hematologic malignancies and have found that although both beta-arrestin1 and -2 are expressed in the hematopoietic system, loss of beta-arrestin2 preferentially leads to a severe impairment in the establishment and propagation of the chronic and blast crisis phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). These defects are linked to a reduced frequency, as well as defective self-renewal capacity of the cancer stem-cell population, in mouse models and in human CML patient samples. At a molecular level, the loss of beta-arrestin2 leads to a significant inhibition of beta-catenin stabilization, and ectopic activation of Wnt signaling reverses the defects observed in the beta-arrestin2 mutant cells. These data cumulatively show that beta-arrestin2 is essential for CML disease propagation and indicate that beta-arrestins and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway lie in a signaling hierarchy in the context of CML cancer stem cell maintenance.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093.']",,,"['DK072234/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA059365/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK072234/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'DP10D006430/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01 HL016037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP1 CA174422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK63031/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL070631/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL70631/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL16037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI067798/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA059365/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067798/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common, dominantly inherited genetic disorder that results from mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. Affected individuals demonstrate abnormalities in neural-crest-derived tissues that include hyperpigmented skin lesions and benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. NF1 patients also have a predisposition to malignancies including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), optic glioma, glioblastoma, schwannoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In an effort to better define the molecular and cellular determinants of NF1 disease pathogenesis in vivo, we employed targeted mutagenesis strategies to generate zebrafish harboring stable germline mutations in nf1a and nf1b, orthologues of NF1. Animals homozygous for loss-of-function alleles of nf1a or nf1b alone are phenotypically normal and viable. Homozygous loss of both alleles in combination generates larval phenotypes that resemble aspects of the human disease and results in larval lethality between 7 and 10 days post fertilization. nf1-null larvae demonstrate significant central and peripheral nervous system defects. These include aberrant proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), dysmorphic myelin sheaths and hyperplasia of Schwann cells. Loss of nf1 contributes to tumorigenesis as demonstrated by an accelerated onset and increased penetrance of high-grade gliomas and MPNSTs in adult nf1a(+/-); nf1b(-/-); p53(e7/e7) animals. nf1-null larvae also demonstrate significant motor and learning defects. Importantly, we identify and quantitatively analyze a novel melanophore phenotype in nf1-null larvae, providing the first animal model of the pathognomonic pigmentation lesions of NF1. Together, these findings support a role for nf1a and nf1b as potent tumor suppressor genes that also function in the development of both central and peripheral glial cells as well as melanophores in zebrafish.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",,,"['R01 HL093766/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007843-15/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH092257/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD076585/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL062974/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007843/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG002995/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 6.,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a heterogeneous disease with multifactorial molecular pathogenesis. Various recurrent somatic mutations have been detected alone or in combination in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Recently, recurrent mutations in spliceosomal genes have been discovered. We investigated the contribution of U2AF1, SRSF2 and SF3B1 mutations in the pathogenesis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and closely related diseases. We genotyped a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, secondary acute myeloid leukemia derived from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia for somatic mutations in U2AF1, SRSF2, SF3B1 and in the other 12 most frequently affected genes in these conditions. Chromosomal abnormalities were assessed by nucleotide polymorphism array-based karyotyping. The presence of molecular lesions was correlated with clinical endpoints. Mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1 and SF3B1 were found in 32%, 13% and 6% of cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, secondary acute myeloid leukemia derived from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, respectively. Spliceosomal genes were affected in various combinations with other mutations, including TET2, ASXL1, CBL, EZH2, RAS, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, TP53, UTX and RUNX1. Worse overall survival was associated with mutations in U2AF1 (P=0.047) and DNMT3A (P=0.015). RAS mutations had an impact on overall survival in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.0456). By comparison, our screening of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia cases showed mutations in ASXL1 (4%), CBL (10%), and RAS (6%) but not in IDH1/2, TET2, EZH2, DNMT3A or the three spliceosomal genes. SRSF2 and U2AF1 along with TET2 (48%) and ASXL1 (38%) are frequently affected by somatic mutations in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, quite distinctly from the profile seen in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Our data also suggest that spliceosomal mutations are of ancestral origin.","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",,,"['K24 HL077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082983/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000439/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 HL-077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL-082983/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 6.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia is the second most common leukemia among United States adults with a median age of 69 years. We investigated recent clinical practices related to treatments and disease outcomes in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia in the United States. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data from 2000 through 2007 linked to Medicare enrollment and utilization data in the United States. RESULTS: Among 5,480 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (median age 78 years, range 65-93), 38.6% received leukemia therapy within three months of diagnosis (treated group). Practice changed with 16.3% of treated patients receiving hypomethylating agents after 2004 when those agents became available. Median survival was two months in the untreated group versus six months in the treated group (P<0.01) with the biggest improvements seen in those aged 65-69 years (10 months vs. 4 months; P<0.01) and 70-74 years (8 months vs. 3 months; P<0.01). In 46 patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (0.8%), the median survival from diagnosis was 22 months. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy for leukemia improves overall survival in older acute myeloid leukemia patients. Based on their comorbidities, most patients up to 80 years of age should be considered for treatment. New therapies including hypomethylating agents and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation are promising and must be compared with other chemotherapy regimens.","['University of Minnesota Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. boran@mdanderson.org']",['Haematologica. 2012 Dec;97(12):1781-2.

However, there is no available evidence regarding the antileukemia responses to chrysin in a mouse model. We hypothesized that chrysin affects murine WEHI-3 leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. The present study showed that chrysin at concentrations of 5-50 muM reduced the cell viability in concentration- and time-dependent manners. In an in vivo study, WEHI-3 leukemic BALB/c mice were established in order to determine antileukemia activity of chrysin. Our results revealed that chrysin increased the percentage of CD3 (T-cell maker), CD19 (B-cell maker) and Mac-3 (macrophages) cell surface markers in treated mice as compared with the untreated leukemia group. However, chrysin did not significantly influence the level of CD11b (a monocyte maker) in treated mice. Moreover, there was a significant increase in phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but no effect in those from the peritoneal cavity in leukemic mice after chrysin treatment. Isolated splenocytes from chrysin-treated leukemic mice demonstrated an increase of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Based on these observations, chrysin might exhibit antileukemia effects on a murine WEHI-3 cell line-induced leukemia in vivo.","['Department of Chinese Medicine, Fong-Yuan Hospital, Department of Health, Executive Yuan, and School of Medicine and Nursing, Hunkuang University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically ATLL is sub-classified into four groups: acute, lymphomatous, chronic and smoldering. ATLL is etiologically linked to the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). The diagnosis of ATLL is based upon a combination of characteristic clinical manifestations, morphological and immunophenotypic changes of the malignant cells, in addition to the confirmation of HTLV-I infection. ATLL is an aggressive malignancy with a median survival of less than 12 months and no successful treatment yet available. Patients are either refractory or only transiently respond to chemotherapy or purine analogues. Smoldering and chronic ATLL pursue an indolent course and survival for years until the disease progresses and becomes refractory to therapy. The major causes of death in ATLL are opportunistic pulmonary infections and progressive disease, often in association with hypercalcemia.","['Al-Amal Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. kakil954@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of 1413 transplantations from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors for adult patients with AML in first CR were analyzed according to the level of center activity. Transplants were performed in 203 European centers between 2001 and 2007. The 2-year probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) after RIC-HSCT performed in centers with the lowest activity (< or =15 procedures/7 years) was 43+/-3% compared with 55+/-2% in the remainder (P<0.001).

Few retrospective studies, without EBV load monitoring postulated that umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) might be associated with high incidence of EBV events. We retrospectively studied 175 UCBT recipients for whom RQ-PCR was used to monitor EBV blood load at least once a week during the first 3 months after UCBT. Median age was 23 years, 74% had leukemia. Conditioning was myeloablative in 54% and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was used in 46%. A total of 24 patients presented an EBV reactivation. For 15 patients, the reactivation occurred during the first 100 days (cumulative incidence: 8%) and included 4 EBV-PTLD. Rituximab as preemptive treatment was used in 12 of these 15 patients. In univariate analysis, the increased risk of early EBV reactivation was associated with RIC in combination with antithymocyte globulin (P=0.03) and previous history of auto-HSCT (P=0.01). Multivariate analysis did not find any independent risk factor. EBV reactivation as time-dependent covariate was not statistically associated with survival. Therefore, EBV events were not major complications after UCBT when EBV load is weekly monitored and preemptive treatment started.","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital and University Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"Recent genome-wide mapping of the mammalian replication origins has suggested the role of transcriptional regulatory elements in origin activation. However, the nature of chromatin modifications associated with such trans-factors or epigenetic marks imprinted on cis-elements during the spatio-temporal regulation of replication initiation remains enigmatic. To unveil the molecular underpinnings, we studied the human lamin B2 origin that spatially overlaps with TIMM 13 promoter. We observed an early G(1)-specific occupancy of c-Myc that facilitated the loading of mini chromosome maintenance protein (MCM) complex during subsequent mid-G(1) phase rather stimulating TIMM 13 gene expression. Investigations on the Myc-induced downstream events suggested a direct interaction between c-Myc and histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 that imparted histone H3K4me3 mark essential for both recruitment of acetylase complex HBO1 and hyperacetylation of histone H4. Contemporaneously, the nucleosome remodeling promoted the loading of MCM proteins at the origin. These chromatin modifications were under the tight control of active demethylation of E-box as evident from methylation profiling. The active demethylation was mediated by the Ten-eleven translocation (TET)-thymine DNA glycosylase-base excision repair (BER) pathway, which facilitated spatio-temporal occupancy of Myc. Intriguingly, the genome-wide 43% occurrence of E-box among the human origins could support our hypothesis that epigenetic control of E-box could be a molecular switch for the licensing of early replicating origins.","['Virology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of aberrant hypermethylation of p15 gene (71 %) was higher comparing to MGMT gene (33 %), whereas concomitant methylation of both genes had 24 % of the patients. Although the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities between the groups with a different methylation status of p15 and/or MGMT genes was not significantly different, we observed general trend of clustering of abnormalities with adverse prognosis into groups with concomitant hypermethylation of both genes and only p15 gene. Also, we showed that AML patients with concomitant methylation of p15/MGMT genes had a higher proportion of leukemic blast cells characterized with specific expression of individual leukocyte surface antigens (CD117(+)/CD7(+)/CD34(+)/CD15(-)), indicating leukemic cells as early myeloid progenitors. Although we could not prove that hypermethylation of p15 and/or MGMT genes is predictive parameter for response to therapy and overall survival, we noticed that AML patients with comethylated p15/MGMT genes or methylated p15 gene exhibited a higher frequency of early death, lower frequency of complete remissions as well as a trend for shorter overall survival. Assessing of the methylation status of p15 and MGMT genes may allow stratification of patients with AML into distinct groups with potentially different prognosis.","['Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their wide-spread use, there is little literature available describing the typical levels of histone acetylation in untreated peripheral blood, the treatment and storage of samples to retain optimal measurement of histone acetylation nor methods by which histone acetylation analysis may be monitored and measured during the course of a patient's treatment. In this study, we have used cord or peripheral blood as a source of human leukocytes, performed a comparative analysis of sample processing methods and developed a flow cytometric method suitable for monitoring histone acetylation in isolated lymphocytes and liquid tumors. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry techniques have also been addressed. We have tested these methods on blood samples collected from four patients treated with LBH589 as part of an Australian Children's Cancer Clinical Trial (CLBH589AAU03T) and show comparable results when comparing in vitro and in vivo data. This paper does not seek to correlate histone acetylation levels in peripheral blood with clinical outcome but describes methods of analysis that will be of interest to clinicians and scientists monitoring the effects of HDACi on histone acetylation in blood samples in clinical trials or in related research studies.","[""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 9.,"Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) functions as a translational regulator and has been suggested to elevate MYC mRNA translation via an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) point mutation in multiple myeloma (MM). We show that YB-1-mediated translation of MYC mRNA occurs independently of the reported IRES mutation, as 87 MM patients (n=88) and all tested human MM cell lines (HMCLs) were negative for the mutation. We show for the first time that positive MYC staining predicts YB-1 co-expression in malignant plasma cells and YB-1/MYC co-expression increases from 30% in medullary to 70% in extramedullary MM. YB-1 knockdown in HMCLs reduced both MYC protein levels and MYC mRNA in the polysomal fraction, providing a mechanism by which YB-1 controls MYC translation. MYC transcription of YB-1 is demonstrated in HMCLs as MYC knockdown resulted in reduced YB-1 protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, MYC activation in non-malignant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) increased YB-1 mRNA, clearly indicating that MYC drives YB-1 transcription. Importantly, perturbation of the MYC/YB-1 oncogenic circuit leads to apoptosis in HMCLs. Here, we demonstrate that these two proteins co-regulate each other via combined transcriptional/translational activity establishing their pivotal role in MM cell survival. We therefore suggest that targeting the YB-1/mRNA interaction provides a new strategy for MM drug development.","['Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine II, Comprehensive Cancer Centre Mainfranken, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany. kurt.bommert@uni-wuerzburg.de']",,,['R01 CA151354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS583548'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the frequency and level of Ig gamma heavy chain (IgG) expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and found that IgG was expressed at a high frequency and level in AML cell lines and primary myeloblasts, but not in monocytes or neutrophils from patients with non-hematopoietic neoplasms or healthy controls. AML-derived IgG had the same molecular weight as B cell-derived IgG and was secreted. We further detected IgG V(H)DJ(H) transcripts in AML cell lines and sorted primary myeloblasts, confirming that IgG expression was indeed produced by AML cells. AML-derived IgG gene rearrangements showed evidence of somatic hypermutation of the variable (V) gene segments, and restricted (AML cell lines) or biased (primary myeloblasts) V usage. Anti-human IgG reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in AML cell lines. Although the function of the AML-derived IgG is unclear, our findings suggest that AML-derived IgG may be a novel AML-related gene that contributes to leukemogenesis and AML progression. AML-derived IgG may serve as a useful molecular marker for monitoring minimal residual disease or designing target therapy.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. qiuxy@bjmu.edu.cn']",['Leukemia. 2013 Jan;27(1):1-2.

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"During treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) fracture incidence is increased. Studies using DXA, which measures a composite of both trabecular and cortical BMD, have shown reduced BMD during treatment. We investigated changes in compartmental (cortical and trabecular) volumetric BMD (vBMD) and bone geometry using peripheral quantitative computed tomography. These outcomes were also analysed in relation to adiposity and treatment factors. Thirty nine patients with ALL (64% male, median age 7.2 years (4.1-16.9)) were compared to 34 healthy controls (50% male, median age 9.1 years (4.4-18.7)). DXA-derived age-specific standard deviation scores (SDS) of the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were reduced in subjects with ALL compared to controls (p </= 0.01). This persisted following adjustment for body size using height-specific SDS (LS -0.72 +/- 1.02 vs -0.18 +/- 0.72, p=0.01; FN -1.53 +/- 0.96 vs -0.74 +/- 0.74, p=0.001) and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) SDS (LS -0.76 +/- 1.14 vs 0.04 +/- 1.08, p=0.01; FN -1.63 +/- 1.38 vs -0.16 +/- 1.20, p<0.001). Radial and tibial trabecular vBMD was also reduced (196.5 +/- 54.9 mg/cm(3) vs 215.2 +/- 39.9 mg/cm(3), p=0.03 and 232.8 +/- 60.3mg/cm(3) vs 267.5 +/- 60.2mg/cm(3), p=0.002, respectively), but cortical vBMD at the radius and tibia was similar in patients and controls. A lowered tibial bone strength index (BSI) was identified in patients with ALL (53.9 +/- 23.1mg/mm(4) vs 82.5 +/- 27.8 mg/mm(4), p<0.001) suggesting lower fracture threshold from compressive forces. No relationships with measures of adiposity, duration of treatment or cumulative corticosteroid dose were identified. Our findings therefore suggest that reduction in trabecular vBMD during childhood ALL treatment may contribute to the observed increased fracture incidence and bony morbidity in this group.","['Paediatric Oncology, University Hospital Southampton, Tremona Road, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK. janice.kohler@uhs.nhs.uk']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jul 4.,"It has recently been reported that the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) derives from a laboratory recombinant. However, sequences with characteristics of the 5' half of XMRV (termed PreXMRV-2) have been identified in several laboratory mouse genomes and cell lines suggesting parts of the XMRV genome exist as naturally occurring retroviruses in mice. We compare here PreXMRV-2 gag sequence diversity in mice to that of reported XMRV-like sequences by testing a panel of wild mouse and common inbred laboratory mouse strain genomic DNAs and by using high throughput amplicon sequencing. Sequences with features typical of previously reported PreXMRV-2 sequences, among them a 24 nt deletion, were repeatedly identified in different wild mice and inbred mouse strains within a high background of non-XMRV-like sequences. However, Sanger sequencing of clones from amplicons failed to retrieve such sequences effectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that PreXMRV-2 gag sequences from mice, cell lines and patient samples belong to the same evolutionarily young clade and that such sequences are diverse and widespread within Mus musculus domesticus and laboratory mice derived from this species. No evidence of PreXMRV-2 like gag sequences could be obtained outside of the M. musculus lineage. The results suggest that accurate determination of presence, absence and relationships of specific murine retroviral strains benefit greatly from deep sequencing analysis.","['Department of Human Genetics, Center of Human and Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty, University of Saarland, 66421 Homburg, Germany.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was opened in 1999 and closed to the enrollment in 2008. The program consisted of intensive five-drug combination chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy as local treatment, and consolidation treatment with high-dose busulfan/melphalan plus autologous stem cell rescue and total-lung irradiation. RESULTS: During the study period, 102 consecutive patients were enrolled. The median follow-up was 62 months (range 24-124). The 5-year event-free survival probability was 0.43 [standard deviation (SD) = 0.05] and the 5-year overall survival probability was 0.52 (SD = 0.052). Unfavorable prognostic factors emerging on multivariate analysis were a poor histological/radiological response at the site of the primary tumor [relative risk (RR) = 3.4], and incomplete radiological remission of lung metastases after primary chemotherapy (RR = 2.6). One toxic death and one secondary leukemia were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: This intensive approach is feasible and long-term survival is achievable in approximately 50% of patients. New treatment approaches are warranted for patients responding poorly to primary chemotherapy.","['Department of Pediatrics, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan.

In the present study, we examined the effects of T. sinensis leaf extracts (TS extracts) on tumor regression using in vitro cell culture and an in vivo athymic nude mice model. We found that TS extracts (10-75 mug/mL) arrested HL-60 cells at the G1-S transition phase through the reductions of Cyclin D1, CDK4, Cyclin E, CDK2, and Cyclin A, and induction of CDK inhibitor p27KIP levels. Furthermore, VEGF expression and release was significantly inhibited by TS extracts. Notably, TS extracts treatment was effective in terms of delaying tumor incidence in the nude mice inoculated with HL-60 cells as well as reducing the tumor burden. Histological analysis confirmed that TS extracts significantly modulated tumor progression in xenograft tumor. Furthermore, a similar pattern of results were observed from gallic acid (5 and 10 mug/mL), a major compound in TS, caused G1 arrest through regulations of cell-cycle regulatory proteins.

Herein PGG significantly decreased the viability of CML cell lines such as K562 and KBM-5 without hurting normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). PGG increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the sub-G1 cell population as well as activated caspase cascades including caspase-8, -9 and -3 in K562 cells. Interestingly, a significant activation of JNK by PGG was observed by MULTIPLEX assay and Western blotting. Conversely, JNK inhibitor D-JNKi suppressed the cleavages of caspase 3 and PARP induced by PGG in K562 cells. Also, PGG dramatically enhanced generation of ROS and reduced the expression of death-domain-associated protein (DAXX). Of note, ROS inhibitor acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) reversed JNK-dependent apoptosis and DAXX inhibition induced by PGG. Overall, these findings suggest that ROS-dependent JNK activation and DAXX downregulation are critically involved in PGG-induced apoptosis in K562 cells.","['College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Jun 16.,"The beneficial effects of Clostridium butyricum in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory disorders are well known. However, it is not fully understood how such bacteria inhibit pathogen-induced intestinal diseases. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of C. butyricum and its spent culture supernatants (SCS) on Escherichia coli (EHEC) growth and adherence to chicken embryo intestinal cells (CEICs). We also evaluated the potential of C. butyricum to inhibit EHEC-induced apoptosis in CEICs. C. butyricum and its SCS exhibited significant inhibitory activity on EHEC growth and adherence to CEICs. C. butyricum also showed a significant inhibitory effect on EHEC-induced apoptosis by modulating the expression of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), BclXL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large), FAS, Bcl2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2), BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein), P53 (Tumor protein 53) and via inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. These results together indicate that C. butyricum possesses the ability to prevent EHEC-induced intestinal disorders both directly, through inhibiting EHEC viability, and indirectly, via medicating EHEC-induced apoptosis. These observations may help explain the beneficial properties of C. butyricum. Furthermore, our data is novel in the case of poultry and the manner in which C. butyricum prevents the EHEC-induced apoptosis provides supportive information for the treatment of colibacillosis in poultry.","[""Key Laboratory for Molecular Design and Nutrition Engineering, Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Ningbo 315100, People's Republic of China.""]",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The combination of 3-HF and imatinib mesylate resulted in significant apoptotic cell death in imatinib mesylate-resistant leukemia cells. Combined treatment resulted in apparent activation of caspases and decrease of the oncoprotein phosphor-Bcr/Abl in leukemia cells.

Epub 2012 Jul 4.,"BACKGROUND: The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe (RARECARE) project aims at increasing knowledge of rare cancers in Europe. This manuscript describes the epidemiology of myeloid malignancies (MMs), taking into account the morphological characterisation of these tumours. METHODS: We used data gathered by RARECARE on cancer patients diagnosed from 1995 to 2002 and archived in 64 European population-based cancer registries, followed up to 31st December 2003 or later. RESULTS: The overall annual crude incidence of MMs was 8.6 per 100,000. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) were most common, with incidence rates of 3.7 and 3.1 per 100,000 year respectively, followed by 1.8 for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MD/MPN) and 0.1 for histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms (HDCN). The 5-year relative survival rate ranged from 18% for chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, 19% for AML, 29% for MDS and 44% for chronic myeloid leukaemia to relatively favourable rates for MPN (62%) and HDCN (83%). Total number of new cases of MMs in the EU27 is estimated at 43,000 annually, total number of prevalent cases (1st January 2008) at 189,000 cases. CONCLUSION: MMs form a large variety of rare entities with specific characteristics. Collection of detailed information (immunophenotype, genetic abnormalities, molecular data and clinical data) and an up-to-date classification system is essential for their surveillance, especially now that more and more targeted therapies are being introduced.","['Comprehensive Cancer Centre the Netherlands, P.O.

The majority of hiPSC lines maintain one transcriptionally active X (Xa) and one inactive X (Xi) chromosome from donor cells. However, at low frequency, hiPSC lines with two Xas are produced, suggesting that epigenetic alterations of the Xi occur sporadically during reprogramming. We show here that X-inactivation status in female hiPSC lines depends on derivation conditions. hiPSC lines generated by the Kyoto method (retroviral or episomal reprogramming), which uses leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-expressing SNL feeders, frequently had two Xas. Early passage Xa/Xi hiPSC lines generated on non-SNL feeders were converted into Xa/Xa hiPSC lines after several passages on SNL feeders, and supplementation with recombinant LIF caused reactivation of some of X-linked genes. Thus, feeders are a significant factor affecting X-inactivation status.

Epub 2012 Jun 29.,"Bendamustine (BDM) is an active chemotherapeutic agent approved in the U. S. for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Its chemical structure suggests it may have alkylator and anti-metabolite activities; however the precise mechanism of action is not well understood. Here we report the concentration-dependent effects of BDM on cell cycle, DNA damage, checkpoint response and cell death in HeLa cells. Low concentrations of BDM transiently arrested cells in G2, while a 4-fold higher concentration arrested cells in S phase. DNA damage at 50, but not 200 microM, was efficiently repaired after 48 h treatment, suggesting a difference in DNA repair efficiency at the two concentrations. Indeed, perturbing base-excision repair sensitized cells to lower concentrations of BDM. Timelapse studies of the checkpoint response to BDM showed that inhibiting Chk1 caused both the S- and G2-arrested cells to prematurely enter mitosis. However, whereas the cells arrested in G2 (low dose BDM) entered mitosis, segregated their chromosomes and divided normally, the S-phase arrested cells (high dose BDM) exhibited a highly aberrant mitosis, whereby EM images showed highly fragmented chromosomes. The vast majority of these cells died without ever exiting mitosis. Inhibiting the Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint accelerated the time of killing by BDM. Our studies suggest that BDM may affect different biological processes depending on drug concentration. Sensitizing cells to killing by BDM can be achieved by inhibiting base-excision repair or disrupting the DNA damage checkpoint pathway.","['Basic Science Division, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.

Epub 2012 Jun 29.,"The interaction of viral proteins with host-cellular proteins elicits the activation of cellular signal transduction pathways and possibly leads to viral pathogenesis as well as cellular biological events. Apoptotic signals induced by DNA-damage are remarkably up-regulated by Friend leukemia virus (FLV) exclusively in C3H hosts; however, the mechanisms underlying the apoptosis enhancement and host-specificity are unknown. Here, we show that C3H mouse-derived hematopoietic cells originally express higher levels of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2 protein than BALB/c- or C57BL/6-deriverd cells, and undergo more frequent apoptosis following doxorubicin-induced DNA-damage in the presence of the FLV envelope protein gp70. Dual transfection with gp70/Mcm2 reproduced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis even in BALB/c-derived 3T3 cells. Immunoprecipitation assays using various deletion mutants of MCM2 revealed that gp70 bound to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) 1 (amino acids 18-24) of MCM2, interfered with the function of NLS2 (amino acids 132-152), and suppressed the normal nuclear-import of MCM2. Cytoplasmic MCM2 reduced the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) leading to the subsequent hyperphosphorylation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Phosphorylated DNA-PK exhibited elevated kinase activity to phosphorylate P53, thereby up-regulating p53-dependent apoptosis. An apoptosis-enhancing domain was identified in the C-terminal portion (amino acids 703-904) of MCM2. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with FLV and doxorubicin extended the survival of SCID mice bearing 8047 leukemia cells expressing high levels of MCM2. Thus, depending on its subcellular localization, MCM2 plays different roles. It participates in DNA replication in the nucleus as shown previously, and enhances apoptosis in the cytoplasm.","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These aberrant properties of Lyn could partially explain leukemic cells' defective apoptosis, directly or through its substrates, for example, HS1 that has been associated to apoptosis in different cell types. To verify the hypothesis of HS1 involvement in Lyn-mediated leukemic cell survival, we investigated HS1 protein in 71 untreated B-CLL patients and 26 healthy controls. We found HS1 overexpressed in leukemic as compared to normal B lymphocytes (1.38+/-0.54 vs 0.86+/-0.29, p<0.01), and when HS1 levels were correlated to clinical parameters we found a higher expression of HS1 in poor-prognosis patients. Moreover, HS1 levels significantly decreased in ex vivo leukemic cells of patients responding to a fludarabine-containing regimen.

Epub 2012 Jun 29.,"BACKGROUND: Leukemia initiating cells (LIC) contribute to therapeutic resistance through acquisition of mutations in signaling pathways, such as NOTCH1, that promote self-renewal and survival within supportive niches. Activating mutations in NOTCH1 occur commonly in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and have been implicated in therapeutic resistance. However, the cell type and context specific consequences of NOTCH1 activation, its role in human LIC regeneration, and sensitivity to NOTCH1 inhibition in hematopoietic microenvironments had not been elucidated. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We established humanized bioluminescent T-ALL LIC mouse models transplanted with pediatric T-ALL samples that were sequenced for NOTCH1 and other common T-ALL mutations. In this study, CD34(+) cells from NOTCH1(Mutated) T-ALL samples had higher leukemic engraftment and serial transplantation capacity than NOTCH1(Wild-type) CD34(+) cells in hematopoietic niches, suggesting that self-renewing LIC were enriched within the NOTCH1(Mutated) CD34(+) fraction. Humanized NOTCH1 monoclonal antibody treatment reduced LIC survival and self-renewal in NOTCH1(Mutated) T-ALL LIC-engrafted mice and resulted in depletion of CD34(+)CD2(+)CD7(+) cells that harbor serial transplantation capacity. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal a functional hierarchy within the LIC population based on NOTCH1 activation, which renders LIC susceptible to targeted NOTCH1 inhibition and highlights the utility of NOTCH1 antibody targeting as a key component of malignant stem cell eradication strategies.","['Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.']",,,"['K08 CA133103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08CA133103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms responsible for fibrosis remain only partially understood. Past studies highlighted the role of growth factors in such pathologies, and recently, the protein lysyl oxidase (LOX) has been implicated in proliferation of MKs, ploidy and deposition of fibers. LOX was initially characterized as a protein responsible for the intermolecular cross-linking of elastin and collagen, and in recent years it has been identified as regulator of various pathologies, such as cancer and inflammation. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of the contribution of MKs to the progression of myelofibrosis, highlighting the newly identified role of LOX.","['Department of Medicine, Whitaker Cardiovascular Institute, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA. kravid@bu.edu']",,,"['R01 HL080442/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL80442/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the impact of the recently established 5-group cytogenetic classification of MDS on outcome after HCT. Results were compared with the impact of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) 3 cytogenetic risk groups, and the additional effect of a monosomal karyotype was assessed. The study included data on 1007 patients, 1-75 years old (median 45 years), transplanted from related (n = 547) or unrelated (n = 460) donors. Various conditioning regimens were used, and marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood served as stem cell source. Both IPSS and 5-group cytogenetic risk classifications were significantly associated with post-HCT relapse and mortality, but the 5-group classification discriminated more clearly among the lowest- and highest-risk patients. A monosomal karyotype tended to further increase the rates of relapse and mortality, even after considering the IPSS or 5-group classifications. In addition, the pathologic disease category correlated with both relapse and mortality. Mortality was also impacted by patient age, donor type, conditioning regimen, platelet count, and etiology of MDS. Although mortality declined significantly in recent years, novel strategies are needed to overcome the barrier of high-risk cytogenetics.","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N., Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. jdeeg@fhcrc.org']",,,"['CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL095999/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 HL088021/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL062946/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL095999/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To corroborate this observation, we used the data and blood specimen from Epilymph to investigate the associations between serological indicators of HBV infection with risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and specific lymphoma entities. For 1,518 cases and 1,496 controls with sufficient amount of serum or plasma, we tested HBs-antigen, anti-HBc and anti-HBs to distinguish between current or past infection and immunity by vaccination. Statistical analysis was carried out with unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We found a positive association of a past HBV infection with multiple myeloma (MM, OR = 1.97, 95 % CL = 1.16-3.37). Non-significant associations were found between past HBV infection and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL, OR = 1.33, 95 % CL = 0.82-2.16) and T-cell NHL (OR = 1.59, 95 % CL = 0.65-3.90), as well as between current HBV infection and NHL (OR = 1.49, 95 % CL = 0.65-3.41), B-NHL (OR = 1.58, 95 % CL = 0.69-3.64) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, OR = 1.50, 95 % CL = 0.47-4.82). Subjects having self-reported HBV infection were serological positive in 75 % of cases and 80 % of controls. For vaccination, the corresponding figures were 49 and 54 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present results support previous reports of an association between a history of HBV infection with an elevated lymphoma risk and add multiple myeloma to the list of potentially virus-associated lymphoma entities.","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 581, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. n.becker@dkfz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral infections and other causes of secondary cranial nerve lesions were excluded. Symptoms completely subsided with the temporary withdrawal of ATRA and did not recur after reintroducing the drug. To date, the patient has managed to receive the treatment as per protocol. In conclusion, we report an atypical presentation of IIH that merits consideration, especially with respect to young patients with APL receiving ATRA; our most important observation is that the drug could be safely reintroduced once the symptoms had resolved.","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, Salamanca 37007, Spain. jorge_labrador@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen of 25 patients (60 %) showed an increase in LGL. All 15 of these patients also showed an increase in NK cells, and 11 showed an increase in CD8(+) T cells. High frequencies of clonal rearrangements of TCR-beta, -gamma, and -delta genes were observed in LGL (+) patients, and at lower frequencies in LGL (-) patients as well. Clinical responses were favorable for all. With respect to their newly obtained complete molecular response after dasatinib treatment, LGL (+) patients showed higher response rates than did LGL (-) patients. In contrast, pleural effusions were more commonly observed in LGL (+) patients (60 %) than in LGL (-) patients (20 %). LGL counts significantly increased at 2 h after oral intake of dasatinib in all 25 patients. This was not observed in treatment with imatinib or nilotinib. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) C7-HRP tests were negative in all patients. Serum CMV-IgM antibodies were positive in only 2 of 25 patients without symptom of infection.

Prospective data on the incidence and clinical role of infections by respiratory viruses in this population have been lacking. METHODS: In this prospective study, 191 children between 0 and 18 years of age were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction for the presence of 8 common respiratory virus types in transnasal aspirations. The study included 110 children with leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors (subgroup 1); 31 children after HSCT (subgroup 2); and 50 immunocompetent control patients. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, immunocompromised children showed a significantly higher incidence of positive virus tests (subgroup 1: 53%; subgroup 2: 81%; controls: 24%; P<0.0001), and more frequently experienced ensuing viral infections in the lower respiratory tract (subgroup 1: 74%; subgroup 2: 88%; controls: 25%; P<0.0001). Sixteen percent of these children had coinfections by 2 or more viruses and revealed more severe respiratory illness. CONCLUSIONS: The present epidemiologic study on viral upper RTI in immunocompromised children revealed a high virus-associated morbidity which was particularly prominent in HSCT recipients. In these children, detection of viral coinfections was identified as a risk factor for a severe course of lower RTI.","[""Department of Pediatrics, St Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University Vienna, Austria.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, has been found to exert anti-metabolic and anticancer activities when tested against various cultured cancer cells. Furthermore, decitabine has been found to play critical roles in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cancer cell lines; however, these roles are not well understood. In this study, we investigated decitabine for its potential anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in human leukemia cell lines U937 and HL60. Our results indicated that treatment with decitabine resulted in significantly inhibited cell growth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by the induction of apoptosis. Decitabine-induced apoptosis in U937 and HL60 cells was correlated with the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 protein levels, the cleavage of Bid proteins, the activation of caspases and the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). However, apoptosis induced by decitabine was attenuated by caspase inhibitors, indicating an important role for caspases in decitabine responses. The data further demonstrated that decitabine increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Moreover, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a widely used ROS scavenger, effectively blocked the decitabine-induced apoptotic effects via inhibition of ROS production and MMP collapse. These observations clearly indicate that decitabine-induced ROS in human leukemia cells are key mediators of MMP collapse, which leads to apoptosis induction followed by caspase activation.","['Department of Molecular Biology, Busan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases (27,447) born and diagnosed in Great Britain during 1980-2006 and matched cancer-free controls (36,793) were from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours. Radiation exposures were estimated for mother's residence at the child's birth from national databases, using the County District mean for gamma rays, and a predictive map based on domestic measurements grouped by geological boundaries for radon. There was 12% excess relative risk (ERR) (95% CI 3, 22; two-sided P=0.01) of childhood leukaemia per millisievert of cumulative red bone marrow dose from gamma radiation; the analogous association for radon was not significant, ERR 3% (95% CI -4, 11; P=0.35). Associations for other childhood cancers were not significant for either exposure. Excess risk was insensitive to adjustment for measures of socio-economic status. The statistically significant leukaemia risk reported in this reasonably powered study (power ~50%) is consistent with high-dose rate predictions. Substantial bias is unlikely, and we cannot identify mechanisms by which confounding might plausibly account for the association, which we regard as likely to be causal. The study supports the extrapolation of high-dose rate risk models to protracted exposures at natural background exposure levels.","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Both groups were comparable concerning age, WBC count at diagnosis, gender, karyotype, genotype, and number of courses of chemotherapy to reach complete remission (CR1). Median follow-up after CR1 was 37 months (range, 11-112 months) and 48 months (range, 9-83 months) in the allo and no-allo groups, respectively. In the allo versus no-allo groups, the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates were 25% +/- 8% versus 61% +/- 9%; P = .005. The 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 22% +/- 7% versus 4% +/- 4% (P = .005), 52% +/- 9% versus 44% +/- 10% (P = .75), and 53% +/- 9% versus 35% +/- 9% (P = .28), respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that CIR was reduced by allo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; P = .01). A landmark analysis performed at day 185 after CR1 confirmed a lower CIR after allo.

Several clinical and fundamental studies have also permitted a better understanding of those disorders and to propose new therapeutic strategies. Large scale genomic analyses have allowed identifying new genes involved in the pathophysiology of this diseases.

An inventory of sites, will document these aspects, to identify highly lethal forms, and thus contribute to improving the management of HM in a hospital in a developing country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study referred to descriptive over two and a half years, from review of patients' medical records allowed an exhaustive census of 58 cases of HM admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine of University Hospital Souro Sanou (UHC SS). RESULTS: The first reason for consultation were abdominal tumor syndrome (63.7%). The average age of patients was 42 +/- 19.7 years with extremes ranging from 16 to 87 years. The sex ratio was 1.42: 1. Hematological disturbances were strongly suspected anemia (89.2%), leukocytosis (64.3%) and thrombocytopenia (46.4%). The HM depending on cytology were dominated by lymphomas (48.2%) followed by chronic myeloid leukemia or 15.5%. Chemotherapy was undertaken in 63.7% of cases. Lethality was 23.1%, was significantly higher for acute leukemia 40% (p = 0.0012). HIV serology was positive in 3 patients among the 13 cases tested. CONCLUSION: This study provided a better understanding of HM epidemiology at the UHC SS in the department of internal medicine. It revealed a predominance of lymphomas with difficulties in the initiation of chemotherapy. Improving access to chemotherapy, and technical support enable a reduction in the fatality associated with HM in the department of internal medicine at UHC SS.","['Medecine interne au Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Souro Sanou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. macco72@yahoo.fr']",,,,,,,,,Place des hemopathies malignes en service de medecine interne du CHU Souro Sanou (Burkina Faso).,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the intervening period, trials in haematological malignancies have been at the forefront of cancer research, both in the proportion of patients recruited, and in the adoption of novel trial designs. In this paper, the principles propounded by Hill for reliable evaluation of new treatments are considered and placed in the context of the development and evaluation of novel treatments in the 21st century. Many of the original principles espoused are still highly relevant today, while the emerging heterogeneity of the conditions, both in aetiology and outcome provide their own newer challenges, which are discussed here.","['Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children. The current treatment protocol for ALL involves an intense chemotherapy regimen yielding cure rates of nearly 80%. However, new therapies need to be designed not only to increase the survival rate but also to combat the risk of severe therapy associated toxicities including secondary malignancies, growth problems, organ damage, and infertility. The c-Myb proto-oncogene is highly expressed in immature hematopoietic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of c-Myb itself decreased the viability of these leukemic cells. Additionally, the inhibition of c-Myb caused a decrease in cell proliferation, significantly increased the number of cells in G(0) /G(1) phase of the cell cycle, increased the sensitivity of pre-B-ALL cells to cytotoxic agents in vitro, and significantly delayed disease onset in a mouse model of leukemia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Bcl-2 is a target of c-Myb in pre-B-ALL cells. Our results identify c-Myb as a potential therapeutic target in pre-B-ALL and suggest that suppression of c-Myb levels or activity, in combination with currently used therapies and/or dose reduction, may lead to a decrease in toxicity and an increase in patient survival rates. Because c-Myb is aberrantly expressed in several other malignancies, targeting c-Myb will have broad clinical applications.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, USA.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['CA116042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR021970/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA162133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2P20RR021970-06/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS439282'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher expression of CD71 has been identified as a negative prognostic marker for numerous solid tumor types and for some lymphomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate CD71 expression on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and to follow its possible clinical correlations. Sixty one patients, aged 1-17 years and diagnosed with ALL, were enrolled in the study. CD71 expression was analyzed on the bone marrow blastic cells by flow cytometry. CD71 expression on the leukemic blasts was diversified; in most patients, all blastic cells showed expression of CD71, but levels of expression varied. CD71 expression was statistically higher on T-lineage leukemias. Within the B lineage ALL, a significant difference in CD71 expression existed between precursor B ALL and mature B-ALL, which showed higher CD71 expression. CD71 expression positively correlated with Hgb concentration at diagnosis. Initial risk group assessment and therapy response were not correlated with CD71 expression, although disease free and overall survival times tended to be shorter in patients with B-lineage leukemias with initial high CD71 expression.","['Department of Pathophysiology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"The process of megakaryopoiesis culminates in the release of platelets, the pivotal cellular component for hemostasis and wound healing. The regulatory architecture including the modulatory role of microRNAs, which underlies megakaryocytic maturation and platelet formation, is incompletely understood, precluding the ex vivo generation of sufficient platelet numbers for transfusion medicine. We derived a highly efficient differentiation protocol to produce mature polyploid megakaryocytes and functional platelets from CD34(+)-hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by comparing previously published approaches. Our megakaryocytic culture conditions using the cytokines SCF, TPO, IL-9, and IL-6 include nicotinamide and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 as contextual additives. The potency of our novel megakaryocytic differentiation protocol was validated using cord blood and peripheral blood human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Using this novel megakaryocytic differentiation protocol, we characterized the modulatory capacity of several miRNAs highly expressed in normal megakaryocytic cells or malignant blasts from patients with megakaryoblastic leukemia. Overexpression of candidate microRNAs was achieved by lentiviral transduction of CD34(+)-hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells prior to differentiation. We revealed miR-125b and miR-660 as enhancers of polyploidization, as well as platelet output of megakaryocytes. The oncogene miR-125b markedly expanded the number of megakaryocytes during in vitro culture. Conversely, the miR-23a/27a/24-2 cluster, which is highly expressed in normal megakaryocytes, blocked maturation and platelet formation. Our study on the utilization of microRNAs in conjunction with a highly efficient differentiation protocol constitutes another step towards ex vivo platelet manufacturing on a clinically relevant scale.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['Ann Hematol. 2014 Jun;93(6):1065-6.

Traditionally it has been assumed that recurrent neoplasia, especially lymphoma, represents a relapse of the original clone. However, this concept has been challenged. Here we present an overview of novel perceptions regarding the clonal relationship of relapsing lymphoid neoplasms, i.e. precursor cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (ALL), so called non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and discuss the potential implications of these findings. In ALL, approximately 10% of ""relapses"" were found to be clonally unrelated to the original disease. In NHL, small series and case reports showed the occurrence of meta- or synchronous lymphoid malignancies, which were of different clonal origin. In cHL, there is evidence that both early and late ""relapses"" may constitute to a certain proportion a novel neoplasm of different clonal origin too. These findings warrant further investigations in order to verify and strengthen the existing data and might have important clinical implications because novel clonally unrelated lymphomas imitating relapses could possibly be treatable with less aggressive regimens compared to true recurrences.","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"PURPOSE: Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a highly aggressive malignancy of T cells caused by human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Recent clinical studies have suggested that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) improves the clinical course of ATL by harnessing a graft-versus-ATL effect, and that donor-derived HTLV-1 Tax-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) contribute to the graft-versus-ATL effect after HSCT. However, little is known about the immunological characteristics of Tax-specific CTLs in ATL patients who underwent HSCT. METHODS: We serially analyzed frequencies, differentiation, functions and clonal dynamics of Tax-specific CTLs in paired samples of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) from an ATL patient after HSCT at the single-cell level. We used flowcytometric and single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis methods without culture steps. RESULTS: Donor-derived Tax-specific CTLs effectively suppressed HTLV-1 replication in both PB and BM at least during chronic graft-versus-host disease after HSCT. Furthermore, Tax-specific CTLs had comparable properties between BM and PB, except for preferential accumulation in BM rather than PB. Tax-specific CTLs persistently existed as less-differentiated CD45RA(-)CCR7(-) effector memory CTLs based on predominant phenotypes of CD27(+), CD28(+/-) and CD57(+/-). Our approach using single-cell TCR repertoire analysis method showed highly restricted oligoclonal responses of Tax-specific CTLs, and TCR BV7- or BV30- expressing two predominant CTL clones persistently existed and maintained strong cytotoxic activities against HTLV-1 in both PB and BM over three years after HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings about Tax-specific CTLs provide insights into future directions for studies on immunotherapy against ATL.","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, 1-847 Amanuma, Omiya-ku, Saitama, Saitama, 330-8503, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These alterations are gain-of-function mutations in that they drive the synthesis of the 'oncometabolite' R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). It remains unclear how IDH1 and IDH2 mutations modify myeloid cell development and promote leukaemogenesis. Here we report the characterization of conditional knock-in (KI) mice in which the most common IDH1 mutation, IDH1(R132H), is inserted into the endogenous murine Idh1 locus and is expressed in all haematopoietic cells (Vav-KI mice) or specifically in cells of the myeloid lineage (LysM-KI mice). These mutants show increased numbers of early haematopoietic progenitors and develop splenomegaly and anaemia with extramedullary haematopoiesis, suggesting a dysfunctional bone marrow niche. Furthermore, LysM-KI cells have hypermethylated histones and changes to DNA methylation similar to those observed in human IDH1- or IDH2-mutant AML. To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe the generation and characterization of conditional IDH1(R132H)-KI mice, and also the first report to demonstrate the induction of a leukaemic DNA methylation signature in a mouse model. Our report thus sheds light on the mechanistic links between IDH1 mutation and human AML.","['The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2C1, Canada.']",,,"['R01 AI081773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI081773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",['NIHMS570638'],,,,"['GEO/GSE38589', 'GEO/GSE38687']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 5.,"Proteasome inhibitors (PIs), namely bortezomib, have become a cornerstone therapy for multiple myeloma (MM), potently reducing tumor burden and inhibiting pathologic bone destruction. In clinical trials, carfilzomib, a next generation epoxyketone-based irreversible PI, has exhibited potent anti-myeloma efficacy and decreased side effects compared with bortezomib. Carfilzomib and its orally bioavailable analog oprozomib, effectively decreased MM cell viability following continual or transient treatment mimicking in vivo pharmacokinetics. Interactions between myeloma cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment augment the number and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs) while inhibiting bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs), resulting in increased tumor growth and osteolytic lesions. At clinically relevant concentrations, carfilzomib and oprozomib directly inhibited OC formation and bone resorption in vitro, while enhancing osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization. Accordingly, carfilzomib and oprozomib increased trabecular bone volume, decreased bone resorption and enhanced bone formation in non-tumor bearing mice. Finally, in mouse models of disseminated MM, the epoxyketone-based PIs decreased murine 5TGM1 and human RPMI-8226 tumor burden and prevented bone loss. These data demonstrate that, in addition to anti-myeloma properties, carfilzomib and oprozomib effectively shift the bone microenvironment from a catabolic to an anabolic state and, similar to bortezomib, may decrease skeletal complications of MM.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.']",,,"['P50 CA094056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA113275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AR057235/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA113275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR057235/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS470437'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 3.,"Medicinal plants have shown great promise as a source of novel drug compounds for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In our search for new entities with anti-inflammatory potential, the extracts of the whole plant of Saussurea heteromalla (family-Asteraceae), collected from Himalayas, were evaluated in the high throughput screen for TNF-alpha and IL-6 inhibitors. The extract blocked TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in LPS stimulated THP-1 cells (human acute monocyte leukemia cell line) completely at 10 and 30 mug/ml. The plant has been found as a new source of chlorojanerin, a guaianolide type of sesquiterpene lactone. Chlorojanerin was shown to be significantly effective in inhibiting TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells (IC(50)=2.3+/-0.2 muM and 1.8+/-0.7 muM respectively). The compound also blocked TNF-alpha and IL-6 production from LPS-stimulated human monocytes (IC(50)=1.5+/-0.4 and 0.7+/-0.2 muM respectively) and synovial cells from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (IC(50)<0.03 and 0.5 muM respectively). Transcriptional profiling of the LPS stimulated THP-1 cells revealed that chlorojanerin exerted its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression of 8 genes involved in activating the transcription factor - NF-kappaB. Real time analysis of these genes validated the effect of chlorojanerin on the classical downstream targets of NF-kappaB. Thus, this study clearly delineated 8 genes which were specifically mitigated due to the effect of chlorojanerin on NF-kappaB induced signaling at the mRNA level. Further, chlorojanerin at 5 muM also inhibited the binding of NF-kappaB in a GFP reporter assay system by 55.5% thus validating the microarray gene expression data. This work is a step towards the isolation and characterization of lead anti-inflammatory agents from the extract of Saussurea heteromalla, which can be developed into better therapeutic molecules targeted towards some specific inflammatory diseases.","['Department of Natural Products-Botany, Piramal Healthcare Limited, 1 Nirlon Complex, Goregaon (East), Mumbai 400063, India.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Despite the importance to public health of childhood cancer, there have been few reports on Canadian trends published in the peer-reviewed literature. This study examines childhood cancer trends by age, sex, and province of residence using the most current cancer registration data. METHODS: Data from the population-based Canadian Cancer Registry were used to compute incidence trends in primary cancers diagnosed between 1992 and 2006 in children (0-14 years) for the 12 major diagnostic groups of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, 3rd Edition. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2006, incidence rates for all cancers remained stable, although trends varied by cancer type. We observed a significant decrease in retinoblastoma in boys for the entire period (-6.5% per year) and an increase in leukemia from 1992 to 1999 (+3.5% per year). In girls, there was a significant decrease in renal tumours from 1998 to 2006 (-5.7% per year) and an increase in hepatic tumours from 1997 to 2006 (+8.1% per year). Differences by age and province were also apparent. Some caution should be exercised when interpreting trends involving a small number of cases per year and those with wide 95% confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest an ongoing need for population-based surveillance and etiologic research.","['Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. debjani.mitra@phac-aspc.gc.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 8.,"OBJECTIVE: Monosomal karyotype (MK) is defined as the presence of two or more autosomal monosomies or a single monosomy associated with a structural abnormality. It was first described as a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality for acute myeloid leukemia and more recently in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, allotransplant outcome in MDS with MK has not been described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of 79 patients with MDS who underwent allotransplant at the University of Iowa from 1990 to 2009. We recorded patients' cytogenetic data, clinical characteristics and evaluated outcome following allogeneic stem cell transplant stratified by cytogenetic classification. RESULTS: Of 79 patients, 37 (47%) had unfavorable karyotypes (23 complex karyotype, 25 abnormal chromosome 7). Twenty-four patients (30%) had MK. Twenty-four patients (30%) relapsed and 59 (74.7%) died during study period. Patients with MK had higher 2-yr relapse incidence (RI) (51% vs. 29%; P = 0.01), lower 2-yr event-free survival (EFS) (8% vs. 40%; P = 0.02), and lower 2-yr overall survival (OS)(6% vs. 41%; P = 0.02) than patients without MK. We further analyzed the effect of MK in each unfavorable karyotype composite. Although the outcome was not statistically different, unfavorable karyotypes with patients with MK showed a trend toward higher 2-yr RI [hazard ratio (HR), 1.7; P = 0.34], lower 2-yr EFS (HR, 1.5; P = 0.29), and lower 2-yr OS (HR, 1.5; P = 0.28) compared to unfavorable karyotypes without MK. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic abnormalities remain an important prognostic factor for allotransplant outcome of MDS. Our results suggested poor allotransplant outcomes with high RI and low OS in MDS with MK.","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA. kitsada-wudhikarn@uiowa.edu']",,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research team consisted of a merge of healthcare providers and research staff. Each individual team consisted of a hematologist, a physician assistant and a nurse coordinator, supported by a shared group of clinical research coordinators, an investigational drug pharmacist, a regulatory associate and a data manager.

Epub 2012 Sep 6.,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones that induce cell death and cell cycle arrest in lymphoid tissues. By virtue of this property, GCs are widely exploited in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. We reported a novel BH3-only transcript, ""Bam,"" from the BCL2L11 locus, which was first described in patients with multiple myeloma. The Bam gene consists of two exons, and became of particular interest to us when we found that it was regulated in the majority of children with ALL and many in vitro systems in which GCs induce cell death. Being a BH3-only transcript, Bam retains a BH3 domain identical to that of Bim, although Bam has a unique C-terminus that is totally different from that of its relative Bim. The present work analyzes whether Bam is translated or not. Since we could not detect Bam in the endogenous situation, we evaluated its 5' untranslated region (UTR). This revealed that there are three out-of-frame initiation codons preceding the Bam open reading frame (ORF). Experiments with constructs without out-of-frame initiation codons and constructs harboring such codons in their 5' UTR revealed that Bam translation is handicapped by their presence. Moreover, there was no Kozak translational initiation sequence surrounding any of the AUGs. Taken together, results of the present study strongly suggest that this transcript is translated at a very low rate, if at all.","['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria. mmansha2005@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Sep 5.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the expansion of a leukemic stem cell (LSC) clone, carrying a Philadelphia translocation, able to overcome the non-malignant hematopoietic stem cells. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are gold-standard for CML treatment. Each shows an impressive rate of complete cytogenetic response in chronic phase (CP)-CML. However, relapse and treatment failure are major problems with long-term use of TKIs. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the mRNA expression of BCR-ABL1 represents the main molecular approach to monitoring response to treatment. However, using this analysis it is currently not possible to prospectively identify patients whose disease will relapse due to LSC reappearance. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the mRNA expression analysis of two Hedgehog (Hh) stemness signaling molecules, Smoothened (SMO) and Patched-1 (PTCH1), could predict upcoming molecular relapse. At the time of diagnosis, patients with high Sokal risk (n = 12) showed higher and lower levels of SMO and PTCH1, respectively (p = 0.0132), compared with patients with different Sokal scores (p = 0.0316 for intermediate risk and p = 0.0340 for low risk). These data suggest that Hh signaling was functionally more active in this risk group at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, the kinetics of Hh signaling activity during the individual medical history correlated with BCR-ABL1 mRNA level and with upcoming molecular relapse. Also, mutation analysis of BCR-ABL1 revealed that activation of Hh signaling precedes molecular relapse by several months, mostly in patients carrying the gatekeeper mutation T315I. Importantly, in vitro data showed a synergistic effect of chemical inhibitors of Hh signaling and TKIs in both wild-type and resistant (T315I) CML cell lines. Collectively our data show that monitoring Hh pathway activity contemporaneously with BCR-ABL1 mRNA level may improve the chance of early detection of patients who will experience a relapse (mainly in the high Sokal risk group), paving the way for an innovative management of this hematologic malignancy.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

TKI-containing induction followed by myeloablative allogeneic HSCT has resulted in long-term survival between 50 and 60% in young adults, and recent reports show promising results in patients submitted to non-myeloablative HSCT.

This paper describes cases reported to the NGO Supporters for the Health and Rights of People in the Semiconductor Industry (SHARPs). We identified demographic characteristics, occupational, and disease history, for 17 leukemia and NHL cases from the Giheung Samsung semiconductor plant, diagnosed from November 2007 to January 2011. Patients were relatively young (mean = 28.5 years, SD = 6.5) at the time of diagnosis and the mean latency period was 104.3 months (SD = 65.8). Majority of the cases were fabrication operators (11 workers among 17) and 12 were hired before 2000. Six cases worked in the etching or diffusion process. The evidence to confirm the causal relationship between exposures in the semiconductor industry and leukemia or NHL remains insufficient and a more formal, independent study of the exposure-disease relationship in this occupation is needed. However, workers should be protected from the potential exposures immediately.","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Graduate School of Public Health, Yonsei University, Korea.']",['Int J Occup Environ Health. 2012 Apr-Jun;18(2):89-91.

Recently, next-generation sequencing techniques at the transcriptome level (RNA-Seq) have been used to verify known and discover novel transcribed gene fusions. We present FusionFinder, a Perl-based software designed to automate the discovery of candidate gene fusion partners from single-end (SE) or paired-end (PE) RNA-Seq read data. FusionFinder was applied to data from a previously published analysis of the K562 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cell line. Using FusionFinder we successfully replicated the findings of this study and detected additional previously unreported fusion genes in their dataset, which were confirmed experimentally. These included two isoforms of a fusion involving the genes BRK1 and VHL, whose co-deletion has previously been associated with the prevalence and severity of renal-cell carcinoma.

We have assessed for the first time the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of BaF3 cells containing ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl), characterized at the final stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. The gut microbial 16S rDNA analysis, using PCR-Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis and quantitative PCR, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of Lactobacillus spp. (decrease of L. reuteri and L. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of L. murinus/animalis) in the BaF3 mice compared to the controls. The restoration of Lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with L. reuteri 100-23 and L. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (Atrogin-1, MuRF1, LC3, Cathepsin L) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). These positive effects are strain- and/or species-specific since L. acidophilus NCFM supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. Altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.","['Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 3.,"Polyphosphate (polyP) is a pro-inflammatory agent and a potent modulator of the human blood-clotting system. The presence of polyP of 60 phosphate units was identified in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells using specific enzymatic assays, urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell extracts, and staining of cells with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and the polyP-binding domain of Escherichia coli exopolyphosphatase. PolyP co-localizes with serotonin- but not with histamine-containing granules. PolyP levels greatly decreased in mast cells stimulated to degranulate by IgE. Mast cell granules were isolated and found to be acidic and decrease their polyP content upon alkalinization. In agreement with these results, when RBL-2H3 mast cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester to measure their intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), they were shown to possess a significant amount of Ca(2+) stored in an acidic compartment different from lysosomes. PolyP derived from RBL-2H3 mast cells stimulated bradykinin formation, and it was also detected in human basophils. All of these characteristics of mast cell granules, together with their known elemental composition, and high density, are similar to those of acidocalcisomes. The results suggest that mast cells polyP could be an important mediator of their pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant activities.","['Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Cadiz, 11009 Cadiz, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine kinase product of the Philadelphia chromosome, P210 BCR-ABL, provided a pathogenetic explanation for the initiation of the CML chronic phase and is the molecular therapeutic target for the disease. Imatinib mesylate, an orally available BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, can induce haematologic and cytogenetic remission of CML. However, imatinib resistance occurs frequently, resulting in relapse. New treatment strategies are focusing on resistant CML stem cells and the bone marrow stroma. The identification of novel pathways and mechanisms in the bone marrow microenvironment could significantly contribute to the development of such strategies. In this work, we used a high-resolution label-free MS(E) proteomic approach to identify differential protein expression in the CML bone marrow plasma of responsive and resistant patients. Oxidative lipid metabolism and regulation of the switch from canonical to noncanonical WNT signaling may contribute to CML resistance in the bone marrow compartment.","['Divisao de Laboratorios do CEMO, Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. pizzatti@inca.gov.br']",['Expert Rev Proteomics. 2012 Dec;9(6):595-8.

METHODS: Previously untreated patients with asymptomatic, Rai stage 0 to II CLL and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) >/= 10 x 10(9) /L were eligible for this phase 2 trial. Polyphenon E with a standardized dose of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (2000 mg per dose) was administered twice daily. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients received Polyphenon E at a dose of 2000 mg twice daily for up to 6 months. Of these patients, 29 (69%) had Rai stage I to II disease. Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment (range, 1 cycle-6 cycles). The most common grade 3 side effects (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) were transaminitis (1 patient), abdominal pain (1 patient), and fatigue (1 patient). Clinical activity was observed, with 13 patients (31%) experiencing a sustained reduction of >/= 20% in the ALC and 20 of 29 patients (69%) with palpable adenopathy experiencing at least a 50% reduction in the sum of the products of all lymph node areas. EGCG plasma levels after 1 month of therapy were found to be correlated with reductions in lymphadenopathy (correlation co-efficient, 0.44; P = .02).

The studies were carried out to contribute to the understanding of Hodgkin lymphoma epidemiology through descriptions of its occurrence and its association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection presenting as infectious mononucleosis. The investigations were supported by the Danish Cancer Society, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Danish Cancer Research Foundation, the Nordic Cancer Union, the Lundbeck Foundation, Plan Danmark, Danish National Research Foundation, Lily Benthine Lund's Foundation, Aase og Ejnar Danielsen's Foundation, Grosserer L. F. Foght's Foundation, the Leukaemia Reseach Fund, the Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The work was carried out in the period 1999-2010 during my employment at the Department of Epidemiology Research at Statens Serum Institut. The employed study designs included population-based incidence surveys of Hodgkin lymphoma in the Nordic countries and in Singapore, register-based cohort studies to characterise the pattern of cancer occurrence in patients with infectious mononucleosis and their first degree relatives, a register-based cohort and a population-based case-control study to characterise the association between infectious mononucleosis and Hodgkin lymphoma taking tumour EBV-status into consideration, and a case-series analysis to assess the association between HLA class I alleles and EBV-positive and EBV-negative Hodgkin lymphomas. Analyses of Nordic incidence data demonstrated that the occurrence of Hodgkin lymphoma had increased markedly younger adults in the period 1978-97, whereas it had decreased among older adults. In combination, these developments led to an accentuation of the younger adult Hodgkin lymphoma incidence peak, which has been a hallmark of Hodgkin lymphoma epidemiology in the Western hemisphere for more than a half century. The opposing incidence trends in younger and older adults are consistent with the prevailing hypothesis of aetiological heterogeneity between Hodgkin lymphomas in different age groups. In contrast to Western industrialised countries, absence of a younger adult incidence peak has been a characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma epidemiology in developing and Asian populations. A survey of Hodgkin lymphoma occurrence in Singapore 1968-2002 revealed increasing incidence rates and the emergence of an incidence peak in younger adults. The appearance of a younger adult incidence peak in conjunction to socio-economic transition towards Western world lifestyle in Singapore is compatible with the suspicion that Hodgkin lymphoma in younger adults is associated with correlates of socioeconomic affluence in childhood, such as delayed exposure to childhood infectious agents. EBV can be demonstrated in the malignant cells in a subset of Hodgkin lymphomas and it has been speculated that the virus' presence and absence may distinguish between aetiologically separate Hodgkin lymphoma entities. This possibility was explored in five investigations characterising the association between infectious mononucleosis and Hodgkin lymphoma. In these studies, infectious mononucleosis was not accompanied by an increased risk of cancer in general, but specifically with an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma. The increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma decreased with time since infectious mononucleosis and because of the typical adolescent age at infectious mononucleosis it was most prominent for Hodgkin lymphoma in younger adults. Supplementing studies provided little support for the notion that the observed association between Hodgkin lymphoma and infectious mononucleosis was explained by confounding or biases. Analyses stratified by Hodgkin lymphoma EBV status indicated that the increased risk after infectious mononucleosis was confined to the subset of Hodgkin lymphomas that harbour the virus in the malignant cells. The genetic analyses pointed to increased and decreased risk of EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma associated with HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02 alleles, respectively. The increased risk of EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma after infectious mononucleosis was not explained by the two HLA class I alleles, but HLA-A*02 abrogated its effect. This led to an immunological model for EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma according to which the level of circulating EBV infected lymphocyte regulated by cytotoxic T-cell responses is a critical determinant of disease risk. Overall, the studies included in the thesis favour that EBV infection is causally associated with development of EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma. The circumstances under which the ubiquitous infection leads to lymphoma development must be explored in future studies, which should include analyses of gene-environment interactions. Meanwhile, the aetiology of EBV-negative Hodgkin lymphoma remains elusive. Possible clinical implications of the aetiological heterogeneity should also be considered and assessed.","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Artillerivej 5, Copenhagen S, Denmark. hhj@ssi.dk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim of the study was to estimate the risk of developing fever at the beginning of any neutropenic period based on the previous history of FN. PROCEDURE: The conditional frailty model was used to estimate the risk of developing fever during neutropenia separately for children with acute leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AL/NHL), or solid tumour (ST). The total number of previous FN episodes (PFNE), age, gender, type of tumour, calendar year of granulocytopenic period, phase of treatment, and granulocyte count were included in the model. RESULTS: A total of 901 granulocytopenic periods was observed in 223 children: 306 in 66 AL/NHL and 595 in 157 ST. Fever developed in 328 cases: 125 in 53 AL/NHL and 203 in 92 ST. The PFNE variable was not significantly associated to the risk of fever [hazard ratio (HR) of 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62-1.22 in children with AL/NHL, and HR of 0.98, 95% CI of 0.70-1.37 in those with ST]. The hazard of FN was significantly affected by the phase of treatment in AL/NHL (P<0.01), and by the level of neutropenia at onset in ST (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Previous history of FN does not increase the risk of further febrile episodes in any new subsequent granulocytopenic period. The aggressiveness of chemotherapy and the level of neutropenia at onset are the most important risk factors in children with AL/NHL and with ST respectively.","[""Epidemiology and Biostatistics Section, Scientific Directorate, G.

We have conducted an ecologic analysis of the relationship between sanitation, using Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as the marker, and the incidence of childhood ALL in 127 cancer registries from 28 countries. RESULTS: There were inverse associations between H. pylori prevalence and ALL incidence rates in children. These associations were minor and only significant for ALL incidence rates for all cancer registries. They became non-significant and smaller in magnitude when the population source and/or the GNP per capita were added to the relationship. Furthermore, these results were unchanged when the associations were examined using the Generalized Estimating Equations. CONCLUSIONS: Although the findings showed lower prevalence of H. pylori and improved sanitation is associated with increased incidence of childhood ALL, they do not conclusively support Greaves ""delayed infection"" hypothesis.","['Surveillance and Response Branch, Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of Health, 16 College Road, Singapore 169854, Republic of Singapore. hishamuddin_badaruddin@moh.gov.sg']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 3.,"Hematopoietic development occurs in complex microenvironments and is influenced by key signaling events. Yet how these pathways communicate with master hematopoietic transcription factors to coordinate differentiation remains incompletely understood. The transcription factor RUNX1 plays essential roles in definitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) ontogeny, HSC maintenance, megakaryocyte (Mk) maturation, and lymphocyte differentiation. It is also the most frequent target of genetic alterations in human leukemia. Here, we report that RUNX1 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases (SFKs) and that this occurs on multiple tyrosine residues located within its negative regulatory DNA-binding and autoinhibitory domains. Retroviral transduction, chemical inhibitor, and genetic studies demonstrate a negative regulatory role of tyrosine phosphorylation on RUNX1 activity in Mk and CD8 T-cell differentiation. We also demonstrate that the nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 binds directly to RUNX1 and contributes to its dephosphorylation. Last, we show that RUNX1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with reduced GATA1 and enhanced SWI/SNF interactions. These findings link SFK and Shp2 signaling pathways to the regulation of RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis via control of RUNX1 multiprotein complex assembly.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['Genes Dev. 2012 Jul 15;26(14):1520-6.

We recently demonstrated that the flavonoid quercetin, naturally present in the diet and belonging to the class of phytochemicals, is able to sensitize several leukemia cell lines and B cells isolated from patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), in addition to apoptotic inducers (anti-CD95 and rTRAIL). Further, it potentiates the effect of fludarabine, a first-line chemotherapeutic drug used against CLL. The proapoptotic activity of quercetin in cell lines and B-CLL is related to the expression and activity of Mcl-1-antiapoptotic proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family. Quercetin downregulates Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels acting on mRNA stability and protein degradation. Considering the low toxicity of the flavonoids toward normal peripheral blood cells, our experimental results are in favor of a potential use of quercetin in adjuvant chemotherapy in CLL or other types of cancer.","[""Istituto di Scienze dell'Alimentazione, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Avellino, Italy.""]",,['(c) 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Omission of etoposide may produce similar clinical outcomes with potentially less gastrointestinal toxicity. METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients aged 15-60 with newly diagnosed AML, receiving high-dose cytarabine induction at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, were retrospectively analysed. Regimens included HiDAC-3 (idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) day 1-3, cytarabine 3 gm/m(2) bd day 1,3,5,7) or ICE (idarubicin 9 mg/m(2) day 1-3, cytarabine 3 g/m(2) bd day 1,3,5,7, etoposide 75 mg/m(2) day 1-7). Toxicity was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received HIDAC-3 and 22 patients received ICE induction. HiDAC-3 was better tolerated than ICE in terms of lower frequency of grade 3-4 nausea (0% vs 41%; P < 0.01), grade 3-4 diarrhoea (26% vs 55%; P = 0.05), lower rates of radiologically evident enterocolitis (6% vs 32%; P = 0.03) and less cumulative days of total parenteral nutrition use (1.2 vs 7.3 days; P < 0.01). Times to haematological recovery were similar between the two regimens. Thirty-day mortality was 0% for HiDAC-3 and 9% for ICE. Eighty-four per cent of HiDAC-3-treated patients achieved complete remission after the first cycle of therapy, compared with 77% with ICE. No differences in survival were evident between the two regimens.

Two clonotypes of T cells of the immune system compete with each other and with other clonotypes for survival stimuli. One of the clonotypes is normal and the other is tumourous. To model the tumourous clonotype the authors include a rate of influx of new naive T cells (descendants of mutated precursor cells) from the thymus. The authors obtain a deterministic approximation to the stochastic model and analyse eight cases of competition between the two clonotypes of T cells. The authors obtain two possible scenarios, depending on the values of parameters: either both clonotypes survive in the repertoire or the clonotype of the normal T cells becomes extinct, meanwhile the clonotype of the tumourous T cells is maintained, after achieving some maximum level of growth. The authors show that if the income of the new tumourous T cells from the thymus is augmented, then the tumourous clonotype, would never be removed from the repertoire; meanwhile the normal clonotype could become extinct if it was not specialised enough to compete effectively for survival stimuli provided by professional cells.","['Departamento de Matematicas, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 400 HSCTs performed in 2010 accounted for a quarter of all allogeneic HSCTs performed in China. The GIAC protocol, which uses HLA-mismatched/haploidentical blood or bone marrow transplantation without in vitro T-cell depletion, entails administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to all donors, intensified immunological suppression, and treatment with anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin. The stem cell grafts are a combination of G-CSF-primed bone marrow cells and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, which may be critical to the success of this protocol through the immune modulation of G-CSF. Using this protocol, more than 99% engraftment and complete donor chimerism were achieved in pediatric and adult patients with hematological malignancies. The incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades 3 and 4 was 13.4% and that of extensive chronic GVHD 22.6%. Comparable relapse rates were observed between patients who received unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation, and those who received HLA-identical or unrelated HSCT. Patients with confirmed minimal residual disease, (expression levels of Wilms' tumor suppressor gene 1 and flow cytometry) after HSCT received pre-emptive modified donor lymphocyte infusion to prevent relapse. Infection was the main cause of non-relapse death. Prospective studies are ongoing to investigate the mechanisms of immune reconstitution in order to refine the protocol. In 1964, a patient with severe aplastic anemia received a bone marrow infusion from her syngeneic, pregnant sister, and remained disease-free over a 40-year follow-up period. Following this success, there was a 20-year interruption in the transplantation program at our center. The hiatus ended in 1981 with the first allogeneic HSCT, which was used to treat a girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the mid-1990s, the facility performed allo-HSCTs from unrelated donors (URD) and umbilical cord blood (UCB). Then, in 2000, a patient with refractory acute leukemia received related haploidentical HSCT and achieved long-term survival without relapse over an 11-year followup period. Coincident with the rapid economic development experienced in China since 2000, the transplantation program at our Institute has been expanded to include broadened indications, multiple sources of stem cells and improved outcomes. The Institute is the largest HSCT center in China, now with 130 beds in four wards, 33 of which are laminar-flow rooms. Between 2007 and 2009, over 350 HSCTs were performed per year, rising to a total of 400 in 2010. Further, in 2010, 94% of these HSCTs were allogeneic transplants, accounting for a quarter of all allo-HSCTs performed in China. Of these, transplants from URD accounted for 6%-7%, those using UCB for less than 5%, those from identical siblings for 25%-30%, and those from the related haploidentical for 55%-65%. The most common indications for treatment with allo-HSCT are intermediate-to-high risk of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), refractory lymphoma, or severe aplastic anemia.","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Beijing, China. xjhrm@medmail.com.cn""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study evaluated the effect of CVT-E002, on life span when administered intraperitoneally to leukemic, infant/juvenile mice. The extract was administered to groups of mice daily for 14 days in several dosing groups up to 50mg/day from age 7 to 21 days. The tumor was administered intraperitoneally under sterile conditions, in a laminar flow hood at 7 days of age (0.5 x 10(6) leukemic cells), immediately preceding the first CVT-E002 injection for each dose group.

Despite the recent advances in knowledge surrounding epigenetics and leukemia, the mechanisms underlying miRNAs' influence on leukemia development have yet to be clearly elucidated. Our aim was to identify high ranking biological pathways altered at the gene expression level and under epigenetic control. Specifically, we set out to test the hypothesis that miRNAs dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) converge on a common pathway that can influence signaling related to hematopoiesis and leukemia development. We identified genes altered in AML patients that are under common regulation of seven key miRNAs. By mapping these genes to a global interaction network, we identified the ""AML Signalisome"". The AML Signalisome comprises 53 AML-associated molecules, and is enriched for proteins that play a role in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, a major regulator of hematopoiesis. Furthermore, we show biological enrichment for hematopoiesis-related proteins within the AML Signalisome. These findings provide important insight into miRNA-regulated pathways in leukemia, and may help to prioritize targets for disease prevention and treatment.","['Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, The University of North Carolina, 135 Dauer Drive, CB 7431, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. jrager@live.unc.edu']",,,"['P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES005948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES019315/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES019315/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*aryl hydrocarbon receptor', '*gene expression', '*leukemia', '*microRNA', '*systems biology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ACW was isolated from seawater and demonstrated several bio-functions at various concentration ranges. ACW showed a satisfactory effect against Staphylococcus aureus, which reduced 90% of bacterial growth after a 5-second exposure. We used cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to test the properties of ACW in inflammatory cytokine release, and it did not induce inflammatory cytokine release from un-stimulated, normal PBMCs. However, ACW was able to inhibit bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha released from PBMCs, showing an anti-inflammation potential. Furthermore, ACW did not stimulate the rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL-2H3) related allergy response on de-granulation. Our data presented ACW with a strong anti-oxidative ability in a superoxide anion radical scavenging assay. In mass spectrometry information, magnesium and zinc ions demonstrated bio-functional detections for anti-inflammation as well as other metal ions such as potassium and calcium were observed. ACW also had minor tyrosinase and melanin decreasing activities in human epidermal melanocytes (HEMn-MP) without apparent cytotoxicity. In addition, the cell proliferation assay illustrated anti-growth and anti-migration effects of ACW on human skin melanoma cells (A375.S2) indicating that it exerted the anti-cancer potential against skin cancer.

Total 60 cases of trisomy 8, as a sole anomaly or in addition to other chromosomal aberrations, were reported (January 2005-September 2008). Unstimulated bone marrow or blood samples were cultured, followed by GTG banding and karyotyping as per the ISCN 2005. Patients with +8 were chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (36), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (17), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (7). In 7 patients, trisomy 8 was the sole anomaly, whereas in 6 patients +8 was in addition to normal clone, in 47 patients, the +8 was in addition to t(9;22), t(15;17), and others, including 3 with tetrasomy 8. Only one patient showed constitutional +8. The present study will form the basis of further cumulative studies to correlate potential differential effects of various karyotypic anomalies on disease progression and survival following a therapeutic regime. To unravel the role of extra 8 chromosome, constitutional chromosomal analysis and uniparental disomy will be considered.","['Department of Cancer Biology, Cell Biology Division, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, NCH Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytogenetics', 'trisomy 8']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer produces a state of glutamine deficiency, which is further aggravated by toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents leading to increased tolerance of tumor to chemotherapy as well as reduced tolerance of normal tissues to the side-effects of chemotherapy. This article reviews the possible role of glutamine supplementation in reducing the serious adverse events in patients treated with anticancer drugs. The literature related to the possible role of glutamine in humans with cancer and the supportive evidence from animal studies was reviewed. Searches were made and the literature was retrieved using PUBMED, MEDLINE, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CENAHL and EMBASE, with a greater emphasis on the recent advances and clinical trials. Glutamine supplementation was found to protect against radiation-induced mucositis, anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and paclitaxel-related myalgias/arthralgias. Glutamine may prevent neurotoxicity of paclitaxel, cisplatin, oxaplatin bortezomib and lenolidamide, and is beneficial in the reduction of the dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxic effects of irinotecan and 5-FU-induced mucositis and stomatitis. Dietary glutamine reduces the severity of the immunosuppressive effect induced by methotrexate and improves the immune status of rats recovering from chemotherapy. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia requiring parenteral nutrition, glycyl-glutamine supplementation could hasten neutrophil recovery after intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Current data supports the usefulness of glutamine supplementation in reducing complications of chemotherapy; however, paucity of clinical trials weakens the clear interpretation of these findings.","['Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'glutamine', 'toxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 2.,"It has been reported that ATP inhibits or stimulates lymphoid cell proliferation depending on the cellular subset analyzed. In this study, we show that ATP exerts strikingly opposite effects on anti-CD3/CD28-activated and regulatory CD4(+) T cells (T(regs)), based on nucleotide concentration. We demonstrate that physiological concentrations of extracellular ATP (1-50 nM) do not affect activated CD4(+) T cells and T(regs). Conversely, higher ATP concentrations have a bimodal effect on activated CD4(+) T cells. Whereas 250 nM ATP stimulates proliferation, cytokine release, expression of adhesion molecules, and adhesion, 1 mM ATP induces apoptosis and inhibits activated CD4(+) T cell functions. The expression analysis and pharmacological profile of purinergic P2 receptors for extracellular nucleotides suggest that activated CD4(+) T cells are induced to apoptosis via the upregulation and engagement of P2X7R and P2X4R. On the contrary, 1 mM ATP enhances proliferation, adhesion, migration, via P2Y2R activation, and immunosuppressive ability of T(regs). Similar results were obtained when activated CD4(+) T cells and T(regs) were exposed to ATP released by necrotized leukemic cells. Taken together, our results show that different concentrations of extracellular ATP modulate CD4(+) T cells according to their activated/regulatory status. Because extracellular ATP concentration highly increases in fast-growing tumors or hyperinflamed tissues, the manipulation of purinergic signaling might represent a new therapeutic target to shift the balance between activated CD4(+) T cells and T(regs).","['Department of Hematology and Oncological Sciences L. & A.

Epub 2012 Jul 2.,"PURPOSE: To determine the association of RUNX1 mutations with therapeutic outcome in younger and older patients with primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) and with gene/microRNA expression signatures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Younger (< 60 years; n = 175) and older (>/= 60 years; n = 225) patients with CN-AML treated with intensive cytarabine/anthracycline-based first-line therapy on Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols were centrally analyzed for RUNX1 mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing and for established prognostic gene mutations. Gene/microRNA expression profiles were derived using microarrays. RESULTS: RUNX1 mutations were found in 8% and 16% of younger and older patients, respectively (P = .02). They were associated with ASXL1 mutations (P < .001) and inversely associated with NPM1 (P < .001) and CEBPA (P = .06) mutations. RUNX1-mutated patients had lower complete remission rates (P = .005 in younger; P = .006 in older) and shorter disease-free survival (P = .058 in younger; P < .001 in older), overall survival (P = .003 in younger; P < .001 in older), and event-free survival (P < .001 for younger and older) than RUNX1 wild-type patients. Because RUNX1 mutations were more common in older patients and almost never coexisted with NPM1 mutations, RUNX1 mutation-associated expression signatures were derived in older, NPM1 wild-type patients and featured upregulation of genes normally expressed in primitive hematopoietic cells and B-cell progenitors, including DNTT, BAALC, BLNK, CD109, RBPMS, and FLT3, and downregulation of promoters of myelopoiesis, including CEBPA and miR-223. CONCLUSION: RUNX1 mutations are twice as common in older than younger patients with CN-AML and negatively impact outcome in both age groups. RUNX1-mutated blasts have molecular features of primitive hematopoietic and lymphoid progenitors, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches.","['The Ohio State University, Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1216 James Cancer Hospital, 300 West 10th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",,,"['U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutations in genes involved in GM-CSF signal transduction, such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, and CBL, have been identified in more than 70% of children with JMML. In the present study, we report 2 patients with somatic mosaicism for oncogenic NRAS mutations (G12D and G12S) associated with the development of JMML. The mutated allele frequencies quantified by pyrosequencing were various and ranged from 3%-50% in BM and other somatic cells (ie, buccal smear cells, hair bulbs, or nails). Both patients experienced spontaneous improvement of clinical symptoms and leukocytosis due to JMML without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These patients are the first reported to have somatic mosaicism for oncogenic NRAS mutations. The clinical course of these patients suggests that NRAS mosaicism may be associated with a mild disease phenotype in JMML.","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the parental 697 and REH cell lines used to generate the Mer knockdown lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis before publication, the transduced progeny were not analyzed until recently. The results of STR analysis indicate that the 697 shMer1A and 697 shMer1B cell lines are actually derived from the REH parental cell line. Importantly, the identities of the other 6 REH and 697 cell lines published in this study have been verified as authentic.Since this unfortunate discovery, the authors have generated new 697 Mer knockdown cell lines and authenticated their identity.

Bone marrow and splenic cell apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry using annexin V-allophycocyanin staining. The oxidative status was investigated in homogenates of the liver. RESULTS: EC was found to increase the in vivo apoptotic effect of etoposide resulting in the decrease of the percentage of leukaemia cells in EC-treated rats in comparison to those treated with etoposide only.

However, organic arsenic derivatives (OAD) have a more favorable toxicity profile than ATO. We herein characterized dipropil-S-glycerol arsenic (GMZ27), a novel OAD. GMZ27 had potent antiproliferative activity against human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines that was higher than that of ATO. In contrast to ATO, GMZ27 only marginally induced maturation of leukemia cells and had no effect on the cell cycle. The anti-leukemia activity of GMZ27 against AML cells was independent of the presence of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein. GMZ27 dissipates mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and induces cleavage of caspase 9 and activation of caspase 3 without altering the expression levels of (BCL-2), BAX and BCL-xl. GMZ27 induces the formation of intracellular superoxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) which plays a major role in the antileukemia activity of this OAD. In addition to ROS generation, GMZ27 concomitantly reduces intracellular glutathione which markedly weakens the cellular antioxidant capacity, thus enhancing the detrimental intracellular effects of ROS production. These results indicate that GMZ27 induces apoptosis in AML cells in a PML-RARalpha-independent fashion, through the induction of ROS production. This activity provides the rationale for the testing of GMZ27 in patients with AML.","['Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS833384'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structure activity relationships (SAR) concerning different 1'-O-alkyl side-chains were also studied on two sets of derivatives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen 1'-O-alkyl protoflavone derivatives were synthesized from genkwanin or 4'-hydroxy-6-methylflavone, thirteen of which are new compounds. All compounds were tested for their cytotoxic effect on four human cancer cell lines, such as HepG2 and Hep3B (hepatic), A549 (lung) and MDA-MB-231 (breast) cell lines, with doxorubicin as a positive control. All compounds, as well as PA, WYC0209 and fourteen of their previously reported analogs were also tested on a multidrug-resistant (MDR) sub-cell line of L5178 mouse T-cell lymphoma and on its parental counterpart (PAR). RESULTS: In general, derivatives bearing a free hydroxyl group at C-1' exerted the strongest activities, while C-1'-substituted compounds were found to be much weaker. Derivatives of 6-methylflavone exhibited mild, but statistically significant selectivity towards the MDR cell line. CONCLUSION: The results are in agreement with our previous findings for fundamental SAR of protoflavones. 6-Methylated protoflavones may serve as valuable leads for developing selective compounds against MDR cancer. Identical activity of other derivatives on the PAR and MDR cell lines suggests that cancer cells cannot exhibit resistance to protoflavones by ABCB1 efflux pump overexpression.","['Institute of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two HDACi, trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA), on etoposide-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Viability, apoptosis rate, caspase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and expression of BCL2 mRNA were assessed in HL60 and U937 cell lines treated with 250 nM TSA or 1.25 mM VPA alone or followed by 5 muM etoposide. RESULTS: Preincubation of HL60 cells with TSA or VPA significantly potentiated etoposide-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, which was associated with activation of caspases and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Similar effects were not observed in U937 cells. Expression of BCL2 mRNA was strongly down-regulated after treatment of cells with HDACi alone but did not show additive effect with etoposide. CONCLUSION: Combination of HDACi with etoposide can have a synergistic effect on increased apoptosis in leukemia cells but this effect depends on the cancer cell type and other factors such as the concentration of drugs and the administration schedule.","['Department of Histology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kopernika 7, PL-31034 Krakow, Poland. ejasek@cm-uj.krakow.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAF is a cyclophosphamide analog which spontaneously degrades to 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide. The effects of MAF on various types of cancer cells were determined during preclinical investigations and clinical trials. The positive results from in vitro and in vivo anticancer studies promoted MAF to a good candidate for phase I trials. Clinical experience with intrathecal MAF, used for patients with neoplastic meningitis due to leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors, indicated good tolerability and efficacy. The recommended phase II doses of intrathecally administered MAF were determined. Clinical trials using intrathecal MAF are now underway. To obtain a better therapeutic index, a strategy to alternate dosing between the intraventricular and intralumbar routes is also being tested. MAF is an attractive agent for regional cancer therapy. The current available knowledge on MAF as a new anticancer agent is based on a collection of the original published studies, conference abstracts and relevant articles.","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland. lidia.mazur@uj.edu.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiproliferative effects of resveratrol were determined by the 3-Bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT) cell proliferation assay. Apoptotic effects of resveratrol on sensitive K562 and resistant K562/IMA-3 cells were determined through changes in caspase-3 activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and apoptosis by annexin V-(FITC). RESULTS: The concentrations of resveratrol that inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC(50)) were calculated as 85 and 122 muM for K562 and K562/IMA-3 cells, respectively. There were 1.91-, 7.42- and 14.73-fold increases in loss of MMP in K562 cells treated with 10, 50, and 100 muM resveratrol, respectively. The same concentrations of resveratrol resulted in 2.21-, 3.30- and 7.65-fold increases in loss of MMP in K562/IMA-3 cells. Caspase-3 activity increased 1.04-, 2.77- and 4.8-fold in K562 and 1.02-, 1.41- and 3.46-fold in K562/IMA-3 cells in response to the same concentrations of resveratrol, respectively. Apoptosis was induced in 58.7%- and 43.3% of K562 and K562/IMA-3 cells, respectively, in response to 100 muM resveratrol.

We have previously demonstrated that PSK induces apoptosis and inhibites proliferation of promyelomonocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, but the signaling pathway for this action remains to be elucidated. In HL-60 cells, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been reported to be involved in stimuli-induced apoptosis. Therefore, involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway in PSK-induced apoptosis was herein investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were used in this study. Western blotting was performed to detect phosphorylated p38 MAPK. A p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, was used to examine the roles of p38 MAPK in PSK-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition. RESULTS: PSK induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Co-treatment with SB203580 blocked PSK-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 activation and growth inhibition.

In the process, the modes of drug resistance are described both of the host and in the leukemia cells themselves. These modes of drug resistance, developed by the ALL cells, are an attempt to overcome the toxic insult this class of anti-leukemic drugs causes to them. It is expected that by reading this article one would obtain a better understanding of the initial events in the leukemia development, its microenvironment, and the many issues that a leukemia specialist has to deal with, especially in the treatment of refractory and relapsed patient populations. The specific issues addressed in this review deal with the importance of nutrients in tumor growth and progression of malignancies; the cytogenetics of ALL, as well as its chemotherapy, are also briefly presented. The emphasis will turn to ASNase, their mechanisms of action, the immune responses they cause in a significant percentage of the ALL patients, the significance of the up-regulation of glutamine synthetase and asparagine synthetase and the complexity of the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of ASNase. Additional details on the ASNase epitope mapping of anti-ASNase antibodies, the degradation of the protein, and the unmet needs in producing an optimal ASNase protein, will be also presented. Finally, a brief description of the toxicity, as well as the correlative factor of ALL treatment with ASNase is given.","[""Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. viavramis@chla.usc.edu""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the association of height with risk of all cancer and of 19 site-specific cancers in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, a prospective cohort of nearly 90,000 women. Weight and height were measured at enrollment, and information on reproductive and medical history as well as lifestyle exposures was obtained by means of questionnaire. After exclusions, 5,679 incident invasive cancers were identified among 88,256 women. We used Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) per 10 cm increase in height. All tests of statistical significance were two sided. All cancers combined and ten specific sites (colorectum, colon, premenopausal breast, postmenopausal breast, endometrium, ovary, kidney, thyroid, melanoma and leukemia) showed statistically significant positive associations with height. The HR for all cancers combined was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.08-1.18), and the magnitude of the associations for specific sites ranged from HR 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03-1.20) for postmenopausal breast cancer to HR 1.51 (95% CI: 1.27-1.80) for melanoma.

Treatment of renal cells with doxorubicin resulted in a significant decrease in viability of the cells, and we next proved that such toxicity was mainly due to apoptotic cell death. Pretreatment of the cells with plaunotol for at least 9 h prior to doxorubicin exposure improved the cells' survival. Plaunotol was shown to up-regulate the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) level whereas it had no effect on the Bcl-2 level. The reduction in Mcl-1 after doxorubicin treatment was shown to be closely associated with the toxic action of the drug, and the increase in Mcl-1 induced by plaunotol pretreatment was able to prevent cell death induced by doxorubicin.

Epub 2012 Jul 3.,"PURPOSE: We sought to determine what women recall about reproductive health risks (RHR) from cancer therapy at the time of cancer diagnosis in order to identify barriers to reproductive health counseling (RHC) and fertility preservation (FP). METHODS: Data were obtained by surveying 1,041 female cancer survivors from the California Cancer Registry. Inclusion criteria included women age 18-40 with a diagnosis of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast or GI cancer diagnosed between 1993 and 2007. Women were asked to respond to an open-ended question: ""what did your doctor tell you about how cancer treatment could affect your ability to get pregnant?"" Framework analysis was used to identify themes surrounding patient perceptions of RHC. RESULTS: Of the patients, 51.8 % (361 out of 697) recalled receiving reproductive health counseling and 12.2 % (85 out of 697) recalled receiving FP counseling. Of the patients, 45.3 % (277 out of 612) reported that uncertain prognosis, risk of recurrence or vertical transmission, age, parity, or uncertain desire may have prevented them from receiving timely and essential information on RHRs. Communication barriers included omission of information, failure to disclose RHRs, and presentation of incorrect information on FP. DISCUSSION: In a sample of women diagnosed with cancer of reproductive age, almost half did not recall counseling on RHRs and few recalled FP counseling. Communication barriers between physicians and patients regarding fertility may lead to uninformed (reproductive health) RH decisions. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Many women may not receive adequate information about RHRs or FP at the time of cancer diagnosis. Advancements in reproductive technology and emerging organizations that cover financial costs of FP have dramatically changed what options women have to preserve their fertility. Routine and thoughtful RHR and FP counseling, as well as collaborative cancer care will help ensure that women diagnosed with cancer are provided with the services and information they need to make an informed choice about their reproductive future.","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA. erin.ebbel@gmail.com']",,,['TL1 RR024129/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 1.,"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) refers to the constellation of deranged metabolic state, characterized by hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, and/or azotemia, secondary to rapid breakdown of tumor cells. It is a life threatening emergency that typically follows administration of chemotherapy or may be spontaneous. Malignancies which have a large tumor burden, rapid turnover, as well as speedy breakdown following chemotherapy are susceptible. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma (particularly Burkitt's lymphoma) are typically predisposed. TLS is best managed by early anticipation and preventive measures than the complicated task of treating an established TLS. Vigorous intravenous hydration is the cornerstone of prevention as well as treatment. Rasburicase has revolutionized the management. It is available in India for past 1 1/2 y, although the cost is a limiting factor. Children with acute leukemia in developing countries may reach health facility late, with severe anemia and hyperleukocytosis. Exchange transfusion may have to be restored to in such patients to simultaneously correct anemia and hyperleukocytosis and enable safe administration of fluids. Dialysis may be required when the metabolic 'trash' overwhelms the renal excretion, resulting in renal failure. Chemotherapeutic drugs are often administered in a phased manner in susceptible patients, in an attempt to prevent precipitous lysis of tumor cells. Presentation and management of TLS in relevance to the pediatric emergency room is outlined.","['Hematology/Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']","['Indian J Pediatr. 2013 Nov;80(11):978.

The aim of our study was to identify DNA repair polymorphisms contributing to the risk of second neoplasm in clinically well-characterized Slovenian patients treated for childhood ALL. METHODS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL between 1971 and 2001 were included in the study. According to the identified clinical risk factors for second neoplasm, a matched set of cases with second neoplasm and controls was selected and genotyped for 11 DNA repair polymorphisms. RESULTS: Among 359 pediatric patients with ALL, 20 second neoplasms were observed. The dose of radiotherapy (P = 0.011), administration of epipodophyllotoxins (P = 0.006), and the dose of anthracyclines (P < 0.001) showed a significant association with the risk of second neoplasm. Among genetic factors, we observed a significant association of NBN 1197G allele with increased risk of second neoplasms (RR = 4.36; 95 % CI: 1.19-15.98; P = 0.026), while the risk was decreased in carriers of XRCC3-316G allele compared with patients with wild-type genotype (RR = 0.20; 95 % CI: 0.04-0.99; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an important role of NBN 1197A>G and XRCC3-316A>G polymorphisms in the development of second neoplasm in patients treated for childhood ALL.","['Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Institute of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Vrazov trg 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 29.,"Doxorubicin is commonly used to treat leukemia, lymphomas, and solid tumors, such as soft tissue sarcomas or breast cancer. A major side effect of doxorubicin therapy is dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin's effects on cardiac energy metabolism are emerging as key elements mediating its toxicity. We evaluated the effect of doxorubicin on [(14)C]creatine uptake in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes and HL-1 murine cardiac cells expressing the human creatine transporter protein. A significant and irreversible decrease in creatine transport was detected after an incubation with 50-100 nmol/l doxorubicin. These concentrations are well below peak plasma levels (5 mumol/l) and within the ranges (25-250 nmol/l) for steady-state plasma concentrations reported after the administration of 15-90 mg/m(2) doxorubicin for chemotherapy. The decrease in creatine transport was not solely because of increased cell death due to doxorubicin's cytotoxic effects. Kinetic analysis showed that doxorubicin decreased V(max), K(m), and creatine transporter protein content. Cell surface biotinylation experiments confirmed that the amount of creatine transporter protein present at the cell surface was reduced. Cardiomyocytes rely on uptake by a dedicated creatine transporter to meet their intracellular creatine needs. Our findings show that the cardiomyocellular transport capacity for creatine is substantially decreased by doxorubicin administration and suggest that this effect may be an important early event in the pathogenesis of doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity.","['Surgery Department, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 26.,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) is implicated in many cellular functions including cell proliferation and differentiation, thus, exerting potential antitumor effects. A major limitation for therapeutic use of 1,25D are its potent calcemic and phosphatemic activities. Therefore, synthetic analogs of 1,25D for use in anticancer therapy should retain cell differentiating potential, with calcemic activity being reduced. Previously, we described pro-differentiating effects of vitamin D2 analogs with extended and branched side-chains. Analogs with side-chains extended by a pair of one (PRI-1906) or two carbon units (PRI-1907) displayed elevated cell-differentiating activity towards some acute leukemia cell lines (AML) in comparison to 1,25D. In this study, the potential mechanism of this superagonistic activity of the analogs was addressed. At first, possible differences in the expression of CYP24A1, a major catabolizing enzyme for vitamin D compounds and resulting differences in the degradation of analogs were investigated. In addition, interactions of the analogs with vitamin D receptor (VDR) and resulting activation of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) were studied. The results obtained show that superagonistic pro-differentiating activities of analogs PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 do not seem to be caused by their altered catabolism, but most probably by altered interactions with VDR and resulting downstream proteins.","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, 50-137 Wroclaw, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 357 T-ALL cases for FLT3 mutations and transcript expression. FLT3 mutations (3% overall) and overexpression (FLT3 high expresser (FLT3(High))) were restricted to immature/TCRgammadelta T-ALLs. In vitro FLT3 inhibition induced apoptosis in only 30% of FLT3(High) T-ALLs and did not correlate with mutational status. In order to investigate the mechanisms of primary resistance to FLT3 inhibition, a broad quantitative screen for receptor kinome transcript deregulation was performed by Taqman Low Density Array. FLT3 deregulation was associated with overexpression of a network of receptor kinases (RKs), potentially responsible for redundancies and sporadic response to specific FLT3 inhibition. In keeping with this resistance to FLT3 inhibition could be reversed by dual inhibition of FLT3 and KIT with a synergistic effect. We conclude that immature T-ALL may benefit from multitargeted RK inhibition and that exploration of the receptor kinome defines a rational strategy for testing multitarget kinase inhibition in malignant diseases.","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Necker-Enfants-Malades APHP, CNRS UMR 8147, Universite Paris-5 Descartes, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATO at therapeutic concentrations (1-2 muM) induces APL NB4, but not non-APL HL-60, cells to undergo apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. The role of antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 in ATO-induced apoptosis was determined. The levels of Mcl-1 were decreased in NB4, but not in HL-60, cells after ATO treatment through proteasomal degradation. Both glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibitor SB216763 and siRNA blocked ATO-induced Mcl-1 reduction as well as attenuated ATO-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. Silencing Mcl-1 sensitized HL-60 cells to ATO-induced apoptosis. Both ERK and AKT inhibitors decreased Mcl-1 levels and enhanced ATO-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Sorafenib, an Raf inhibitor, activated GSK-3beta by inhibiting its phosphorylation, decreased Mcl-1 levels and decreased intracellular glutathione levels in HL-60 cells. Sorafenib plus ATO augmented reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis induction in HL-60 cells and in primary AML cells. These results indicate that ATO induces Mcl-1 degradation through activation of GSK-3beta in APL cells and provide a rationale for utilizing ATO in combination with sorafenib for the treatment of non-APL AML patients.","['The Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA093533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA93533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS386393'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, CSCs are therapeutically important because of their key contributions toward drug resistance. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1alpha is critical for CSC maintenance in mouse lymphoma. In this study, we showed that low concentrations of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG eliminate lymphoma CSCs in vitro and in vivo by disrupting the transcriptional function of HIF1alpha, a client protein of HSP90. 17-AAG preferentially induced apoptosis and eliminated the colony formation capacity of mouse lymphoma CSCs and human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) CSCs. However, low concentrations of 17-AAG failed to eliminate highly proliferative lymphoma and AML cells (non-CSCs), in which the AKT-GSK3 signaling pathway is constitutively active. The heat shock transcription factor HSF1 is highly expressed in non-CSCs, but it was weakly expressed in lymphoma CSCs. However, siRNA-mediated attenuation of HSF1 abrogated the colony formation ability of both lymphoma and AML CSCs. This study supports the use of 17-AAG as a CSC targeting agent and, in addition, shows that HSF1 is an important target for elimination of both CSCs and non-CSCs in cancer.","['Section of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Medical Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI48109, USA.']",,['(c)2012 AACR.'],"['R01 CA120023/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS062391/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007767/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA164469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA143474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS393801'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data have demonstrated high expression levels of AVEN messenger RNA in acute leukemias as well as a positive correlation between AVEN mRNA overexpression and poor prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. On the basis of these data, we investigated the potential involvement of AVEN in tumorigenesis. First, we confirmed the overexpression of AVEN in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) patient samples. We then established a transgenic mouse model with T-cell-specific overexpression of AVEN, with which we demonstrated the oncogenic cooperation of AVEN with heterozygous loss of p53. Finally, we used a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model to show that AVEN knockdown in the T-ALL cell lines, MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM, and in the acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1, leads to a halt in tumor growth owing to the increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of tumor cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the anti-apoptotic molecule, AVEN, functions as an oncoprotein in hematopoietic neoplasms.","['Chemotherapeutisches Forschungsinstitut Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A pre- and post-test crossover design. SETTING: An urban outpatient cancer center in the midwestern United States. SAMPLE: A convenience sample of 20 patients, aged 20-68 years (X = 38.5), receiving treatment at a BMT clinic. METHODS: Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Therapy-Related Symptom Checklist, and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index, and provided salivary cortisol samples. After pretesting, individuals were assigned to either a wait list or intervention. Individuals in the wait-list group received the usual treatment before completing the post-test measures. Individuals in the intervention group participated in a one-hour art-making session, after which they completed post-test measures. Participants then crossed over to the other group. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Art making, stress, state anxiety, and therapy-related symptoms. FINDINGS: Therapy-related symptom concerns for the intervention group at post-test were significantly lower than at pretest; no change ocurred in the control group. The salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower at post-test in the intervention and control groups. No change occurred in the anxiety levels of participants in the intervention and control groups. The study hypothesis was partially supported. CONCLUSIONS: Art making decreased therapy-related symptoms (e.g., feeling sluggish, difficulty concentrating). Use of more physiologic indices to measure stress and replication on a larger sample are suggested. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Individuals receiving BMT may benefit from participation in art-making interventions. Art making is easy to implement in a clinic setting and allows for positive interactions between nurses and patients.","['Department of Occupational Therapy Education, University of Kansas Medical Center, USA. lmische-lawson@kumc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: LR11 is specifically expressed in monocytes, and surface levels on leukemic cells are highly induced in both AML and ALL. sLR11 levels of acute leukemia patients were significantly increased (P<0.001) (ALL, 73.5+/-93.5 ng/ml; AML, 26.8+/-29.1 ng/ml) in comparison to controls (9.2+/-3.3 ng/ml). Patients with AML and ALL in remission showed significantly decreased sLR11 levels to below 20 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: LR11 and its released soluble form are strongly elevated in acute leukemias. Remarkably, this increase in circulating sLR11 levels is ameliorated at complete remission.","['Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Fifty-one patients (median age, 36 years; range, 20-64 years) received a matched sibling (n = 24), syngeneic (n = 2), or matched unrelated donor transplant (n = 25) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission (n = 30), second complete remission (n = 13), or active disease (n = 8). More than one-half of the patients had a high-risk cytogenetic profile, as defined by the presence of t(9;22) (n = 17), t(4;11) (n = 3), or complex cytogenetics (n = 7). Clo 40 mg/m(2) was given once daily, with each dose followed by pharmacokinetically dosed Bu infused over 3 hours daily for 4 days, followed by hematopoietic SCT 2 days later. The Bu dose was based on drug clearance, as determined by the patient's response to a 32-mg/m(2) Bu test dose given 48 hours before the high-dose regimen. The target daily area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 5500 muM/min for patients age <60 years and 4000 muM/min for those age >/=60 years. The regimen was well tolerated, with a 100-day nonrelapse mortality rate of 6%. With a median follow-up of 14 months among surviving patients (range, 6-28 months), the 1-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality rates were 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55%-83%), 54% (95% CI, 41%-71%), and 32% (95% CI, 16%-45%), respectively. For patients undergoing SCT in first remission, these respective rates were 74%, 64%, and 25%.

The RBM doses of 42 patients (age 2.7-86.4 years) were calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. The trabecular spongiosa was segmented to substitute RBM rather than the whole bone. Quantitative correlations between anthropometric variables such as age, physical bone density (PBD) and RBM dose were established. Personalized leukaemia risk was evaluated using an improved Boice model which included the age-associated RBM involvement. An incremental leukaemia risk of 29%-82% (mean = 45%) was found to be associated with 40 pelvic kVCBCT scans in the subject group used in a typical external beam radiation therapy course. Higher risks were observed in children. Due to the enhanced photoelectric effect in high atomic number materials, PBD was observed to strongly affect the RBM dose. Considerable overestimations (9%-42%, mean = 28%) were observed if the whole bone doses were used as surrogates of RBM doses. The personalized estimation of RBM dose and associated leukaemia risk caused by pelvic kVCBCT scans is clinically feasible with the proposed empirical models. Higher radiogenic cancer risks are associated with repeated kVCBCT scans in IGRT of cancer patients, especially children.","[""Beijing Key Lab of Medical Physics and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, pH and drug content of the polymeric prodrug only presented slight influence on the 6-MP release. MTT assay demonstrated that this system had higher inhibition ratio on HL-60 cells (human promyelocytic leukemia cells) in the presence of GSH and lower cytotoxicity on mouse fibroblast cell line (L929). Therefore, this nano-sized system is glutathione-dependent, and it can be employed as a potential carrier for the controlled release of 6-MP.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, PR China.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2012 Jun 27.,"The granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus transiently express markers of the GABAergic phenotype early during development. However, GCs are generated throughout life, posing the question of whether the newborn neurons in the adult rodent recapitulate the development of the neurotransmitter phenotype of GCs generated during embryonic and early postnatal development. In this work we asked whether newborn GCs transiently express a GABAergic phenotype during their development in the adult rat. Using retroviral infection, we labeled dividing cells in the dorsal hippocampus with GFP, identified them as granule cells, and determined their expression of GABAergic markers at different developmental stages. We found that GFP-positive cells express Prox-1 and calbindin, identifying them as GCs. GABA or GAD(67) was expressed in 13% of GFP-positive cells at 7 dpi, in 16% at 10 dpi and in 20% at 15 dpi. At 30 dpi, however, no GFP-positive cell somata containing GABAergic markers were detected, but their mossy fiber boutons did contain GAD(67). Interestingly, developing GCs detected with doublecortin and PSA-NCAM in non-injected adult rats, did not express GABAergic markers, suggesting that retroviral injection/infection stimulates their transient expression. However, in non-injected rats, a number of mossy fiber boutons of newborn granule cells detected with PSA-NCAM did express GAD(67). Our findings reveal that developing GCs born in the adult are able to transiently up-regulate the expression of GABAergic markers to be detected in their soma in response to insults, while they constitutively express GAD(67) in their mossy fibers.","['Department of Physiology, Biophysics and Neurosciences, Centro de Investigacion y Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Apartado Postal 14-740, Mexico 07000 D.F., Mexico.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The establishment of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line as an efficient and reliable experimental research tool was considered a major advance toward the understanding of the wild-type mast cell population's biology. The development of sub-clone RBL-IV (HR+) led to the isolation of histamine-secreting RBL-2H3 cell line. Since then, RBL-2H3 cells have been extensively used for studying the IgE high affinity receptor (FcvarepsilonRI) interactions with their ligand, the IgE antibody. This cell line has been employed for generating human and more recently canine and equine FcvarepsilonRIalpha-transfected RBL cell lines facilitating an assessment of the residues involved in the complementary interaction between the IgE molecules from these species and their cognate high affinity receptor. A proteomics-based approach to the definition of IgE-receptor-mediated signaling pathways was also carried out using this cell line.

Epub 2012 Jun 27.,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are associated with fusion of the BCR and ABL1 genes by chromosome translocation. The chimerical BCR-ABL1 gene encodes different fusion proteins that vary in size, depending on the breakpoint in the BCR region. Different types of fusion genes in CML and Ph(+) ALL are thought to be related to the clinical course and outcome of each patient. Currently, the genotypes are determined by PCR, followed by gel electrophoresis or DNA sequencing (among other methodologies). Our major aim was to develop a diagnostic method for CML genotyping by means of an integrated process of DNA microarray. Here, we describe a method of integrated multiplex reverse transcription, asymmetric PCR, and hybridization, all in the same reaction mixture in a chamber assembled on the surface of capture oligonucleotide probes immobilized on a glass slide. The integrated system successfully identified the four predominant types of chimerical BCR-ABL1 RNA (b3a2, b2a2, e1a2, and c3a2), which together account for 98% of CML cases. The integrated multiplex system also had a high sensitivity of detection (as little as 200 molecules of target RNA molecules). The integrated process saves time and effort, and it also the advantage of minimizing the steps needed for automated detection of different types of chimerical CML RNA.","['Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea.']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer effects of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in two different ALL cell lines (CCRF-CEM (T-ALL) and Nalm-6 (B-ALL)). The anti-leukemic effects of PGE2 were also compared with two epigenetic compounds (trichostatin A and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine). MTT assay was used to assess growth inhibition by anti-cancer drugs in these cells. All three compounds were shown to induce apoptosis in both ALL cell lines using flow cytometry and Western blotting. To evaluate the differentiation induction by these agents, the expressions of CD19 and CD38 markers on Nalm-6 cell line and CD7 marker on CCRF-CEM cell line were assayed. Surprisingly, the flow cytometric analysis showed a significant increase in CD markers expression in response to PGE2 treatments. We, for the first time, provide evidences that PGE2 has anti-leukemic effects and induces differentiation at micromolar ranges in both T- and B-cell derived ALL cell lines. Since T-ALL cells are insensitive to current chemotherapies, these findings may help the designing of new protocols for T-ALL differentiation therapy in the future.","['Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) was encapsulated in biodegradable nanoparticles and targeted to the cell surface using an antibody to the oligosaccharide antigen SSEA-1. Sustained release of LIF from nanoparticles composed of a solid Poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) polyester or a hydrogel-based liposomal system, we term Nanolipogel, replenished once after each cell passage, proved as effective as daily replenishment with soluble LIF for maintenance of pluripotency after 5 passages using 10(4)-fold less LIF.

Eight different leukemia cluster scenarios were simulated using individual addresses of all 1,009,332 children living in Denmark in 2006. For each scenario, a number of point sources were defined with an increased risk ratio at centroid, decreasing linearly to 1.0 at the edge; aggregation levels were administrative units of Danish municipalities and squares of 5, 12.5 and 25 km(2). Six statistical methods were compared. Generally, statistical power decreased with increasing size of aggregated units. In our scenarios, statistical tests based on individual data usually had lower statistical power than the best test based on aggregated data. In conclusion, spatial aggregation does not necessarily blur a clustering effect; this depends on the nature of clustering and the aggregated units.","['Institute for Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.

In a small proportion of APL cases, RARalpha is fused with a number of alternative partner genes. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 beta (STAT5b) is one of the variant partners. Here, we describe one rare case with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) -unresponsive APL characterized by the STAT5b-RARalpha fusion transcript. Morphology and immunophenotypic analyses indicated the typical features of APL; however, cytogenetic analysis exhibited a normal karyotype, and importantly, results of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that PML-RARalpha expression was negative. FISH analysis with the RARalpha dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe indicated a submicroscopic deletion of the 3' end of one RARA gene. Indeed, the STAT5b-RARalpha fusion transcript was found in this case by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and nested RT-PCR. To the best of our knowledge, we report here only the sixth APL patient in the world with the STAT5b-RARalpha fusion transcript.

METHODS: As a first step to understand the molecular role of GIG47, we analyzed the expression profile of GIG47 in multiple human cancers including the breast cancer and characterized its function related to human carcinogenesis. Based on this oncogenic role of GIG47, we then embarked on determining the high-resolution structure of GIG47. We have applied multidimensional heteronuclear NMR methods to GIG47. RESULTS: GIG47 was over-expressed in primary breast tumors as well as other human tumors including carcinomas of the uterine cervix, malignant lymphoma, colon, lung, skin, and leukemia. To establish its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer in humans, we generated stable transfectants of MCF7 cells. The ectopic expression of GIG47 in MCF7 cells promoted the invasiveness in the presence of 50% serum. In addition, it also resulted in the increased tumorigenicity in in vivo tumor formation assay. The tumorigenesis mechanism involving GIG47 might be mediated by the activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. These results indicate that GIG47 plays a role in the breast tumorigenesis, thus representing a novel target for the treatment of breast cancer. To facilitate the development of GIG47-targeted therapeutics, we determined the structural configuration of GIG47. The high-resolution structure of GIG47 was obtained by combination of NMR and homology modeling. The overall structure of GIG47 has four alpha-helices and 6 beta-strands, arranged in a beta1-alpha1-beta2-beta3-alpha2-beta4-alpha3-alpha4-beta5-beta6 topology.

RESULTS: Here, we provide evidence that Pbx1 is expressed in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons from embryonic day 11 into adulthood and determines some of the cellular properties of this neuronal population. In Pbx1-deficient mice, the mesencephalic dopaminergic axons stall during mid-gestation at the border between di- and telencephalon before entering the ganglionic eminence, leading to a loose organization of the axonal bundle and partial misrouting. In Pbx1-deficient dopaminergic neurons, the high affinity netrin-1 receptor, deleted in colon cancer (DCC), is down-regulated. Interestingly, we found several conserved Pbx1 binding sites in the first intron of DCC, suggesting a direct regulation of DCC transcription by Pbx1. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Pbx1 in dopaminergic neurons and its regulation of DCC expression make it an important player in defining the axonal guidance of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, with possible implications for the normal physiology of the nigro-striatal system as well as processes related to the degeneration of neurons during the course of Parkinson's disease.","['Laboratory of Molecular Neuropathology, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. sgado@science.unitn.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are reporting a 13 years old girl with FA and positive chromosomal breakage. She required regular blood product transfusion. She was planned for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but the sibling-matched donor was found to have chromosomal breaks as well. Later on, her peripheral smear showed blast cell. Bone marrow showed pre-B ALL. She was started on chemotherapy but died shortly due to complications of the treatment.

We present a case of a woman with calcifications in her left innominate vein after removal of an implantable venous device. CASE PRESENTATION: A venous access port was surgically placed for intravenous chemotherapy in a 19-year-old Caucasian woman who had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She developed a fever three and a half years after placement, and the venous access port was removed as it was seen as the only focus for her fever. In the year following its removal, a computed tomography scan was ordered due to a clinical suspicion of deep venous thrombosis of her left arm. The computed tomography scan revealed a hyperdense structure in the left innominate vein with thrombosis. It was concluded that this was a foreign body, a retained catheter fragment after removal of the catheter. After three-dimensional reconstructions were performed, it was determined that these hyperdense structures were calcifications in the left innominate vein that resembled a foreign body. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiating between intravenous thrombotic calcification and a retained catheter tip after removal can be challenging, even with modern day diagnostic tools. Care should be taken to document the length of the catheter upon placement and upon removal. In this manner, unnecessary surgical exploration can be avoided. We would like to highlight the importance of these diagnostic considerations for radiologists and oncologists.","['Department of Paediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Groningen, PO Box 30,001, 9700, RB, Groningen, The Netherlands. j.van.bastelaar@umcg.nl.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 29.,"An 8-year-old male neutered Labrador Retriever was referred to the University of Wisconsin Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of leukemia. Hematologic abnormalities included normal neutrophil count with a left shift, monocytosis, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, and circulating immature mononuclear cells. Bone marrow was effaced by immature hematopoietic cells of various morphologic appearances. In addition, large multinucleated cells were observed frequently. Flow cytometric analysis of nucleated cells in blood revealed 34% CD34(+) cells, consistent with acute leukemia. By immunocytochemical analysis of cells in blood and bone marrow, some mononuclear cells expressed CD18, myeloperoxidase, and CD11b, indicating myeloid origin; some, but not all, large multinucleated cells expressed CD117 and CD42b, the latter supporting megakaryocytic lineage. The diagnosis was acute myeloblastic leukemia without maturation (AML-M1). To identify genetic aberrations associated with this malignancy, cells from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded bone marrow were analyzed cytogenetically by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Co-localization of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing BCR and ABL was evident in 32% of cells. This confirmed the presence of the canine BCR-ABL translocation or Raleigh chromosome. In people, the analogous translocation or Philadelphia chromosome is characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is rarely reported in AML. BCR-ABL translocation also has been identified in dogs with CML; however, to our knowledge this is the first report of AML with a BCR-ABL translocation in a domestic animal.","['Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.']",,['(c) 2012 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.'],"['T35 OD011070/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'T35 RR025837/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS702425'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, histone H3 methylation in these cells has not been characterized. METHODS: This study examined the methylation status at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) in primary acute leukemia cells obtained from patients and compared with those in the non-leukemia and healthy cells. We further characterized the effect of phenylhexyl isothiocyanate (PHI), Trichostatin A (TSA), and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) on the cells. RESULTS: We found that methylation of histone H3K4 was virtually undetectable, while methylation at H3K9 was significantly higher in primary human leukemia cells. The histone H3K9 hypermethylation and histone H3K4 hypomethylation were observed in both myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells. PHI was found to be able to normalize the methylation level in the primary leukemia cells. We further showed that PHI was able to enhance the methyltransferase activity of H3K4 and decrease the activity of H3K9 methyltransferase. 5-Aza had similar effect on H3K4, but minimal effect on H3K9, whereas TSA had no effect on H3K4 and H3K9 methyltransferases. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed opposite methylation level of H3K4 and H3K9 in primary human leukemia cells and demonstrated for the first time that PHI has different effects on the methyltransferases for H3K4 and H3K9.","['Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, 363000, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 16.,"The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is involved in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease. Thus far, at least 29 variants of the TPMT gene have been described, many of which encode proteins that have low enzyme activity and in some cases become more prone to aggregation and degradation. Here, the two naturally occurring variants, TPMT*2 (Ala80 --> Pro) and TPMT*5 (Leu49 --> Ser), were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that TPMT*2 was substantially destabilized whereas TPMT*5 showed much greater stability comparable to that of wild-type TPMT (TPMTwt). The extrinsic fluorescent molecule anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS) was used to probe the tertiary structure during thermal denaturation. In contrast to TPMTwt, neither of the variants bound ANS to a large extent. To explore the morphology of the TPMT aggregates, we performed luminescent conjugated oligothiophene staining and showed fibril formation for TPMT*2 and TPMT*5. The differences in the flexibility of TPMTwt, TPMT*2, and TPMT*5 were evaluated in a limited proteolysis experiment to pinpoint stable regions. Even though there is only one amino acid difference between the analyzed TPMT variants, a clear disparity in the cleavage patterns was observed. TPMT*2 displays a protected region in the C-terminus, which differs from TPMTwt, whereas the protected regions in TPMT*5 are located mainly in the N-terminus close to the active site. In conclusion, this in vitro study, conducted to probe structural changes during unfolding of TPMT*2 and TPMT*5, demonstrates that the various causes of the low enzyme activity in vivo could be explained on a molecular level.","['Department of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Linkoping University, SE-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with high risk myelofibrosis as determined by their advanced age, degree of anemia, leukocytosis, constitutional symptoms and high percentage of circulating blasts have a very short median survival of 2 years. In addition quality of life is significantly compromised due to cytokine induced constitutional symptoms, frequent transfusion for cytopenias and bulky splenomegaly. Progression to myelogenous leukemia occurs in about 20% of patients within 10 years of diagnosis and is often fatal. Allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation is the only curative therapy but is limited by patient eligibility, transplant related mortality and graft versus host disease. Androgens, erythropoietin analogues, hydroxyurea, alkylators and spleen directed therapies have all been used with limited efficacy and no curative potential. The discovery of mutations in the hematopoietic progenitors of patients with myelofibrosis, including the JAK2 V617F mutation and others has greatly improved our understanding of the disease and facilitated development of newer targeted therapies. Our article will review new discoveries in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis and focus on emerging targeted treatments. These novel therapies including oral JAK2 inhibitors, immunomodulators, as well as inhibitors of HDAC and mTOR, in isolation and in combination are likely to improve outcomes in management of this disease.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, nine cases of fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia have been reported in the literature. All the patients had hematological neoplasms and were severely neutropenic after one or two intensive chemotherapy regimens. They died shortly (within 3 days) after the onset of the hemorrhagic pneumonia. Management of the infection caused by S. maltophilia is hampered by high-level intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics and the increasing occurrence of acquired resistance to co-trimoxazole and fluoroquinolones. It would be important to keep in mind that hemorrhagic respiratory infection caused by S. maltophilia may lead to a fulminant and lethal course in severely neutropenic patients with hematological neoplasms and to recognize which antibiotic agents are more sensitive to S. maltophilia in each institution.","['Department of Hematology, Kokura Memorial Hospital.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 22.,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are common early-onset malignancies. Their causes are largely unknown but infectious etiology has been implicated. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease for which infectious triggers of disease onset have been sought and increasing pointing to enteroviruses. Based on our previous results on co-morbidity between leukemia and T1D, we updated the Swedish dataset and focused on early onset leukemias in patients who had been hospitalized for T1D, comparing to those not hospitalized for T1D. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for leukemia in 24,052 patients hospitalized for T1D covering years 1964 through 2008. T1D patients were included if hospitalized before age 21 years. Practically all Swedish children and adolescents with T1D are hospitalized at the start of insulin treatment. SIR for ALL was 8.30 (N = 18, 95% confidence interval 4.91-13.14) when diagnosed at age 10 to 20 years after hospitalization for T1D and it was 3.51 (13, 1.86-6.02) before hospitalization for T1D. The SIR for ALL was 19.85 (N = 33, 13.74-27.76) and that for AML was 25.28 (8, 10.80-50.06) when the leukemias were diagnosed within the year of T1D hospitalization. The SIRs increased to 38.97 (26, 25.43-57.18) and 40.11 (8, 17.13-79.42) when T1D was diagnosed between ages 10 to 20 years. No consistent time-dependent changes were found in leukemia risk. CONCLUSION: A shared infectious etiology could be a plausible explanation to the observed co-morbidity. Other possible contributing factors could be insulin therapy or T1D related metabolic disturbances.","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. k.hemminki@dkfz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MESCs maintained with SB-216763 for one month were morphologically indistinguishable from LIF-treated mESCs and expressed pluripotent-specific genes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Furthermore, Nanog immunostaining was more homogenous in SB-216763-treated colonies compared to LIF. Embryoid bodies (EBs) prepared from these mESCs expressed early-stage markers for all three germ layers, and could efficiently differentiate into cardiac-like cells and MAP2-immunoreactive neurons. To our knowledge, SB-216763 is the first GSK3 inhibitor that can promote self-renewal of mESC co-cultured with MEFs for more than two months.","['Department of Biological Science, California State University-Fullerton, Fullerton, California, United States of America.']",,,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 22.,"Mutated tyrosine kinases are associated with a number of different haematological malignancies including myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. The potential commonalities in the action of six of these leukemogenic proteins on nuclear proteins were investigated using systematic proteomic analysis. The effects on over 3600 nuclear proteins and 1500 phosphopeptide sites were relatively quantified in seven isogenic cell lines. The effects of the kinases were diverse although some commonalities were found. Comparison of the nuclear proteomic data with transcriptome data and cytoplasmic proteomic data indicated that the major changes are due to post-translational mechanisms rather than changes in mRNA or protein distribution. Analysis of the promoter regions of genes whose protein levels changed in response to the kinases showed the most common binding site found was that for NFkappaB whilst other sites such as those for the glucocorticoid receptor were also found. Glucocorticoid receptor levels and phosphorylation were decreased by all 6 PTKs. Whilst Glucocorticoid receptor action can potentiate NFkappaB action those proteins where genes have NFkappaB binding sites were in often regulated post-translationally. However all 6 PTKs showed evidence of NFkB pathway modulation via activation via altered IkB and NFKB levels. Validation of a common change was also undertaken with PMS2, a DNA mismatch repair protein. PMS2 nuclear levels were decreased in response to the expression of all 6 kinases, with no concomitant change in mRNA level or cytosolic protein level. Response to thioguanine, that requires the mismatch repair pathway, was modulated by all 6 oncogenic kinases. In summary common targets for 6 oncogenic PTKs have been found that are regulated by post-translational mechanisms. They represent potential new avenues for therapies but also demonstrate the post-translational regulation is a key target of leukaemogenic kinases.","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,"['PLoS One. 2013;8(6). doi:10.1371/annotation/df82a4c0-2909-43a0-8a7f-5bd2ce9ca0bd.', ""O'Dea, Mark Aspinall [corrected to Aspinall-O'Dea, Mark]""]",,,,,,,,,,

To understand MLL-rearranged leukemia, several murine models for this disease have been established. However, the mouse leukemia derived from mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may not be fully comparable with human leukemia. Here we developed a humanized mouse model for human leukemia by transplanting human cord blood-derived HSCs transduced with an MLL-AF10 oncogene into a supra-immunodeficient mouse strain, NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2Rgamma(-/-) (NOG) mice. Injection of the MLL-AF10-transduced HSCs into the liver of NOG mice enhanced multilineage hematopoiesis, but did not induce leukemia. Because active mutations in ras genes are often found in MLL-related leukemia, we next transduced the gene for a constitutively active form of K-ras along with the MLL-AF10 oncogene. Eight weeks after transplantation, all the recipient mice had developed acute monoblastic leukemia (the M5 phenotype in French-American-British classification). We thus successfully established a human MLL-rearranged leukemia that was derived in vivo from human HSCs. In addition, since the enforced expression of the mutant K-ras alone was insufficient to induce leukemia, the present model may also be a useful experimental platform for the multi-step leukemogenesis model of human leukemia.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, chromosomal rearrangements can amplify, delete, or even fuse genes, altering their functions and contributing to malignant phenotypes. Using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), a technique to detect numeric variations between different DNA samples, we examined genomes from zebrafish (Danio rerio) T-cell leukemias of three cancer-prone lines. In all malignancies tested, we identified recurring amplifications of a zebrafish endogenous retrovirus. This retrovirus, ZFERV, was first identified due to high expression of proviral transcripts in thymic tissue from larval and adult fish. We confirmed ZFERV amplifications by quantitative PCR analyses of DNA from wild-type fish tissue and normal and malignant D. rerio T cells. We also quantified ZFERV RNA expression and found that normal and neoplastic T cells both produce retrovirally encoded transcripts, but most cancers show dramatically increased transcription. In aggregate, these data imply that ZFERV amplification and transcription may be related to T-cell leukemogenesis. Based on these data and ZFERV's phylogenetic relation to viruses of the murine-leukemia-related virus class of gammaretroviridae, we posit that ZFERV may be oncogenic via an insertional mutagenesis mechanism.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",,,"['K08 HD053350/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anticarcinogenic properties of garcinol appear to be moderated via its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and proapoptotic activities. In addition, garcinol displays effective epigenetic influence by inhibiting histone acetyltransferases (HAT 300) and by possible posttranscriptional modulation by mi RNA profiles involved in carcinogenesis. In vitro as well as some in vivo studies have shown the potential of this compound against several cancers types including breast, colon, pancreatic, and leukemia.

METHODS: The growth inhibition rate of K562/A02 cells was investigated by MTT assay, and apoptosis of cells and the intracellular daunorubicin concentration were detected by flow cytometry. Distribution of nanoparticles taken up by K562/A02 cells was observed under a transmission electron microscope and demonstrated by Prussian blue staining. The transcription level of MDR1 mRNA and expression of P-glycoprotein were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting assay, respectively. RESULTS: The reversible effect of daunorubicin-wogonin magnetic nanoparticles was 8.87-fold that of daunorubicin + wogonin and of daunorubicin magnetic nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy and Prussian blue staining revealed that the nanoparticles were located in the endosome vesicles of cytoplasm. Also, the apoptosis rate and accumulation of intracellular daunorubicin in the daunorubicin-wogonin magnetic nanoparticle group were significantly higher than that in the daunorubicin, daunorubicin + wogonin, and daunorubicin magnetic nanoparticle groups. Furthermore, transcription of MDR1 mRNA and expression of P-glycoprotein in K562/A02 cells were significantly downregulated in the daunorubicin-wogonin magnetic nanoparticle group compared with the other groups.

We examined a discovery cohort of 42 African American CLL patients ascertained at Duke University and found that the risk allele frequency of most single nucleotide polymorphisms known to confer risk of development for CLL is significantly lower among African Americans than whites. We then confirmed our results in a distinct cohort of 68 African American patients ascertained by the CLL Research Consortium. These results provide the first evidence supporting differential genetic risk for CLL between African Americans compared with whites. A fuller understanding of differential genetic risk may improve prognostication and therapeutic decision making for all CLL patients.","['Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.']",,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR02128/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08CA134919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA118444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA134919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no longitudinal study monitoring motor performance after cessation of treatment has been published. Whether sub-maximal exercise capacity is reduced is unknown. PROCEDURE: Motor performance of pediatric ALL survivors, treated with Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL-9 protocol was measured with the movement-ABC at stop treatment and >/=5 years later. At follow-up functional exercise capacity was also investigated using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Heart rate and oxygen saturation were measured with a portable pulse oximeter before and after the 6MWT. RESULTS: Nineteen boys and 15 girls, median age 12.3 years (range: 9.0-18.7), median time since completion of chemotherapy 5.2 years (5.0-7.1), participated. Mean height/age and weight/age were within the norm, whereas mean BMI/age was significantly increased (mean SDS 0.38, SEM 0.17, P = 0.04). Motor performance had improved significantly (P = 0.001). In contrast, functional exercise capacity at follow-up was significantly impaired (mean SDS -2.05, SEM 0.13, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: At >/=5 years after completion of ALL treatment motor performance had improved significantly, but functional exercise capacity was significantly impaired. The exact underlying cause of this late effect needs further study.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, 3015 GJ Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.hartman@erasmusmc.nl""]",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence of MBL in the general population with an age over 40 years is 3 to 5%. Subjects with MBL develop CLL requiring treatment at a rate of 1 to 2% per year. At the moment official guidelines with respect to MBL are not available in the Netherlands. On the basis of the available data, we will discuss the definitions of MBL , highlight clinical consequences and offer recommendations for daily practice. Individuals with clinically suspected MBL should undergo a complete evaluation by a haematologist. In case of CLL phenotype MBL , further annual follow-up can take place by the general practitioner.

Mutations in this gene affect disease progression and response to therapy, particularly in hematological disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNMT3A gene mutations affecting codon R882 are actively involved in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and cause abnormal alteration of DNA methylation and poor survival. In this study, we screened DNMT3A mutations in a total of 389 Chinese patients with hematological disease by sequencing the coding region of exon 23 covering residue R882. Three heterozygous mutations (p.R882S, p.R882C and p.R882H) were identified in three of 61 AML patients, whereas none of patients with other hematological disorders harbored any mutation. Our results support the notion that DNMT3A R882 was a frequent mutation in AML patients but rare in other types of hematological disorder.","['Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Kunming, Yunnan, China. yunlongli.km@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective was the effect of ESA administration on patient's quality of life (QoL). Secondary objectives were hemoglobin (Hb) recovery, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, overall survival, and event-free survival. METHODS: Adult patients with Hb </= 11 g/dL after consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (group 1), or after allo-HSCT for any hematological diseases (group 2), were prospectively included. ESA was administered subcutaneously once per week during a maximum period of 6 months and was stopped when Hb level reached 12 g/dL. A paired-matched analysis using a historical control group was performed for secondary endpoints. Fifty-two patients were included in group 1, and 55 patients were in group 2. RESULTS: For the global population, a significant improvement of QoL was noticed with ESA use; 83% (group 1) and 71% (group 2) of patients achieved an Hb level >/= 12 g/dL without transfusion requirement. The pair-matched analysis showed a reduction of 4 RBC units per patient in group 1 (P = .0002) and 3 RBC units per patient in group 2 (P = .04). No significant difference in terms of thromboembolic events, overall survival, and event-free survival was observed between ESA and control groups. A RBC transfusion median savings of euro1712 per patient was estimated in each group. CONCLUSIONS: ESAs have a clinical and economic benefit on Hb recovery, could improve a patient's QoL, and lead to a significant reduction in number of RBC transfusions with no effect on survival.","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France. mauricette.michallet@chu-lyon.fr']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred sixty-one eligible, previously untreated patients ages 16 to 82 years (median age, 40 years) were enrolled, and 33 (20%) were aged >/=60 years. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients (80%) achieved complete remission (CR). Dose intensification of daunorubicin and cytarabine was feasible. At a median follow-up of 10.4 years for surviving patients, the 5-year DFS rate was 25% (95% confidence interval, 18%-33%), and the overall survival (OS) rate was 30% (95% confidence interval, 23%-37%). Patients aged <60 years who received the 80 mg/m(2) dose of daunorubicin had a DFS of 33% (95% confidence interval, 22%-44%) and an OS of 39% (95% confidence interval, 29%-49%) at 5 years. Eighty-four patients (52%) relapsed, including 9 patients (6%) who had isolated CNS relapses. The omission of cranial irradiation did not result in higher than historic CNS relapse rates. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive systemic, oral, and intrathecal methotrexate dosing permitted the omission of CNS irradiation in adult patients with ALL. This intensive approach using higher doses of daunorubicin and cytarabine failed to result in an overall improvement in DFS or OS compared with historic CALGB studies.

We studied a group of children and found that BMC sidedness gradually increased up to the age of 6 years and then remained stable into late adolescence. INTRODUCTION: Bone mineral content (BMC) exhibits sidedness in the arms after the age of 8 years, but it is not known whether BMC is greater in the dominant arm from birth or whether lateralization develops in early childhood. To address this, we examined bone mineral status in relation to handedness and age. METHODS: Subjects (N = 158) were children recently initiating glucocorticoids for underlying disease (leukemia 43 %, rheumatic conditions 39 %, nephrotic syndrome 18 %). Handedness was determined by questionnaire and BMC by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Median age was 7.2 years (range, 1.5 to 17.0 years), 49 % was male, and the spine BMD Z-score was -0.9 (SD, 1.3). By linear regression, BMC sidedness in the arms was significantly related to age (r = 0.294, p = 0.0005). Breakpoint analysis revealed two lines with a knot at 6.0 years (95 % CI, 4.5-7.5 years). The formula for the first line was: dominant:nondominant arm BMC ratio = 0.029 x age [in years] + 0.850 (r = 0.323, p = 0.017). The slope of the second line was not different from 0 (p = 0.332), while the slopes for the two lines were significantly different (p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that arm BMC sidedness in this patient group develops up to age 6 years and then remains stable into late adolescence. This temporal profile is consistent with mechanical stimulation of the skeleton in response to asymmetrical muscle use as handedness becomes manifest.","['University of Alberta, 6628-123 Street, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6H 3T6. kerrygs@telusplanet.net']",,,['64285-1/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada'],['CAMS4556'],,,,,,,,['NLM: CAMS4556'],['Canadian STOPP Consortium National Pediatric Bone Health Working Group'],,,"['Kloiber R', 'Lewis V', 'Midgley J', 'Miettunen P', 'Stephure D', 'Lentle BC', 'Cabral D', 'Houghton DB', 'Nadel HR', 'Hay J', 'Duffy C', 'Feber J', 'Halton J', 'Jurencak R', 'Matzinger M', 'Roth J', 'Shenouda N', 'Ward LM', 'Cairney E', 'Clarson C', 'Filler G', 'Grimmer J', 'McKillop S', 'Sparrow K', 'Stein R', 'Cummings E', 'Fernandez C', 'Huber AM', 'Lang B', ""O'Brien K"", 'Arora S', 'Atkinson S', 'Barr R', 'Coblentz C', 'Dent PB', 'Larche M', 'Webber C', 'Abish S', 'Bell L', 'LeBlanc C', 'Rodd C', 'Scuccimarri R', 'Moher D', 'Ramsay T', 'Glorieux F', 'Rauch F', 'Alos N', 'Dubois J', 'Laverdiere C', 'Phan V', 'Saint-Cyr C', 'Couch R', 'Ellsworth J', 'Pinsk M', 'Siminoski K', 'Wilson B', 'Gaboury I', 'Charron M', 'Hebert D', 'Grant R', 'Blydt-Hansen T', 'Israels S', 'Oen K', 'Reed M', 'Taback S']","['Kloiber, Reinhard', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Midgley, Julian', 'Miettunen, Paivi', 'Stephure, David', 'Lentle, Brian C', 'Cabral, David', 'Houghton, David B Dix Kristin', 'Nadel, Helen R', 'Hay, John', 'Duffy, Ciaran', 'Feber, Janusz', 'Halton, Jacqueline', 'Jurencak, Roman', 'Matzinger, MaryAnn', 'Roth, Johannes', 'Shenouda, Nazih', 'Ward, Leanne M', 'Cairney, Elizabeth', 'Clarson, Cheril', 'Filler, Guido', 'Grimmer, Joanne', 'McKillop, Scott', 'Sparrow, Keith', 'Stein, Robert', 'Cummings, Elizabeth', 'Fernandez, Conrad', 'Huber, Adam M', 'Lang, Bianca', ""O'Brien, Kathy"", 'Arora, Steve', 'Atkinson, Stephanie', 'Barr, Ronald', 'Coblentz, Craig', 'Dent, Peter B', 'Larche, Maggie', 'Webber, Colin', 'Abish, Sharon', 'Bell, Lorraine', 'LeBlanc, Claire', 'Rodd, Celia', 'Scuccimarri, Rosie', 'Moher, David', 'Ramsay, Tim', 'Glorieux, Francis', 'Rauch, Frank', 'Alos, Nathalie', 'Dubois, Josee', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Phan, Veronique', 'Saint-Cyr, Claire', 'Couch, Robert', 'Ellsworth, Janet', 'Pinsk, Maury', 'Siminoski, Kerry', 'Wilson, Beverly', 'Gaboury, Isabelle', 'Charron, Martin', 'Hebert, Diane', 'Grant, Ronald', 'Blydt-Hansen, Tom', 'Israels, Sara', 'Oen, Kiem', 'Reed, Martin', 'Taback, Shayne']",,,,

At each checkpoint, whether a thymocyte survives or dies is determined by antiapoptotic and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. We used Mcl-1 transgenic (tg) mice to investigate the impact of elevated expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 on thymocyte apoptosis and selection, making a side-by-side comparison with thymocytes from BCL-2tg mice. Mcl-1 was as effective as Bcl-2 at protecting thymocytes against spontaneous cell death, diverse cytotoxic insults and TCR-CD3 stimulation-driven apoptosis. In three different TCR tg models, Mcl-1 markedly enhanced positive selection of thymocytes, as did Bcl-2. In H-Y TCR tg mice, elevated Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 were equally effective at inhibiting deletion of autoreactive thymocytes. However, in the OT-1tg model where deletion is mediated by a peripheral antigen whose expression is regulated by Aire, Mcl-1 was less effective than Bcl-2. Thus, the capacity of Mcl-1 overexpression to inhibit apoptosis triggered by TCR stimulation apparently depends on the thymocyte subset subject to deletion, presumably due to differences in the profiles of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members mediating the deletion.","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.']",,,"['R01 CA043540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late complications of their treatment are well documented and include cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, endocrine dysfunction and second malignancy. Research exploring appropriate surveillance for these complications is lacking. However, evidence to support surveillance is mounting and many are publishing consensus-based guidelines recommending surveillance for these anticipated complications.

Epub 2012 May 30.,"t(17;19)-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) shows extremely poor prognosis. E2A-HLF derived from t(17;19) blocks apoptosis induced by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and has a central role in leukemogenesis and chemoresistance. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is expressed on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells and binds with death receptors (DR4/DR5), inducing apoptosis by dual activation of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, and TRAIL mediates the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). We found that cell lines and patients' samples of t(17;19)-ALL expressed death receptors for TRAIL, and recombinant soluble TRAIL immediately induced apoptosis into t(17;19)-ALL cell lines. E2A-HLF induced gene expression of DR4/DR5, which was dependent on the DNA-binding and transactivation activities of E2A-HLF through the 5' upstream region of the start site at least in the DR4 gene. Introduction of E2A-HLF into non-t(17;19)-ALL cell line upregulated DR4 and DR5 expression, and sensitized to proapoptotic activity of recombinant soluble TRAIL.

Epub 2012 Jun 1.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent lymphoid malignancy in the elderly of the Western world. Although treatment options have improved over the past two decades, 10-15% of patients still have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to therapy. Aberrations in the p53 pathway, such as a deleted (del17p13) or mutated p53 gene, are highly enriched in this class of patients. In an extensive screen for p53-independent apoptosis inducers, actinomycin D was identified from 1496 substances and shown to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells derived from high-risk patients including those with aberrant p53, revealing a novel p53-independent mechanism of action. Both pro-survival genes BCL2 and MCL1 are targeted by actinomycin D, in contrast to fludarabine the backbone of current treatment schedules. In the well-established TCL1 transgenic mouse model for high-risk CLL, actinomycin D treatment was more effective in reducing tumor load than fludarabine, with no evidence of resistance after three treatment cycles and an overall survival increase of over 300%. Tumor load reduction was coupled to BCL2 downregulation. Our results identify the clinically approved compound actinomycin D as a potentially valuable treatment option for CLL high-risk patients.","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectiology of the Paracelsus Medical University Hospital, Salzburg, Austria. o.merkel@salk.at']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jun 26.,"Consumers are exposed daily to several pesticide residues in food, which can be of potential concern for human health. Based on a previous study dealing with exposure of the French population to pesticide residues via the food, we selected 14 pesticides frequently found in foodstuffs, on the basis of their persistence in the environment or their bioaccumulation in the food chain. In a first step, the objective of this study was to investigate if the 14 selected pesticides were potentially cytotoxic and genotoxic. For this purpose, we used a new and sensitive genotoxicity assay (the gammaH2AX test, involving phosphorylation of histone H2AX) with four human cell lines (ACHN, SH-SY5Y, LS-174T and HepG2), each originating from a potential target tissue of food contaminants (kidney, nervous system, colon, and liver, respectively). Tebufenpyrad was the only compound identified as genotoxic and the effect was only observed in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell-line. A time-course study showed that DNA damage appeared early after treatment (1h), suggesting that oxidative stress could be responsible for the induction of gammaH2AX. In a second step, three other pesticides were studied, i.e. bixafen, fenpyroximate and tolfenpyrad, which - like tebufenpad - also had a methyl-pyrazole structure. All these compounds demonstrated genotoxic activity in SH-SY5Y cells at low concentration (nanomolar range). Complementary experiments demonstrated that the same compounds show genotoxicity in a human T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat). Moreover, we observed an increased production of reactive oxygen species in Jurkat cells in the presence of the four methyl-pyrazoles. These results demonstrate that tebufenpyrad, bixafen, fenpyroximat and tolfenpyrad induce DNA damage in human cell lines, very likely by a mode of action that involves oxidative stress. Nonetheless, additional in vivo data are required before a definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding hazard prediction to humans.","['INRA, UMR1331, Toxalim, Research Centre in Food Toxicology, F-31027 Toulouse, France.']",,['(c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report that besides the well-established function of Foxo3a as a transcriptional regulator of multiple target genes in nucleus, a substantial fraction of Foxo3a translocates to mitochondria leading to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and caspase activation during erythroid differentiation mediated by guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP). In fact, non transcriptional role of Foxo3a in mitochondria was achieved through the protein-protein interaction with pro-apoptotic protein Bax and its translocation to mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, our results revealed that mitochondrial localization of Foxo3a was modulated by intracellular GTP content which is sensed by PKC signaling element. Collectively, our findings provided insight into a novel Foxo3a mechanism in leukemia cells which led to engagement of cells in the maturation pathway.","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, PO Box 13145-1384, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2012 Jun 27.,"MOTIVATION: Large public repositories of gene expression measurements offer the opportunity to position a new experiment into the context of earlier studies. While previous methods rely on experimental annotation or global similarity of expression profiles across genes or gene sets, we compare experiments by measuring similarity based on an unsupervised, data-driven regulatory model around pre-specified genes of interest. Our experiment retrieval approach is novel in two conceptual respects: (i) targetable focus and interpretability: the analysis is targeted at regulatory relationships of genes that are relevant to the analyst or come from prior knowledge; (ii) regulatory model-based similarity measure: related experiments are retrieved based on the strength of inferred regulatory links between genes. RESULTS: We learn a model for the regulation of specific genes from a data repository and exploit it to construct a similarity metric for an information retrieval task. We use the Fisher kernel, a rigorous similarity measure that typically has been applied to use generative models in discriminative classifiers. Results on human and plant microarray collections indicate that our method is able to substantially improve the retrieval of related experiments against standard methods. Furthermore, it allows the user to interpret biological conditions in terms of changes in link activity patterns. Our study of the osmotic stress network for Arabidopsis thaliana shows that the method successfully identifies relevant relationships around given key genes.

Although long known as a disease with an inexorable progression to acute leukemia, CML history has been significantly improved by the use of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of CML by transforming it from an invariably fatal disease to a chronic but manageable condition. In fact, the discovery of this class of targeted therapy had an impact not only on the survival of CML patients but also on other scientific and medical fields. This review illustrates the impact of imatinib, the first example of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the treatment of CML, on the treatment of other cancers, the impact on health systems and on the scientific research in general.","['Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Liban. rn03@aub.edu.lb']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We also examined the relation of these features with patient's outcome. RESULTS: Among 19 cases, 4 had a microgranular morphology, 7 presented PB leukocytes >10x109/l, 2 had FLT3-ITD and 3 had FLT3-TKD (all three presenting a methylated CDKN2B). NPM1 mutation was not observed. PB leukocyte count showed an inverse relation with standard deviation of gray levels, contrast, cluster prominence, and chromatin fractal dimension (FD). Cases with FLT3-ITD presented a microgranular morphology, PB leukocytosis and expression of HLA-DR, CD34 and CD11b. Concerning nuclear chromatin texture variables, these cases had a lower entropy, contrast, cluster prominence and FD, but higher local homogeneity, and R245, in keeping with more homogeneously distributed chromatin. In the univariate Cox analysis, a higher leukocyte count, FLT3-ITD mutation, microgranular morphology, methylation of CDKN2B, besides a higher local homogeneity of nuclear chromatin, a lower chromatin entropy and FD were associated to a worse outcome. All these features lost significance when the cases were stratified for FLT3-ITD mutation. Methylation status of CDNK2A and TP73 showed no relation to patient's survival. CONCLUSION: in APL, patients with FLT3-ITD mutation show different clinical characteristics and have blasts with a more homogeneous chromatin texture. Texture analysis demonstrated that FLTD-ITD was accompanied not only by different cytoplasmic features, but also by a change in chromatin structure in routine cytologic preparations. Yet we were not able to detect chromatin changes by nuclear texture analysis of patients with the FTLD-TKD or methylation of specific genes.","['State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapies that enhance NK cytotoxicity may therefore prove valuable in remission-induction and maintenance treatment regimens. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has previously been considered resistant to NK cell lysis and not tractable to this approach. Our study demonstrates that bortezomib, valproate and troglitazone can up-regulate NK activating ligands on a B-ALL cell line and on a proportion but not all adult primary B-ALL samples. Drug-treated ALL cells trigger higher levels of NK degranulation, as measured by CD107a expression, and this effect is dependent on signaling through the NK activating receptor NKG2D. These results suggest that bortezomib, valproate and troglitazone may have clinical utility in sensitizing ALL to NK mediated lysis in vivo.","['Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.

These include lung leukostasis, leukemic lung infiltration, the cell lysis pneumopathy and the secondary alveolar proteinosis. These were the subject of a review in the Revue des Maladies Respiratoires published in 2010. We wished to review the management of these clinical situations, the severity of which mean patients frequently require intensive care unit admission.

Previous studies have found drug resistance in human leukemia is mainly associated with overexpression of the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1). The aim of the present study was to investigate the modulation of P-glycoprotein expression by triptolide in adriamycin-resistant K562/A02 cells. The reverse effects of triptolide on drug resistance in K562/A02 cells were assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The percentage of apoptotic cells was obtained from annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propridium iodide (PI) double-staining. The effects of triptolide on P-glycoprotein activity were evaluated by measuring intracellular adriamycin accumulation. The expression of P-glycoprotein was determined by flow cytometry. A luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect the transcriptional activity of the MDR1 promoter. Results revealed that triptolide decreased the degree of resistance of K562/A02 cells, and significantly inhibited P-glycoprotein expression and drug-transport function, and increased the accumulation of adriamycin in K562/A02 cells as measured by flow cytometry. A luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that triptolide was capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the MDR1 promoter. Triptolide may effectively reverse the adriamycin resistance in K562/A02 cells via modulation of the P-glycoprotein expression and by increasing intracellular adriamycin accumulation.","[""Department of Central Laboratory, The Affiliated People's Hospital, Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, P.R.

No significant differences were observed in the levels of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells, IL-2, IL-10 or TGF-beta in B-ALL versus T-ALL patients. The authors concluded that CD19 and CD7 may serve as diagnostic markers of B-ALL and T-ALL, respectively. The increased presence of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells and the altered levels of secreted cytokines are indicative of an immunosuppressive mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALL.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College, Haikou, Hainan 570102, P.R.

Epub 2011 Nov 8.,"Urea derivatives have been widely used in biology and medicine. The substituted urea derivative URD12 introduced in this study exhibits cytotoxic activity against the K562 human leukemia and KB human mouth epidermal carcinoma cell lines. To further study the bioactivity of URD12 and examine its feasibility as a new antitumor drug, we applied in vivo and in vitro assays to investigate the antitumor activity of URD12. URD12 was prepared and its cytotoxicity was evaluated using the BGC-823 human gastric carcinoma, MGC-803 human gastric carcinoma, SMMC-7721 human hepatoma and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using MTT assays. Antitumor activity in vivo was confirmed in mice bearing H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Organ coefficient was used to further elucidate the cytotoxic mechanisms of URD12. URD12 inhibited the growth of tested tumor cell lines in vitro and the growth of H22 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo with no effects on the weight, spleen and thymus coefficient of tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that URD12 is an effective antitumor agent without evident immunosuppression effects.","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, P.R.
