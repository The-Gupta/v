Recently, activation of cellular oncogenes has been shown to be associated with leukemia in humans. Relatively few studies of oncogene activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been reported. In most instances, rearrangement of oncogenes has not been detected. Exceptions include the bcl-1 oncogene in B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, the tcl-1 oncogene in T-cell CLL, the Hu-ets-1 and Hu-ets-2 oncogenes in small cell lymphocytic lymphoma and c-myc in a Sezary cell leukemia cell/line. Overall, it appears that oncogene abnormalities are less common in CLL than in other leukemias. The reason for it is uncertain and may relate to the relatively few cases evaluated. Alternatively, novel mechanisms of oncogene involvement or gene other than oncogenes may be important in the etiology or pathogenesis of CLL.","['Butturini, A', 'Gale, R P']","['Butturini A', 'Gale RP']","['Department of Pediatrics, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', '*Oncogenes']",24,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(98)80013-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(1):89-92. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)80013-1.,,,,,,,,,

Gross and Y. Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo.

The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.","['Gross, L', 'Dreyfuss, Y', 'Faraggiana, T']","['Gross L', 'Dreyfuss Y', 'Faraggiana T']","['Cancer Research Unit, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10468.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sex Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 May 1;48(9):2451-3.,,,,,,,,,

All FVC-P injected mice were dead within 40 days; however, infected mice receiving TBI on days 5 and 12 exhibited long-term survival. FVC-P-injected mice receiving TBI treatment on days 5 and 12 had normal leukocyte counts, normal spleen weights, and no detectable spleen focus-forming virus. Although the FVC-P-infected mice had decreased proportions of L3T4+ cells and increased proportions of Lyt-2+ cells, these were returned to normal following TBI treatment. Apparently the time sequence of TBI treatments is important since one treatment with TBI on day 5, or two treatments with TBI on days 12 and 18, was not as efficacious. The inability of in vitro irradiation doses of up to 1000 cGy to inactivate FVC-P which was subsequently injected into murine hosts suggests that the effectiveness of the TBI treatment in vivo is not due to a direct radiation effect on the virus.

By life table analysis, 70% to 78% of patients with a favorable prognosis would remain in continuous complete remission (CCR) at 4 years if treated with HDMTX. Uniformly lower CCR rates could be expected with RTSC, especially in St Jude better-risk patients. HDMTX also would show greater efficacy than RTSC in the CCG average-risk and POG poor-risk groups, but the results appear inferior to those being achieved with intensified regimens for high-risk leukemia. Although both therapies would provide adequate CNS prophylaxis in favorable-risk groups, RTSC would offer greater protection in patients classified as being in a worse-risk group by St Jude criteria.

Ideal treatment to completely eliminate residual disease following remission is not yet known. In most series, only one out of three patients are long-term survivors of this disease. Recent advances in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and improved techniques for autologous engraftment leave promise for significant improvements in postinduction disease control. Biologic studies of surface immunophenotype have contributed to our understanding of the heterogeneity of this family of disorders and allowed identification and characterization of leukemias of mixed myeloid/lymphoid lineage. Karyotype studies have identified important subsets of ANLL with distinctive clinical and biologic properties, for which tailored therapies someday may be developed. In addition, studies of oncogenes provide insight into regulation of leukemic hematopoiesis with potential of identifying future methods to regulate proliferation of the leukemic clone.","['Kalwinsky, D K', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Dahl, G V']","['Kalwinsky DK', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Dahl GV']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Ann,Pediatric annals,0356657,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",48,1988/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3928/0090-4481-19880301-07 [doi]'],ppublish,"Pediatr Ann. 1988 Mar;17(3):172-6, 179-90. doi: 10.3928/0090-4481-19880301-07.",,['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The exact cause is unknown, but some genetic, immunologic, viral, and environmental factors have been implicated. Symptoms at the time of diagnosis frequently include fever, bleeding, fatigue, and irritability. Initial white blood cell count and patient age at diagnosis are the most reliable indicators of prognosis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a heterogenous disease. Lymphoblast morphology, immunologic markers, enzyme abnormalities, cytogenetic findings, and staining characteristics in conjunction with clinical characteristics allow classification into risk groups. Appropriate therapy for each risk group is based on these parameters. Combination chemotherapy administered alone or with additional chemotherapy or radiotherapy to sanctuary sites is the principal modality for treatment of ALL. Optimal therapy for relapse has not yet been determined, but for patients with appropriate donors, allogeneic bone marrow transplant is promising. Common complications of chemotherapy include tumor lysis syndrome, myelosuppression, and other problems such as gastrointestinal toxicity, neurotoxicity and cardiac toxicity. Significant late effects of chemotherapy include neurological impairment ranging from learning problems to leukoencephalopathy and a possible increased risk of second malignancy. Complete remission is achieved in 95% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and more than 55% will continue to be in complete remission at five years. Optimal CNS prophylaxis, effective treatment of relapse, and adjustment of therapy to minimize acute and late adverse effects are a continuing challenge. With improved understanding of biologic factors, and development of more specific therapy for each subgroup, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia should enjoy a better long term outcome.","['Diamond, C A', 'Matthay, K K']","['Diamond CA', 'Matthay KK']","['University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Ann,Pediatric annals,0356657,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",15,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3928/0090-4481-19880301-06 [doi]'],ppublish,"Pediatr Ann. 1988 Mar;17(3):156-61, 164-70. doi: 10.3928/0090-4481-19880301-06.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,

We observed a small difference in half-life between F4-12B2 and MOPC-31C c-myb mRNA (175 min and 105 min, respectively) insufficient to account for the approximately 20-fold lower levels of this transcript in myelomas. Using the run-on transcription assay we found that c-myb transcripts were initiated at similar rates in all three cell types and were elongated at this relatively high rate to a site approximately 2 kilobases into the first intron. NIH3T3 c-myb transcripts did not proceed detectably beyond this pause/attenuation site, while in F4-12B2 cells transcription of regions 3' of this site occurred at a rate approximately 12-fold greater than in MOPC-31C. We have concluded that this transcriptional arrest mechanism, together with small differences in RNA turnover, were sufficient to account for the spectrum of c-myb mRNA abundance observed. Despite evidence of transcript initiation, we were unable to detect c-myb mRNA in fibroblasts, even under conditions (e.g. serum stimulation) which induced high c-myc mRNA levels. However, a novel 3.0 kilobase transcript with homology to c-myb was detected in cycloheximide-treated NIH3T3 cells.","['Watson, R J']",['Watson RJ'],"[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1988 Mar;2(3):267-72.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,

Direct inhibition of c-myc expression with the anti-myc oligomer was associated with a decreased cell growth rate and an induction of myeloid differentiation. Related antisense oligomers with 2- to 12-base-pair mismatches with c-myc mRNA did not influence HL-60 cells. Thus, the effects of the antisense oligomer exhibited sequence specificity, and furthermore, these effects could be reversed by hybridization competition with another complementary oligomer.

Lineage association is known to exist between p53 expression and normal lymphopoiesis, but not myelopoiesis. We studied the expression of p53 using chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines, somatic hybrids of these cells, and leukemic cells from CML patients. Lymphoid CML lines expressed both p53 mRNA and protein. We also analyzed p53 synthesis by two B-lymphoid lines from the same CML patient; cells of one line were derived from the neoplastic clone, cells of the other were derived from the normal clone. Both synthesized equal amounts of a phosphorylated p53 protein. None of the myeloid CML lines expressed detectable p53 protein and two of four expressed negligible p53 mRNA. Two other myeloid CML lines and myeloid cells from three of four patients expressed p53 mRNA. These findings suggest that expression of the gene is not regulated normally in CML.

Southern blot analyses showed no gross alterations in the p53 gene from cells of either the expressing or the nonexpressing lines. No difference in the pattern of demethylated CpG sites was noted in the region of the p53 gene in cells from K562 (myeloid p53 nonexpressor) and in BV173 (lymphoid p53 expressor). The sites of demethylation clustered in and around the p53 promoter in both cell lines. Somatic hybrids formed between a p53 mRNA nonexpressor myeloid line (K562) and the parental p53 expressor lymphoid lines (Daudi, PUT) produced p53 mRNA and protein, suggesting that p53 is a dominantly expressed protein and that lack of expression in myeloid cells is not mediated by a trans-acting negative regulatory protein. DNA transfection experiments performed using the indicator gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase attached to promoter sequences of p53 showed that these constructs were equally activated in BV173 (p53 expressor) and K562 (p53 mRNA nonexpressor). The mechanism of p53 regulation in CML remains unclear.","['Lubbert, M', 'Miller, C W', 'Crawford, L', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Lubbert M', 'Miller CW', 'Crawford L', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA Medical Center 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Blast Crisis/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.167.3.873 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Mar 1;167(3):873-86. doi: 10.1084/jem.167.3.873.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']","['CA-26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2188905,,,,

Four patterns of DNA distribution were identified, but only histograms that demonstrated cells containing nuclei with more than 4C DNA content (hypertetraploidy) reliably distinguished LN involved with CTCL from LN with reactive changes; for example, dermatopathic lymphadenitis. An abnormal DNA histogram with evidence of hypertetraploidy was demonstrated in 9 of 12 LN showing histopathologic evidence of involvement compared with no abnormal histograms in 14 LN without histopathologic involvement. One LN that was diffusely involved with CTCL had a DNA distribution characteristic of a relatively high level of cell proliferation, but without definite hypertetraploidy. Cytogenetic studies on the blood of this patient, who had Sezary syndrome, demonstrated a clone of lymphocytes with a pseudodiploid karyotype without a related polyploid subline. The remaining two histopathologically involved LN had normal DNA histograms; these LN were only focally involved with CTCL.

Human recombinant IL-1 and murine recombinant TRF/IL-5 were used in this study. Purified B cells from non-primed or antigen-primed mice, LPS-stimulated B-cell blasts, and chronic B-cell leukaemia (BCL1) cells were used as the responding B-cell population. Addition of IL-1 to the culture of normal B-cells and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) induced a dose-dependent anti-SRBC IgM response, with maximal response at 100 U/ml, whereas the response induced by TRF/IL-5 was less than that induced by IL-1 and did not reach the maximum even at 100 U/ml. Addition of anti-IL-1 antibody, but not anti-TRF/IL-5 antibody or anti-IL-2 receptor antibody, inhibited IL-1-induced anti-SRBC responses. Depletion of cells adherent to Sephadex beads from splenic B cells showed no significant effect on the magnitude of the total responses. IL-1 could induce little, if any, differentiation in antigen-primed B cells, LPS-stimulated B-cell blasts, or BCL1 cells into antibody-secreting cells, whereas differentiation could be induced by low doses of TRF/IL-5 (1-2 U/ml). Of great interest is that suboptimal doses of IL-1 (10 U/ml) could synergize with TRF in the primary anti-SRBC PFC responses. Kinetic studies revealed that IL-1 acts on B cells for the first 2 days and TRF/IL-5 for the last 3 days in 5-day cultures of B cells. These results suggest that IL-1 acts primarily on resting B cells as a differentiation-inducing factor in the presence of antigen, and also acts as a 'priming' factor for TRF/IL-5.","['Koyama, N', 'Harada, N', 'Takahashi, T', 'Mita, S', 'Okamura, H', 'Tominaga, A', 'Takatsu, K']","['Koyama N', 'Harada N', 'Takahashi T', 'Mita S', 'Okamura H', 'Tominaga A', 'Takatsu K']","['Department of Biology, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody-Producing Cells/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1988 Feb;63(2):277-83.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukins)']",,,,PMC1454512,,,,

Absorption of ketoconazole is variable after oral administration, with large variability in peak serum concentrations. Antacids reduce, and food or dilute hydrochloric acid increase, absorption. Renal failure and bone marrow transplantation are associated with reduced absorption. Ketoconazole is not absorbed systemically after topical administration, and minimally absorbed from the vagina. Distribution of ketoconazole varies according to the tissue sampled, the underlying disease and the dose and duration of treatment. Ketoconazole does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier, and crosses to only a limited extent in fungal meningitis. Urinary concentrations of ketoconazole are usually low, but vaginal and vaginal tissue concentrations correlate with those in serum. Seminal fluid concentrations are inadequate for treatment of epididymitis. Ketoconazole is 83.7% plasma protein (mainly albumin) bound, and 15.3% is erythrocyte bound, resulting in only 1% of free drug. Animal studies indicate strong binding to the cytochrome P-450 mono-oxygenase complex. Extensive metabolism to inactive metabolites occurs, the products being mainly excreted in the faeces. Saturable hepatic first-pass metabolism is probable. The half-life of ketoconazole is dose-dependent, increases during long term treatment, suggesting auto-inhibition of metabolism. The kinetics after oral administration fit a 2-compartment model.

Examining fractionated mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood, an N-ras mutation at position 13 was observed in one patient with overt leukemia, resulting in a base change from GGT to TGT thus converting glycine to cysteine. The other cases exhibited no ras gene mutations. It is surprising that c-ras mutations are only occasionally observed in overt acute nonlymphocytic leukemia related to treatment with alkylating agents, as such abnormalities have often been observed in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia de novo, and as many alkylating agents are known to produce DNA adducts leading to point mutations and substitution of single amino acids. The fact that deletions of varying parts of the long arms of chromosomes 5 and 7 are observed in most cases of therapy-related acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and preleukemia, as confirmed by our own series of 71 patients, suggests that loss of heterozygosity for specific alleles on the two chromosomes, rather than activation of a protooncogene, could be an important step in leukemogenesis.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Janssen, W G', 'Lyons, J', 'Philip, P', 'Bartram, C R']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Janssen WG', 'Lyons J', 'Philip P', 'Bartram CR']","['Department of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Finsen Institute-Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Genes, ras', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Preleukemia/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",,1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Apr 1;48(7):1812-7.,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen patients, 3-45 years of age, who had an HLA-identical sibling donor, received bone marrow transplantation. Twenty-five patients who either lacked an HLA-identical sibling or were over 45 years of age received intensive consolidation chemotherapy including high-dose cytosine arabinoside with or without adriamycin. The actuarial rate of continued complete remission (CCR) at 3 years was significantly higher in the transplantation group than in the chemotherapy group: 70% (95% confidence interval 35-91%) compared with 10% (95% confidence interval 2-30%); P = 0.01. However, the actuarial rate of CCR was not significantly different between the transplantation group and patients under 45 years in the chemotherapy group: 70% (95% confidence interval 35-91%) compared with 17% (95% confidence interval 4-45%), 0.1 greater than P greater than 0.05. The actuarial probability of leukaemia relapse was significantly lower in the transplantation group than in the chemotherapy group: 10% (95% confidence interval 4-21%) compared with 88% (95% confidence interval 70-96%), 0.005 greater than P greater than 0.001. There was no significant difference between both groups if we compare only the patients who died of non-leukaemic causes: 22% (95% confidence interval 9-42%) versus 25% (95% confidence interval 7-59%), P = NS. In summary, this study shows that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a better anti-leukaemic treatment than is intensive consolidation chemotherapy in patients with AML in first complete remission.","['Conde, E', 'Iriondo, A', 'Rayon, C', 'Richard, C', 'Fanjul, E', 'Garijo, J', 'Hermosa, V', 'Coma, A', 'Bello, C', 'Carrera, D']","['Conde E', 'Iriondo A', 'Rayon C', 'Richard C', 'Fanjul E', 'Garijo J', 'Hermosa V', 'Coma A', 'Bello C', 'Carrera D', 'et al.']","['Haematology Department, Hospital Nacional Marques de Valdecilla, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06193.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Feb;68(2):219-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06193.x.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,

Involved frozen biopsy tissue specimens from eight cases of intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma/mantle zone lymphoma (ILL/MZL); eight cases of follicular centre cell lymphomas (FCCL) of the centroblastic/centrocytic type; and seven cases of well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (WDLL) consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were analysed immunohistologically with R4/23 (DRC-1) monoclonal antibody reactive with 'bystander' DRCs. As opposed to FCCL and most WDLL/CLL cases, the DRCs consistently formed a loose, ill-defined meshwork with a radiating or blurred outline in all MZL cases and one ILL. On the basis of the observed findings as well as from those reported in literature, the hypothesis is proposed that ILL/MZL originates from the follicular mantle zone and represents a distinct lymphoma entity owing to its peculiar immunostaining pattern of DRCs that allows it to be separated from both FCCL and WDLL/CLL. Moreover, the absence of DRCs in the microenvironment of other B-cell malignancies such as prolymphocytic leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia, analogously with most CLL cases, would speak in favour of their different--possibly extrafollicular--compartment of origin within lymphoid tissue.","['Manconi, R', 'Poletti, A', 'Volpe, R', 'Sulfaro, S', 'Carbone, A']","['Manconi R', 'Poletti A', 'Volpe R', 'Sulfaro S', 'Carbone A']","['Division of Pathology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Mononuclear Phagocyte System/pathology']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06192.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Feb;68(2):213-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06192.x.,,,,,,,,,

The paralytogenic property is attributed to direct viral injury to motor neurons and glial cells and is associated with unique amino acids in the murine leukemia virus envelope gp70. This murine model may have relevance to both human T-lymphotropic virus type I, and human immunodeficiency virus infection of human brain. It presents a practical model for testing antiviral agents aimed at retrovirus infection of the mammalian central nervous system. Simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome type D retrovirus causes a silent infection of the brain in infected macaques. Viral nucleic acids are detected in the brain parenchyma in the absence of viral antigen, neurological symptoms, and neuropathology. Infected choroid plexus epithelial cells are the source of cell-free virus in the cerebrospinal fluid of viremic monkeys.

Our findings suggest that the number of chromosomes in an abnormal clone may be unreliable for distinguishing between lymphoid and myeloid BC.

However, this balanced reciprocal t(9;22) is probably not the primary event in the pathogenesis of this disease, at least at a cytogenetic level. The cause of Ph variants in +/- 5% of patients is still unknown. Improvements in cytogenetic techniques and molecular studies in a limited number of cases indicate that simple variants do not exist: Region 9q34 appears to be involved in all types of Ph variants. There is tentative evidence that these variants may in fact represent a clonal evolution from a standard t(9;22). The types of additional secondary abnormalities found in Ph variants are the same as those commonly found in standard cases. Ph negative CML represents a heterogeneous group of myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders. The various mechanisms that could lead to Ph negativity are discussed. Some karyotypically normal cases and those showing a chromosome abnormality other than the Ph during the chronic phase have shown the same molecular changes as found in Ph positive CML. The types of clonal changes accompanying transformation to an acute phase are similar to those seen in myeloid disorders as a whole. The prognostic karyotypic factors in predicting imminent metamorphosis to the acute stage and during the acute phase are discussed. The extent of clonal evolution, the type of secondary abnormalities, and their relationship to the hematopoietic lineage of blast cells should be assessed. The nonrandom clonal changes found in 80% of cases are +Ph, +8, i(17q), +19, and loss of the Y. The significance of +Ph is possibly related to amplification of the bcr/abl fusion gene product, but the reason for the other persistent nonrandom changes is still speculative. Recent cytogenetic data indicate that the specific changes observed in various types of ANLL may be seen in corresponding types of MT, such as t(15;17) in promyelocytic transformations and abnormalities of 3q21-3q26 in megakaryoblastic transformations. Patients with LT usually have an early precursor B phenotype associated with a better prognosis. They tend to have either normal or hypodiploid karyotypes. An i(17q) is never seen and +8 and +19 are absent in most series. Duplication of the Ph and loss of the Y are common to both MT and LT.

Concomitant loss of NK and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activities.,2090-5,"We investigated the inactivation of human NK cells, a population of large granular lymphocytes (LGL), with K562, an NK-sensitive target cell (TC) and KLCL, an NK-resistant TC, but which can be lysed by NK cells via antibody (Ab)-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. NK-enriched effector cells (ECc) were first treated with either K562 or Ab-coated KLCL (Ab-KLCL). After incubation, ECc were separated from their TC then examined for residual NK and ADCC activities, phenotypic changes, and changes in LGL morphology. K562-treated ECc and Ab-KLCL-treated ECc, when retested against the inactivating TC, respectively, lost greater than 90% of their lytic activities. However, K562-treated ECc lost 60 to 70% of their activity against Ab-KLCL, whereas Ab-KLCL-treated ECc lost less than 10% of their activity against K562. In contrast to what we observed with K562-treated ECc, we detected significant reductions in plasma membrane expression of Leu-11a and Leu-11b on Ab-KLCL-treated ECc. Although the proportion of OKM1+ cells remained unchanged after the inactivation process, the density of OKM1 on both K562-treated ECc and Ab-KLCL-treated ECc increased significantly. Morphologic analysis revealed no apparent differences in the percentages of LGL before and after treatment with K562 or Ab-KLCL. Finally, IL-2 restored lytic potential to both K562-treated ECc and Ab-KLCL-treated ECc and, in addition, IL-2-induced enhancement of Ab-KLCL-treated ECc was accompanied by a partial reexpression of Leu-11a. These data support the hypothesis that NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity may result from a common lytic mechanism, although the initiation steps and regulation of the pathway are distinct.","['Abrams, S I', 'Brahmi, Z']","['Abrams SI', 'Brahmi Z']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46223.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Rosette Formation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",,1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Mar 15;140(6):2090-5.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,

In reactive lymph nodes, MT1 stained the T-cell areas, whereas MT2 stained both the T-cell areas and mantle-zone B lymphocytes. MT1 stained 38 of 55 T-cell lymphomas (69.1%; 94.7% of cases from one hospital that used a shorter fixation time, and 55.6% of cases from another hospital that used a longer fixation time). MT2 stained only 6 (10.9%) of the T-cell lymphomas.

Neither MT1 nor MT2 stained Reed-Sternberg cells or their variants in HodgKin's disease. We conclude that MT1 is a valuable marker for T cells, particularly when used with a panel of antibodies reactive with B cells in paraffin sections.

The Japanese Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group.,1292-300,"From 1981 to 1983, 131 previously untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) standard-risk group were entered to the protocol JCCLSG-S811. Of 119 eligible patients, 115 (96.6%) attained complete remission by treatment with prednisone (PRD) plus vincristine (VCR) or vindesine (VDS). After preventive central nervous system (CNS) therapy including 18 Gy cranial irradiation and three doses of intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), the patients were assigned randomly to the two maintenance chemotherapies, Regimen A and Regimen B. Regimen A (intermittent regimen) consisted of PRD (120 mg/m2/day by mouth for 5 days) plus 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) (175 mg/m2/day by mouth for 5 days) plus VCR (2.0 mg/m2 intravenously) alternating biweekly with MTX (225 mg/m2 intravenously). Regimen B (continuous regimen) consisted of 6MP (50 mg/m2/day by mouth) plus MTX (20 mg/m2/week by mouth) combined with pulses of PRD and VCR (the same dosages as Regimen A) every 4 weeks. As the late intensification therapy (LIT), five courses of high-dose MTX (2000 mg/m2 per dose per week intravenously for three doses every 12 weeks) with leucovorin rescue were administered to all patients who were in continuous complete remission (CCR) for more than 2 years. Sixty and 55 patients, respectively, were registered in Regimen A and B. The CCR rates in Regimen A and B were 75.1% +/- 5.8% (mean +/- 1 SE) and 49.7% +/- 7.3% (P less than 0.01) at 4 years, and 72.1% +/- 6.3% and 49.7% +/- 7.3% (P less than 0.05) at 5 years, respectively. In Regimen B, CNS and testicular relapses increased after 3 years of CCR. In addition, the patients in Regimen B had a much higher incidence of infections than Regimen A. The LIT did not seem to have important effects on the duration of CCR. From these data we conclude that the intermittent cyclic regimen of 6MP and MTX may be more effective as compared to the continuous administration of these drugs in the maintenance chemotherapy.","['Koizumi, S', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Takeda, T', 'Yatabe, M', 'Utsumi, J', 'Mimaya, J', 'Ninomiya, T', 'Yanai, M']","['Koizumi S', 'Fujimoto T', 'Takeda T', 'Yatabe M', 'Utsumi J', 'Mimaya J', 'Ninomiya T', 'Yanai M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Random Allocation', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19880401)61:7<1292::aid-cncr2820610703>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Apr 1;61(7):1292-300. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880401)61:7<1292::aid-cncr2820610703>3.0.co;2-o.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,

Because tumor-specific immune mechanisms persist in both irradiated and nude mice, it has not been possible to determine if this result is due to rejection of cells already immortalized by retrovirus infection, or reflects an inherent limitation in the proliferative capacity and malignancy of these ""preleukemic"" cells. To clarify these issues, we have transplanted virus-infected bone marrow into mouse fetuses that are immunologically immature and thus incapable of graft rejection. We report here that within days of virus inoculation, transplantable cells capable of disease progression in certain fetal hosts can be detected with this technique. These results demonstrate that cells with the capacity for extensive leukemic proliferation arise very early in Friend virus-induced disease. However, successful transplantation was seen only in genetically anemic recipients (Wx/Wv), which are deficient in hematopoietic stem cells, and not in their normal littermates. Thus, in accord with recent in vitro observations, this in vivo data suggests that normal hematopoietic cells, independent of immune mechanisms, can suppress the malignant progression of transformed cells.","['Fleischman, R A']",['Fleischman RA'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fetus/microbiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice/*embryology/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Preleukemia']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78160-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Mar;71(3):800-3.,,,,,,,,,

All T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) that did not express surface membrane CD3 (SmCD3) appeared to express CyCD3. Furthermore, the majority of SmCD3+ T-ALL also expressed CyCD3. Analogous results were obtained with thymus cell samples in that about 95% of the thymocytes expressed CyCD3 whereas 60% to 75% of the thymocytes also expressed SmCD3. In normal peripheral blood only prominent SmCD3 expression was found. These data indicate that immature T cells express CyCD3 only, that the combined expression of CyCD3 and SmCD3 is characteristic for intermediate differentiation stages, and that mature T cells express prominent SmCD3. All (precursor) B cell leukemias, acute myeloid leukemias, and non-T cell lines tested did not express CyCD3. On the basis of these data, we conclude that CyCD3 expression is restricted to the T cell lineage and can be used as a diagnostic marker for immature SmCD3- T cell malignancies. Therefore, we evaluated which fixative is optimal for CyCD3 staining, and we determined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting which anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) can be used for the detection of CyCD3. In our opinion, acid ethanol was the best fixative for the cytocentrifuge preparations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CyCD3 can be easily detected by use of MoAbs raised against denaturated CD3 chains such as those of the SP series (SP-6, SP-10, SP-64, and SP-78). In addition we tested 22 anti-CD3 MoAbs of the Oxford CD3 panel that were raised against native SmCD3, and it appeared that only four (UCHT1, VIT-3b, G19-41 and SK7/Leu-4) of them were able to detect CyCD3.

Ras gene activation sufficient to mediate in vitro transformation and rodent tumorigenesis usually results from point mutations and amino acid substitutions in the 12th or 61st codons. In AML and the related myelodysplastic syndromes, amino acid substitution at the 13th codon has been observed. An activated c-N-ras gene from a 45-year-old patient with AML was isolated by transfection analysis and subjected to molecular cloning and sequence analysis. A point mutation of the 12th codon (GGT to GAT) resulting in aspartic acid substitution for glycine was observed. In other neoplasms such as colon cancer, specific ras mutations occur predominantly (e.g., K-ras, codon 12). This predominance has been of demonstrable value in analyzing large cohorts for ras activation with techniques that are rapid and economical, such as oligonucleotide hybridization. It had previously been thought that such a predominance for activation of c-N-ras at codon 13 existed in AML; however, this study in concert with others underscores the importance of 12th codon c-N-ras mutations, along with 13th and 61st codon mutations in the molecular pathogenesis of AML. Guanylate to adenylate transition mutations are commonly observed in AML and may provide insight into potential environmental leukemogens. Addressing all commonly prevalent ras activating mutations bears impact in the future design of molecular surveys of the role of ras activation in leukemogenesis.","['Needleman, S W', 'Devine, S E', 'Kraus, M H']","['Needleman SW', 'Devine SE', 'Kraus MH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Feb;2(2):91-3.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,

A review of the literature and a risk assessment.,419-39,"Benzene is widely recognized as a leukemogen, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is currently attempting to limit exposure to it more strictly. The proposed new regulation is a limit of an eight-hour time-weighted average of 1 ppm in place of the current limit of 10 ppm. The fundamental rationale for the change is a perception that the current standard is associated with an inordinate excess of leukemia. The epidemiologic literature on benzene and leukemia supports the inference that benzene causes acute myelocytic leukemia. However, the available data are too sparse, or suffer other limitations, to substantiate the idea that this causal association applies at low levels (i.e., 1-10 ppm) of benzene. Nonetheless, under the assumption that causation does apply at such low levels, a number of authors, including ourselves, have performed risk assessments using similar data but different methodologies. The assessments that we consider acceptable suggest that, among 1,000 men exposed to benzene at 10 ppm for a working lifetime of 30 years, there would occur about 50 excess deaths due to leukemia in addition to the baseline expectation of seven deaths. However, this estimate is speculative and whether or not enough confidence can be placed in it to justify a lower occupational benzene standard remains a decision for policy makers.","['Austin, H', 'Delzell, E', 'Cole, P']","['Austin H', 'Delzell E', 'Cole P']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Risk Factors']",64,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114820 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1988 Mar;127(3):419-39. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114820.,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],['CA29968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 1989 May;129(5):1084-6.

Can one talk about positive growth in childhood, neutral growth in maturity, and negative growth in old age?"" Our goal is to help promote normal positive growth in infants and children. To achieve this, we must be cognizant of the morphologic changes of both normal and abnormal bone formation as they are reflected in the radiographic image of the skeleton. The knowledge of the various causes and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the disturbances of bone growth and development allows us to recognize the early radiographic manifestations. Endocrine and metabolic disorders affect the whole skeleton, but the early changes are best seen in the distal ends of the femurs, where growth rate is most rapid. In skeletal infections and in some vascular injuries two-or three-phase bone scintigraphy supercedes radiography early in the course of the disease. MRI has proved to be very helpful in the early detection of avascular bone necrosis, osteomyelitis, and tumor. Some benign bone tumors and many bone dysplasias have distinct and diagnostic radiographic findings that may preclude further studies. In constitutional diseases of bone, including chromosomal aberrations, skeletal surveys of the patient and all family members together with biochemical and cytogenetic studies are essential for both diagnosis and genetic counseling. Our role is to perform the least invasive and most informative diagnostic imaging modalities that corroborate the biochemical and histologic findings to establish the definitive diagnosis. Unrecognized, misdiagnosed, or improperly treated disturbance of bone growth can result in permanent deformity usually associated with disability.","['Ledesma-Medina, J', 'Newman, B', 'Oh, K S']","['Ledesma-Medina J', 'Newman B', 'Oh KS']","['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Radiol Clin North Am,Radiologic clinics of North America,0123703,IM,"['Bone Diseases, Developmental/*diagnostic imaging', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/diagnostic imaging', 'Bone Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging', 'Bone and Bones/injuries/radiation effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lead Poisoning/diagnostic imaging', 'Leukemia/diagnostic imaging', 'Osteomyelitis/diagnostic imaging', 'Radiography']",116,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiol Clin North Am. 1988 Mar;26(2):441-63.,,,,,,,,,

In one of these tumors the observed rearrangement was not due to the insertion of an intact MoMuLV provirus. The rearranged c-myc DNA fragment from this thymoma was cloned and examined by restriction endonuclease mapping, hybridization to MoMuLV proviral DNA probes, and DNA sequence analysis. These analyses revealed that the c-myc rearrangement in this tumor was due to the presence of a partially duplicated MoMuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) 5' to c-myc exon 1. The orientation of this LTR structure was opposite to the transcriptional orientation of c-myc. The sequences at the 3' flanking side of the LTR structure were derived from a cellular DNA region which maps to the same chromosome as c-myc (chromosome 7), although to a site distant from this proto-oncogene. These findings present evidence for a homologous recombination event occurring between sequences of two proviruses integrated on the same chromosome, one of which was inserted near the c-myc proto-oncogene. The recombination product contains three copies of the MoMuLV LTR 72-base-pair direct repeat and is associated with a high level of c-myc expression. The reciprocal product of this recombination was not detected. We propose that recombination between homologous sequences may play a significant role in the generation of chromosomal rearrangements and therefore in tumor induction and progression.","['Lazo, P A', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Lazo PA', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymoma/etiology/genetics/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology/genetics/*microbiology']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.62.3.788-794.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1988 Mar;62(3):788-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.62.3.788-794.1988.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']","['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['GENBANK/M19096'],,PMC253633,,,,

Although teniposide as a single agent rarely produced a complete remission in heavily pretreated leukemia patients, teniposide plus ara-C produced complete remissions in some patients with refractory and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Innovative front-line and salvage regimens using teniposide have been developed that incorporate a multi-drug strategy with early intensification, rotation of drug combinations in maintenance, and regional therapy in an effort to improve the cure rate in leukemia. However, as the complexity of these regimens increases, the contribution of an individual component such as teniposide becomes less clear. Although some of these regimens for newly diagnosed and relapsed ALL are now thought to represent the best available therapy, teniposide remains an investigational agent.

Subsequently, 91 (81%) were deemed operable. Patients were then randomized to receive surgery or radiotherapy (RT) to determine which of these modalities afforded better local tumor control. All patients also received 2 additional years of CAFVP in a further attempt to eradicate local disease and systemic micrometastases. Forty-one of the randomized patients have relapsed. Approximately half of the initial relapses in each arm were local. The overall duration of disease control was similar following either modality, with a median of 29.2 months for surgery patients and 24.4 months for RT patients. Similarly, there was no major difference in survival related to randomized treatment with an overall median of 39 months (median follow-up 37 months). Pre- or perimenopausal status and inflammatory disease were associated with shorter disease control and survival. Treatment was generally well tolerated and toxicity was acceptable. This study demonstrates that prolonged control of stage III breast carcinoma can be achieved with combined modality therapy in which cytotoxic chemotherapy precedes and follows treatment directly primarily at the breast tumor, using either surgery or RT.

A favorable karyotype (inversion of chromosome 16; translocations between chromosomes 8 and 21, or 15 and 17) was more frequent in patients whose first remission was 12 months or longer compared with less than 12 months (30% v 10%; P less than .0001). An unfavorable karyotype (chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities, trisomy 8, other changes) was more frequent in the latter category (16% v 42%; P less than .0001). Thirty-seven of the 58 patients (64%) with late-relapse AML achieved complete remission (CR). The incidence of CR increased significantly with an increased first remission duration from less than 12, 12 to 18, and greater than 18 months (17% v 41% v 64%; P less than .0001), while the incidence of resistant disease was significantly lower (59% v 36% v 19%; P less than .0001). When effective antileukemic regimens were considered, remission rates were also significantly increased by the duration of first remission (24% v 48% v 72%; P less than .001). Compared with patients with earlier relapse, those with late-relapse AML had a longer median survival from salvage therapy (3.5 v 12 months; P less than .01), and longer median second remission durations (3.5 v 11 months; P less than .01). We conclude that late-relapse AML has unique clinical, cytogenetic, and prognostic characteristics, and remains extremely sensitive to chemotherapy with a potential cure fraction. The duration of first remission is an important prognostic parameter in AML relapse and may be useful in the design and analysis of future salvage programs.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Keating, M J', 'Walters, R S', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', 'Walters RS', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Statistics as Topic']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.2.232 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 Feb;6(2):232-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.2.232.,,,,,,,,,

Lung small-cell carcinoma cell lines were unreactive, while staining was seen in a proportion of lung squamous-cell carcinoma cell lines. The antibodies were unreactive with other cell lines, including breast, colon, ovarian, and renal-cell carcinoma, leukemia, and lung fibroblast. The antibodies stained normal mesothelial cells, but were unreactive with normal bronchial epithelial cells in primary cultures, or peripheral blood cells. Immunohistochemical staining of cryostat sections of tumor tissues confirmed the ability of the antibodies to distinguish between mesothelioma and lung adenocarcinoma.

Since an increase in c-fos transcripts was not detected during dimethylsulfoxide induced HL-60 granulocytic differentiation, it was suggested that within the myeloid series c-fos gene expression might be lineage specific. In the present study, we have determined whether expression of the c-fos and c-sis genes is indeed specific for the monocytic pathway or rather common to both the granulocyte and monocyte pathways. C-fos and c-sis gene expression was analyzed in freshly isolated human granulocytes and monocytes, in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic or monocytic pathway, in myeloblasts from five patients with the M1 or M2 subtype of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and in blasts from six patients with M4 myelomonocytic leukemia. The level of c-fos mRNA was fifteen times higher in granulocytes as compared with monocytes. An increase in c-fos expression was also found in HL-60 cells differentiated along the granulocytic pathway after exposure to hypoxanthine, hexamethylene bisacetamide, and the combination of retinoic acid and dibutyryl adenosine 3'5' cyclic monophosphate. Three of 5 M1 and M2 leukemic myeloblast preparations depleted of lymphoid and monocytic cells and all six M4 leukemic cells expressed c-fos transcripts. In contrast, c-sis gene transcripts were detectable in monocytes and during drug induced monocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells but not in granulocytes during granulocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells or in AML samples. Thus, in the myeloid series, c-sis gene expression is lineage specific while expression of the c-fos gene is found in both lineages and may be related to metabolic pathways common to both granulocytes and monocytes.","['Sariban, E', 'Mitchell, T', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Kufe, D W']","['Sariban E', 'Mitchell T', 'Rambaldi A', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78202-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Feb;71(2):488-93.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)']","['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The translocation can be identified at the DNA level in Ph-positive CML by using a probe to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). In addition, as a result of this translocation an abl-related 210-kd protein with protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity is produced. We analyzed 28 cases of Ph-negative CML for rearrangement of the chromosome 22 sequences and found that eight of the 28 show rearrangement of the bcr. When 12 of the Ph-negative cases were independently reviewed, five were indistinguishable from Ph-positive CML on the basis of morphology, peripheral blood film and clinical details. These five also showed bcr rearrangement. The other seven were reclassified as six atypical CML (aCML) and one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). None of these seven showed bcr rearrangement. In addition 11 cases of bcr- CML were assayed for abl-related PTK, and no detectable activity was present, whereas p210 phl/abl PTK was observed both in Ph-positive (three cases examined) and Ph-negative, bcr + (four cases examined) CML. Therefore, bcr + CML, whether or not the Ph chromosome is cytogenetically apparent, involves a similar molecular alteration and produces the 210-kd protein with enhanced PTK activity. Furthermore, these cases can be distinguished from Ph-negative bcr- CML by careful evaluation of clinical and hematologic data.","['Wiedemann, L M', 'Karhi, K K', 'Shivji, M K', 'Rayter, S I', 'Pegram, S M', 'Dowden, G', 'Bevan, D', 'Will, A', 'Galton, D A', 'Chan, L C']","['Wiedemann LM', 'Karhi KK', 'Shivji MK', 'Rayter SI', 'Pegram SM', 'Dowden G', 'Bevan D', 'Will A', 'Galton DA', 'Chan LC']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78181-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Feb;71(2):349-55.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,

The present work has focused on the properties of five HAG derivatives as inhibitors of the ribonucleotide reductase from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. HAG derivatives acted as non-competitive inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase with respect to the substrates CDP and ADP. The apparent Ki values for the various HAG derivatives as inhibitors of CDP reductase ranged from 3.4 to 543 microM. However, the apparent Ki values for these inhibitors with respect to ADP reductase were 2- to 10-fold lower than the respective values for CDP reductase. After a preincubation of HAG derivatives and ribonucleotide reductase in the absence of substrates, an increased inhibition was observed. The activity of the inhibited enzyme could be restored by passage over a Sephadex G-25 column and subsequent incubation with dithioerythritol. The addition of either the non-heme iron subunit or the effector-binding subunit to the intact enzyme in the assay mixture resulted in a diminished inhibition of ADP reduction. Inhibition by HAG derivatives of ribonucleotide reductase activity in the test tube was not enhanced by iron chelators.

An excellent immunoreaction, even with a weak surface antigen, was observed by inhibition of endogenous peroxidase after the secondary antibody reaction; reactions of weak antigens tended to be obscured when the inhibition was performed before the first antibody reaction. Use of the Giemsa stain as a counterstain made it possible to readily observe the cell morphology; therefore, white blood cell analysis could be performed simultaneously when peripheral blood smears were studied. The positive rate of immunoreaction by an immunofluorescent method was well correlated with that obtained by the ABC method. The ABC method proved to be an excellent immunocytochemical technique for detecting cell surface antigens with high sensitivity and specificity; furthermore, it is useful for cell morphology studies and yields permanent preparations.","['Aratake, Y', 'Tamura, K', 'Kotani, T', 'Ohtaki, S']","['Aratake Y', 'Tamura K', 'Kotani T', 'Ohtaki S']","['Central Laboratory for Clinical Investigation, Miyazaki Medical College Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens/analysis', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*classification/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Meningitis/etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Mumps/immunology/pathology', 'Reference Values']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1988 Jan-Feb;32(1):117-22.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)']",,,,,,,,

This protein is well recognized as a protein which detoxifies, stores and transports iron. The 24 subunits of ferritin assemble to form a protomer of Mr 480,000. This protein shell can sequester up to 4500 g atoms of iron as ferrichydroxyphosphate. Ferritin in vitro and in vivo binds other metal ions such as Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Be and Al. Next to Fe it binds large quantities of Be. Therefore, in vitro ferritin protects against and reverses the inhibition by Be of enzymes susceptible to this metal ion. Also, rats pretreated with Fe survive otherwise toxic levels of either pulmonary or intravenous exposure of Be. Liver ferritin from rats injected with Zn contains some of the injected metal ion. Incubation of such ferritin-zinc complex with zinc-requiring apoenzymes restores their activity. Fe(III) of ferritin is released only after its reduction to Fe(II) by a reductant. Incubation of phosphoglucomutase, a phosphoserine containing enzyme with ferritin and a reductant causes irreversible inactivation of the enzyme and removes 70% of its phosphate. Some other phosphoproteins are similarly inactivated but without the loss of the bound phosphate. Thus, uncontrolled release of iron from ferritin, in the presence of a reductant and oxygen can modify several biomolecules and can affect metabolic processes. A subclass of ferritin, acidic isoferritins, have been implicated in leukemia-associated inhibitory activity and has been suggested to inhibit production of Ia+ macrophage progenitors.","['Joshi, J G', 'Zimmerman, A']","['Joshi JG', 'Zimmerman A']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Tennessee, Knoxville 37996-0840.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,IM,"['Animals', 'Ferritins/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Metals/*metabolism']",62,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0300-483X(88)90055-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0300-483x(88)90055-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1988 Jan;48(1):21-9. doi: 10.1016/0300-483x(88)90055-8.,"['0 (Metals)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,

The surviving fraction of GM-CFC is an exponential function of the drug concentration and time of exposure. Variation of marrow light-density cell concentration between 2 x 10(6) and 10 x 10(6)/ml does not significantly influence its GM-CFC toxicity. Marrow depleted of GM-CFC by A-ALD subsequently generates GM-CFC when grown in suspension cultures. During the early period after treatment with A-ALD the number of surviving GM-CFC (size of surviving GM-CFC compartment) does influence the speed of the GM-CFC repopulation in suspension cultures. The importance of the number of surviving GM-CFCs for the growth and maintenance of GM-CFC population in such suspension cultures diminishes with time. No significant differences are observed after 2 wk, indicating that the ancestor stem cell population and its regenerative potential responsible for in vitro hematopoiesis have not been significantly affected by the drug treatment. A-ALD-treated progenitor cells retain their ability to integrate with the previously established marrow stromal cell layer and generate GM-CFC within this layer to an extent comparable to that of untreated marrow cells. The effect of A-ALD on human hematopoiesis is comparable to that of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. Its advantage over 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide is a greater stability in vitro. It has sparing effect on GM-CFC ancestor cells. Its toxicity to myeloid leukemia cell line (KBM-3)-derived clonogeneic cells is higher than to the GM-CFC. It is similar in doxorubicin-sensitive (KBM-3) and -resistant (KBM-3/DOX) leukemic cells. Thus, A-ALD appears to be a promising drug for in vitro purging of bone marrow cells.","['Beran, M', 'Andersson, B S', 'Wang, Y', 'McCredie, K B', 'Farquhar, D']","['Beran M', 'Andersson BS', 'Wang Y', 'McCredie KB', 'Farquhar D']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/*pharmacology', 'Regeneration']",,1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jan 15;48(2):339-45.,"['0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '113341-60-9 (acetaldophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,

In parallel, serum total protein content, urea and creatinine levels were determined and protein fractions were separated electrophoretically. Serum T1 was found to be 1518 +/- 73 ms (1 SD) in control mice, 1670 +/- 69 ms in leukemic mice, and 1380 +/- 71 ms in the healthy and the leukemic cis-Pt treated mice. The T1 increase in leukemic serum and T1 decrease in the serum of cis-Pt injected mice are attributed to decreased and increased protein contents respectively. A detailed analysis in terms of electrophoretic fractions of serum proteins reveals that the serum relaxation rate 1/T1 is a multilinear function of the mass concentrations of the main serum protein fractions, explaining all serum T1 effects. This makes T1 a non-specific blood parameter. The kidney T1 was found to be 311 +/- 12 ms in normal mice and 334 +/- 20 ms in leukemic mice. A dramatic T1 increase is observed when the mice are injected with cis-Pt; the values are 400 +/- 38 ms and 407 +/- 39 ms for healthy and leukemic mice, respectively. This effect is related to the nephrotoxicity of the drug, as evidenced by serum urea and creatinine levels and protein content being higher than normal.","['Raeymaekers, H H', 'Callens, F', 'Eisendrath, H', 'Atassi, G', 'Fossoul, C', 'Vandewalle, J', 'Gielen, M', 'Willem, R']","['Raeymaekers HH', 'Callens F', 'Eisendrath H', 'Atassi G', 'Fossoul C', 'Vandewalle J', 'Gielen M', 'Willem R']","['Dienst QUOP-WE, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,NMR Biomed,NMR in biomedicine,8915233,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Reference Values', 'Urea/blood']",,1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/nbm.1940010205 [doi]'],ppublish,NMR Biomed. 1988 Apr;1(2):80-9. doi: 10.1002/nbm.1940010205.,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,

Senescent forgetfulness, defined as consistent but not incapacitating memory deficit, may have represented early DAT in some instances. When such cases were included as secondary cases, the morbid risk to first-degree relatives of probands was 67% by age 86 years while risk to comparable control relatives remained 23%. No cases of Down's syndrome were observed. A significant excess of hematologic malignant neoplasms was found among first-degree relatives of probands, supporting an association with DAT. Overall, the findings add further evidence of the action of familial-genetic factors in the etiology of DAT. The magnitude of the effect is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, with penetrance nearly complete by age 85 years. The probands were not selected on the basis of factors posited by some to indicate a familial form of DAT, suggesting that such a genetic mechanism may be involved in the occurrence of DAT in general.","['Martin, R L', 'Gerteis, G', 'Gabrielli, W F Jr']","['Martin RL', 'Gerteis G', 'Gabrielli WF Jr']","['Department of Psychiatry, Washington University, St Louis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Archives of general psychiatry,0372435,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics', 'Congenital Abnormalities/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/genetics', 'Mental Disorders/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Risk Factors']",,1988/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800340016002 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1988 Oct;45(10):894-900. doi: 10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800340016002.,,['MH 31302/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1990 Apr;47(4):395-6.

We have previously described erg, a human gene related to the ets oncogene. In this study, we have regionally assigned the erg gene to chromosome 21q22.3 by using somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization analysis. In light of this chromosome assignment, the relationship of erg to the 21q translocation breakpoint characteristic of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was considered. By using a DNA probe that is specific for the erg gene, a panel of rodent-human cell hybrids was analyzed by the Southern technique to study specific chromosome translocations occurring in acute myeloblastic leukemia. The erg gene was found to translocate from chromosome 21 to 8 in the t(8; 21) (q22; q22), a non-random translocation found in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia of the subgroup M2 (AML-M2).

Two different peaks of biologic activity have been separated by HPLC gel permeation in the range of 100-120 Kd and 75-85 Kd referred to as high molecular weight suppressor factor HMWSF, and low molecular weight suppressor factor LMWSF, respectively. These fractions were then concentrated, dialyzed and further purified by anion exchange HPLC. This chromatographic step allowed us to considerably purify the two SFs. The biologically active fractions derived from the previous chromatographic step were eventually subjected to hydrophobic interaction HPLC (HIC) for final purification. The highly purified material was characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium-dodecylsulfate (SDS-PAGE): a single band corresponding to 115 Kd was observed for HMWSF, while LMWSF yielded a single band at 80 Kd. The isoelectric points (pI) of the different SFs was determined by flat-bed isoelectric-focusing: the HMWSF yielded a single band at pI 7.4, while a much lower pI was observed for LMWSF, 3.5-3.6. Studies on temperature lability indicated that both proteins are stable for 3-4 hours at room temperature (RT), 24-36 hours at +4 degrees C and 7-10 days at -80 degrees C.","['Cirillo, C', 'Montaldo, P', 'Lanciotti, M', 'Parodi, M T', 'Castagnola, E', 'Ponzoni, M']","['Cirillo C', 'Montaldo P', 'Lanciotti M', 'Parodi MT', 'Castagnola E', 'Ponzoni M']","['Laboratorio di Oncologia Pediatrica, Istituto Scientifico G.

Tumors were typed using a panel of antibodies. Cocktails of up to six antibodies were selected based on binding greater than 80% of the malignant cells as tested by immunoperoxidase and flow cytometry. These monoclonal antibodies were then conjugated to Adriamycin and administered intravenously. Seventeen of 23 patients had reactions to the administration of immunoconjugates, but these were tolerable in all but two patients. Fever, chills, pruritus, and skin rash were by far the most common transitory reactions. All were well controlled with premedication. In several patients there was limited antigenic drift among various biopsies within the same patient over time. This observation confirms the necessity for the use of a cocktail of antibodies if one wishes to cover all tumor cells. Preliminary serologic evidence suggests that the development of an IgM antibody, which is specific against the mouse monoclonal antibody, has the specificity and sensitivity to predict clinical reactions. Selected patients were re-treated. One patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had re-treatment on three occasions and demonstrated regression of peripheral lymph nodes. Two patients with breast carcinoma had definite improvement in ulcerating skin lesions and two patients with tongue carcinoma had shrinkage of their lesions. In the course of the study free Adriamycin released from the monoclonal antibodies was discovered to be a limiting factor in the amount of antibody that could be administered. Up to 1 g of Adriamycin and up to 5 g of monoclonal antibody were administered. The limiting factor appeared to be a variable dissociation of active Adriamycin from the antibody that unpredictably caused hemopoietic depression. This study demonstrates the feasibility and reviews technical considerations in preparing immunoconjugate cocktails for patients with refractory malignancies. The major technical hurdle appears to be the selection of an effective conjugation method that can be used to optimally bind Adriamycin to monoclonal antibodies for targeted cancer therapy.","['Oldham, R K', 'Lewis, M', 'Orr, D W', 'Avner, B', 'Liao, S K', 'Ogden, J R', 'Avner, B', 'Birch, R']","['Oldham RK', 'Lewis M', 'Orr DW', 'Avner B', 'Liao SK', 'Ogden JR', 'Avner B', 'Birch R']","['Williamson Medical Center, Biological Therapy Institute, Franklin, TN 37065-1676.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biother,Molecular biotherapy,8904897,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/analysis/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biother. 1988;1(2):103-13.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,

This patient presented headache, and was diagnosed brain tumor on computed tomography. A left parietal cranietomy was done to remove a large central dome-like mass, 8 cm, involving the dura with a slightly dusky greenish solid appearance. Compact nests of moderately mature granulocytes and immature cells comprised the tumor. Histochemical and electron microscopic studies confirmed these tumor cells as myeloid cells in varying stages of maturation. Several days after the operation, left cervical lymph nodes became palpated, and the biopsied lymph nodes revealed same neoplastic cells seen in the skull.

In the present study, the DIF from conditioned medium of MC3T3-E1 cells was partially purified and its biologic activity was examined. The DIF was purified by monitoring the induction of phagocytic activity of mouse myeloblastic leukemia cells (M1). The DIF induced differentiation of not only M1 cells but also mouse myelomonocytic cells (WEHI-3). Furthermore, the DIF increased the in vitro bone-resorbing activity and the osteoclast number in mouse calvaria. The increases were inhibited by the addition of either salmon calcitonin or indomethacin. When mouse bone marrow cells were cultured with the DIF for 8 days, formation of osteoclast-like multinucleated cells was stimulated dose dependently. The DIF from MC3T3-E1 cells appeared to be different from interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta).

Leukemosuppressive anti-viral treatment of these animals results in several important changes in the AKR thymus, including the elimination of virus producing cells, the induction of cellular phenotypic alterations, a decreased ability to bind ecotropic and MCF virus, a resistance to challenge with leukemogenic exogenous retroviruses, and the apparent elimination of a population of virus producing radioresistant cells. In addition, complement-mediated depletion with anti-viral IgG resulted in the complete elimination of proliferating thymocytes. These results suggest that passive anti-viral immunotherapy effectively eliminates a population of thymocytes which serve as the neonatal source of endogenous retroviruses and interferes with the earliest stages of leukemogenesis in AKR mice.","['Buckheit, R W Jr', 'Liberman, S N', 'Bolognesi, D P', 'Weinhold, K J']","['Buckheit RW Jr', 'Liberman SN', 'Bolognesi DP', 'Weinhold KJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Thymus,Thymus,8009032,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thymus. 1988-1989;12(3):143-56.,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],['1-RO1-CA33387-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Fifteen samples constitutively exhibited messenger (m) RNA for colony stimulating factor for granulocytes (G-CSF). Eleven AML specimens produced mRNA specific for CSF for granulocyte and macrophages (GM-CSF). When probed for CSF for macrophages (M-CSF or CSF-1) specific hybridization signals became detectable in six samples. Five out of six blast cell populations transcribing M-CSF, synthesized G-, and GM-CSF mRNA's simultaneously, whereas another five leukemias transcribed G-, and GM-CSF genes exclusively. Furthermore, when specific bioassays were performed to detect secretion of biologically active CSF proteins by these leukemic blast samples, twelve out of fifteen G-CSF mRNA producing cell populations, eight out of eleven GM-CSF mRNA producing cell populations and one out of six M-CSF mRNA synthesizing samples, demonstrated release of the respective, functionally active CSF's into their culture supernatants.

One case presented as diffuse adenopathy in a 35-yr-old male. A second case presented as a jaw mass in a 2-yr-old girl with Down's syndrome. Histologically, each case demonstrated usual Burkitt's-like morphology (intermediate-size cells with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, 1 to 3 prominent nucleoli, high mitotic rate, basophilic cytoplasm, and cytoplasmic vacuolation). Ultrastructural morphometric data corroborated the Burkitt's-like nature of these neoplasms. Immunologically, the neoplasms were of ""novel"" T-cell phenotype, as seen in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL). The cases showed variable expression of activation antigens (e.g., Ia) and weak to moderate expression of proliferation antigens as measured by Ki-67. This modest proliferative activity (less than 25% Ki-67 expression) contrasts with Burkitt's-like lymphomas of the B-cell type which usually show greater than 80% Ki-67 expression. The jaw tumor also demonstrated positivity for human progenitor cell antigen (HPCA) as commonly found in leukemia. Both cases mimic granulocytic sarcoma by virtue of their eosinophilic/myelocytic recruitment--a phenomenon previously reported in association with PTL. The patients have survived 62 wk and 20 wk, respectively, surpassing the survival rates seen in our concurrent B-cell Burkitt's-like lymphomas (12 wk). Burkitt's-like lymphoma of the T-cell type appears to be a distinctive immunological subset of potential clinical and prognostic relevance.","['Oliver, J D', 'Grogan, T M', 'Payne, C M', 'Spier, C', 'Richter, L C', 'Rangel, C S']","['Oliver JD', 'Grogan TM', 'Payne CM', 'Spier C', 'Richter LC', 'Rangel CS']","['Department of Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/ultrastructure']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1988 Jan;1(1):15-22.,,,,,,,,,

Kinetics and diversity of human bone marrow cell response to recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha in short-term suspension cultures in vitro.,31-42,"The response of normal human bone marrow-derived granulocyte macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFC) to human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was studied in short-term suspension cultures, in the presence or absence of human placenta-derived colony-stimulating factors (CSF). The effect of rTNF-alpha on GM-CFC was correlated with its influence on more mature progeny, as defined by standard morphological criteria, and was related to both dose of rTNF-alpha and length of exposure. After very short-term exposure (2 h), ""inactivation"" of a substantial number of GM-CFC was observed only in the presence of very high rTNF-alpha doses (1 x 10(4) ng/ml). When the exposure was prolonged to 16 h, a significant killing of both day 8 (GM-CFC8d) and day 14 (GM-CFC14d) progenitor cells was detected in the presence of 10 ng of rTNF-alpha/ml. Exposure for 5 days resulted in a further increase in the GM-CFC killing. Presence of yet unknown factor(s) in human placenta-conditioned medium sensitized GM-CFC to the action of rTNF-alpha. By morphological analysis of marrow cells, it was found that rTNF-alpha inhibited growth and/or recruitment of granulocytic precursor cells and caused inhibition of their differentiation. This effect was not dose dependent above 1 x 10(1) ng/ml. The presence of rTNF-alpha slightly promoted dose-dependent differentiation along the macrophage pathway. rTNF-alpha appeared to promote eosinophilic differentiation, also in a dose-dependent manner.","['Beran, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Gutterman, J U', 'McCredie, K B']","['Beran M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Gutterman JU', 'McCredie KB']","['Department of Hematology/Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,IM,"['Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects', 'Phagocytes/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacokinetics']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1988;2(1):31-42.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,

When the ability of these antibodies to interfere with the development of cell-mediated immunity to clone D cells in vitro was tested, it was found that the proliferative reaction and generation of cytolytic activity by syngeneic lymphocytes were inhibited by addition of several MAbs to the tumor--lymphocyte co-cultures.","['Grohmann, U', 'Puccetti, P', 'Fioretti, M C', 'Mage, M G', 'Romani, L']","['Grohmann U', 'Puccetti P', 'Fioretti MC', 'Mage MG', 'Romani L']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192-0561(88)90003-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(88)90003-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1988;10(7):803-9. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(88)90003-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,

They are organized in a three-dimensional network consisting of central preadipocytes/adipocytes, mesenchymal and reticular cells, and resident macrophages that are closely associated with myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and with their progenies. These spheroids are 2- to 5- fold more abundant in progenitor cells compared with the whole bone marrow as estimated by monoclonal antibody markers My 10 and T 9, by analysis of granulocyte--macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC) and by cytological techniques. They produce terminally differentiated cells in organotypic microcultures. We suggest that a multicellular spheroid may represent the fundamental unit of primary hematopoiesis; we therefore name it hematon. Here we show that the presence of hematons in bone marrow aspirates correlated positively with homeostatic blood cell production: they were present in normal bone marrow (BM) (19/25), and absent in myelodysplasic syndromes (MDPS) (8/21), in acute nonlymphocytic leukemias (ANLL) (3/22) and in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (2/28).

In this report, we investigate the specific origin of various CSF species in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), purified T-lymphocyte and monocyte (Mo) populations. Furthermore, we assess the conditions required for stimulation of purified cell cultures to express CSF messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins. In the absence of exogenous activation stimuli, human PBMC, T cells and Mo failed to produce transcripts for CSF for macrophages (M-CSF or CSF-1), for granulocytes (G-CSF), for granulocytes/macrophages (GM-CSF), and for multilineage CSF (multi-CSF or Il-3). However, after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), mRNAs for M-, G-, GM-CSF, and multi-CSF became detectable in PBMC as early as 6 hours after initiation of cultures. Identical culture conditions resulted in synthesis of G-, and M-CSF mRNA by Mo, whereas T-lymphocytes produced GM-CSF and multi-CSF mRNA. More physiologically, when Mo were activated with interferon (IFN)-gamma or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and T-lymphocytes were stimulated in an Mo-independent pathway, that is via triggering of the 50 kd sheep erythrocyte receptor protein employing monoclonal antibodies (mo ab) to the Tll-2- and Tll-3- defined epitopes, similar kinetics of mRNA expression were obtained. Similarly, when interleukin-1 (Il-1) receptive T cells were stimulated with Il-1, T cells transcribed functionally active GM-CSF and multi-CSF. Maximum peak activity of GM-, G-, and M-CSF protein secretion was identical for all CSF species investigated, and occurred in culture 48-72 hours after specific induction.

B-CLL (n = 12) patients previously refractory to chemotherapy or with progressive disease post cessation of chemotherapy were eligible. rIL-2 was given as i.v. infusion (2 x 10(6) units/m2) over 2 h 5 times per week for 3 weeks as induction. Responding patients were placed on maintenance therapy. Although there were no complete or partial responses (by ECOG criteria) there was clear evidence of tumor reduction. Seven of 10 evaluable patients had a reduction of the peripheral blood B cell clone, 3 had node reduction and 2 had reduction in their splenomegaly. All patients experienced mild to moderate toxicity and 1 patient died while on induction therapy. Three B-CLL patients following induction rIL-2 treatment were placed back on chemotherapy because of progressive disease. Interestingly, these 2 B-CLL patients achieved extremely rapid and complete responses to chemotherapy which had previously been ineffective.

As CD4, CD8 and NK cells correspond to heterogeneous populations, in this work we tried to better define these subpopulations. Thus, CD4 subpopulations were displayed by using double labelling techniques into helper inducer subset (CD4+CDW29+) and suppressor inducer subset (CD4+CD45R+). CD8 subpopulations were delineated according to density expression of CD8 and reactivity with CD16 and CD11b in: suppressive cells defined by high density (HD) CD8 and reactivity with CD11b; NK cells defined by low density (LD) CD8 and binding to CD16; CTL cells by LD or HD CD8 and absence of expression of CD16 and CD11b. Our results concerning 47 normal control donors and 27 B-CLLs indicated that: although percentages of cells expressing CD3, CD4, CD8 and NK markers are decreased, absolute values of these subpopulations were increased; there exists an imbalance concerning CD4 and CD8, given by a more important increase of CD8 than CD4 subpopulations, but both are significantly augmented when compared to the normal range; within CD4 subpopulations, there is an important increase of CD4 CDW29 subset (helper inducer) whereas the CD4 CD45R (suppressor inducer) is not augmented in stage A patients and decreases in stage C patients; all the 3 identified CD8 subpopulations (NK, suppressors and CTLs) appeared to be increased; in 3 cases of clonal remission CLL studied, all T cell and NK subpopulations were recovering to normal percentages.","['Vuillier, F', 'Tortevoye, P', 'Binet, J L', 'Dighiero, G']","['Vuillier F', 'Tortevoye P', 'Binet JL', 'Dighiero G']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immuno-Pathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*classification', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification', 'Phenotype']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):331-4.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",,,,,,,,

TNF induced proto-oncogene expression and DNA synthesis occur over a substantially longer time period than when the cells are stimulated with agents such as TPA and Calcium ionophore (2), but we have no evidence that the delay represents the time taken to generate TNF dependent secondary cytokines such as IL-1 and IL6. Alpha interferon opposes TNF mediated activation and our recent data indicate that this effect is independent of alpha interferon down regulation of TNF receptors. It appears to be related instead to a decreased accumulation of TNF mRNA which occurs contemporaneously with an alpha interferon induced rise in 2-5 A synthetase. If TNF dependent growth is important for the survival of B-CLL cells, then agents which mimic alpha interferon or which block TNF induced autocrine growth would be predicted to be of therapeutic benefit.","['Bianchi, A C', 'Heslop, H E', 'Drexler, H G', 'Cordingley, F T', 'Turner, M', 'De Mel, W C', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Bianchi AC', 'Heslop HE', 'Drexler HG', 'Cordingley FT', 'Turner M', 'De Mel WC', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Feedback', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/*pharmacology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):317-9.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,

No clinical associations were observed using the CD23, CD25, 4F2, Ba, Bac-1 or FN50 markers. Functional studies showed that the B cells from both clinical categories of patients responded equally well with DNA synthesis when optimally triggered and supplied with T cell factors. However, B-CLL cells from patients with progressive disease secreted significantly higher levels of IgM in response to phorbol ester. The present experiments thus show that differences exist in the activation of B-CLL cells in vivo and that these patterns are correlated with disease activity. Further, the maximal in vitro proliferative capacity of individual tumor cells is similar, whereas differences in accessory T cell functions may exist between patients.","['Totterman, T H', 'Carlsson, M', 'Funderud, S', 'Simonsson, B', 'Oberg, G', 'Nilsson, K']","['Totterman TH', 'Carlsson M', 'Funderud S', 'Simonsson B', 'Oberg G', 'Nilsson K']","['Clinical Immunology Section, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/analysis/*classification/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phenotype']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):279-81.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,

The one exception was a patient with a prolymphocytoid transformation of B-CLL. For 3 patients SI had to be interrupted or stopped because of severe cytopenia. Quantitation of malignant B cells and normal T lymphocytes revealed that the total irradiation dose which resulted in a specific decrease of malignant lymphocytes varied from patient to patient. Normal T-cell subpopulations, which were increased before SI, decreased to normal or abnormally low values during SI. In previously untreated patients, natural killer (NK) cell numbers decreased more rapidly than T-cell subpopulations.

In order to unravel the mechanisms underlying these differences, the parameters responsible for these variations were studied. The efficacy of the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) WT32 (CD3), OKT4 (CD4), T101 (CD5), WT1 (CD7) and WT82 (CD8) conjugated to ricin A-chain was expressed by the extent of protein synthesis inhibition of four leukaemic T cell lines (CEM, GH1, Jurkat and HPB-ALL). Large differences in cytotoxicity were observed. Efficient inhibition of protein synthesis was seen with anti-CD3 IT, anti-CD5 IT and anti-CD7 IT. In these cases the cytotoxicity was related to the antigen density on the target cell membrane. Anti-CD4 IT inhibited poorly and anti-CD8 IT was ineffective, even on cell lines with a high expression of the corresponding antigen. When antigen density and cytotoxicity were plotted for all CD antigens, no correlation could be found. Subsequently, internalization was studied with 125Iodine-labelled antibodies. Anti-CD7 showed the fastest internalization rate, followed by anti-CD3 and anti-CD5. Anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies were respectively moderately and hardly internalized. When the absolute amount of internalized MoAb was calculated, a highly significant correlation with cytotoxicity was found. We conclude that the degree of antigen expression is not so important as the absolute amount of antibody internalized in predicting the efficacy of ITs.","['Preijers, F W', 'Tax, W J', 'De Witte, T', 'Janssen, A', 'vd Heijden, H', 'Vidal, H', 'Wessels, J M', 'Capel, P J']","['Preijers FW', 'Tax WJ', 'De Witte T', 'Janssen A', 'vd Heijden H', 'Vidal H', 'Wessels JM', 'Capel PJ']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Ricin/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02484.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Nov;70(3):289-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02484.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,

It has previously been shown that the degree of the anaemia correlates with the severity of the inflammatory disease and that serum from patients with arthritis inhibits erythropoiesis. This study was designed to examine whether interleukin 1 could be a mediator of the anaemia in rheumatoid arthritis. Radioimmunoassay of interleukin 1 beta in serum showed that patients with rheumatoid arthritis and associated anaemia had significantly higher interleukin 1 beta concentrations than patients with rheumatoid arthritis without anaemia. Pure recombinant human interleukin 1 alpha and interleukin 1 beta, in concentration ranges similar to those found in the arthritic patients, markedly suppressed the colony formation of the erythroid, but not the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells in cultures of normal bone marrow. Natural human interleukin 1 and recombinant interleukin 1 beta, but not interleukin 1 alpha, suppressed in a dose dependent manner the proliferation of the human erythroleukaemia cell line (HEL) in cultures, suggesting that the interleukin 1 effect is a direct one. The results show that interleukin 1 is a humoral inhibitor of erythropoiesis and suggests that interleukin 1 is involved in the development of anaemia in association with rheumatoid arthritis.","['Maury, C P', 'Andersson, L C', 'Teppo, A M', 'Partanen, S', 'Juvonen, E']","['Maury CP', 'Andersson LC', 'Teppo AM', 'Partanen S', 'Juvonen E']","['Fourth Department of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Rheum Dis,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,0372355,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*blood/etiology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*blood/complications', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chronic Disease', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/ard.47.12.972 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Rheum Dis. 1988 Dec;47(12):972-8. doi: 10.1136/ard.47.12.972.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,PMC1003648,,,,

The pattern of factor-dependency does not correlate with morphological criteria in individual cases, and may thus offer a new tool for classification of AML.

The differential effect of rGM-CSF on the phosphorylation of Ara-C in normal BMMCs versus leukemic blasts has potential implications for the use of a regimen consisting of rGM-CSF and high dose Ara-C in the treatment of ANLL with chemotherapy or autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Bhalla, K', 'Birkhofer, M', 'Arlin, Z', 'Grant, S', 'Lutzky, J', 'Graham, G']","['Bhalla K', 'Birkhofer M', 'Arlin Z', 'Grant S', 'Lutzky J', 'Graham G']","['Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Dec;2(12):810-3.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",['CA-45671-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

We demonstrated that cultured HCs at resting conditions were able to spontaneously release the sIL-2R, whereas control enriched B cells did not. This phenomenon was present only when culturing HCs recovered from patients observed at the time of diagnosis but was not observed during treatment with rIFN-alpha 2. Following activation in vitro with a series of different stimulatory agents including BCGF, phorbol myristate acetate, and anti-human IgM antibody, cultured HCs increased their capability to shed the IL-2R molecules. On the other hand, the release of sIL-2R from enriched T cell populations from HCL patients did not significantly differ from the value obtained in controls. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that leukemic B cells represent the main source of sIL-2R in HCL patients and further emphasize the importance of evaluating this parameter as a relevant marker for monitoring the effectiveness of rIFN-alpha 2 therapy.","['Semenzato, G', 'Trentin, L', 'Zambello, R', 'Agostini, C', 'Bulian, P', 'Siviero, F', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Vinante, F', 'Prior, M', 'Chilosi, M']","['Semenzato G', 'Trentin L', 'Zambello R', 'Agostini C', 'Bulian P', 'Siviero F', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Vinante F', 'Prior M', 'Chilosi M', 'et al.']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Dec;2(12):788-92.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,

Proliferative responses to these factors, when added separately as well as in combinations, were analyzed in 25 cases of human AML using 3H-thymidine incorporation and colony assays. The 3H-thymidine uptake data revealed that IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF were stimulators of AML proliferation in 19, 15, 13, and 4 cases, respectively. Epo only stimulated DNA synthesis in the cells of the single erythroleukemia case. GM-CSF stimulation was seen only in IL-3 reactive cases and GM-CSF, when combined with IL-3, could not further elevate the DNA synthesis evoked by IL-3 alone. On the other hand, in six cases, G-CSF enhanced the IL-3- or GM-CSF-stimulated thymidine uptake. These results suggest that subpopulations of AML cells that are activated by distinct CSFs (eg, IL-3/GM-CSF-responsive cells and G-CSF-responsive cells) coexist. The 3H-thymidine incorporation assay was more sensitive for measuring CSF responses than methylcellulose colony cultures, since activation of DNA synthesis was more frequently seen than induction of colony formation. DNA synthesis experiments revealed eight different CSF response patterns among these 25 cases. CSF phenotyping may be a useful addition to the morphologic classification of AML, since these patterns directly reflect the ability of the proliferating subsets of AML cells to respond to the CSFs.","['Delwel, R', 'Salem, M', 'Pellens, C', 'Dorssers, L', 'Wagemaker, G', 'Clark, S', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Delwel R', 'Salem M', 'Pellens C', 'Dorssers L', 'Wagemaker G', 'Clark S', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82153-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Dec;72(6):1944-9.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,

We found chymotrypsin-like proteinase ('chymase') activity in the RNK-16 dense granules that also contain cytolytic activity. The chymase activity hydrolyzed the thiobenzyl peptide substrate Suc-Phe-Leu-Phe-SBzl and, in comparison to RNK-16 tryptase activity, was selectively inhibited by three different types of serine proteinase inhibitors. The selective inhibitors were the fungal aldehyde chymostatin, the chloromethylketone Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CH2Cl, and the mechanism-based or 'suicide' inhibitor 7-amino-4-chloro-3-(2-phenylethoxy)isocoumarin. These proteinase inhibitors also blocked RNK-16 granule-mediated cytolysis. Chymostatin, a reversible inhibitor, delayed granule-mediated cytolysis, whereas the irreversible chloromethylketone and isocoumarin proteinase inhibitors completely abrogated granule-mediated cytolysis. The two irreversible inhibitors displayed biphasic inhibition of the chymase activity, indicating that at least two chymases are present in the granules. By Northern blot analysis, we found that RNK-16 mRNA hybridized strongly with a cDNA probe of CCPI, a mouse cytotoxic T lymphocyte serine proteinase gene. These data imply that chymase activity in the cytotoxic granules is important for cytolytic function and is likely to belong to a new subfamily of serine proteinases.","['Zunino, S J', 'Allison, N J', 'Kam, C M', 'Powers, J C', 'Hudig, D']","['Zunino SJ', 'Allison NJ', 'Kam CM', 'Powers JC', 'Hudig D']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno 89557-0046.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Chymases', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology', '*Genes', 'Hemolysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*analysis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*enzymology', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,1988/12/15 00:00,1988/12/15 00:01,['1988/12/15 00:00'],"['1988/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(88)90095-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(88)90095-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Dec 15;967(3):331-40. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(88)90095-5.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)']","['CA38942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL29307/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL34035/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Moreover, L1210/DTIC is rejected by syngeneic hosts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DTIC selects pre-existing immunogenic clones rather than inducing ex novo new antigenic determinants and to verify the number of induced antigens. L1210 leukemia was cloned in vitro and 4 clones were treated in vivo with DTIC. All the treated clones displayed antigenic properties since they were rejected by syngeneic hosts. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activated against one DTIC clone could recognize and lyse the relevant target. One of these DTIC-modified clones (L4/DTIC) was recloned and the subclones were tested in vivo and in vitro. Two out of six subclones were rejected by syngeneic hosts. CTL specific against these two clones were able to recognize and lyse all the other clones to different degrees. The degree of susceptibility to lysis did not correlate with the capability to evoke an immune response in vivo. Based on these findings we conclude that DTIC does not select pre-existing clones but modifies the tumor cells antigenically, and that the antigenicity induced by DTIC in a cloned tumor line is due to the presence of common antigens shared to different degrees with treated cells.","['Marelli, O', 'Franco, P', 'Canti, G', 'Prandoni, N', 'Ricci, L']","['Marelli O', 'Franco P', 'Canti G', 'Prandoni N', 'Ricci L']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Universita di Milano, Italia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Cross Reactions', 'Dacarbazine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects']",,1988/08/31 00:00,1988/08/31 00:01,['1988/08/31 00:00'],"['1988/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1988 Aug 31;74(4):387-92.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)']",,,,,,,,

The chromosome numbers of metaphase cells in all studied SD leukemias were near diploid and in all leukemias numerical or structural abnormalities were found. Affected were chromosomes No. 11, 2, 13 and 1. A common finding in most leukemias was trisomy 11 observed either as simple trisomy (SD1, SD4 and 2 clones of SD6), or the translocation form of trisomy (SD3), or the tandem translocation t(11;13) in SD7, or the Robertsonian fusion -rob(2;11) in SD5. In SD9 and one cell clone of SD8 no apparent trisomy was found, but the cells contained an 11q+ marker. Among the rearranged chromosomes, chromosome 2 was most frequently involved. Der No. 2 with terminal deletion was found in some of SD3 metaphases and a probable partial duplication of chromosome 2 was found in SD6. The finding of trisomy 2 in SD5 and SD6 occurred rarely. Further structural rearrangements concerned No. 13, the involvement of which was evident in the 13q+ marker typical of SD2, one cell clone of SD6, SD7 and SD8 leukemias. 1q+ aberration was the common finding in SD3 and SD5, while 1q-was observed in all SD6 metaphases. According to the cytogenetic examination of SD leukemias, we considered that the changes of chromosomes 11, 2, 13 and 1 were nonrandom.

Infection of long-term bone marrow cultures enriched for B-lymphoid cell types with a Moloney murine leukemia virus retroviral vector containing the BCR/ABL cDNA resulted in clonal outgrowths of immature B-lymphoid cells which expressed abundant P210 kinase activity. Surprisingly, infection of long-term myeloid lineage-enriched cultures also resulted in clonal outgrowths of immature B-lymphoid cells. The P210-expressing lymphoid cell lines resulting from either type of culture were resistant to the lethal effects of corticosteroids.

Previous studies with 173 and 183 cells have consistently shown that TPA alone induces differentiation but no proliferation. However, when the two clones were exposed to TPA plus BSF-MP6, not only differentiation but also DNA synthesis was observed. Compared with TPA exposure alone, the fraction of cells with induced lymphoblastoid-plasmacytoid morphology increased and Ig secretion was enhanced. By a 1-hr TPA pulse followed by BSF-MP6, the DNA synthesis was further augmented, but less maturation was observed. T cell and monocyte removal, using cell sorting, showed that the DNA synthesis induced was independent of these cell types, also under serum-free conditions. Quantitation of several cell cycle-associated surface Ags showed that the 4F2, Ba, Bac-1, and cD23 Ags increased while the CD37 decreased in expression upon addition of BSF-MP6. We conclude that B-CLLs are inducible by TPA and BSF-MP6 not only to differentiation, but also to DNA synthesis even under serum-free conditions in vitro. The results furthermore suggest that the very low proliferation activity in B-CLL tumors in vivo may reflect a relative deficiency of proper growth and differentiation factors or a subnormal response of B-CLL cells to such factors.","['Carlsson, M', 'Matsson, P', 'Rosen, A', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Totterman, T H', 'Nilsson, K']","['Carlsson M', 'Matsson P', 'Rosen A', 'Sundstrom C', 'Totterman TH', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Nov;2(11):734-44.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,

We correlated the in vitro binding and transcriptional activity of one of these cellular factors (Mr, 180,000) to the trans-activation of the HTLV-I LTR by p40x. Point mutations were generated within the cAMP octanucleotide of the HTLV-I 21-bp sequence that simultaneously abolished biological responsiveness to trans-activation by p40x and to stimulation by cAMP. We found that these mutations also eliminated the binding of the 180-kilodalton HeLa factor to the HTLV-I 21-bp element. In the absence of a demonstrable DNA-binding property for p40x, we hypothesize that cellular proteins are involved, possibly through signal transduction pathways, in its trans-activation of responsive promoters.","['Jeang, K T', 'Boros, I', 'Brady, J', 'Radonovich, M', 'Khoury, G']","['Jeang KT', 'Boros I', 'Brady J', 'Radonovich M', 'Khoury G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genes, Viral', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.62.12.4499-4509.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1988 Dec;62(12):4499-509. doi: 10.1128/JVI.62.12.4499-4509.1988.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,PMC253560,,,,

There were 12 primary cutaneous lymphomas, 15 cases of secondary cutaneous involvement of systemic lymphoma, and 5 cases of concurrent skin and lymph node involvement. Histologically, large cell lymphoma predominated in both primary and secondary cutaneous lymphomas. Immunohistochemical study using monoclonal antibodies reactive with B- and T-cells in paraffin sections revealed the cellular lineage in 30 cases. Nineteen cases were of T-cell origin and 11 cases were of B-cell derivation. The prognosis of these patients was rather poor; 25 patients died within 5 years. The predominance of T-cell lymphoma contrasts with a higher frequency of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma in Western countries. As the clinicopathological features of cutaneous lymphomas are diverse, it is suggested that cutaneous lymphomas should be classified and studied in a similar way to their nodal counterparts.","['Mukai, K', 'Sato, Y', 'Watanabe, S', 'Ishihara, K', 'Shimoyama, M', 'Shimosato, Y']","['Mukai K', 'Sato Y', 'Watanabe S', 'Ishihara K', 'Shimoyama M', 'Shimosato Y']","['Pathology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mycosis Fungoides', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0560.1988.tb00543.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 1988 Aug;15(4):193-200. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.1988.tb00543.x.,,,,,,,,,

The ITs were tested for their ability to kill cells from the Burkitt lymphoma line, Daudi, the pre-B-cell leukemia line, NALM-6, and the myeloma cell line, ARH-77. Daudi expresses high levels of CD22, whereas NALM-6 and ARH-77 express low levels of CD22. The IgG-RFB4-A was highly toxic to all 3 cell lines; it killed 50% of the Daudi cells at a concentration of 1.2 x 10(-12) M and 50% of NALM-6 and ARH-77 cells at concentrations of 1.5 to 2.1 x 10(-11) M. IgG-RFB4-A was 10-30 times more toxic to Daudi cells than were the IgG-As constructed from the other 3 CD22 MAbs and 10 times more toxic than ricin itself. IT-As constructed from the Fab' fragments of the 4 CD22 antibodies were 2 to 5 times less toxic to Daudi cells than their IgG-A counterparts. Fab'-RFB4-A was twice as toxic to Daudi cells as ricin, whereas the other Fab'-As were about 7 times less toxic than ricin. Scatchard analyses of the binding of the radio-iodinated antibodies to Daudi cells showed that the intact RFB4 antibody bound 3-10 times more strongly than the other antibodies, whereas the Fab'-RFB4 bound 1.2 to 3.5 times more strongly than the Fab' fragments prepared from the other antibodies. Thus, the potent cytotoxic activity of the RFB4-As appears to derive, in part, from their superior binding affinity. Prior studies have shown that UV22-I and HD6 cross-react with certain normal human tissues lacking cells of B-cell lineage, whereas UV22-2 and RFB4 are B-cell-specific. This fact, together with its superior potency as an IT-A, suggests that RFB4 is the antibody of choice for preparing Fab'-As or IgG-As for in vivo therapy of human B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.","['Shen, G L', 'Li, J L', 'Ghetie, M A', 'Ghetie, V', 'May, R D', 'Till, M', 'Brown, A N', 'Relf, M', 'Knowles, P', 'Uhr, J W']","['Shen GL', 'Li JL', 'Ghetie MA', 'Ghetie V', 'May RD', 'Till M', 'Brown AN', 'Relf M', 'Knowles P', 'Uhr JW', 'et al.']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/metabolism', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Ricin/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",,1988/11/15 00:00,1988/11/15 00:01,['1988/11/15 00:00'],"['1988/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910420527 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Nov 15;42(5):792-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910420527.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cd22 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,

In the former group, NHL cells were maximally induced by TPA to secrete Ig and higher proportions of TRAP positive cells. In addition hairy cell features as seen by light and scanning electron microscopy were also more pronounced. TPA also induced the maximal expression of SmIg and GP-70 in cells derived from patients in this group.

Clone K4L was specific for antigen B on L1210, and this antigen was different from antigen A for which the previously reported T-cell clone K7L was specific. K4L possessed cytotoxicity and tumor growth-inhibitory activity against both L1210 and antigen A loss variant, L1210-K7L-, but not against syngeneic tumor P388 or L5178Y. Previously we showed that antigen A was lost frequently for generation of antigen loss variants. In contrast, antigen B was barely found to be lost. When mice were inoculated with L1210 plus a moderate dose of K4L, the tumor grew after initial suppression but this newly emerging tumor was K4L sensitive and was ultimately rejected. The mice initially given L1210 plus K4L attained a high-grade tumor-specific immunity for rejecting the subsequently challenged high-dose (10(7) cells) L1210. This immunity did not involve any bystander antitumor activity against the third party P388 lymphoma that was injected together with L1210 but accompanied the increase in the L1210-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. Evidence was provided that the live L1210, the outgrowth of which was inhibited by K4L, induced an effective immune response of radiation-sensitive host lymphocytes including L3T4+ helper T-cells. Taken together, our results show a novel strategy for inducing high-grade host-dependent antitumor immunity by use of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone specific for a stable tumor-specific transplantation antigen.","['Rahman, S M', 'Kawashima, K', 'Nakashima, I', 'Nagase, F']","['Rahman SM', 'Kawashima K', 'Nakashima I', 'Nagase F']","['Department of Immunology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,1988/11/15 00:00,1988/11/15 00:01,['1988/11/15 00:00'],"['1988/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Nov 15;48(22):6450-4.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (tumor-associated transplantation antigen)']",,,,,,,,

The nature of these cell-cell interactions has not yet been fully elucidated, but the involvement of pre-B-cell stimulating factors produced by various mesenchymal cell lines has recently been demonstrated in the murine system. In this model, transformed pre-B-cells differ from their normal counterparts in their acquisition of autonomous growth potential, as seen by an ability to be maintained in vitro in the absence of mesenchymal cell feeders. To test the hypothesis that autonomy might be associated with autocrine growth factor production, we tested the ability of a spontaneous pre-B-cell transformant (H9 cells) and two independently derived Abelson murine leukemia virus transformed pre-B-cell lines to produce pre-B-cell stimulating factors. All three lines released activities that stimulated the proliferation of themselves or H9 cells when cultured at low cell densities. One of the three transformed pre-B-cell lines could also substitute for mesenchymal feeders to stimulate normal pre-B-cells. Time course studies of an evolving Abelson murine leukemia virus transformant showed that the production of an autocrine pre-B-cell growth factor increased concomitantly with the acquisition of autonomous growth potential suggesting a relationship between these two phenotypic changes. Preliminary characterization of the growth factor responsiveness of H9 cells and the nature of the autostimulatory activity produced by this line suggested its nonidentity with any known hemopoietic growth factor. Activation of autocrine growth factor production appears to be a common event in the evolution of malignant pre-B-cells arising through different oncogenic mechanisms and may therefore be relevant to the pathogenesis of human acute lymphoid leukemia.","['Lemoine, F M', 'Krystal, G', 'Humphries, R K', 'Eaves, C J']","['Lemoine FM', 'Krystal G', 'Humphries RK', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.C.

Second, media conditioned by purified blast cell fraction depleted of both T-cells and phagocytic cells potentiated autologous blast progenitor growth both in methylcellulose and suspension cultures stimulated by optimal concentration of media conditioned by human bladder carcinoma line 5637.

Three questions were of particular interest. Do the chromosomal changes in T-cell ALL preferentially affect bands where genes encoding the T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR) have been mapped? Do alterations involving the TCR gene regions appear with any notable frequency in B-progenitor ALL? Do chromosomal abnormalities in this disease relate to stage of T-cell ontogeny? A relatively high proportion of cases (65%) had a pseudodiploid karyotype at presentation, the majority (58%) characterized by a translocation. The overall frequency of translocations was 44%, comparable to that among all banded cases of ALL seen in our laboratory. Hypodiploidy and hyperdiploidy were exceedingly rare (only four of 57 cases); 16 cases (28%) had apparently normal karyotypes. In half the cases with a translocation (14 of 24), the breakpoints were in regions to which the alpha and beta chain TCR genes have been mapped. Chromosomal breakpoints that were consistently observed in the vicinity of TCR gene loci were 7q32-q36 (TCR beta chain; n = 8), 14q11-q13 (TCR alpha chain; n = 6); other frequent breakpoints were 9p13-pter (n = 8) and 6q15-qter (n = 9). Chromosomal alterations occurred near TCR gene loci significantly more often in T-cell cases than in a comparison group of 335 patients with B-cell precursor ALL (26% v 1.5%, P = .0001). Stage I thymocyte development (CD7+, CD2+, CD5+, CD1-, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-) was noted in 23 cases, stage II (CD7+, CD2+, CD5+, CD1+, CD3-, CD4 +/-, CD8 +/-) in 25 cases, and stage III (CD9+, CD2+, CD1-, CD5+, CD3+, and either CD4+ or CD8+) in nine cases. The only statistically significant associations between cytogenetic findings and T-cell ontogeny were a higher frequency of normal karyotypes in cases with stage I thymocytes, and of pseudodiploidy in stage II cases. There was no apparent relationship between particular translocations and level of thymocyte maturation. Our findings indicate that most children with T-cell ALL have pseudodiploid karyotypes, although a surprisingly high percentage lack demonstrable abnormal clones. Specific chromosomal changes do not appear to be related to discrete stages of T-cell ontogeny as defined in this study, but they occur preferentially in bands containing TCR genes.","['Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F G', 'Roberson, P K', 'Pui, C H', 'Rivera, G K', 'Murphy, S B', 'Williams, D L']","['Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Roberson PK', 'Pui CH', 'Rivera GK', 'Murphy SB', 'Williams DL']","[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79240-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Nov;72(5):1560-6.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

These IL-2 receptors could be demonstrated to mediate a physiologic response to the lymphokine for which the high-affinity form of the IL-2 receptor appears to be essential. The phenotype of PER-117 cells corresponds to the earliest identifiable stage of T-cell differentiation, which is defined by the lack of the T3-T-cell receptor complex and the presence of the 40 Kd protein recognized by monoclonal antibodies of the CD7 group. Further evidence for the clonality and T-cell lineage of this cell line was obtained by analysis of rearrangements of genes for the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain and for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgJH) genes. PER-117 cells could be shown to have rearranged TCR beta genes but no rearrangement of the IgJH genes. Cell line PER-117 provides a model to investigate the requirements for induction of IL-2 receptors in a cell expressing the first T-cell-specific marker and may help to elucidate the role of IL-2 during thymic differentiation and in the uncontrolled proliferation of T-cell leukemias.","['Kees, U R']",['Kees UR'],"['Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79234-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Nov;72(5):1524-9.,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,

The detection of 14 patients born in the southeastern United States, all black, indicates a group deserving particular attention for studies of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), a suspected etiologic agent in most cases of ATLL. Although geographic clustering of ATLL in areas endemic for HTLV-I, particularly southwest Japan and the Caribbean Basin, is a dramatic feature of this disease, a review of the literature indicates that HTLV-I-associated ATLL probably occurs sporadically in a much wider distribution, the disease being diagnosed in native-born African, Chinese, European, and Latin American patients. A registry for ATLL cases is suggested, to assist in the identification of risk factors for this disease and, at the same time, improve case definitions and early diagnosis.","['Levine, P H', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Manns, A', 'Murphy, E L', 'Clark, J', 'Blattner, W A']","['Levine PH', 'Jaffe ES', 'Manns A', 'Murphy EL', 'Clark J', 'Blattner WA']","['Environmental Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Yale J Biol Med,The Yale journal of biology and medicine,0417414,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'United States']",,1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yale J Biol Med. 1988 May-Jun;61(3):215-22.,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],,,,PMC2590467,,,,

These clones are visible as phenotypically homogeneous cell populations in multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of peritoneal and splenic B cells; they show unique immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain gene rearrangements in Southern gel analyses of peritoneal and splenic DNA; and, like the self-replenishing Ly-1 B-cell population from which they are drawn, they tend to grow readily in irradiated or unirradiated syngeneic or allotype congenic hosts. Furthermore, they develop and generalize in primary and secondary hosts in a characteristic pattern (peritoneum much greater than spleen greater than lymph node greater than bone marrow) that suggests that their initial growth is controlled by the mechanisms that normally control Ly-1 B-cell distribution in lymphoid organs. The universal emergence of these clones within the Ly-1 B-cell lineage may be explained by the substantially greater opportunity for hyperplastic and neoplastic transformation events in this long-lived self-replenishing Ly-1 B-cell population, which must divide relatively frequently to maintain its normal size throughout adulthood. Repeated exposure to internal or environmental antigens (with which Ly-1 B cells are known to react) may also play a role in driving the development of these clones.","['Stall, A M', 'Farinas, M C', 'Tarlinton, D M', 'Lalor, P A', 'Herzenberg, L A', 'Strober, S', 'Herzenberg, L A']","['Stall AM', 'Farinas MC', 'Tarlinton DM', 'Lalor PA', 'Herzenberg LA', 'Strober S', 'Herzenberg LA']","['Department of Genetics, Stanford University, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Ly/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Clone Cells/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peritoneum/cytology', 'Phenotype']",,1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.19.7312 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Oct;85(19):7312-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.19.7312.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)']","['AI-07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-01287/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC282176,,,,

Although these virus groups share tropism for human CD4+ T cells, they differ markedly in primary sequence, genetic organization and disease association (AIDS versus adult T-cell leukaemia), but show similar general strategies for the regulation of viral gene expression. Each encodes a protein able to trans-activate transcription from the homologous viral long terminal repeat (tat in HIV, tax in HTLV), although these proteins act by different mechanisms and do not appear to be interchangeable. Each virus also produces a second trans-acting protein that induces the expression of the unspliced messenger RNAs encoding the viral structural proteins (rev in HIV and rex in HTLV). Here we show that the rex protein of HTLV-I can functionally replace the rev protein of HIV-1 in transient expression assays. This genetic complementation by rex is adequate for the rescue of a replication-defective rev mutant of HIV-1.

In L-M fibroblasts, each of these IL-1 species, but not a recombinant 24-kDa precursor of the predominant IL-1 beta, produced a prompt, dose-related, and transient increase in (Ca2+)i. The effect was smaller but not eliminated when the cells were stimulated in EGTA-containing calcium, suggesting that the rise in (Ca2+)i was due to influx from both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ pools. In human fibroblasts, however, the (Ca2+)i increased gradually, reaching a maximum after 1 hr of incubation with IL-1 and returning slowly to near basal levels in the following 2 hr. In contrast to the L-M cells, this accumulation of Ca2+ was abolished by EGTA, suggesting that in human fibroblasts, Ca2+ is mobilized solely from the extracellular space. Addition of the Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine was ineffective. IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta both induced a dose-related increase in prostaglandin E2, but only in the human fibroblasts.

We isolated both spontaneous idiotype and receptor-negative variants without applying mutagens or any selective pressure other than sorting the cells. These sorted and cloned populations are all clonally related to each other as shown by their beta-TCR locus gene rearrangements. The idiotype variants have alpha-chains which are differentially glycosylated, but they have the same size core protein after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F to remove their carbohydrate side chains. This probably accounts for their idiotypic difference, since the antibody that distinguishes them appears dependent upon glycosylation for its binding, as shown by immunoprecipitation in the presence versus the absence of tunicamycin, which inhibits glycosylation from occurring. The idiotype variants differed from one another in variable region sequences by only a single amino acid substitution in the beta-chain, which is likely not important for the idiotypic difference. The receptor-negative variant produces both alpha- and beta-mRNA and cytoplasmic protein for TCR, but fails to transport this protein to the cell surface. We conclude that idiotype and receptor-negative variants of a T cell clone can occur in the absence of appreciable somatic mutation.","['Maecker, H T', 'Levy, R']","['Maecker HT', 'Levy R']","['Stanford University Medical School, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/classification/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*Genetic Variation', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/analysis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/*metabolism']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Nov 1;141(9):2994-3002.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",['CA 34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Resting T lymphocytes do not express Leu 23. However, expression of Leu 23 glycoprotein can be induced on the Jurkat T leukemia cell line within a few hours after stimulation with soluble anti-CD3 mAb or Con A. After removal of the stimulus Leu 23 is expressed for greater than 30 h. A total of 20 to 30% of resting human thymocytes was unexpectedly stained by anti-Leu 23 mAb. Biochemical analysis revealed that the Leu 23 Ag expressed on thymocytes is a phosphorylated disulfide-linked dimer composed of 28- and 32-kDa subunits. Within the thymus, Leu 23 is preferentially expressed on the CD3bright, mostly CD4+ CD8- or CD4- CD8+ subpopulations. By contrast, CD3dim CD4+CD8+ thymocytes expressed only very low levels of Leu 23, and CD7+ CD3- CD4- CD8- thymocytes were Leu 23-. However, Leu 23 was induced on the CD3dim thymocytes by in vitro culture of thymocytes with anti-CD3-conjugated Sepharose. The transition from CD3dim to CD3bright within the thymus may be an important differentiation stage and influence selection of the antigenic repertoire. Therefore, the ability to detect subpopulations within the thymus that express Leu 23 Ag may help to identify thymocytes activated in vivo, possibly by the functional engagement of their CD3/TCR.","['Testi, R', 'Phillips, J H', 'Lanier, L L']","['Testi R', 'Phillips JH', 'Lanier LL']","['Becton Dickinson Monoclonal Center, Mountain View, CA 94043.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",,1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Oct 15;141(8):2557-63.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,

A cell surface glycoprotein that marks early B lineage cells and mature myeloid lineage cells in mice.,2551-6,"To explore the cell surface molecules expressed on pre-B cells we have produced a panel of alloantibodies against transformed pre-B cells from BALB/c mice by immunizing a wild mouse, Mus spretus. One of these antibodies, BP-3, recognized glycoproteins of Mr 38,000 to 48,000 on pre-B cells transformed either by the Abelson murine leukemia virus or an erb B oncogene construct. Removal of N-linked oligosaccharides from the BP-3 Ag revealed a single core protein of Mr 32,000. The Ag was expressed by bone marrow cells in all but one (A/J) of the inbred mouse strains tested and in wild mice of biochemical groups Mus-1 and Mus-2. Analysis of the tissue distribution revealed expression of the BP-3 reactive molecule on normal pre-B and B cells in the bone marrow, 35% of B cells in the circulation, 30% of the B cells in the spleen, and less than or equal to 20% of B cells in lymph nodes, peritoneal cavity, and Peyer's patches. The subpopulation of BP-3+ B cells in bone marrow and peripheral tissues displayed an immature phenotype (IgM IgD +/- ). Examination of a panel of transformed B lineage cells confirmed the early stage-specific expression of the BP-3 alloantigen. In addition, a myeloid cell line and normal myeloid cells were found to express the BP-3 alloantigen. In contrast to B lineage cells, the level of BP-3 expression increased as a function of myeloid cell differentiation. Myeloid cells in the bone marrow expressed relatively little Ag, whereas circulating neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages expressed relatively high levels of the BP-3 alloantigen with Mr 38,000, 41,000, and 46,000. The data suggest that this variably glycosylated cell surface protein could play different roles in the differentiation of B lineage and myeloid lineage cells. The BP-3 alloantigen appears to be a useful marker for virgin B cells that have recently migrated from the bone marrow to the periphery.","['McNagny, K M', 'Cazenave, P A', 'Cooper, M D']","['McNagny KM', 'Cazenave PA', 'Cooper MD']","['Division of Developmental and Clinical Immunology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['*ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Surface/isolation & purification', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/isolation & purification', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Isoantigens/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Muridae', 'Species Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution']",,1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Oct 15;141(8):2551-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase 2)']","['CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Herein, we report that rIL-4 is a potent regulator of human NK cells. Although rIL-4 had no effect on the cytotoxic activity of resting NK cells, it was capable of inhibiting in a concentration-dependent manner the rIL-2-induced cytolytic activation of NK cells against NK cell-resistant tumor cell targets. rIL-4 acted directly on NK cells and did not require accessory cells. rIL-4-induced inhibition of NK cell activation was specific for rIL-2 in that activation of NK cell cytolysis by IFN-alpha was not affected. These results represent the first direct evidence that rIL-2 and IFN-alpha activate NK cells by different pathways. rIL-4 also effectively blocked the rIL-2-dependent proliferation of NK cells. The results presented in this study clearly demonstrate that rIL-4 is a potent regulator of IL-2-dependent mechanisms of NK cell activation and proliferation and thus may play an important physiologic role in vivo.","['Nagler, A', 'Lanier, L L', 'Phillips, J H']","['Nagler A', 'Lanier LL', 'Phillips JH']","['Becton-Dickinson Monoclonal Center, Inc., Mountain View, CA 94043.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Oct 1;141(7):2349-51.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,

Its level of expression on the pre-B leukemic HOON cell line used for derivation of the corresponding mAb is intermediate but sufficient to permit the purification of the Ag. The molecule isolated by immunoaffinity from HOON is a glycoprotein since it bound to Ricinus communis agglutinin, wheat germ agglutinin, and peanut agglutinin lectins. The Ag was purified 2400-fold from a soluble taurocholate extract of HOON cells by affinity to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and 44G4-IgG-Sepharose. The purified glycoprotein is likely a homodimer as it migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent m.w. of 170,000, nonreduced, and 95,000, reduced. Removal of N-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidase F led to a decrease in m.w. of 25,000; if neuraminidase and O-glycanase were also present, the total decrease in m.w. was 33,000 suggesting a polypeptide chain of 62,000 and 8,000 in O-linked substitutions. The glycoprotein digested with N-glycanase, neuraminidase, or O-glycanase could still be immunoprecipitated with the 44G4 mAb indicating that the antigenic epitope resides in the polypeptide. By Western blot analysis, the dissociated but nonreduced protein was reactive with 44G4, whereas the reduced and alkylated protein was not. Therefore, the epitope is dependent on the presence of intact disulfide bond(s). Sequential immunoprecipitation with OKT9 and 44G4 antibodies indicated that these epitopes are present on two distinct molecules and that 44G4 is distinct from the transferrin receptor despite a similar subunit structure.","['Gougos, A', 'Letarte, M']","['Gougos A', 'Letarte M']","['Division of Immunology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Lectins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Transferrin/isolation & purification']",,1988/09/15 00:00,1988/09/15 00:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Sep 15;141(6):1934-40.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",,,,,,,,

All other cell types observed in these tissues were unreactive. Immunofluorescence staining of endothelial cells isolated from umbilical cord vein and grown in culture confirmed that mAb 44G4 recognized a surface membrane component of vascular endothelium. Granulocytes, monocytes, B and T lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes cultured in the presence of PHA for 72 h did not express the 44G4 Ag. mAb 44G4 reacted weakly with leukemic cells from 28 of 41 patients with non-T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and 4 of 7 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, whereas 8 of 10 cases of T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia were negative. Moderate reactivity with leukemic cell lines of pre-B and myelomonocytic origin was also observed.

Immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from surface-iodinated endothelial cells and the immunizing pre-B leukemic cell line revealed that the 44G4 Ag from both cell types was composed of two subunits of apparent m.w. 95,000 linked by disulfide bond(s).

Moreover, the CSA-inducing monokine was neutralized by an anti-IL-1 antibody in vitro and, in the one case so tested, the same antibody also inhibited ""spontaneous"" colony growth. Therefore granulocyte/macrophage colony growth in JCGL is characteristically abnormal and distinguishes JCGL from the adult form of the disease. This abnormality depends upon the production, by mononuclear phagocytes, of IL-1 which, in turn, stimulates the release of high levels of colony stimulating activity by other cells.

The identities of the different isomers have been elucidated by selective labeling of [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with [32P]phosphate in the 3'-or 4',5'-positions and by following the metabolism of different radiolabeled inositol phosphates in extracts of RBL-2H3 cells. We report here that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, when incubated with the membrane fraction of extracts of RBL-2H3 cells, was converted to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Further dephosphorylation of the inositol polyphosphates proceeded rapidly in whole extracts of cells, although the process was significantly retarded when ATP (2 mM) levels were maintained by an ATP-regenerating system.

The possible implications of the apparent interconversion between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate in regulating histamine secretion in the RBL-2H3 cells are discussed.","['Cunha-Melo, J R', 'Dean, N M', 'Ali, H', 'Beaven, M A']","['Cunha-Melo JR', 'Dean NM', 'Ali H', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Rats', 'Sugar Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Tritium']",,1988/10/05 00:00,1988/10/05 00:01,['1988/10/05 00:00'],"['1988/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)68212-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Oct 5;263(28):14245-50.,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '102850-29-3 (inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)']",,,,,,,,

We report that MLR-3 identifies an early activation molecule since its binding is detectable on T cells 1.5-2 hr after in vitro activation. Its expression, therefore, does not require DNA synthesis and precedes, by many hours, that of the receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2R) and transferrin (TF-R). The MLR-3 antigen is also found on activated thymocytes (including the large early thymic CD3- subset) and B cells. The majority of T- and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, as well as the myeloid and erythroid cell lines HL60, GM1 and K562, are MLR-3+; conversely, non-haemopoietic cell lines are MLR-3 negative. Seventy percent of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and 15% of B non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) are MLR-3+. On tissue sections MLR-3 is reactive with epithelia, sweat glands, hair follicles and Henle's loop but not with vessels, connective, endothelium and many other tissues. In vitro studies show that MLR-3 (1-100 micrograms/ml) significantly alters the thymidine uptake of mitogen-treated lymphocytes:augmentation is found when T and B cells are induced with TPA-Ionomycin and reduction when induced with phytohaemoagglutinin (PHA) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC), respectively. On SDS-PAGE, MLR-3 immunoprecipitates a disulphide-linked heterodimer of MW 29,000-35,000: both subunits are glycosylated, phosphorylated and exhibit a pI of 4.1 and 5.0, respectively. Our data, particularly the in vitro results, suggest that the MRL-3 molecule could have an important role in the early hours of activation for the progression of resting lymphocytes into mitosis.","['Delia, D', 'Traversari, C', 'Ballinari, D', 'Cattoretti, G', 'Fontanella, E', 'Polli, N', 'Della Porta, G']","['Delia D', 'Traversari C', 'Ballinari D', 'Cattoretti G', 'Fontanella E', 'Polli N', 'Della Porta G']","['Division of Experimental Oncology A, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1988 Aug;64(4):593-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,PMC1384978,,,,

We have developed a three-step purification of PK-P from the interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent DA-1 murine leukemic cell line, entailing DEAE-Sephacel chromatography followed by TSK-3000 size exclusion and Mono-Q anion exchange HPLC steps. This yielded a 27-kd protein (from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) capable of preferentially phosphorylating the characteristic 75.5- and 77-kd endogenous substrates of PK-P previously noted. These observations were the basis for the development of a quantitative assay for PK-P, utilizing its separation from PK-C upon DEAE-Sephacel minicolumns followed by measurement of phosphatidylglycerol-stimulated histone H2B phosphorylation. This assay, and an analogous assay for PK-C, was then used to study the response of IL-3-starved DA-1 cells to IL-3 restimulation. PK-C exhibited cytosol to particulate redistribution following either IL-3 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, as has been previously described by others using similar systems. PK-P exhibited a rapid decrease in total activity following either IL-3 or PMA treatment, suggesting a response to PK-C activation. This was followed by a recovery phase during which PK-P activity slowly increased, with preferential redistribution into the particulate fraction of IL-3- but not PMA-treated cells. This difference in redistribution was thus likely to be under the control of signal transduction events other than PK-C activation. DA-1 PK-P thus exhibits a complex pattern of modulation by IL-3 and PMA, and may therefore constitute a new component of the cellular signal transduction cascade.","['Klemm, D J', 'Elias, L']","['Klemm DJ', 'Elias L']","['Department of Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylglycerols', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1988 Nov;16(10):855-60.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Phosphatidylglycerols)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (protein kinase P)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['1 R01 CA42520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The cells were treated in vitro with or without stimulating agents: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and/or phorbol-ester (TPA) were the most frequently used. Fourteen cell lines of continuous growth were established from cells from 11 patients, but only four of these were proven to be derived from the original leukaemic cells. Only in the latter four lines were the karyotypic abnormalities and the patterns of immunoglobulin (Ig)-gene rearrangements identical to those found in the patients' leukaemic cells. On the other 10 lines, five had both kappa- and lambda-producing cells, and the remaining five, despite showing light-chain restriction, were proved to be non-leukaemic clones by comparing the Ig-gene rearrangement patterns before and after culture. Three of the four leukaemic cell lines (JVM-2, JVM-3 and JVM-13) were induced by EBV + TPA and derived from prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) cases; the fourth (JVM-14) originated from a case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with increased percentage of prolymphocytes whose cells were stimulated in vitro with EBV. The immunophenotype of the three PLL lines is more mature than that of the original prolymphocytes, as shown by a reduction in surface-Ig and FMC7 expression, enhancement of cytoplasmic-Ig and increase in CD38- and transferrin receptor-positive cells. The cells from line JVM-14 retained the CD5-antigen, a marker of CLL. This study suggests that PLL and some CLL clones are arrested at a stage of maturation ideally suited to be triggered to continuous proliferation in culture. The presence of consistent chromosomal abnormalities in PLL may offer an alternative explanation for the greater proliferative potential of these cells in vitro.","['Melo, J V', 'Foroni, L', 'Brito-Babapulle, V', 'Luzzatto, L', 'Catovsky, D']","['Melo JV', 'Foroni L', 'Brito-Babapulle V', 'Luzzatto L', 'Catovsky D']","['MRC Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chronic Disease', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1988 Jul;73(1):23-8.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,PMC1541467,,,,

Although of a responder H-2 type, AKR.H-2b mice could not raise cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against a syngeneic GCSA+ tumor (AKR.H-2bSL1). In contrast, AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice served as a source for ""antiviral"" CTLs specific for GCSA+ tumors such as AKR.H-2bSL1, but not for CTLs against the cl.18-5 variant tumor, an antiviral CTL-resistant subclone derived from AKR.H-2bSL1. In the present study in vivo tumor challenge experiments demonstrated that both the ability of the recipient strain to raise CTLs and the sensitivity of the tumor to the CTLs were critical factors which determine tumor growth and recipient mortality. Furthermore, the ability to raise protective immunity against AKR.H-2bSL1 and cl.18-5 tumor challenge by preimmunization was investigated. It was not possible to raise protective immunity in CTL-nonresponder AKR.H-2b mice. In the case of AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice, immunization with allogeneic GCSA+ E male G2 tumor cells leads to complete protective immunity--not only against parental AKR.H-2bSL1 but, somewhat surprisingly, also against cl.18-5 variant, tumor challenge. Consistent with these findings and at the same time with an in vivo role for antiviral CTL, however, CTLs directed to the E male G2, AKR.H-2bSL1, and cl.18-5 tumors could be generated from the spleens of mice which had rejected cl.18-5 tumor cells. Interestingly, immunization of AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice with syngeneic AKR.H-2bSL1 tumor cells failed to raise any protective immunity. Thus, the data suggested that the concurrent recognition of allogeneic components with tumor-associated transplantation antigens (TATA) might be important in the induction of sufficient protective immunity against syngeneic GCSA+ tumors. Finally, the possible relationship of TATA and retroviral antigens, such as gp70 and p30 or as defined by CTL clones, is discussed.","['Azuma, H', 'Wegmann, K W', 'Green, W R']","['Azuma H', 'Wegmann KW', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03756.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(88)90215-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(88)90215-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1988 Oct 1;116(1):123-34. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(88)90215-8.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']","['CA43475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO4 CA01112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

No significant radiobiological differences were observed between T-lineage versus B-lineage ALL LPC. Notably, the D0 values displayed a significant interpatient variation in both groups, indicating a pronounced heterogeneity in the radiation sensitivity of LPC. LPC from some patients were very radioresistant, and in additional experiments using cryopreserved bone marrow blasts, up to 32% of LPC could survive 1600 cGy delivered at 100 cGy/min. In six of 11 T-lineage ALL cases and five of ten B-lineage ALL cases, a distinct initial shoulder was present on the single dose radiation survival curves, providing circumstantial evidence that LPC are able to repair sublethal radiation damage. A greater proportion of LPC survived 400 cGy when the dose was delivered in two fractions instead of a single dose, providing direct evidence that LPC in ALL possess a substantial capacity to repair sublethal radiation damage. The interpatient differences in Dq and recovery factor values indicated a marked heterogeneity in the ability of LPC to repair sublethal radiation damage. Analysis of the dose rate effects on the radiation survival of LPC in four ALL cases suggested that the radiation sensitivity of LPC is dose rate dependent.

Clinicopathologic study of 21 cases of a unique type of low-grade lymphoma.,1531-8,"The morphologic and immunologic features of three cases of an unusual and distinct B-cell lymphoma were recently described and termed monocytoid B-cell lymphoma (MBCL) because of the striking resemblance of the neoplastic cells to reactive monocytoid B-lymphocytes. The morphologic spectrum and the clinical behavior of MBCL were investigated in a series of 21 patients. This study indicates that patients with MBCL usually present with lymphadenopathy and Stage I or II disease. MBCL also occurs at extranodal sites including the salivary gland. Because four of the patients with MBCL had Sjogren's syndrome with characteristic laboratory profiles, these results raise the possibility that there may be a relationship between MBCL and Sjogren's syndrome. Eight patients were male and 13 female (M:F = 1:1.6), and MBCL primarily involved the elderly (median age, 66 years). The most striking clinical findings were high percentages of complete remissions and long survival times indicating that MBCL is a low-grade lymphoma. Of 21 patients investigated, 18 were in complete remission at the time of completion of this study. Two patients died with the disease and one was lost to follow-up. Patients with localized MBCL may have a better survival rate than those with generalized disease. Like other low-grade lymphomas, MBCL can progress to a higher grade lymphoma of large cell type. Unlike other low-grade lymphomas, in MBCL splenomegaly, bone marrow involvement, and leukemic conversion are uncommon.","['Sheibani, K', 'Burke, J S', 'Swartz, W G', 'Nademanee, A', 'Winberg, C D']","['Sheibani K', 'Burke JS', 'Swartz WG', 'Nademanee A', 'Winberg CD']","['Division of Pathology, James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Salivary Glands/pathology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/pathology""]",,1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19881015)62:8<1531::aid-cncr2820620814>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Oct 15;62(8):1531-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19881015)62:8<1531::aid-cncr2820620814>3.0.co;2-a.,,"['CA26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Lymphoblasts were isolated from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis and cultured in vitro with or without dexamethasone. DNA was then purified from the cells and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Only high molecular weight (mol wt) DNA was present in cells cultured without dexamethasone, but a ladder of DNA fragments ranging in size from 180 to 200 base pairs (bp) to greater than 1,500 bp was present in cells cultured with dexamethasone. The DNA fragments were multiples of 180 to 200 bp, suggesting an internucleosomal site of DNA cleavage. The same pattern of DNA fragmentation was detected in normal thymocytes isolated from adrenalectomized rats following in vivo treatment with dexamethasone and in S49 mouse thymoma cells after in vitro incubation with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone-induced DNA fragmentation preceded overt loss of viability in glucocorticoid-sensitive cells but was not detected in two variants of the S49 cell line that are glucocorticoid resistant owing to glucocorticoid receptor defects.

Radiolabeled IL-2 binding assay revealed 750 high-affinity and 6,750 low-affinity binding sites per cell. In accordance with the expression of high-affinity IL-2 receptors, the leukemic cells proliferated in response to exogenous IL-2 without prior stimulation. In addition, exogenous IL-4 also induced their proliferation. Moreover, IL-2 and IL-4 exerted a synergistic effect on the leukemic cell proliferation. Although the expression of IL-2 or IL-4 mRNA was not detected in fresh leukemic cells, the expression of IL-2 mRNA, but not IL-4 mRNA, was induced by phytohemagglutinin stimulation, and the leukemic cells proliferated.

Among C57BL/6 lymphoma cells progression toward a more malignant phenotype was observed in TB6-3 cells, and in their derived clones, after several in vitro passages. This event was accompanied by the in vitro loss of requirement for exogenous growth factor(s) when tumorigenic TB6-3 cells were plated at high density.

During this period, the cells were assessed for phenotype and for cytotoxic responses in a 4-h 51Cr release microcytotoxicity assay. The CTCs continued to show specific lysis of autologous leukemic cells and bone marrow (BM) cells. However, the nonspecific lysis of natural killer (NK) targets and the proportion of cells showing NK phenotype (HNK-1 antigen) increased progressively on cultivation in IL-2-containing medium. Therefore cells showing CD8 phenotype and specific cytotoxic function were segregated by cloning CTCs under the condition of limiting dilution in the presence of allogeneic feeder cells and IL-2-containing medium. Three cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones expressing CD3+, CD8+, and HLA DR+ phenotypes were obtained from CTCs of 2 CML patients. These clonoid populations, maintained in IL-2-containing medium and periodic antigenic stimulation with autologous leukemic cells, showed specific lysis of autologous leukemic cells and BM cells even at lower (10:1) effector:target ratios. They did not kill K562 (erythroblastoid leukemic NK target cell line) cells and autologous phytohemagglutinin-induced blasts. These clones apparently functioned in an MHC-restricted manner as they did not lyse allogeneic CML cells which would also express a similar set of maturation antigens if sensitization was, as it appeared, against these antigens. Finally, interaction of autologous BM cells with CTL clones reduced the colony forming potential of BM cells only to the extent of 18%-30%. The results therefore indicate that such CTL clones can possibly be used in adoptive immunotherapy as they showed minimal BM toxicity.","['Somasundaram, R', 'Advani, S H', 'Gangal, S G']","['Somasundaram R', 'Advani SH', 'Gangal SG']","['Immunology Division, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00200025 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1988;27(2):183-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00200025.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,

Sensitization of lymphocytes from CML patients with either autologous leukemic cells or BM cells generated cytotoxic cells (CTCs) capable of killing both the targets. These results suggested that in CML, the PBL may have been sensitized to myeloid maturation-releated antigens in vivo, which, on secondary stimulation in vitro, may result in differentiation of CTCs cytotoxic to immature myeloid cells, either from autologous leukemic cells or autologous BM. The inability of PBL from patients with oral cancers to lyse autologous BM cells upon in vitro stimulation, supported this possibility. Clonogenic assays conducted to assess the colony forming potential of BM cells which had interacted with CTCs indicated that there was about 37% reduction in committed granulocyte stem cell colony formation without an appreciable change in committed granulocyte/monocyte stem cell units and clusters.

Therefore, the effects of TGF-beta 1 on mouse hematopoiesis were studied. TGF-beta 1 is a potent inhibitor of IL-3-induced bone marrow proliferation, but it does not inhibit the proliferation induced by granulocyte/macrophage, colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte CSF, and erythropoietin (Epo). TGF-beta 1 also inhibits IL-3-induced multipotential colony formation of bone marrow cells in soft agar, which includes early erythroid differentiation, while Epo-induced terminal differentiation is unaffected. In addition, IL-3-induced granulocyte/macrophage colonies were inhibited; however, small clusters of differentiated myeloid cells were consistently seen in cultures containing IL-3 and TGF-beta 1. Thus, TGF-beta 1 selectively inhibits early hematopoietic progenitor growth and differentiation but not more mature progenitors.

Therefore, TGF-beta 1 functions as a selective regulator of differentiating normal hematopoietic cells, and suppresses myeloid leukemic cell growth.","['Keller, J R', 'Mantel, C', 'Sing, G K', 'Ellingsworth, L R', 'Ruscetti, S K', 'Ruscetti, F W']","['Keller JR', 'Mantel C', 'Sing GK', 'Ellingsworth LR', 'Ruscetti SK', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Program Resources, Inc., National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factors']",,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.168.2.737 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Aug 1;168(2):737-50. doi: 10.1084/jem.168.2.737.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Peptides)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC2189000,,,,

The availability of the purified and, more recently, recombinant IL-1 has allowed the characterization of other biological properties of this molecule. Thus, IL-1 is thought to have the same properties as hemopoietic 1, a growth factor that has been shown to act on primitive murine hemopoietic cells. Here we report that rIL-1 acts synergistically with granulocyte/macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) or granulocyte CSF in the stimulation of clonogenic cells from many patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Although IL-1 by itself has no effect on AML blasts, it can support colony formation under conditions where there is detectable production of endogenous GM-CSF. IL-1 also promotes the growth of multipotential progenitors from normal human bone marrow cells in the presence of GM-CSF. These observations support the hypothesis that in the hemopoietic system, IL-1 has a selective effect on primitive precursors.","['Hoang, T', 'Haman, A', 'Goncalves, O', 'Letendre, F', 'Mathieu, M', 'Wong, G G', 'Clark, S C']","['Hoang T', 'Haman A', 'Goncalves O', 'Letendre F', 'Mathieu M', 'Wong GG', 'Clark SC']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.168.2.463 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Aug 1;168(2):463-74. doi: 10.1084/jem.168.2.463.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,PMC2189011,,,,

To investigate the pathogenesis of this coagulopathy, suspensions of purified leukemic cells were prepared and tested for procoagulant activity. Neither the leukemic cells nor their supernatants directly accelerated the clotting of plasma. Since the leukemic cells did not possess direct procoagulant activity, their ability or inability to elaborate a mediator of cellular coagulant properties, interleukin-1, was studied. Leukemic cells from patients with coagulopathy elaborated interleukin-1, and addition of phytohemagglutinin increased interleukin-1 release. In contrast, no interleukin-1 was released, before or after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, from leukemic cells from patients without coagulopathy. Leukemic cells from another group of patients with abnormalities of coagulation released interleukin-1 only after phytohemagglutinin treatment. In terms of the coagulation mechanism, interleukin-1 containing supernatants from leukemic cell cultures induced the procoagulant receptor tissue factor, a co-factor in the initiation of coagulation, on the endothelial cell surface. There was coordinate suppression of the anticoagulant endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin, a co-factor for the antithrombotic protein C pathway. Antibody to interleukin-1 prevented these changes in cellular coagulant properties. Taken together, these changes result in a shift in the balance of endothelial cell coagulant properties to an activated state in which mechanisms promoting procoagulant reactions on the vessel surface predominate. Synthesis and release of the mediator interleukin-1 by leukemic cells thus defines a new mechanism through which malignant cells can potentially activate the coagulation mechanism.","['Cozzolino, F', 'Torcia, M', 'Miliani, A', 'Carossino, A M', 'Giordani, R', 'Cinotti, S', 'Filimberti, E', 'Saccardi, R', 'Bernabei, P', 'Guidi, G']","['Cozzolino F', 'Torcia M', 'Miliani A', 'Carossino AM', 'Giordani R', 'Cinotti S', 'Filimberti E', 'Saccardi R', 'Bernabei P', 'Guidi G', 'et al.']","['4th Department of Internal Medicine, University of Firenze, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*etiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*blood/pathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(88)90420-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(88)90420-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1988 Feb;84(2):240-50. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(88)90420-2.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']","['CA83902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CTR1971/CT/CIT NIH HHS/United States', 'HL34625/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Unlike other cells in which GR regulation has been examined, the growth of these cells is inhibited by glucocorticoids, leading to cell death. Treatment of glucocorticoid-sensitive CEM-C7 cells with 1 microM dexamethasone for 18 h resulted in an increase in both cytoplasmic and nuclear GR protein, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-human GR antisera. Analysis of GR mRNA levels by Northern blotting revealed a corresponding increase in mRNA in steroid-treated cells. An increase in GR mRNA was detectable after as little as 3 h of treatment with dexamethasone, and GR mRNA concentration continued to increase for at least 18 h, well before the onset of growth arrest or cell death. GR mRNA concentration was not altered after dexamethasone treatment of the glucocorticoid-resistant mutant cell line ICR27TK.3, which lacks functional GR. Thus, the increase in GR seen in glucocorticoid-sensitive cells is a GR-mediated response. These results are in sharp contrast to the down-regulation of GR reported in other cells and tissues, and suggest that regulation of the GR by its cognate ligand may be tissue-specific.","['Eisen, L P', 'Elsasser, M S', 'Harmon, J M']","['Eisen LP', 'Elsasser MS', 'Harmon JM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4799.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/08/25 00:00,1988/08/25 00:01,['1988/08/25 00:00'],"['1988/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)37890-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Aug 25;263(24):12044-8.,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'O9S11FMA79 (dexamethasone 21-methanesulfonate)']",['CA32226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

All cases had greater than 3% myeloperoxidase and Sudan black B-positive leukemic blasts, and blasts from seven cases contained Auer rods. Reactivity of the cells with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) indicated that leukemic cells in all cases expressed myeloid-associated (CD11b, CD13) surface antigens, further supporting the diagnosis of AML. However, blasts from every patient coexpressed the T-cell-associated surface CD2 and CD7 as well as cytoplasmic CD3 antigens. Blasts from five patients expressed surface CD25, whereas blasts from only one expressed surface CD3. Five patients had rearranged T-cell receptor beta-chain genes, whereas only three had rearranged T-cell receptor gamma-chain genes. This pattern of lineage-related gene expression appears to define a distinct subtype of AML with T-lymphoid features (CD2+ AML) and could reflect either aberrant gene expression in leukemic blasts or transformation of a pluripotent stem cell having a flexible pattern of gene expression. Clinically, these 10 patients presented at an older age with a higher leukocyte count and a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy than did children whose blast cells were characteristic of myeloid leukemia. Patients with CD2+ AML also had poorer responses to remission induction therapy (50% v 80% entered complete remission, P = .05). However, each of the five children who failed induction chemotherapy on AML protocols had a striking response to drug combinations usually reserved for lymphoid leukemia.

Three molecular species of neutral GSL and greater than or equal to 13 molecular species of acidic sialosyl-GSL (ganglioside) were detectable on high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) in untreated MOLT-3 cells. The major components were ceramide monohexoside and gangliosides GM3 and GD1a.

The activity of one sialyltransferases, CMP-sialic acid:CDH sialyltransferase, which synthesizes ganglioside GM3 and the total sialic acid content of the cell surface, parallelled the extent of cell differentiation. Examination of another human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, HPB-ALL, indicated that TPA could also induce the cells to differentiate along T-cell lineage and that changes in the ganglioside pattern during differentiation are similar to those of MOLT-3 cells. The results indicate that human T-lymphoid cell differentiation intimately involves elongation of neutral oligosaccharide-moieties and the addition of sialic acid residues to gangliosides, resulting in more mature T cells containing higher gangliosides.

Twenty percent (4/20) of the Ig kappa light chain-expressing CLL cells reacted with 17.109, a MoAb against a major CRI on human IgM autoantibodies that is encoded by a conserved Ig variable-region gene (V gene) of the V kappa IIIb sub-subgroup. Another MoAb specific for V kappa IIIb framework determinant(s) reacted exclusively with all the 17.109-reactive CLL cells. Only one of 20 kappa light-chain-expressing CLL cells reacted with 6B6.6, a monoclonal antibody specific for a CRI commonly found on rheumatoid factor (RF) paraproteins with light-chain variable regions of the V kappa IIIa sub-subgroup. Finally, greater than 20% (8/34) of all CLL reacted with G6, a MoAb specific for an Ig heavy chain-associated CRI present on several RF paraproteins. In contrast, these CRIs were expressed at significantly lower frequencies in NHL of follicular center cell origin. Only one of 30 NHL expressing kappa light chains reacted with the 17.109 MoAb. Also, in contrast to the concordance between the 17.109-CRI and V kappa IIIb framework determinant(s) in CLL, two lymphomas in addition to the 17.109-reactive lymphoma were recognized by the anti-V kappa IIIb framework MoAb. None of the NHL reacted with either the 6B6.6 or the G6 MoAbs. These results are the first to demonstrate that CLL and NHL differ with respect to the expression of autoantibody-associated CRIs. The data support the notion that NHL of follicular center cell origin differs from CLL in its utilization and/or somatic mutation of Ig variable-region genes. The physiological and immunotherapeutic implications of these findings are discussed.","['Kipps, T J', 'Robbins, B A', 'Kuster, P', 'Carson, D A']","['Kipps TJ', 'Robbins BA', 'Kuster P', 'Carson DA']","['Department of Basic and Clinical Research, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cross Reactions', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81010-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Aug;72(2):422-8.,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']","['AR25443/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR33489/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR38475/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

We have examined the proliferative response of 30 B-cell tumours to anti-Ig in the presence and absence of B-cell growth factor. Three reaction patterns were observed. In 12 cases a dose-dependent synergism between anti-Ig and B-cell growth factor was present in the induction of proliferation, in ten cases anti-Ig did not induce any response, and in eight cases anti-Ig suppressed the B-cell growth factor (BCGF)-induced proliferation. Similar responses to anti-Ig were found in the absence of BCGF. When these B-cell tumours were typed for expression of Ig isotypes, HLA class II antigens, several B-cell markers, activation markers, complement receptors, Fc receptors, cell size, and cell cycle phase, no correlation could be found with the proliferative response of these tumour B cells to anti-Ig. T cells or T-cell factors were not involved, because T-cell depletion did not change the tumour B-cell proliferative response to incubation with anti-Ig. The observed inhibition of proliferation did not correlate with the expression of Fc receptors, indicating the involvement of suppressor mechanisms other than the cross-linking of Fc receptors with surface immunoglobulins. Tumour B cells, for which monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (MoAb anti-id) were available, responded to MoAb anti-id in the same way as they did to anti-Ig. In view of the treatment of B-cell malignancies with MoAb anti-id, the question of whether these responses in vitro correlate with in vivo clinical outcome of anti-id therapy is of interest. So far our data show that the proliferative response of B-cell tumours to anti-Ig or MoAb anti-id is heterogeneous and cannot be linked to phenotype, is T cell-independent, and is most likely an intrinsic property of the malignant cell.","['Allebes, W A', 'Wetzels, R H', 'Capel, P J']","['Allebes WA', 'Wetzels RH', 'Capel PJ']","['Department of Nephrology, University Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*physiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, T-Independent/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb02420.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1988 Jul;28(1):95-103. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb02420.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, T-Independent)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",,,,,,,,

No difference was observed in the first-phase half-life, in systemic clearance or in the volume of distribution of the drug (P greater than 0.05). The concentration of MTX at the end of the infusion was approximately 4-fold higher when the drug was given over only 6 h. However, patients receiving 24-h infusions had approximately 9-fold higher levels by 24 h after the beginning of the infusion. The area under the data curve from start of the MTX infusion until the beginning of folinic acid rescue administration was significantly higher in patients with osteogenic sarcoma (6-h infusions), while the area under the log-data curve was significantly longer in the ALL group (24-h infusions) for the same period. The latter parameter is considered to be characteristic for the concentration-time-effect relationship. The longer duration of MTX administration (with delayed rescue) is thought to be more beneficial from the pharmacokinetic aspect. Patients with osteogenic sarcoma had significantly lower concentrations of MTX at the end of their last treatment with MTX than at the end of the first infusion. Patients developing MTX toxicity had shorter half-lives of MTX in the beta phase. It is suggested that cisplatin induced tubular loss of MTX and folinic acid is responsible for these observations.

Preliminary results in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma.,82-8,"A wide variety of human cancers currently have no effective treatment and are potential targets for lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cellular immunotherapy. Relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and neuroblastoma are two of the major therapeutic challenges in pediatric oncology today. However, one problem which makes LAK immunotherapy in children particularly difficult is obtaining the large numbers of cells required. Present adult therapeutic LAK protocols have utilized short-term (5 day) cultures of interleukin-2 (IL2)-activated cells which are initially obtained from leukopheresis. Since routine use of this procedure in small children is not practical, we have investigated a different approach to obtain increased cell numbers by activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with OKT3, a mitogenic anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, and IL2. Cell growth and LAK activity in OKT3 + IL2-activated cultures were compared to cultures activated with IL2 alone in 2 children with relapsed ALL and 2 children with stage IV neuroblastoma. OKT3 + IL2-activated cultures had marked increases in cell number: after 14 days the OKT3 + IL2-activated cultures yielded an approximately 500-fold increase in cell number compared to a 7-fold increase for cultures activated with IL2 alone. In vitro 51Cr release assays were used to estimate LAK activity of the cultures at 7 and 14 days. When tested against HL60, a natural killer (NK)-resistant tumor cell line, not only were total cytolytic units greatly increased in OKT3 + IL2-stimulated cultures by lytic activity on a per cell basis (lytic units/1 x 10(6) cells) had also markedly increased on day 14 of culture. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that 80% to 90% of cells in OKT3 + IL2-stimulated cultures were CD3 + T cells. Variable low percentages of CD16 + NK cells were seen in these cultures. In summary, OKT3 + IL2 activation resulted in a large increase in cell yield and the development of high level LAK activity using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with cancer.

In the case reported here the diagnostic problems raised by the appearance of cutaneous nodules in a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) were solved by histo-immunological examinations. A 70-year old male patient had been presenting since 1976 with a psoriasis-like skin disease. He was first seen at the Argenteuil hospital in 1984. Physical examination showed psoriasiform finger-like erythemato-squamous lesions, infiltrated plaques and an ulcerated tumoral swelling of the right elbow. A diagnosis of mycosis fungoides was made on histological and immunological examination results. At histology, this epidermotropic lymphoma was peculiar in that the atypical infiltrate was clearly centred on vessels. Electron microscopy confirmed that the vascular walls were invaded by the mycosis cells. Additional examinations showed hyperleucocytosis and myelaemia which were rapidly attributed to a chronic myelocytic leukaemia since the Philadelphia chromosome was present and the leucocytes had a low alkaline phosphatase score. Bone marrow biopsy disclosed a myeloproliferative syndrome of the CML type. Biopsy of a right axillary lymph node showed myelocytic infiltration associated with dermopathic lymphadenitis. There were no circulating Sezary cells, and a search for extension proved negative. From May, 1984 to June, 1985 the patient's CML was treated with busulfan which produced blood and bone marrow remission. The skin lesions were treated first with mechlorethamine, then with topical corticosteroids. Superficial electron therapy was applied to the tumoral lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Sigal Nahum, M', 'Rostoker, G', 'Gaulier, A', 'Urbajtel, M', 'Raphael, M', 'Bouzamondo, A', 'Sigal, S']","['Sigal Nahum M', 'Rostoker G', 'Gaulier A', 'Urbajtel M', 'Raphael M', 'Bouzamondo A', 'Sigal S']","[""Service de Dermatologie, Hopital d'Argenteuil.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*complications/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1988;115(2):159-66.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,Association mycosis fongoide et leucemie myeloide chronique.

The authors have initially found that these reagents are useful in elimination of malignant lymphomas cells from human bone marrow for autologous bone marrow transplantation. In the current study, the authors have further characterized the reactivity of these antibodies in B-cell neoplasia and have analyzed the heterogeneity of antigenic expression among benign and neoplastic lymphoid cells for B-cell monoclonal antibodies. With the use of quantitative flow cytometric techniques to assess heterogeneity of antigen expression, the findings indicate that phenotypic heterogeneity within neoplasms from individual patients exists for a number of B-cell-related monoclonal antibodies, including B1, common acute lymphocyte leukemia antigen (CALLA), Ia, Ba-1, DLC-48, and LN-1. Within a given histologic class of lymphoid neoplasia, phenotypic heterogeneity was found to be a property of some individual cases and not others for all B-cell monoclonal antibodies examined. This heterogeneity was not consistently expressed in patients with similar tumors, nor was it a consistent property of a given antigen. Using cell lines derived from large cell lymphomas, the authors were able to find phenotypic heterogeneity within neoplastic cell lines that can be used to develop models for dealing with phenotypic heterogeneity in the context of complement-mediated cell lysis. They also established that for DLC-48 and LN-1, the heterogeneity was not related to the phase of the cell cycle of the proliferating cells. The results suggest that single monoclonal antibody treatment for bone marrow depletion of neoplastic cell may be insufficient to overcome phenotypic heterogeneity of B-cell neoplasms.","['Marder, R J', 'Winter, J', 'Epstein, A']","['Marder RJ', 'Winter J', 'Epstein A']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/90.2.149 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1988 Aug;90(2):149-55. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/90.2.149.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,

AIF is also produced by normal mature cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. We studied the effects of AIF on the differentiation of normal GM progenitors and found an increase in the number of mature cells in AIF-exposed cultures. This increase did not occur when AIF was pretreated with anti-heart ferritin antiserum or when basic isoferritin was used in the place of AIF. The influence of AIF was not mimicked by removing S phase cells by pretreatment with a pulse of high specific activity tritiated thymidine. Thus, the apparent differentiation-stimulating effect of AIF is not likely to be due to selective removal of immature dividing cells. The results suggest that AIF-inhibitory activity on the proliferation of GM progenitors might at least in part be mediated by a stimulus for differentiation of the target cells, thus regulating the number of mature cells which might be formed by a single progenitor cell.","['Guimaraes, J E', 'Berney, J J', 'Broxmeyer, H E', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Francis, G E']","['Guimaraes JE', 'Berney JJ', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Francis GE']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Ferritins', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jul;2(7):466-71.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (acidic isoferritin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']","['CA 36740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,

The diminished rate of Ara-C transport concomitant with Ara-CTP formation after TPA treatment is considered to be the biochemical basis for this acquired resistance.","['Takimoto, T', 'Kubota, M', 'Tsuruta, S', 'Kitoh, T', 'Tanizawa, A', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Kiriyama, Y', 'Mikawa, H']","['Takimoto T', 'Kubota M', 'Tsuruta S', 'Kitoh T', 'Tanizawa A', 'Akiyama Y', 'Kiriyama Y', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jul;2(7):443-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and mezerein were found to be capable of inducing c-WRT-7 cells to secret IL-1, while non-stimulated c-WRT-7 cells were unable to produce any IL-1 whatever. After treatment of c-WRT-7 cells with LPS, IL-1 activity reached a maximum level after approximately 48 hrs of culture. Supernatants from LPS-stimulated c-WRT-7 cells promoted the proliferation of thymocytes initiated by suboptimal doses of lectins, and restored depressed mitogenic responses of macrophage depleted spleen cells. However, no detectable interleukin 2 (IL-2) activity was observed in the supernatants of LPS-stimulated c-WRT-7 cells. The IL-1 from c-WRT-7 cells had an apparent molecular weight between 15,000 and 20,000 when measured by gel filtration. The thymocyte comitogenic activity was maintained mainly at alkaline pH and the reduction was noted at the pH below 4. The activity was partially inactivated by heating at 60 degrees C for 60 min or at 70 degrees C for more than 10 min. Papain and pronase reduced the activity completely, whereas chymotrypsin and trypsin had little effect.

The colony-to-cluster ratio of CFU-GM and the dose-response curves of CFU-GM to stimulation by rhGM-CSF in vitro did not change during the clinical trial. However, the percentage of CFU-GM in DNA synthesis, which is a measure of the proliferative rates of these cells, determined by the high specific activity tritiated thymidine kill technique in vitro, was markedly enhanced in a reversible fashion after administration in vivo of rhGM-CSF. The increased cycling rates of CFU-GM were consistent with the induced increase in neutrophil counts in these patients that has been reported elsewhere. Additionally, marrow CFU-GM from patients given rhGM-CSF in vivo were increased in sensitivity to inhibition in vitro by recombinant human H-subunit (acidic) ferritin in two of eight cases, and were increased in sensitivity to inhibition by lower dosages of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha in all patients evaluated. The sensitivity of CFU-GM to inhibition in vitro by recombinant human interferon gamma and prostaglandin E1 did not change during the clinical trial. These studies demonstrate that the rhGM-CSF is having an effect on CFU-GM in the patients on the phase I clinical trial.

In five patients (12%), a clonal aberration was found only once. Six patients (15%) showed changes of the karyotype. One treated patient with multiple aberrations acquired another monosomy. Another patient with multiple aberrations and prolymphocytic transformation gained a marker chromosome. One treated patient with an initially normal karyotype acquired two independent clonal aberrations. Three patients lost one subclone but retained another clone that increased in frequency. In two cases, clonal changes were associated with clinical changes. The chromosomal aberrations are mostly established already at diagnosis and mark the disease of the CLL patient.

In this study, we examined the rearrangement of the recently discovered T-cell delta chain genes in a variety of lymphoproliferative diseases. We show here that six of 14 T-cell lymphomas and five of 23 B-cell lymphomas or B-cell leukemia cell lines have rearranged the delta loci, while two of two hyperimmune reactions retain germline configuration within these genes. Seven of ten cases of AILD were rearranged, and Lennert's lymphoma, which has been previously described as a T-cell malignancy, also contains rearrangements in the delta chain genes (three of five). Large cell anaplastic lymphomas positive for the activation antigen CD 30 also contain rearrangement in about one-half (five of 11) of the tumors examined. Two of seven of the Hodgkin's lymphomas studied contained a rearrangement for this gene. This study indicates that this newly identified T-cell delta gene is useful in evaluating clonality but is not lineage specific. However, with only one exception (in 28 rearrangements), this gene rearranges in tumors with gamma and beta chain gene rearrangements, indicating that when used in conjunction with the other TcR genes, delta rearrangement may also be useful in evaluating lineages.","['Tkachuk, D C', 'Griesser, H', 'Takihara, Y', 'Champagne, E', 'Minden, M', 'Feller, A C', 'Lennert, K', 'Mak, T W']","['Tkachuk DC', 'Griesser H', 'Takihara Y', 'Champagne E', 'Minden M', 'Feller AC', 'Lennert K', 'Mak TW']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80597-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):353-7.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,

Our earlier finding that the mantle zone (MZ) but not the germinal center (GC) of normal lymph nodes (LN) is CD1c+, CD1a-, and CD1b- prompted us to further investigate the expression of these molecules on normal, activated, and malignant B cells. We report that blood and spleen contain CD1c+ B cells that account for 49% +/- 20.4% (mean +/- SD) and 50.9% +/- 4.4% of the total B cell population, respectively. CD1a- and CD1b-specific MoAbs are unreactive with both B and T cells; these latter are CD1c- as well. When CD1c+ and CD1c- B cells are activated in vitro, the CD1c molecule is upregulated in the former subset and induced de novo in the latter. Conversely, activated blood T cells remain CD1c-. Neither CD1a nor CD1b molecules are detected on activated T and B lymphocytes. At ultrastructural level, the CD1c+ B cells exhibit distinctive features, namely, condensed chromatin with or without a nucleolus and a unique cluster of cytoplasmic vesicles and organelles; the number of nucleolated cells is higher in the spleen (95%) than in the tonsil (40%) or blood (5%). These findings further confirm the similarity between blood and MZ B cells. The CD1c expression assessed on 27 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL) and 46 B non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) was detected on 41% and 32% of cases, respectively; the latter comprised four follicular and 11 diffuse histotypes. The Burkitt's lymphomas were CD1c-negative. The B-cell neoplasms were all CD1a- and, except for four with a weak cytoplasmic staining, all CD1b- as well. The clear-cut CD1c distribution in normal LN (MZ+, GC-) contrasted with the evidence that some B-NHL cells of GC origin (eg, follicular with predominantly small cleaved cells) were CD1c+. Overall, the finding that CD1c expression is restricted to a fraction of B cells present in lymphoid organs and in peripheral blood indicates that CD1c is a powerful marker for the identification and dissection of B-cell subsets whose functional properties can now be evaluated.","['Delia, D', 'Cattoretti, G', 'Polli, N', 'Fontanella, E', 'Aiello, A', 'Giardini, R', 'Rilke, F', 'Della Porta, G']","['Delia D', 'Cattoretti G', 'Polli N', 'Fontanella E', 'Aiello A', 'Giardini R', 'Rilke F', 'Della Porta G']","['Division of Experimental Oncology A, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80580-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):241-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,

A synergistic antitumor effect was observed in resting cells between irradiation and 2'-deoxycoformycin/deoxyadenosine, with the dose required to reduce the surviving cell fraction to 0.1 being 25% lower than predicted for an additive effect. Synergy was enhanced with increasing deoxyadenosine concentration or with increasing radiation dose. When cells were treated with 2'-deoxycoformycin/deoxyadenosine for 1 h prior to irradiation, synergy was increased by prolonging postirradiation drug treatment. With 4-h postirradiation exposure to drug, varying the preirradiation incubation time did not affect synergy. In contrast, only a small enhancement of antitumor activity was observed in irradiated proliferating cells treated with 2'-deoxycoformycin/deoxyadenosine. Incubation of resting cells with 2'-deoxycoformycin/deoxyadenosine resulted in inhibition of the rate and extent of repair of radiation-induced DNA single strand breaks and an increase in dATP, but had no effect on NAD or ATP. With removal of drug, the dATP level fell rapidly and DNA repair resumed. Repair of DNA single strand breaks was more rapid in proliferating cells than in resting cells and was minimally affected by 2'-deoxycoformycin/deoxyadenosine, although the accumulation of dATP in these cells was 2-fold greater than in resting cells. The repair of DNA single strand breaks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells was as rapid as for proliferating L5178Y cells, but repair was significantly inhibited by 2'-deoxycoformycin/deoxyadenosine. These results suggest that 2'-deoxycoformycin/deoxyadenosine can function as a radiosensitizer, and this effect is associated with the cellular accumulation of dATP and inhibition of repair of DNA single strand breaks.","['Begleiter, A', 'Pugh, L', 'Israels, L G', 'Johnston, J B']","['Begleiter A', 'Pugh L', 'Israels LG', 'Johnston JB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology']",,1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jul 15;48(14):3981-6.,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",,,,,,,,

Madden et al. (Cancer Res 46 (1986) 617) have demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on these cells is due in part to an inhibition of cholesterol synthesis even in the presence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-containing serum. To delineate further the role of cholesterol in this growth inhibition, we have examined the ability of LDL-bound [3H]cholesterol linoleate to reverse the growth inhibitory effect of 1 microM dexamethasone on the CEM-C7 cells. LDL-bound cholesterol linoleate did not reverse the dexamethasone-mediated growth inhibition. Although incorporation of [14C]acetate into free cholesterol was inhibited only 20% by incubation with LDL, the presence of dexamethasone further inhibited acetate incorporation into free cholesterol in the LDL-treated cells. Dexamethasone had no effect on the uptake or utilization of LDL-bound cholesterol linoleate. Under all conditions, more than 99% of the acetate incorporated into cholesterol was present as free cholesterol, while over 80% of the LDL-derived cholesterol linoleate remained in the ester compartment. In contrast, in normal lymphocytes, over half the LDL-derived cholesterol was converted to free cholesterol. Direct analysis of the acid cholesterol ester hydrolase, the enzyme primarily responsible for processing LDL-bound cholesterol esters, revealed over 60-times the activity of this enzyme in the normal lymphocytes as compared to the activity present in the C7 cells. This finding cautions against the assumption that the presence of lipoprotein-containing serum provides an adequate, usable source of cholesterol for all cells.","['Cutts, J L', 'Melnykovych, G']","['Cutts JL', 'Melnykovych G']","['Department of Microbiology, Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/pharmacology', 'Cholesterol Esters/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol, LDL/*metabolism/physiology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleic Acids/pharmacology', 'Mevalonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(88)90131-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(88)90131-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Jul 1;961(1):65-72. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(88)90131-2.,"['0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (Linoleic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",['CA08315/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

These two results show that hormones can affect lymphocyte physiology through modulation of their ionic conductances in a way that might help explain some of the diverse effects of 5-HT on neuronal cells.","['Choquet, D', 'Korn, H']","['Choquet D', 'Korn H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U261, Departement des Biotechnologies, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Ketanserin/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Metergoline/pharmacology', 'Methiothepin/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Receptors, Serotonin/physiology', 'Serotonin/*pharmacology', 'Serotonin Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Tropanes/pharmacology', 'Tropisetron']",,1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.12.4557 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Jun;85(12):4557-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.12.4557.,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Receptors, Serotonin)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '0 (Tropanes)', '1501393LY5 (Metergoline)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '55D94103HL (Methiothepin)', '6I819NIK1W (Tropisetron)', '97F9DE4CT4 (Ketanserin)', 'O98T3677PA (bemesetron)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,,PMC280470,,,,

Their responses to CSFs were different from those of normal myeloid progenitors. First, the sensitivity of blasts to 0.01 ng/ml of G-CSF and 0.001 ng/ml of GM-CSF was significantly increased compared with normal. Second, in more than 70% of patients, the pattern of the responsiveness to the two CSFs was aberrant compared with ordered response in normal subjects. Third, in about half of the patients, combination of G-CSF and GM-CSF showed synergism for the growth of blast progenitors in both culture methods, whereas negligible or no synergism was observed in normal subjects. Finally, when stimulated by G-CSF, GM-CSF, or both, a significant relationship was noted between blast colony formation in methylcellulose and blast progenitor growth in suspension, suggesting that CSFs do not affect the balance between self-renewal and terminal divisions of blast stem cells.","['Murohashi, I', 'Nagata, K', 'Suzuki, T', 'Maruyama, Y', 'Nara, N']","['Murohashi I', 'Nagata K', 'Suzuki T', 'Maruyama Y', 'Nara N']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Male', 'Methylcellulose', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90063-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(5):433-40. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90063-x.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",,,,,,,,

Tunicamycin inhibits surface expression.,9502-7,"The T-cell surface glycoprotein CD4 plays an important role in mediating cellular immunity and serves as the receptor for human immunodeficiency virus. We have examined the glycosylation of CD4 and asked whether carbohydrate addition is essential for proper expression of the glycoprotein on the cell membrane. Under conditions where treatment of CD4+ human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM-CM3 cells) with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin decreased surface expression of CD4 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, the surface expression of several other glycoproteins was unaffected. Incubation with tunicamycin for 48 h inhibited mannose incorporation by 98%, caused a 76% decrease in CD4 surface expression as judged by flow cytometry, and had little effect on methionine incorporation. Scatchard analysis showed a decrease in the total number of CD4 molecules on the cell surface from 17,000 to 8,900 after 24 h of tunicamycin treatment. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled CD4 revealed the presence of an unglycosylated precursor in tunicamycin-treated cells. The observed difference between the Mr of the glycoprotein and its precursor is consistent with glycosylation at two potential N-linked sites. However, this precursor could not be detected by measuring steady state levels by immunoblotting. Also, no intracellular accumulation of CD4 in tunicamycin-treated cells was detectable using immunofluorescence microscopy. We conclude that surface expression of CD4 depends on glycosylation of the protein and that the unglycosylated precursor is preferentially degraded.","['Konig, R', 'Ashwell, G', 'Hanover, J A']","['Konig R', 'Ashwell G', 'Hanover JA']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Metabolism, National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology']",,1988/07/05 00:00,1988/07/05 00:01,['1988/07/05 00:00'],"['1988/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)76570-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Jul 5;263(19):9502-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",,,,,,,,

CD 7, a differentiation antigen appearing early in T cell ontogeny, may be involved in the activation and differentiation processes. CD 7 was found to be rapidly down-regulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) from mature T cell surface. The time course of CD 7 down-regulation was similar to that of other functionally important T cell antigens, CD 3 and CD 4. Within 2 h, TPA at 10 to 30 ng/ml induced a complete down-regulation of CD 7. Twenty-four hours later, the reappearance of CD 7 on TPA-treated cells was observed. This phenomenon was monocyte independent. In contrast, CD 7 expression on thymocytes was resistant to the effect of TPA. In addition, certain leukemic T cells were also resistant to TPA-induced CD 7 down-regulation. The mechanism underlying TPA-induced CD 7 down-regulation was investigated further. Synthetic diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, did not induce down-regulation of CD 7 on mature T cells. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, did not down-regulate this antigen either. Thus, it is concluded that the processes of protein kinase C activation and/or cytosolic calcium influx are not sufficient for TPA-induced CD 7 down-regulation; other pathways induced by TPA may be responsible.","['Jung, L K', 'Fu, S M']","['Jung LK', 'Fu SM']","['Immunology Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology']",,1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830180509 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1988 May;18(5):711-5. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830180509.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['CA34546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

By combining forward and orthogonal light scattering it was shown that lymphocytes from a patient with T gamma lymphocytosis were abnormal. Orthogonal light scattering also showed an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes in a patient with mononucleosis infectiosa and in a splenectomized patient. Orthogonal light scattering of lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the leu8+ population of a patient with mononucleosis infectiosa was bidisperse. For elderly donors the occurrence of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and HNK-1+ lymphocytes with a large orthogonal light scattering varied considerably.

On SDS-PAGE analysis, CEM-ON CSF had an apparent molecular weight of 33,000-43,000; following reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, this migrated as a 20,000-24,000 subunit, suggesting a homodimer structure.

Separation of 9.3 antigen from the T cell receptor for antigen.,573-85,"The now classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted receptor for antigen on human T lymphocytes has been identified as a 90 kDa disulphide-linked heterodimer composed of two glycoproteins termed alpha and beta. More recently, another type of T cell receptor for antigen has been described, which seems to mediate killing of target cells without any obvious requirement for MHC recognition. This T cell receptor for antigen is also a heterodimer composed of gamma, delta chains non-covalently associated with the three mon morphic CD3 subunits. Another disulphide-linked dimer capable of triggering T lymphocytes has been defined recently by a monoclonal antibody: the anti-human 9.3 antigen. In order to generate monoclonal or polyclonal reagents against variable and constant regions of the T cell receptor chains and against new epitopes of the 9.3 antigen, we have developed a biochemical method of purification of T lymphocyte disulphide-linked dimers. Our method relies on two biochemical properties of the 9.3 surface molecule and the T cell receptor for antigen. (1) They are disulphide-linked dimers and thus can be separated from the vast majority of the cell surface molecules by two-dimensional (non-reduced versus reduced) sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). (2) T cell receptor chains are less hydrophobic than the 9.3 antigen, and thus can be isolated from it on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at a lower concentration of acetonitrile. Microsomal preparations from T cell clones and leukaemia lines were prepared by nitrocavitation and lysed in sodium deoxycholate. After concentration, this lysate was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE in non-reducing conditions. The gel slice corresponding to the molecular weight of the T cell receptor was cut out and run in reducing conditions in the second dimension. The T cell receptor spots were easily located on the gel by autoradiography as the microsomal lysate had been mixed with iodinated glycoproteins. The T cell receptor was eluted from the gel with about 85% yield. At this stage, the T cell receptor preparations also contained the 9.3 antigen, another disulphide-linked dimer. The separation of this antigen from the T cell receptor chains had been achieved on reverse-phase HPLC. This procedure allows the purification and separation of two disulphide-linked dimers which are both involved in T cell activation. The obtention of antibodies against new epitopes of these important molecules would be extremely useful for analysing their role in T cell function and ontogeny.","['Leca, G', 'Benichou, G', 'Bensussan, A', 'Kanellopoulos, J']","['Leca G', 'Benichou G', 'Bensussan A', 'Kanellopoulos J']","['Association Claude-Bernard (C 12), U 23 INSERM, Hopital St-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Disulfides', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/*analysis']",,1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb02385.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1988 May;27(5):573-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb02385.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,,,,,,,

Specifically, it has been shown in many target cell systems that the expression of class I MHC proteins by target cells is inversely proportional to their susceptibility to lysis by NK cells. It has been suggested, therefore, that MHC proteins may act as important negative regulatory elements in the ongoing control of NK cell function. Herein, we examined two closely related murine lymphoma cells (ASL1 and ASL1w), both in terms of their susceptibility to lysis by NK cells as well as their expression of both H-2K and H-2D class I MHC proteins. The results of these studies showed that whereas ASL1 and ASL1w cells differed greatly in their susceptibility to NK cell lysis (ASL1 was much more NK resistant than ASL1w), both expressed high levels of H-2K and D proteins. In contrast to what might have been predicted base on reports from other target cell systems, the more NK susceptible ASL1w cells expressed somewhat higher levels of H-2K Ag than did ASL1 cells. These results indicate that expression of H-2 class I proteins by target cells, in and of itself, is not sufficient to inhibit the lytic activity of murine NK cells.","['Chervenak, R', 'Wolcott, R M']","['Chervenak R', 'Wolcott RM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport 71130.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'H-2 Antigens/*analysis/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Jun 1;140(11):3712-6.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)']",,,,,,,,

Both tumor lines metastasized to the liver but they affected liver functions in a different way: ESb cells infiltrated the liver diffusely and exerted toxic effects on liver parenchyma very quickly. This resulted in early increase of liver enzyme activity in the blood. In contrast, liver infiltrated by ESb-MP cells showed a more focal type of colonization and the organs seemed to be functioning for much longer periods. In fact, animals inoculated with ESb-MP cells subcutaneously or intravenously had an increased life expectancy compared to ESb-tumor-bearing animals of about 300%. The organotropism of both tumor lines remained similar although there were kinetic and quantitative differences, especially with regard to the kidney. In late stages of tumor growth, ESb-MP-tumor-bearing animals developed a high percentage of metastases in the kidney and around and within the spinal cord, thereby causing a syndrome of hind-leg paralysis. This syndrome was remarkable in its reproducibility, especially after intravenous tumor cell inoculation. The changed adhesiveness thus seemed to have affected the tumor latency period, the speed of dissemination into blood and internal organs, the mode of organ infiltration (focal vs. diffuse) and of metastatic growth, parameters which all might contribute to the greatly reduced overall malignancy.","['Benke, R', 'Lang, E', 'Komitowski, D', 'Muto, S', 'Schirrmacher, V']","['Benke R', 'Lang E', 'Komitowski D', 'Muto S', 'Schirrmacher V']","['Institut fur Immunologie und Genetik, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, BRD.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Invasion Metastasis,Invasion & metastasis,8202435,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Leukemia L5178/complications/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Paralysis/etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invasion Metastasis. 1988;8(3):159-76.,,,,,,,,,

An autocrine or paracrine model of production and utilization?,201-9,"In a series of untreated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), the capacity of the neoplastic B-cell population to release an interleukin-2 like factor (IL-2lf) was assessed. While unstimulated purified leukemic B-cells showed no IL-2lf production, in 16 of the 27 cases tested (59.2%) significant amounts of IL-2lf (4.3-125 U) were released following activation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In seven further cases (25.9%), small quantities of IL-2lf (0.2-1.7 U) were detected, while only in four (14.8%) no release was found. In 11 of the 20 cases (55%), PHA alone was also capable of inducing the production of limited amounts of IL-2lf (0.4-8 U). Only small amounts were released from B lymphocytes isolated from normal tonsils both with PHA and PHA plus TPA. Further purification using a fluorescence activated cell sorter suggests that the IL-2lf is truly produced by leukemic B cells and blocking experiments with the PC-61 monoclonal antibody indicate that IL-2lf and IL-2 use the same cell membrane receptor. However, co-cultures of leukemic B cells with small amounts of autologous or allogeneic T lymphocytes enhanced the amount of IL-2lf released into the supernatant to values markedly higher than those released by T- or B cells alone. Unlike normal B lymphocytes, unstimulated purified leukemic B cells from 17 out of 23 B-CLL cases (73.9%) were capable of absorbing variable amounts of exogenous IL-2. In addition, in six of the 11 cases tested (54.5%) IL-2 alone was capable of producing a 2-4 fold increase of thymidine uptake. In six out of eight cases (75%), a 2-5 fold enhancement of the proliferative response was observed when the leukemic B cells were co-stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC) and IL-2. Moreover, when the cells were pre-activated with SAC or with PHA plus TPA and then further stimulated with IL-2, a 2-20 fold increase in proliferative response was found in the majority of cases studied. These findings indicate that elevated quantities of IL-2lf may be released in B-CLL particularly due to the B- and T cell interconnections, and that the leukemic B cells appear capable of absorbing IL-2 and of proliferating after costimulation with IL-2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Giovarelli, M', 'Foa, R', 'Benetton, G', 'Lusso, P', 'Fierro, M T', 'Forni, G']","['Giovarelli M', 'Foa R', 'Benetton G', 'Lusso P', 'Fierro MT', 'Forni G']","['Istituto di Microbiologia, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Models, Biological', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/*metabolism']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90137-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(3):201-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90137-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,

The target cells to be killed are first incubated with cell-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). After removal of excess unbound antibody, the cells are incubated in the presence of lactose with an indirect IT, a conjugate of whole abrin and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SAM) that binds only to cells having primary mouse MAbs on their surfaces. The SAM-abrin IT is affinity purified before use to remove molecules with exposed B-chain-binding sites; it was nontoxic in the absence of the specific mouse MAbs, demonstrating the specificity of the two-step method. We compared the indirect approach, using four different primary MAbs, with the conventional method, in which abrin is coupled directly to the mouse MAbs. In three human cell lines--the melanoma line FEMX, the Burkitt cell line Rael, and the leukemia cell line KM3--the cell kill, measured by a clonogenic assay, was consistently greater with the indirect than with the direct method. In the melanoma and Rael cells, the indirect method gave a higher cell kill than even native abrin. With a mixture of two different antibodies an additive effect was observed with the indirect but not with the direct method. The new approach greatly simplifies the therapeutic application in vitro of ITs, because it permits the use of different primary antibodies, singly or in mixtures, in conjunction with only one or a few general indirect ITs. In efforts to further improve the usefulness of the indirect method, other indirect ITs containing different toxin moieties are being examined.

The DNA sequence at the chromosome 11 junction shows a perfect match to a recombinase signal sequence implying that this translocation occurred by recombinase error.

There was no bcr-abl chimeric mRNA typical of Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, the cells expressed an abl-related protein of Mr 190 kd with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. Leukemic cell metaphases were studied by the technique of in situ hybridization with probes for C-lambda, sis, abl, and 5' bcr. The c-abl probe mapped to chromosome 22q11 in Ph-positive metaphases. The 5' bcr probe mapped to 9q+ in the Ph-positive metaphases and the C-lambda gene mapped to the Ph chromosome. Thus, the genomic breakpoint in this patient must lie upstream of the BCR defined by study of Ph-positive CML and downstream of the C-lambda gene locus.

The monoclonal IgM significantly inhibited sarcoma growth when given to the mice after inoculation with Moloney murine sarcoma/leukemia virus, and also potentiated the in vivo antibody response specific for M-MuLV Ag. These responses were significantly greater than the primary response to the virus alone in age- and sex-matched control mice, and were also seen in mice which were injected with the IgM antibody only and not with virus, suggesting that an Ag-independent mechanism may be involved. The M-MuLV-specific serum antibody responses induced by the monoclonal IgM, with or without prior virus inoculation, were predominantly of the IgG1 isotype, with some IgG2a; no other isotypes were found to have titers significantly higher than in the normal response to virus alone. M-MuLV-specific IgG1 was detected only in mice injected with monoclonal IgM, and not in the response to virus alone. The same sera also had high titers of anti-idiotypic antibodies, (Ab2), as well as anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3). It appears, therefore, that passive immunization with M-MuLV-specific IgM mAb activates an idiotypic network, which results in both Ab2 and Ab3 responses; the M-MuLV-specific response may be considered a subset of Ab3.","['Powell, T J Jr', 'Spann, R', 'Vakil, M', 'Kearney, J F', 'Lamon, E W']","['Powell TJ Jr', 'Spann R', 'Vakil M', 'Kearney JF', 'Lamon EW']","['Birmingham Veterans Administration Hospital, AL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*therapy']",,1988/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 May 1;140(9):3266-72.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']","['R01 AI014782/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 34968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The amino acid sequence of p68, deduced from the sequences of overlapping cDNA clones, is described. The results show that p68 is closely related to a family of proteins which includes intracellular substrates of the EGF receptor and pp60src tyrosine kinases. The p68 amino acid sequence is internally repetitive, being constructed from eight repeats of varying lengths, each of which contains a highly conserved sequence. Multiple copies of the latter sequence are also present in the related proteins p36, lipocortin I and protein II. We discuss how the common structural features of these proteins may reflect common functions and, furthermore, how the eight repeat structure of p68 may have evolved. The sequences of independent cDNAs suggest that alternatively-spliced mRNAs could encode different p68 protein species. This suggestion is consistent with the observation that purified p68 migrates as a closely-spaced doublet when analysed by SDS-PAGE.","['Crompton, M R', 'Owens, R J', 'Totty, N F', 'Moss, S E', 'Waterfield, M D', 'Crumpton, M J']","['Crompton MR', 'Owens RJ', 'Totty NF', 'Moss SE', 'Waterfield MD', 'Crumpton MJ']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Annexin A6', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Palatine Tonsil/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1988 Jan;7(1):21-7.,"['0 (Annexin A6)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,['GENBANK/Y00097'],,PMC454210,,['EMBO J 1988 Jun;7(6):1914'],,

Decreases in area values which immediately followed cap formation were shown to result from a pH-dependent quenching of fluorescence emission as the internalized FITC-R alpha MIg entered acidic subcellular compartments. Similar results were obtained with BCL1 cells, but, in addition to cap formation and acidification, cytoplasmic diffusion of the fluorescent ligand could also be discerned by flow cytometry. With either cell type the rates of cap formation and endocytosis were shown to be temperature dependent with temperature coefficient (Q10) values of 2.0-2.7.

Some tumor cell lines that are resistant to nitrosoureas contain the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (alkyltransferase). This protects cells by removing cytotoxic, nitrosourea-induced O6-alkylguanine adducts. We measured the level of alkyltransferase activity in myeloid leukemic cells freshly obtained from patients to determine whether the alkyltransferase was an important factor in nitrosourea resistance in these cells and whether inactivation of this protein could sensitize leukemic cells to nitrosoureas. Myeloid leukemic cells from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia had higher levels of alkyltransferase than did myeloid precursors from normal donors (P less than .01). This difference did not appear to be due to the state of differentiation of the leukemic or normal cells. To show that this repair protein mediated nitrosourea resistance in leukemic cells, cells were treated with the modified base O6-methylguanine to selectively and irreversibly inactivate the alkyltransferase and then exposed to 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). An 18-hour incubation in 0.5 mmol/L O6-methylguanine caused an 87% +/- 3.6% decrease in alkyltransferase activity in leukemic cells and a 73% +/- 8.6% decrease in normal myeloid precursors. After treatment with O6-methylguanine, clonogenic leukemic cells from ten different donors became much more sensitive to BCNU, with a decrease in the dose needed to reduce colony survival by 50% (LD50) of 6.3 +/- 1.4-fold. A lesser effect was seen on CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEM where the LD50 decreased two- to threefold. These studies show that nitrosourea resistance in myeloid leukemic cells can be abrogated by inactivation of the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. This method of biochemical modulation of DNA repair will sensitize leukemic cells to nitrosoureas in vitro and has the potential of increasing the therapeutic index of nitrosoureas in this disease.","['Gerson, S L', 'Trey, J E']","['Gerson SL', 'Trey JE']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, OH 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Carmustine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",,1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77264-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 May;71(5):1487-94.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '9B710FV2AE (O-(6)-methylguanine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']","['CA 43688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ESCA00134/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA 43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

Our results indicated that the cytoplasmic form of CD22 comigrated with 125I/lactoperoxidase-labeled surface CD22. Therefore, cytoplasmic CD22 is probably a pool of fully processed glycoprotein. We also observed unusual cases of AML (approximately 20%) that expressed cytoplasmic CD22 based on immunofluorescent staining; however, biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation revealed an apparently cross-reactive protein(s) of approximately 250 to 300 kd in AML cells.

A specific saturable binding component which may mediate the phorbol ester effects has been identified by using [20-(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in a whole cell binding assay. Saturation of the specific binding occurs at a concentration (approx. 100 nM) consistent with causing maximal cytotoxicity. Scatchard analysis of the binding after 15 min at 37 degrees C demonstrates a single class of binding sites. The number is 194,000 sites per cell. Other phorbol esters are also cytotoxic to CEM-C7 cell in the presence of 30 nM dexamethasone in an approximate proportion to their activity in competing for [20-(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding. Phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate, 4-O-methyl PMA, 4-beta-phorbol do not compete for specific binding. The synergism of phorbol esters and dexamethasone on CEM-C7 cells is reversible by 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine(H-7). However, by treating CEM-C7 cells with TPA for 48 h there is not any increase in the affinity or levels of glucocorticoid receptor. It is tentatively concluded that phorbol esters may play an important role linked to the glucocorticoid-induced growth inhibition in CEM-C7 human T-leukemic cell.","['Sato, K', 'Ido, M', 'Kamiya, H', 'Sakurai, M', 'Hidaka, H']","['Sato K', 'Ido M', 'Kamiya H', 'Sakurai M', 'Hidaka H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Binding, Competitive', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Protein Kinase C/analysis', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(98)80002-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(1):3-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)80002-7.,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (dexamethasone receptor)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,

A syngeneic animal model of leptomeningeal neoplasia was developed in which percutaneous inoculation of L2C tumor cells into the cisterna magna of Strain 2 guinea pigs produced disseminated leptomeningeal and intraventricular leukemia and death. Percutaneous intracisternal injection of 2 micrograms of an anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody (M6)-intact ricin immunotoxin 24 hours following intracisternal inoculation of 10(5) L2C cells (10,000 times the lethal dose) produced prolonged survival (p less than 0.005) of tumor-bearing animals. The immunotoxin therapy caused no detectable toxicity. Intracisternal injection of either M6 monoclonal antibody alone or a nonspecific control immunotoxin had no therapeutic effect.

Different clones of myeloid leukemia cells can differ in their response to these regulatory proteins. The present experiments characterize proteins secreted by Krebs ascites carcinoma cells that induce differentiation of 2 different types of myeloid leukemic cell clones (clones II and 7-M12). The results indicate the following: (1) Krebs cells produce 2 distinct and separable proteins, each inducing differentiation in one of the leukemic clones. (2) One protein induced differentiation of clone-II myeloid leukemic cells and of normal myeloid precursor cells was free of any colony-inducing (MGI-1 = CSF or IL-3) activity, bound to double-stranded mammalian DNA, and was thus a differentiation-inducing protein MGI-2. This MGI-2 protein (MGI-2A) was purified to a single silver-stained band on an SDS polyacrylamide gel. (3) The other protein induced differentiation of clone 7-M12 myeloid leukemic cells, did not bind to double-stranded DNA and could not be separated from the myeloid growth-inducing protein MGI-1GM (GM-CSF) after 6 steps of purification including high-pressure liquid chromatography. The use of specific antisera confirmed that the protein which induced differentiation of clone 7-M12 leukemic cells was MGI-1 GM.

The expression of this molecule was investigated using monomorphic affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including one of the IgG2a subclass designated EDU-1. This antibody reacts strongly in a cell-binding radioimmunoassay with HLA-DR and -DQ loss mutants derived from a lymphoblastoid parental cell. The EDU-1 mAb also reacted with a local panel of homozygous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines. The reactive molecules were further detected on allostimulated T-cell clones and various leukemic cells including those of myeloid origin which lack surface expression of HLA-DQ molecules. Thus the class II molecule described in this study corresponds to a monomorphic HLA class II determinant expressed on a variety of cells of different origin and HLA phenotypes. Moreover, this antigen structure is distinct from that of HLA-DP/DQ/DR as shown by direct immunoprecipitation, serial immunodepletion experiments, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The molecule could be specified by new class II genes between DP and DQ.

The addition of IFN or IL-2 to the NK-rich fractions resulted in a significant increase in NK activity against the autologous tumor cells. This stimulatory effect was blocked if the target hairy cells (HCs) were preincubated with either IFN or IL-2. Pretreatment of the HCs with anti-Tac antibody entirely prevented the blocking effect of IL-2 and partially the blocking effect of IFN. One patient was treated with recombinant alpha c-IFN. After 2 months there was a dramatic reduction in the number of HCs in the peripheral blood coincident with the loss of the protection effect of IFN against NK lysis of the patient's HCs. NK activity against autologous tumor cells correlated poorly with that against the K562 cell line. We conclude that there is a discordant effect of IFN and IL-2 on NK activity and HC sensitivity to lysis. The Tac receptor appears to play a role in this sensitivity. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating the effects of NK activity against K562 cells to those on HC targets.,"['Lahat, N', 'Aghai, E', 'Kotler, A', 'Kinarty, A', 'Sobel, E', 'Gruener, N', 'Froom, P']","['Lahat N', 'Aghai E', 'Kotler A', 'Kinarty A', 'Sobel E', 'Gruener N', 'Froom P']","['Hematology Institute, Lady Davis Carmel Hospital, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology']",,1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77767-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Apr;71(4):1141-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,

Correlation with other B-cell markers.,133-40,"Using in situ immunohistological analysis, expression of Leu-8 and its correlation with other B-cell markers were investigated in 21 selected lymphomas of different categories, each one expressing its own typical immunophenotype. These categories included eight follicular centroblastic/centrocytic (CB/CC) lymphomas, eight intermediately differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas (ILL)/mantle zone lymphomas (MZL), and five lymphocytic lymphomas (LL) associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Four reactive lymph nodes and three tonsils were also studied using double immunolabelling procedures. Cell suspensions were also performed in three CB/CC and four ILL/MZL cases. Leu-8 was consistently expressed in ILL/MZL and LL but it was absent in most (7/8) CB/CC lymphomas. In reactive tissues, the Leu-8-positive B cells were strictly confined to the mantle zones. A close association emerged between Leu-1 (CD5) and Leu-8, both being present in ILL/MZL and LL but absent in CB/CC. A consistent lack of association was found between Leu-8 or CD5 antigens and common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen (CD10) and BA-2 (CD9) antigen, whereas Leu-8 and CD5 were strictly associated with surface IgD. Reactivity with Leu-8 provides a means of distinguishing between CB/CC and ILL/MZL.

When such IL-3-induced blast colonies were individually lifted up and recultured in the presence of rIL-3 and recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo), a variety of hematopoietic colonies developed from every single colony, including neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, mast cells, and erythroblasts. The results indicated that IL-3-induced blast colonies consisted of multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells. By culturing individual IL-3-induced blast colonies in the presence of rIL-2 and irradiated peritoneal macrophages, on the other hand, the proliferation of homogeneous lymphoid cells was observed in 5 of 24 wells, each of which received a single blast colony. Morphologically, they were typical large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and thus it was indicated that LGL could be differentiated directly from the hematopoietic progenitor cells utterly in vitro by rIL-2 and accessory macrophages. From one of these culture wells, a continuous LGL line, IL3B1, was successfully obtained. The proliferation of IL3B1 was dependent on IL-2 in the presence of accessory macrophages, but they no longer responded to IL-3, nor to another T cell growth factor, IL-4. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the phenotype of IL3B1 was Thy-1+,T3+,L3T4-,Lyt-2-,T200+ Asialo GM1+, whereas that of original IL-3-induced blast cells was Thy-1+,T3-,L3T4-,Lyt-2-,B220-. The results suggested that the expression of T3 molecules was induced in the process of LGL differentiation from the hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Conforming to this, it was revealed that both gamma and beta chain genes of the TCR were rearranged in IL3B1. Northern blot analysis indicated that IL3B1 had abundant mRNA for gamma chain, while mRNA for beta chain was rather faint. Functionally, IL3B1 exhibited typical NK-patterned cytotoxic activity against a panel of tumor cell targets. In addition, they showed significant cytotoxic activity against normal bone marrow cells, as well as various factor-dependent myelogenous progenitor cell lines, all of which were resistant to endogenous NK activity of the fresh spleen cells. These results indicated that at least a set of T3+ LGL with rearranged TCR genes could be directly differentiated from isolated hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Results also suggested that such a prethymically differentiated subset of T-lineage lymphocytes, namely T3+ double-negative LGL, had particular cytotoxic activity in addition to conventional NK activity, which might well contribute to feedback regulation of hematopoiesis.","['Minato, N', 'Hattori, M', 'Sudo, T', 'Kano, S', 'Miura, Y', 'Suda, J', 'Suda, T']","['Minato N', 'Hattori M', 'Sudo T', 'Kano S', 'Miura Y', 'Suda J', 'Suda T']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.167.3.762 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Mar 1;167(3):762-76. doi: 10.1084/jem.167.3.762.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,PMC2188877,,,,

In contrast to LPS, a phorbol ester (PMA) induces a stable, non-transient population of mRNA.

Treatment of CLL B-cells with the maturational agent, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, results in restoration of L-system amino acid uptake to normal velocity. To further characterize the effect of phorbol ester on the L-system of CLL B-cells, we have examined the ability of normal and CLL lymphocytes to exchange intracellular for extracellular amino acids by the L-system (trans-stimulation). A 60% increase in L-system uptake was noted in normal B- and T-lymphocytes in the presence of a high intracellular concentration of 2-amino-2-carboxy-bicycloheptane (BCH), a largely L-system-specific substrate. L-system transport was not trans-stimulated in CLL B-lymphocytes. Phorbol ester treatment restored L-system uptake in CLL to a normal Vmax of 900 mumol/liter cell water per minute in the absence of BCH loading. The Vmax could be increased further to 2,400 if phorbol ester-treated CLL cells were loaded with BCH.

Irradiation (20 Gy), which enhances IL-2 synthesis by activated T-enriched PBL and Jurkat cells, also increases oxidative product formation, K+ flux, cGMP production, and induces cell membrane depolarization. Conversely, irradiation does not produce a rise in intracellular free Ca2+, as measured in PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells. PMA is also without effect on intracellular free Ca2+, added before or after PHA stimulation. Thus, except for the rise in intracellular free Ca2+, irradiation and stimulation exert similar effects on some of the events observed in IL-2-producing Jurkat cells, but these effects are not additive. Stimulation and irradiation effects are shown to be additive or synergistic only for cGMP production.

The hybridomas were selected for the expression of the Thy-1.2 antigen of the normal cell donor and for their ability to produce IL-2 upon co-culture with irradiated normal spleen cells. The hybridomas produce IL-2 when co-cultured with H-2k, H-2u, H-2j, or H-2v cells of some strains but not in mixtures with H-2p, H-2s, H-2f, H-2b, H-2q, or H-2d cells. An investigation into the nature of these differences revealed a novel type of interaction between hybridomas, mature T lymphocytes and class II-positive spleen or lymph node cells. The experiments described in this communication suggest that irradiated L3T4+, Ly-1 High T cells recognize syngeneic class II-positive spleen or lymph node cells, but only in some strains. The ability to recognize the syngeneic cells depends both upon the H-2 complex and on the non-H-2 genes. The recognition leads, in the absence of proliferation, to the secretion of an as yet unidentified and largely hypothetical factor which then acts on the hybridoma cells. Upon stimulation with the T lymphocyte-derived factor, the hybridoma cells begin to secrete IL-2, which can then be measured by the proliferation of the IL-2-dependent CTLL line. The IL-2 production by the hybridoma cells is independent of their proliferation. The described interaction apparently does not involve the T-cell receptor of the hybridoma cells.

In this paper, we extend our studies of T101-induced modulation and compare it to T101-induced capping. We found that, in contrast to antigenic modulation, capping occurred only in the presence of secondary anti-mouse IgG antisera and was altered by drugs that affect the cellular cytoskeleton or energy metabolism. F(ab')2 fragments of T101 induced antigenic modulation with kinetics similar to those of intact T101, but Fab-induced modulation proceeded more slowly and required the continual presence of Fab throughout the incubation. Experiments with radioiodinated T101 demonstrated that initial internalization of the antibody is followed by rapid efflux of intact, immunoreactive T101 from the cells. These data indicate important differences between capping and modulation and suggest that these two phenomena proceed by different mechanisms. More importantly, the data have implications for the potential therapeutic use of monoclonal antibody immunoconjugates.","['Shawler, D L', 'Johnson, D E', 'McCallister, T J', 'Bartholomew, R M', 'Dillman, R O']","['Shawler DL', 'Johnson DE', 'McCallister TJ', 'Bartholomew RM', 'Dillman RO']","['Biotherapeutics, Inc., La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Endocytosis', '*Immunologic Capping/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology']",,1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(88)90074-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1988 May;47(2):219-29. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(88)90074-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']","['CM-37613-64/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-07444/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Previously, we demonstrated that peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients secrete significant amounts of interleukin 2 (IL2) with an apparent dysregulation of accessory cells controlling this production. In this study, IL2 production was investigated in PB and in bone marrow (BM) from patients with previously untreated B-CLL, mostly in early stages of the disease, and compared to normal donors. A significant secretion was observed in both PB and BM from B-CLL patients after stimulation by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), with lower amounts in patients with nodular involvement of BM, as compared to interstitial or diffuse involvements. To explore the role of accessory cells in controlling IL2 production, we added phorbol ester or indomethacin to the culture system or irradiated the cells before culture. Phorbol ester significantly increased the IL2 secretion in both the PB and the BM of B-CLL patients. The irradiation or the addition of indomethacin did not enhance the IL2 production in PB from B-CLL patients. However, IL2 secretion increased in the BM cells from B-CLL patients after addition of indomethacin or prior irradiation, in a similar way to that observed in PB and BM of normal controls, suggesting an apparent normal control of the IL2 production in BM from B-CLL patients. In normal controls, we demonstrated that IL2 secretion per T-cell from BM was 5.4-fold greater than that from normal PB, suggesting a very efficient role of accessory cells controlling IL2 production in normal BM.","['Rossi, J F', 'Klein, B', 'Commes, T', 'Jourdan, M', 'Janbon, C']","['Rossi JF', 'Klein B', 'Commes T', 'Jourdan M', 'Janbon C']","['Service de Medecine B, Hopital Saint-Eloi, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06191.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Feb;68(2):207-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06191.x.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (phytohemagglutinin-P)']",,,,,,,,

Common ALL (CALLA) (J5) was a good marker for classifying the leukemia as ALL.

Eighteen cases of ALL were diagnosed and consisted of five cases of T-cell ALL and 13 cases of non-T-cell ALL. Both the T-cell ALL cases and non-T-cell ALL cases were found to be heterogeneous and could be further subgrouped by phenotypic expression with additional MoAbs in the panel. A monoclonal antibody panel consisting of My4, My7, My9, Mo1, and Mo2 was useful in characterizing an acute leukemia as ANLL. This panel was less useful in distinguishing myeloid from monocytic subtypes although My4, Mo1, or Mo2 when present, appeared to favor a monocytic component. Of interest, a case of biclonal leukemia with two distinct blast populations on the flow cytogram was discovered. Morphology alone was successful in diagnosing ALL from ANLL in 35 cases (70%). It was not useful in distinguishing non-T-ALL cases from T-ALL cases. The ambiguous cases could be resolved by cytometric means.

Nucleoid sedimentation profiles obtained from cells incubated with ADR (1-10 microM; 30 min; 37 degrees C) exhibited an increased sedimentation rate associated with an increased protein content of these subnuclear units. Exposure of cells to HYP (1-3 h; 42 degrees C) produced similar results. Simultaneous exposure of L1210 cells to conditions of HYP and ADR which resulted in minimal changes in nucleoid sedimentation when used singly, produced an enhanced effect. A similar enhancement was observed with other intercalating antineoplastic agents believed to exert their effect, at least partially, via free radicals (daunorubicin, amsacrine, bisantrene, mitoxantrone). However, enhancement with HYP was not observed with (a) the classic intercalating agent, ethidium bromide; (b) non-intercalating DNA-breaking agents (bleomycin, lithocholic acid, etoposide); (c) inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (m-methoxybenzamide, benzamide); or (d) non-intercalating antineoplastic agents capable of causing free radical formation (bleomycin). The results suggest that DNA intercalating agents capable of initiating free radical processes may show an enhanced toxicity with simultaneous HYP treatment, and that the nucleoid assay may be a means of screening agents with these biological properties for potential clinical usefulness in combination with HYP.","['Daugherty, J P', 'Simpson, T A Jr']","['Daugherty JP', 'Simpson TA Jr']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med,"International journal of radiation biology and related studies in physics, chemistry, and medicine",0374725,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Superhelical/analysis', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Subcellular Fractions/analysis']",,1988/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553008814552511 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. 1988 Mar;53(3):367-80. doi: 10.1080/09553008814552511.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",['CA-13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Approximately 20% of normal tonsil and peripheral blood (PB) B cells are UCHB 1+ and the majority of B cells from all cases of prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) tested, together with a low, variable percentage of PB B cells from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with centroblastic centrocytic leukemia also express this antigen.

In tonsil sections UCHB 1 staining is almost completely confined to surface IgM+ mantle zone lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells, but not B cells, within the germinal centers. UCHB 1 can induce a rise in the level of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in PLL B cells and low concentrations of monoclonal antibody can result in the entry of these cells into cell cycle in the absence of additional factors. The proliferative effect of UCHB 1 is greatly enhanced in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan and, to a lesser extent, phorbol ester. A similar costimulatory effect is exerted on a proportion of normal tonsil B cells although here, despite inducing a rise in [Ca2+]i, UCHB 1 alone does not cause cells to proliferate.

This augmentative effect of N-CWS was not seen when the LAK cells were prepared from normal mice. The cytolytic activity was predominantly expressed in the NAPC prepared from the site of injection of rIL-2, and repeated administrations of rIL-2 were required to induce and maintain this potent cytolytic activity in vivo. Serological analysis revealed that the LAK cells were positive for Thy 1.2 and asialo GM1 antigens and that they were not classical CTL or NK cells. The administration of rIL-2 statistically prolonged the MST of mice bearing LAK-sensitive 3LL cells but not the MST of mice bearing LAK-resistant EL-4 leukemia. Furthermore, combination therapy with N-CWS and rIL-2 prolonged the MST of the mice more than the therapy with rIL-2 alone. These results suggest that LAK cells potentiated with N-CWS would be useful for immunotherapy of malignant neoplasms.","['Yokota, S', 'Shirasaka, T', 'Nishikawa, H', 'Hosoe, S', 'Ikeda, T', 'Komuta, K', 'Kawase, I', 'Masuno, T', 'Ogura, T', 'Kishimoto, S']","['Yokota S', 'Shirasaka T', 'Nishikawa H', 'Hosoe S', 'Ikeda T', 'Komuta K', 'Kawase I', 'Masuno T', 'Ogura T', 'Kishimoto S']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Wall/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nocardia/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199841 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1988;26(1):11-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00199841.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,

Feasibility of LAK generation in adult patients with active disease and in remission.,709-16,"The feasibility of in vitro interleukin 2 (IL-2) activation and expansion of mononuclear cells (MNCs) derived from adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (ANLL) was studied. Patients' natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity was compared with that of normal donors in terms of: (a) cytolytic activity (four-hour 51Cr release assay) against an NK-sensitive target (K562), NK-resistant targets (Raji/Daudi), and fresh/cryopreserved autologous and allogeneic leukemic blasts; (b) proliferation and expansion in culture with 1,000 U/mL recombinant IL 2 (rIL 2); and (c) the cell surface phenotype of the cultured cells. In 21 of 24 patients with active disease (AP) MNCs derived from the peripheral blood (PBL) or bone marrow (BM) could be cultured and expanded in the presence of rIL 2. These cultures initially contained between 30% and 50% blasts, and during 2 to 4 weeks of culture destruction of blasts and enrichment of up to 60% in cells with the morphology of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) was observed. Expansion in culture varied between two- and 100-fold. MNCs from all patients in remission (RP) could be activated by rIL 2 and expanded up to 30-fold after 1 to 3 weeks in culture. NK activity of fresh PBLs from AP was significantly lower than in normal controls, whereas NK activity of RP was within the normal range. High levels of postactivation NK and LAK activity on K562/Raji/Daudi and on fresh/cryopreserved leukemic blasts was generated in approximately 50% of cases of AP and in most RP. Cell surface phenotype studies showed that cultured cells derived from ANLL patients were significantly enriched (up to 40%) in NKH-1 (Leu 19) positive cells, with RP LAK cells also expressing a high proportion of CD16 positive cells (up to 40%). This study has shown that it is feasible to activate and significantly expand killer cells derived from active disease and remission ANLL patients during 1 to 3 weeks culture with IL 2 with good maintenance of cytolytic activity. Both initial NK activity and LAK generation was optimal in remission patients. Based on data from this study, a clinical protocol has been developed for treatment of early relapse ANLL patients with LAK cells cultured for 1 to 3 weeks and systemic IL 2.","['Adler, A', 'Chervenick, P A', 'Whiteside, T L', 'Lotzova, E', 'Herberman, R B']","['Adler A', 'Chervenick PA', 'Whiteside TL', 'Lotzova E', 'Herberman RB']","['Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Cells/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/physiology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78145-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Mar;71(3):709-16.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,

In this study, we have analyzed the changes in chromosomes at different stages of tumor development in C57BL/6J mice treated with gamma-irradiation or the chemical carcinogen, N-methylnitrosourea. Trisomy 15 occurred in both groups of mice regardless of inducing agent. The frequency of this event differed significantly in radiation-treated animals between stage I and stage II of the disease. A specific marker chromosome occurred only in the gamma-irradiated mice and not in the mice treated with N-methylnitrosourea. This marker consists of a translocation between chromosomes 1 and 5. It occurred in 43% of the gamma-irradiated animals at stage 1 of the disease and did not vary markedly during tumor development. In contrast, trisomy 15 increased in frequency between stages I and II of the disease in the same animals. These results suggest that the translocation event may be an early event in tumor development, whereas trisomy 15 may contribute to tumor progression.","['McMorrow, L E', 'Newcomb, E W', 'Pellicer, A']","['McMorrow LE', 'Newcomb EW', 'Pellicer A']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, School of Osteopathic Medicine, Camden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monosomy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/radiation effects', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Feb;2(2):115-9.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],"['CA16239/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03847/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Binding studies showed that the Jurkat cells fixed 0.82 +/- 0.11 microgram pea lectin, 2.02 +/- 0.17 micrograms Con A, 1.85 +/- 0.07 micrograms PHA and 8.88 +/- 0.61 micrograms WGA. Scatchard plots were linear, indicating that the binding process was homogeneous with respect to the binding constant. PHA and Con A bound with the highest affinity [Kass (apparent) approximately equal to 9 x 10(9) M-1], followed by pea lectin and WGA [Kass (apparent) approximately equal to 3 x 10(9) M-1]. The number of lectin binding sites was in agreement with the results of saturation experiments. We also evaluated the effect of the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on the binding process. Results show that there were no gross alterations in the value of (apparent) Kass in the case of PHA and WGA. In contrast, the presence of TPA decreased the affinity of Con A and modified the Scatchard profile for pea lectin, which was curvilinear with a concavity turned upward. In this case, data were (apparent) K1 = 17.7 x 10(9) M-1 (""high-affinity"" sites) and (apparent) K2 = 2.6 x 10(9) M-1 (""low-affinity"" sites). The four lectins shared the ability to stimulate Jurkat 77 6.8 cells to secrete IL-2. Optimal lectin concentrations were 20 micrograms/ml (PHA) and 50 micrograms/ml (WGA and Con A). Pea lectin failed to display a dose-response relationship, and IL-2 production increased proportionally with lectin concentration. Con A was the most efficient stimulator (250 U/ml), followed by WGA (160 U/ml) and PHA (108 U/ml). Addition of TPA potentiated Jurkat cell response. In this case, Con A and pea lectin were the most efficient stimulators (470 U/ml), followed by PHA (316 U/ml) and WGA (271 U/ml). Here, also, pea lectin failed to show a dose-response relationship. Our data do not reveal an obvious relationship between the binding parameters and the ability of the lectins to induce IL-2 production. We suggest that the efficiency of the four lectins to stimulate IL-2 production in the case of the Jurkat 77 6.8 variant is most likely related to the nature of their specific cell surface receptor(s).","['Dupuis, G', 'Bastin, B']","['Dupuis G', 'Bastin B']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.43.3.238 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1988 Mar;43(3):238-47. doi: 10.1002/jlb.43.3.238.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lectins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,

B-cells were evaluated as surface immunoglobulin- (SIg+) bearing cells and by serum immunoglobulin levels. Granulocyte activities were evaluated by responses to chemotaxis and to nitroblue tetrazolium test. Complement activity was measured by classic hemolytic complement assay. In addition, circulating immune complexes were detected in serum. MDS were associated with a significant decrease in the absolute numbers of total T (E-rosetting and T3+) cells, T4+, and T8+ cells and a dramatic decrease of the responses to Concanavalin A. An impairment of either chemotaxis or of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was frequently encountered. An increase in the levels of IgG or IgA was also a frequent feature. The findings reveal that all patients with a high degree of T-cell impairment have refractory anemia associated with an excess of medullary blast cells. All in all, the data suggest that the counts of the absolute number of cells bearing the T3 and T8 phenotypes could be of prognostic value: the higher the number, the better the patient's survival.","['Colombat, P H', 'Renoux, M', 'Lamagnere, J P', 'Renoux, G']","['Colombat PH', 'Renoux M', 'Lamagnere JP', 'Renoux G']","['Department of Hematology, CHU Bretonneau, Tours, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/immunology', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology']",,1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19880315)61:6<1075::aid-cncr2820610604>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Mar 15;61(6):1075-81. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880315)61:6<1075::aid-cncr2820610604>3.0.co;2-e.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,

To analyze the regulatory mechanisms of the proliferation of leukemic blast progenitors, the effects of highly purified native granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) obtained from human squamous cell carcinoma line (CHU-2) on blast progenitors in AML patients were studied in methylcellulose and suspension cultures.

Of the 32 primary myeloid and lymphoid acute leukemia samples investigated, the great majority were natural killer cell-resistant but were variably sensitive to LAK effectors. Variations in LAK activity were observed according to the donor of PBL, while little or no difference was documented in the capacity to elicit LAK activity of PBL cultured with 100 or 1,000 U of rIL-2/ml. Pretreatment of the leukemic target cells with neuraminidase did not increase substantially their sensitivity to LAK activity. LAK cells generated from the PBL of patients at the onset of the disease or in complete clinicohematological remission lysed Raji cells as efficiently as normal LAK effectors. Finally, LAK cells were capable of abrogating the tumor growth in nude mice of a human leukemic T cell line.

It is not known if such natural cytotoxic activity represents background activity of preexisting clones of immunoglobulin-producing cells, cross-reacting antibodies appearing after immunization, physiological immune regulatory molecules, or components of an immune network. We have therefore examined the presence of thymocytotoxic IgM molecules in normal adult and neonatal sera and in a number of diseases which affect the lymphoid and immune system. The thymocytotoxic effect of serum was measured in different dilutions, both directly and after heat inactivation of the sera and supplementation with a standard amount of IgM-depleted serum, which is inactive in itself but provides a fixed amount of the heat-labile cofactor. The cytotoxic IgM was present in various amounts in all sera tested, although in neonates very small amounts were found. No specific aberration in toxic activity was seen in rheumatoid arthritis or a number of hematological diseases. In general, the cytotoxic activity correlated well with the total amount of IgM. However, in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and immunocytoma aberrant cytotoxic activities were found, but to ascertain a connection between these diseases and the factor would require a more extensive follow-up study. The results indicate that the naturally occurring thymocytotoxic IgM is widespread and may reflect a clone of B cells which is activated by an endogenous stimulus, or by some ubiquitous exogenous immunogen.","['Sandberg, G', 'Stenvinkel, C']","['Sandberg G', 'Stenvinkel C']","['Department of Histology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol,International archives of allergy and applied immunology,0404561,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*analysis', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000234472 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol. 1988;85(1):38-46. doi: 10.1159/000234472.,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",,,,,,,,

A 20-fold lower level of these transcripts, however, can be found in cells derived from Stage I cells (thymocytes with germline alpha, beta, and gamma genes), 4 times less messages in Stage II cells (thymocytes with rearranged gamma and beta chain genes, but with germline alpha chain genes), and a 4-fold lower amount of RNA in Stage IV cells (mature lymphocytes). Culture of these cells with a variety of inducing reagents indicated that leukemia cell lines of only Stages I and II can be induced to increase their levels of YT16 expression by the addition of tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate.

Differentiation was induced with TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) and defined and quantitated by morphological and functional markers. Changes in the cell cycle position were determined by flow cytometry of acridine orange-stained cells. The uninduced B-CLL cells represented a homogeneous population with the same cell cycle position (GO) as resting normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. After five days of TPA stimulation, 56% of the B-CLL cells were found in G1A, 9% in G1B, and 3% in the S + G2/M phase, of which 2% was accounted to proliferating T cells. The cell cycle transition of the differentiating B-CLL cells was also examined using cell cycle-associated surface antigens as markers. HLA-DR and CD23 antigens were present already on noninduced cells. The former had a high constant expression, while the amount of CD23 increased upon induction. The 4F2 antigen was absent on noninduced cells but present on 86% of the induced cells. HH1 (CD37) was expressed by the majority of the cells before TPA treatment and decreased to almost undetectable levels within 24 hours. Two antigens related to late stages of the cell cycle, the interleukin 2 (IL 2; CD25) and the transferrin receptor, were present on about 20% of the induced cells. Experiments with enriched T cells showed that T but not B cells incorporated 3H-thymidine. Taken together these results and previous work on the induction of the protooncogene c-myc and c-fos suggest that this B-CLL clone represents GO cells that undergo differentiation without concomitant proliferation when exposed to TPA.","['Carlsson, M', 'Totterman, T H', 'Matsson, P', 'Nilsson, K']","['Carlsson M', 'Totterman TH', 'Matsson P', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*pathology']",,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78190-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Feb;71(2):415-21.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,

We examined L-system transport in chronic leukemic B lymphocytes after incubation with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate to determine if the transport abnormality can be corrected by the apparent cell maturation induced by this agent. Amino acid uptake was measured using 2-amino-2-carboxy-bicycloheptane, an L-system specific synthetic amino acid. Marked enhancement of L-system transport occurred in each of 12 leukemic cell populations; the initial velocity of transport in phorbol ester-treated cells increased 8-fold and 14-fold at 16 and 40 h, respectively, compared with untreated cells. The Vmax of the L-system in phorbol ester-treated leukemic cells was similar to that of phorbol ester-treated normal B lymphocytes. The L-system enhancement of the leukemic cells paralleled the development of plasmacytoid features at 40 h. Uptake of leucine, a naturally occurring L-system amino acid, was also increased by tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. Cycloheximide, 100 micrograms/ml, which inhibited over 90% of protein synthesis in phorbol ester-treated chronic leukemic cells, blocked completely the phorbol ester-induced L-system enhancement.

There is another type of normal myeloid regulatory protein (MGI-2) with no MGI-1 (CSF or IL-3) activity which can induce differentiation of normal myeloid precursors and certain clones of myeloid leukemic cells. The present results with MGI-2 and pure recombinant MGI-1G, MGI-1GM and IL-3 have shown that different clones of myeloid leukemic cells can be induced to differentiate by different hematopoietic regulatory proteins. One type of leukemic clone is induced to differentiate to mature cells only by MGI-2 and is partially differentiated by MGI-1G, a second type is differentiated only by MGI-1GM or IL-3, and other workers have found a third type that is differentiated only by MGI-1G. The presence of surface receptors does not necessarily make leukemic cells differentiation-competent for these hematopoietic regulatory proteins. All 4 types of MGI-1 (CSF or IL-3) induce endogenous synthesis of MGI-2 in normal myeloid precursor cells. It is suggested that, in addition to their potential therapeutic effect on the development of normal hematopoietic cells, MGI-2, MGI-1G, MGI-1GM and IL-3 all have the potential for differentiation-directed therapy of leukemia in leukemic cells that can be differentiated by one of these normal hematopoietic regulatory proteins.","['Lotem, J', 'Shabo, Y', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Shabo Y', 'Sachs L']","['Department of Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology']",,1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910410119 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Jan 15;41(1):101-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910410119.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,

In particular, a dose-dependent clustering of intramembrane particles was observed in all cell types examined, i.e., normal T and B lymphocytes, T cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though to a different extent. Normal T lymphocytes appear to be the most sensitive to the action of the drug, while corresponding B cells are much less affected. As regards leukemic cells, in T lymphoblasts the ultrastructural membrane changes are lower than in normal T lymphocytes, whereas leukemic B cells show the same low response to Lonidamine treatment as their normal counterpart. Such a differential effect may be explained by the different membrane molecular organization displayed by normal T and B lymphocytes and by normal and leukemic cells. Moreover, the extent of the ultrastructural modifications at the plasma membrane level, correlates well with literature data on the inhibition of the aerobic glycolysis induced by Lonidamine on the different lymphoid cell types.

In the absence of these allogeneic cells, neither pokeweed mitogen nor interleukin 2 had any effect. However, T-cell-conditioned medium as well as the supernatants of two T-cell hybridomas induced strong IgM production in the absence of T cells. Thus, neoplastic B cells of some patients with B-prolymphocytic leukemia can be stimulated to proliferation and differentiation in vitro and can be used as an assay and model system to study the effect of T cells and/or T-cell factors in human B-cell activation.","['Sauerwein, R W', 'van der Meer, W G', 'Logtenberg, T', 'Aarden, L A']","['Sauerwein RW', 'van der Meer WG', 'Logtenberg T', 'Aarden LA']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(88)90001-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1988 Jan;46(1):1-13. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(88)90001-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,

After exposure of cells to isomolar concentrations of doxorubicin or its metabolites, uptake/retention of doxorubicinol was 23% of doxorubicin, and uptake/retention of aglycones was 5 to 13% of doxorubicin. Seventy to 90% of doxorubicin and 60 to 90% of doxorubicinol taken up/retained by the cells were detected in the cell nuclear fraction, whereas only 20 to 40% of the aglycones were localized in the cell nucleus.

However, lipid lateral diffusion increased in cells incubated 24, 48, and 72 h with LPS, and an additional 6 h with 10(-5) M TA suggested that activated BCL1 cells were more glucocorticoid sensitive than cells at Time 0. Plasma membrane cholesterol and phospholipid content, analyzed at 0 and 24 h, indicated that LPS activation was associated with a 7% increase in the cholesterol:phospholipid ratio in BCL1 membranes and that glucocorticoid treatment of these LPS-activated cells for 6 h decreased the membrane cholesterol:phospholipid ratio perhaps through inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis.","['Keating, K M', 'Barisas, B G', 'Roess, D A']","['Keating KM', 'Barisas BG', 'Roess DA']","['Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cholesterol/analysis', 'Diffusion', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Membrane Lipids/analysis/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jan 1;48(1):59-63.,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']","['AI-21873/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 23236/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The stimulation first becomes apparent at 72 h when the cells start to enter the quiescent state. The inhibition of protein synthesis by the addition of cycloheximide to L-929 cells before ribosomal extracts were prepared did not alter the stimulatory effect of GPRE. When GPRE was added together with 20% fetal calf serum to cultures of quiescent HL-60 cells, growth was stimulated to the extent that the generation time was reduced by approximately 9 h to 32.4 h. GPRE alone was unable to stimulate the quiescent cells. The growth stimulatory effect was not restricted to one cell generation but was a characteristic of at least the following two cell cycles. GPRE extract from L-cells synchronized by centrifugal elutriation was most efficient when isolated from cells in early G1 phase, while extract from S phase cells had virtually no effect.

This problem is most often seen in examination of CSF from patients with lymphoma or leukemia. We suggest a statistical model of this problem in which the numbers of malignant cells in the blood and the fluid specimen are related to the number of red blood cells. Using the Poisson distribution, the probability of finding the observed number of malignant cells in the fluid is calculated and used as the basis for suggesting whether these cells are likely to represent contamination effect or true involvement of the fluid by the malignancy.

Ig) (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) commonly produce a remission in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) but have only rarely been successful in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA).

In one patient with an associated ITP a prompt rise in platelet count but no change in Hb concentration occurred. The second patient with AIHA associated with chronic lymphatic leukaemia showed a prompt response, with a rise in Hb concentration and fall in plasma bilirubin. The poor response to i.v. Ig seen in AIHA may be related to the expansion of the reticulo-endothelial system seen in AIHA but not ITP. Clearance of antibody-coated red cells and platelets may occur at different rates and/or sites in the reticulo-endothelial system and this may account for the differential response seen in case 1. Higher doses of i.v.

To our knowledge, this is the first example, among anticancer drugs, of pharmacological intervention of a biochemical pathway based strictly on regulatory control. Several features of polyamine biology naturally favor this approach and may account for its relative success. These include (a) the nature of the regulatory mechanisms themselves, (b) the exquisite sensitivity of the pathway to regulatory control, (c) the rapid turnover of ODC and AdoMetDC, (d) the different structural specificity of ODC and AdoMetDC regulation versus growth-dependent functions, and (e) the direct dependence of growth on sustained polyamine biosynthesis. As such, the regulatory approach to interference with polyamine biosynthesis offers several advantages over the use of specific enzyme inhibitors (Table 10). Of these, perhaps, the more significant are the facts that more than one enzyme can be simultaneously and specifically suppressed and that compensatory mechanisms, which otherwise counter the effects of enzyme inhibitors (11), are not invoked. We are encouraged by the concurrence of in vitro mechanistic findings with the predictions of the hypothesis for the regulatory approach and by the in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory effects of the analogs against murine leukemia. One disadvantage of the regulatory analogs, such as BESm, has been that, as with specific polyamine inhibitors such as DFMO, analog-induced polyamine depletion results in cytostatic growth inhibition. While this response may help to minimize host toxicities, it clearly compromises antitumor activity. An intriguing exception to this generality has recently been found among human lung carcinoma cell lines. Previously, Luk et al. (93, 94) and others (95) reported that, among a spectrum of human lung carcinoma lines, small cell carcinoma was exquisitely sensitive to the ODC inhibitor, DFMO. Not only did these cells display a cessation of growth but also an inability to survive during DFMO-induced polyamine depletion. Studies extending these findings to long term maintenance therapy in human small cell lung carcinoma implants in athymic mice revealed sustained growth inhibition of the tumor for longer than one year (96). Casero et al. (97) now find that human large cell carcinoma, which is otherwise refractory to chemotherapeutic intervention, displays a cytotoxic response in vitro to polyamine depletion induced by BES or BESm but not by DFMO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Porter, C W', 'Bergeron, R J']","['Porter CW', 'Bergeron RJ']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carboxy-Lyases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Spermidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(88)90009-x [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1988;27:57-79. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(88)90009-x.,"['0 (Polyamines)', 'EC 4.1.1.- (Carboxy-Lyases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']","['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

An excess of methotrexate blocks incorporation of the photoprobe. Following cyanogen bromide digestion of the radiolabeled enzyme and high-pressure liquid chromatographic separation of the generated peptides, a majority of the label was centered around residues 63-65 (Lys-Asn-Arg), part of the inhibitor binding domain. This photoprobe is also transported into murine L1210 cells in a temperature-dependent, sulfhydryl reagent inhibitable manner with a Vmax similar to that for methotrexate. Ultraviolet irradiation at 4 degrees C of a cell suspension that had been incubated with the radiolabeled photoprobe resulted in the covalent modification of a 46-48 Kd protein. This can be demonstrated when the plasma membranes from the labeled cells are analyzed via sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Labeling of this protein occurs half-maximally at a reagent concentration that correlates with the Kt for transport of the iodinated compound. Protection against labeling of this protein by increasing amounts of methotrexate parallels the concentration dependence of inhibition of photoprobe uptake by methotrexate.

The following time periods were evaluated: (1) during therapy; (2) between the end of therapy and the onset of puberty, and (3) between the onset of puberty and the most recent observation. We found: (1) a reduction of height SDS during therapy, related to the irradiation dose used; no significant effect of the duration of the therapy could be established; (2) a normal growth rate during the second time period studied for the total group, but a further decrease in height SDS for those found to be growth hormone deficient after therapy (47%), and (3) a further decrease in height SDS during puberty. The timing of puberty in the female patients was normal. We conclude that in patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, growth impairment has several components, different in timing and mechanism.","['Logghe, K A', 'Bourguignon, J P', 'Craen, M', 'Benoit, Y']","['Logghe KA', 'Bourguignon JP', 'Craen M', 'Benoit Y']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Height', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*etiology', 'Growth Hormone/deficiency/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Puberty']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000181030 [doi]'],ppublish,Horm Res. 1988;30(2-3):62-7. doi: 10.1159/000181030.,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,,,,,,,

Results indicate that the cybrid cells (HL-R) incorporated with reticulocyte cytoplasts become differentiated, and the malignancy is obviously suppressed or reversed to a certain degree when compared with those of parental tumor cells. They lose the growth ability to form colony soft agar medium, become non-tumorigenic under heterotransplantation to nude mice, and are accompanied by decrease in growth rate, cellular mitotic index and DNA synthesis. No gene transcripts or homologous sequence of mRNA corresponding to c-myc oncogene can be detected in cybrid cells by Northern blot technique with cloned c-myc gene probe, suggesting that the expression of originally active c-myc has been inhibited. On the other hand, analysis, by the same molecular hybridization technique with human globin gene probe and by PAGE method, of the expression of globin gene products in cybrid cells detected at the transcription (globin mRNA) and translation (hemoglobin) levels demonstrates consistently that originally inactive human globin gene has been activated to express in passages. These results suggest that some regulatory factors existing in reticulocyte cytoplasm can regulate gene expression and reverse malignant phenotype of leukemia tumor cells.","['Xue, S P', 'Liu, Y H']","['Xue SP', 'Liu YH']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sci Sin B,"Scientia Sinica.

Secondly, the accumulation of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (R123) in the different cell lines were analyzed. It could be observed that the resistant S180DOX and CHOCOL cells needed significantly more time to accumulate R123 than their sensitive parental cell lines or L1210AraC cells.

The in vivo growth exhibited better than that in vitro. Histological and morphological findings of these four different kinds of tumor cells are similar to those of original tumor cells. Treatment of the microencapsulated tumor cells (MTC) with cytotoxic drugs (adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide) in vitro showed no significant difference in percent inhibition (p greater than 0.05) between the encapsulated and non-encapsulated cells.

Minority rates, adjusted to the 1964 China population, ranged from 26.7 (Miao) to 127.5 (Kazak). Multiple high-risk areas were noted for cancer of the esophagus and other sites, and urban rates exceeded those for rural areas. The transitional experience among U.S. Chinese was examined at geographic-generational levels. Among U.S. Chinese, downward trends were found for cancers known as to be high-risk for Asian-Chinese (nasopharynx, esophagus, liver, uterus, and perhaps stomach). The reverse was true for low-risk sites (colon, lung leukemia, and female breast). Lung and colorectal cancers among females were the only major sites for which foreign-born Chinese had higher rates than U.S.-born.","['King, H', 'Locke, F B']","['King H', 'Locke FB']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Asian Americans', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Female', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Sex Factors', 'Singapore']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1988;13(3-4):157-66.,,,,,,,,,

The monophosphate and triphosphate forms of the drug were detected within a few hours of 3'-NH2-dCyd treatment of intact cells. No significant change in the deoxynucleoside triphosphate levels was observed during the early stages of treatment. However, by 24 h a 2-fold increase in the amount of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates was seen. The triphosphate form of the drug competitively inhibited dCTP incorporation into calf thymus DNA using highly purified DNA polymerase alpha. The Ki was determined to be 9.6 microM with respect to dCTP. Incorporation of the analogue into DNA was not detected. On the other hand, sucrose gradient analysis suggested that incorporation of the analogue into actively synthesized DNA may account for the biological activity of this compound. Treatment with 3'-NH2-dCyd induced single-strand breaks in actively synthesized DNA, but no double-strand breaks were observed in the presence of the analogue.

One protocol consisted of repetitive week-long exposures to 300 ppm benzene (6 h/d x 5 d/wk) interrupted by 2 weeks of non-exposure. The exposure pattern (1 week of exposure followed by 2 weeks of non-exposure) was continued until the death of the last exposed animal. The second protocol consisted of exposures to 1200 ppm benzene (6 h/d x 5 d/wk) for 10 weeks. Exposures were then terminated and the animals allowed to live out their lives. For each protocol, appropriate age-matched control mice received comparable exposures to filtered, conditioned air. The discontinuous exposure patterns mimic the patterns of exposure often encountered in the workplace and, in addition, prolong the survival of exposed animals so as to maximize potential tumorigenic responses. Both exposure protocols were markedly hematotoxic to both mouse strains as measured by peripheral blood counts. Both strains of mice responded to the intermittent 300 ppm benzene exposures with elevated incidences of malignant tumors. Particularly noteworthy was a 35% incidence of zymbal gland tumors in the C57Bl mice. In contrast, only the CD-1 mice responded to the 1200 ppm benzene exposures delivered over 10 weeks with elevated tumor incidences. A 46% incidence of lung adenoma was particularly striking in these mice.

To address the relationship between congenital transmission of EV21 and host susceptibility to ALV-E infection, SF roosters that were heterozygous for the dominant gene for susceptibility to ALV-E were mated with ev-negative rapid-feathering (RF), subgroup E-resistant dams to produce SF and RF progeny. The SF female progeny that were heterozygous ALV-E susceptible were viremic at hatch and, when mature, consistently shed the ALV group-specific antigen, p27, in the egg albumen they produced. In contrast, SF females that were homozygous ALV-E resistant were neither viremic at hatch nor shedders of ALV p27. Infectious ALV-E assays of progeny from susceptible and resistant SF dams confirmed that maternal cellular resistance to ALV-E limited congenital transmission of EV21.

These characteristics of FT-ADM are partly due to the presence of a 2'-fluoro atom which strengthens the glycoside bond. FT-ADM, however, is sparingly soluble in water because of lack of the 3'-amino group of adriamycin. To increase the solubility of FT-ADM, a hydrophilic group was added at the 14-OH group. Then, the 14-hemisuccinate, 14-hemiglutarate, 14-hemiadipiate, 14-hemipimelate and 14-hemisuberate derivatives of FT-ADM were synthesized. Among them, the 14-hemipimelate derivative (FAD-104) was selected for further development because of its potent antitumour activity and weak toxicity. When drugs were injected intraperitoneally every day from day 1 to 9, FAD-104 showed an apparently stronger antitumour effect against mouse L-1210 leukaemia than adriamycin with lower toxicities. FAD-104 was also more effective than adriamycin on L-1210 using other administration schedules. A characteristic feature is that FAD-104 is effective over a very broad range, which will be advantageous for safe clinical use. FAD-104 also showed marked antitumour effect against L-1210 when it was injected intravenously either once on day 1 or three times on days 1, 5 and 9. Thus, FAD-104 may be a more potent antitumour anthracycline than adriamycin.","['Umezawa, K', 'Takeuchi, T', 'Komuro, K', 'Nosaka, C', 'Kunimoto, S', 'Tsuchiya, T', 'Takagi, Y', 'Umezawa, S', 'Umezawa, H']","['Umezawa K', 'Takeuchi T', 'Komuro K', 'Nosaka C', 'Kunimoto S', 'Tsuchiya T', 'Takagi Y', 'Umezawa S', 'Umezawa H']","['Institute of Microbial Chemistry, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Drugs under experimental and clinical research,7802135,IM,"['Animals', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drugs Exp Clin Res. 1988;14(7):429-34.,"['103930-51-4 (7-O-(2,6-dideoxy-2-fluorotalopyranose)adriamycinone)', '103946-11-8 (7-O-(2,6-dideoxy-2-fluorotalopyranosyl)daunomycinone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,

These cells share with human pluripotent hemopoietic cells the unique ability to vary their proliferative status from a non-cycling (GO) state to a cycling one (continuous progression from G1----S----G2----M). Time course studies of the size and turnover of these primitive, normally quiescent human hemopoietic cell populations in long-term marrow cultures has provided evidence that marrow mesenchymal elements play a role not only in supporting their maintenance, but also in regulating their proliferation. A model delineating how this regulation may be mediated based on known features of mesenchymal cell and hemopoietic progenitor cell biology is presented together with a number of predictions of the model. Preliminary tests are consistent with these. Longterm marrow cultures offer an in vitro system that can be used to analyze how the proliferation of very primitive hemopoietic cells may be controlled by mesenchymal cells. The molecular mechanisms involved may be the same as those that are normally operative in the marrow in vivo and which are de-regulated or by-passed in several human hemopoietic malignancies.","['Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.

When DFO, 1.0 microM, was included with each agent in dose-response studies, a synergistic enhancement of the antiproliferative effects was observed.

The results support other porcine studies which indicate the swine NK system has both similarities and differences to this system in other species. Profiles of NK activity indicated swine NK cells are highly reactive against the YAC-1 lymphoma, the K-562 myeloid leukemia, the P-815 mastocytoma, and the TU-5 virally transformed fibroblast. In contrast, the MOLT-4 and SB leukemias are NK resistant. Kinetic studies indicated that in Yorkshire swine, NK lysis begins 6 h after mixing effectors and targets. The kinetics of the lytic reaction differ both from other breeds of swine and from other species, where cytotoxicity is readily measured in 4-h assays. The delayed lysis was not due to delayed target cell recognition, because Yorkshire swine NK cells are rapidly bound to tumor targets. The delayed lysis seems to be due to a refractoriness in the NK lytic mechanism. This delay may relate to the morphologic finding that the target-binding cell in Yorkshire swine appeared quite different from the large granular lymphocyte (LGL) reported as the NK effector in humans and rodents. Indeed, in light microscopic studies the typical tumor-binding cell in Yorkshire swine is a small, apparently nongranular, lymphocyte. Analysis of NK activity at the single cell level was performed with single effector-tumor conjugates immobilized in agarose. Generally, lysis by target binders paralleled sensitivity to lysis in 51Cr release tests, indicating lysis in agarose may be used as an NK index in swine. Like other species, swine NK cells were found to be nonadherent lymphocytes with a characteristic tissue distribution. Peripheral blood and spleen had the highest levels of NK activity. Lymph node cells displayed a small amount of NK activity which was limited to the YAC-1 target, while thymocytes showed no appreciable NK activity against any of the cell lines tested.","['Pinto, A', 'Ferguson, F']","['Pinto A', 'Ferguson F']","['Medical College of Pennsylvania, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Philadelphia 19129.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/immunology', 'Swine/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(88)90022-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(88)90022-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1988 Dec;20(1):15-29. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(88)90022-0.,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, it appears that the remission can be maintained with intermittent administration of interferon weekly or even every other week. As compared to splenectomized patients, granulocyte recovery is delayed in nonsplenectomized patients. However, after several months of treatment there is no difference in peripheral blood values between splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients. In the light of the present results, primary splenectomy remains justified in a selected group of patients for whom the risk of surgery (due to low granulocytes and/or platelets) is low and for whom careful evaluation predicts a high potential for long-standing remission after splenectomy. In the other cases, initial interferon therapy seems justified.","['Frey, B', 'Hofmann, V', 'Cavalli, F', 'Fehr, J', 'Kroner, T', 'Nesthus, I', 'Schwarzmeier, J']","['Frey B', 'Hofmann V', 'Cavalli F', 'Fehr J', 'Kroner T', 'Nesthus I', 'Schwarzmeier J']","['Abeilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsspital Zurich.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy']",,1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1988 Oct 15;118(41):1468-75.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,Wirksamkeit von rekombinantem Interferon-alpha 2 bei 34 Patienten mit Haarzell-Leukamie.

Two genetic components segregate with susceptibility to this neurological disease: the presence of multiple proviral copies of N-tropic endogenous murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) and homozygosity of the permissive allele for N-tropic viral replication (Fv-1n/n). We have quantified the levels of RNA for several endogenous retroviruses, using virus specific oligonucleotide probes, in various tissues of C58 mice in relation to age and immunosuppression. A tissue specific increase in expression of 3.0 kb AKR MuLV RNA in the spinal cords of mice occurred with increasing age of the mice and was enhanced several-fold by immunosuppression in old mice. Susceptibility to LDV-induced poliomyelitis occurs in the same age dependent manner as AKR MuLV expression and is also enhanced by immunosuppression. In contrast, the mink cell focus forming virus (MCF) RNA levels in the spinal cord remained constant despite apparent variations in MCF RNA expression in other tissues, and no xenotropic retrovirus RNA was detectable in spinal cords or brains of the C58 mice. The increased AKR MuLV RNA in the spinal cord was shown by in situ hybridization to be mainly located in the same motor neurons that become infected with LDV in these mice and are destroyed as paralysis develops. These results support a novel dual virus virus hypothesis for LDV-induced poliomyelitis in which increased endogenous retroviral expression in motor neurons renders these cells susceptible to cytocidal replication of LDV and hence to the development of LDV-induced poliomyelitis.","['Contag, C H', 'Plagemann, P G']","['Contag CH', 'Plagemann PG']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455-0312.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus/*genetics/growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Motor Neurons/*microbiology', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Paralysis/*microbiology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Spinal Cord/*microbiology']",,1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0882-4010(88)90101-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0882-4010(88)90101-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 1988 Oct;5(4):287-96. doi: 10.1016/0882-4010(88)90101-5.,['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)'],"['AI 15267/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Routine empiric antifungal treatment was initiated in our institution in 1982. Amphotericin B was given to granulocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies with (a) unremitting fever after 48-72 h of antibiotic treatment, (b) recurrent fever during antibiotic treatment, or (c) with newly detected pulmonary infiltrates, sinusitis, skin and retinal lesions suggestive of a fungal infection. With this approach the rate of systemic fungal infections decreased significantly from 10% (27 of 270 patients; 1973-1981) to 4% (6 of 153 patients; 1982-1986, P less than 0.02). The reduction of systemic fungal infections was most prominent in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, where its proportion decreased from 16% (16 of 98 patients; 1973-1981) to 4% (2 of 50 patients; 1982-1986, P less than 0.023).

We examined the blood leukocytes and bone marrow fibroblasts of four patients with Philadelphia chromosome- (Ph1) positive CML for evidence of rearrangement in the breakpoint cluster region (BCR). Fibroblasts were obtained by growing bone marrow in long-term culture, disposing of nonadherent cells, and passaging three times before final trypsinization and analysis. DNA from fibroblasts and peripheral leukocytes was digested with Bg1II, Bc1I, EcoRI, and HindIII restriction endonucleases and hybridized to both 3' and 5' BCR probes. Southern blot analysis of the DNA from the peripheral leukocytes in all four patients demonstrated rearrangement in the BCR. However, analysis of DNA from marrow fibroblasts showed only the normal BCR restriction fragments in all patients. This study demonstrates the absence of the Ph1 -associated molecular events in the fibroblasts of patients with CML. It is consistent with previous studies using G6PD isoenzymes to show polyclonality in CML fibroblasts and with most cytogenetic studies that did not show the Ph1 in these cells. In summary, we present further evidence that involvement of CML fibroblasts is a secondary event in the leukemogenic process.","[""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Shtalrid, M', 'Blick, M', 'Beran, M', 'Talpaz, M']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Shtalrid M', 'Blick M', 'Beran M', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Fibroblasts/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Restriction Mapping']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1988;2(1):25-9.,,,,,,,,,

The approach provided an efficient method for obtaining monoclonal antibodies to a specific low abundance nuclear antigen that has not been purified. Sixteen wells from three fusions contained antibody displaying a specific reaction with the nuclear protein fraction obtained from the HL-60 cells. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that all of the sixteen specific hybridoma cell lines produced antibody against the same Mr 55,000 nuclear antigen. Selecting hybridoma cells that produce antibody reactive with the native antigen provided antibody suitable for detecting MNDA in immunocytochemical tests. The rat monoclonal antibodies were purified and coupled to CNBr-activated agarose and carbonyldiimidazole-activated agarose.

McAbs L243 (anti-HLA-DR antigen), MY9, S3-13 and S17-25 were cytotoxic almost completely with CFU-GM from NBM as well as from NPB, McAbs R1, B19 and WGHS 29.1 reacted with a high percentage of NBM CFU-GM but not with those from NPB. The antigens expressed on normal CFU-GM were also found on the CFU-L in the majority of patients. However, PMN29 reacted strongly with ""late"" CFU-GM from NBM and did not react with CFU-L. In contrast, some of the McAbs (S4-7, VIM-2) recognized the antigens on a much higher proportion of CFU-L than ""early"" CFU-GM from NBM. The expression of the majority of the antigens on leukaemic clonogenic cells tends to vary between different patients and also between the different cells of an individual patient.

Cases were identified through four population-based cancer registries in the U.S. and controls were randomly selected from the same geographic areas. Exposure to asbestos was assessed by classifying each job held by a subject into one of four categories, based on the estimated intensity of exposure to asbestos. Evidence was found for a modest increasing risk of CLL with increasing asbestos exposure. Relative to persons with no known occupational exposure to asbestos, the risk for CLL was 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-1.6) for low, 1.2 (CI = 0.8-1.8) for medium, and 1.4 (CI = 0.8-2.3) for high peak asbestos exposure (p value for trend = 0.13). The association was strongest in white study subjects and in those individuals exposed 10 to 19 years prior to the interview. No association was observed between MM and occupational exposure to asbestos in the entire study population or within specific subgroups.

The dye-exclusion rate was closely correlated with cell survival after hyperthermia of L5178Y cells, suggesting that this is a simple method of detecting the thermosensitivity and thermotolerance of cancer cells. The difference in survival of L5178Y cells and M10 cells after combined treatment with gamma irradiation and hyperthermia was smaller than with gamma irradiation alone. It was also found that there was a relationship between radiation-induced interphase death and hyperthermia-induced interphase death, and that interphase death accounted for a major part of cell death caused by hyperthermia in mouse leukemia cells.","['Baba, Y', 'Yasunaga, T', 'Uozumi, H', 'Takahashi, M', 'Sawada, S']","['Baba Y', 'Yasunaga T', 'Uozumi H', 'Takahashi M', 'Sawada S']","['Department of Radiology, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Radiat Med,Radiation medicine,8412264,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', '*Hot Temperature', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/radiation effects', 'Radiation Tolerance', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/radiation effects']",,1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Med. 1988 Sep-Oct;6(5):232-9.,['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)'],,,,,,,,

The human cell lines used in this study were: HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia, K562 erythroleukemia, BHM-97 and A2058 melanoma, and A-1, A-2, A-4 and A-6 clones of A2058 line. Inducers of differentiation were phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and retinoic acid (RA); cytostatics: adriamycin (ADM), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), dacarbazine (DTIC), cis-platin (platidiam, PD) and arabinosyl cytosine (ara-C). Expression of the differentiated phenotype was shown by cell attachment (HL-60), hemoglobin production (K562), dendrit formation (A2058, BHM-97). Individual cells expressed the differentiated phenotype heterogeneously in all types of cell populations. Clone A-4 was the most, and clone A-6 the least sensitive to PMA. The drug sensitivity of the clones was different and drug-dependent. It is concluded that induction of differentiation as another approach to therapy of cancer, similar to anticancer drug therapy, also implies disadvantages due to population heterogeneity. Combinations of cytostatics with differentiation inducers might result in improved therapeutic effects.","['Palyi, I']",['Palyi I'],"['Research Institute of Oncopathology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(88)80185-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(88)80185-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1988 Dec;184(1):11-7. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(88)80185-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in patients evidencing a karyotypic alteration from the initial karyotypic findings progresses in severity that includes overt leukemia, and results in a shorter survival than in patients who show no further karyotypic changes. Therefore, the prognosis of patients with MDS can be predicted more accurately by subsequently reanalyzing their chromosomes after the initial analysis, as well as by examining their peripheral blood/counts, and by monitoring bone marrow cytology.","['Maekawa, T', 'Fujii, H', 'Shizumi, Y', 'Ebisui, S', 'Horishi, M', 'Suyama, Y', 'Miyoshi, M', 'Horiike, S']","['Maekawa T', 'Fujii H', 'Shizumi Y', 'Ebisui S', 'Horishi M', 'Suyama Y', 'Miyoshi M', 'Horiike S']","['3rd Dept. of Intern.

Treatment of age matched female control mice (MRL-+/+) or young (3 month) MRL-lpr/lpr mice did not lead to similar toxicity. However, pretreatment of young mice with the pyridine extract of residue of Corynebacterium parvum (alternatively designated Propionibacterium acnes) prior to lipopolysaccharide injection, led to the rapid death of 100% of the mice. Similarly, treatment of old MRL-lpr/lpr mice, or young mice pretreated with the C. parvum extract, with doses of indomethacin non-toxic to MRL-+/+ mice (5 mg/kg), led to 100% mortality. These results indicate that the presence of the lpr gene in MRL mice leads to an age-dependent induction of RES activation. Whether this RES activation is a result of the autoimmune diseases these animals exhibit or is a secondary sequelae of the lymphoproliferation associated with the lpr gene cannot be ascertained. However, the finding of increased sensitivity of old MRL-lpr/lpr mice to the toxic effects of indomethacin indicates that the RES activation occurring in these animals is similar to that observed previously in mice bearing the BCL1-leukemia or treated with C. parvum.","['Hart, D A']",['Hart DA'],"['Joint Injury and Diseases Research Group, University of Calgary Health Sciences Centre, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,J Clin Lab Immunol,Journal of clinical & laboratory immunology,7808987,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Indomethacin/*toxicity', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mononuclear Phagocyte System/*drug effects/immunology']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Clin Lab Immunol. 1988 Jul;26(3):129-34.,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",,,,,,,,

In contrast, old rats that had been injected RA-2 iv survived longer than controls. Survival of DBA/2 mice inoculated intraperitoneally (ip) with P388 cells was not influenced by the age of the host. The antineoplastic activity of ambazone and, to a less extent, of 5-fluorouracil against P388 was drastically lower in 12 months old mice than in 3 months old tumour bearers. Likewise a graduate loss of antineoplastic activity of ambazone against Ca-755 was observed with increasing age of the mice, whereas the effect of ambazone and 5-fluorouracil against RA-2 did not depend on the age of the rats.

Biosynthesis of macromolecules indicated by the incorporation rate of [14C]adenine (DNA, RNA), [14C]thymidine (DNA), [14C]uridine (RNA) and [14C]valine (proteins) were studied for concentration (75 to 600 mumol/l) and time dependence. Cloturin inhibits incorporation of all 14C-precursors into the TCA-insoluble fraction of both types of cells in proportion to its concentration. The complete inhibition of 14C-precursors was reached at the highest concentrations of cloturin (300 and 600 mumol/l). The fact that incorporation of four precursors is inhibited suggests that the effect of cloturin lies at an underlying level of energy generation or transfer, rather than at specific reactions in the biosynthesis of DNA and proteins. The rate of DNA synthesis is rapidly affected by the lowering of the level of any of the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. Interference with the generation of high-energy phosphate bonds is one of the mechanisms available for induction of nucleotide deficiency. A depletion of nucleotide pools can serve as an efficient tool to inhibit cellular growth and to induce cell death under some circumstances.","['Miko, M', 'Krepelka, J', 'Melka, M']","['Miko M', 'Krepelka J', 'Melka M']","['Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry, Slovak Polyt.

Pyrromycin, marcellomycin and musettamycin, which possess an identical aglycone structure containing a Cl-hydroxyl group, exhibited relatively low optimal inductive concentrations. In contrast, the optimal inductive concentration of aclacinomycin A, which lacks the Cl-hydroxyl group, was markedly higher, i.e., the differentiation inducing capacity was lower. It should be noted, however, that the yield of differentiated cells following treatment with the monosaccharide-anthracycline pyrromycin was distinctly lower than that after treatment with the oligo-saccharide-anthracyclines, aclacinomycin A, marcellomycin or musettamycin. Thus, our data indicate that the efficacy of anthracyclines to induce erythroid differentiation is related to a) the presence of a Cl-hydroxyl group in the aglycone and b) the presence of an oligosaccharide side chain.","['Steinheider, G', 'Schaefer, A', 'Westendorf, J', 'Marquardt, H']","['Steinheider G', 'Schaefer A', 'Westendorf J', 'Marquardt H']","['Department of Toxicology, Hamburg University Medical School, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,IM,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Anthracyclines', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice']",,1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00141291 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 1988 Mar;4(1):123-33. doi: 10.1007/BF00141291.,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '668-17-7 (pyrromycin)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,

The property of inducing cellular differentiation in vitro has also been demonstrated for different antineoplastic agents commonly used in therapeutic protocols. The molecular events involved during erythroid differentiation are wholly unknown. Here we demonstrate that K562 cells, undergoing differentiation by the alkylating agent Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloro platinum (II), CDDP) employed in clinical protocols for the treatment of solid tumors, are induced to produce haemoglobin. Down modulation of the transferrin receptor (Tfr), highly represented on the cell surface, is also observed during the early stages of differentiation. Furthermore, Tf receptor expression correlates with cell growth, is down regulated and lost during terminal differentiation. The Tfr down regulation is an early event, before haemoglobin production, during cell differentiation. The data suggest that CDDP can induce terminal differentiation in K562 cells in vitro, like other antineoplastic agents.","['Parodi, M T', 'Tonini, G P', 'Bologna, R', 'Franchini, E', 'Cornaglia-Ferraris, P']","['Parodi MT', 'Tonini GP', 'Bologna R', 'Franchini E', 'Cornaglia-Ferraris P']","['Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, G.

Among these patients prolongation of liver T1 was related to the extent of disease elsewhere in the body. For 23 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) examined at the time of diagnosis, liver T1 was significantly correlated with other known markers of disease extent or activity (alkaline phosphatase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the presence of systemic symptoms). No such correlations were observed among 25 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Muscle and fat T1 was measured in 26 patients with lymphoma, 14 patients with acute leukemia and 88 volunteers. Seven of the patients with lymphoma and 2 of those with leukemia had muscle T1 values above the range observed for volunteers. Similarly, 3 patients with lymphoma and 1 with leukemia had prolonged fat T1. These findings indicate that a systemic effect of malignancy on T1 is detectable in a proportion of humans with lymphoma or leukemia.","['Richards, M A', 'Gregory, W M', 'Webb, J A']","['Richards MA', 'Gregory WM', 'Webb JA']","[""ICRF Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Magn Reson Imaging,Magnetic resonance imaging,8214883,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscles/pathology']",,1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0730-725X(88)90130-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0730-725x(88)90130-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Magn Reson Imaging. 1988 Sep-Oct;6(5):557-65. doi: 10.1016/0730-725x(88)90130-0.,,,,,,,,,

Of these cells, HL-60, A-253 and Colo 320 CM were sensitive and Friend leukaemia resistant to this agent. The effects were time- and concentration-dependent. During the initial 24-48 h of treatment, a slowdown in cell proliferation was apparent but cell death was not extensive. After 24-48 h, there was a reduction in the proportion of cells in S phase of the cell cycle and the cells became preferentially arrested in G1 phase. The G1 cells showed high heterogeneity with respect to RNA content and some cells were characterized by very low RNA content. Progressive cell death occurred in cultures maintained with Pannon for up to 7 d in proportion to its concentration. Reductions of 50 and 90% in clonogenicity of A-253 cells were observed during their growth in the presence of 0.13 and 1.5 micrograms/ml of this protein, respectively. Exponentially growing cells were more sensitive to Pannon compared with cells from confluent cultures. Colonies of A-253 cells growing in the presence of Pannon were much smaller in size compared with control colonies, indicating that the rate of proliferation of clonogens is reduced by this agent.

The replication of HL-60/AR and of adriamycin sensitive parental HL-60 cells was inhibited by greater than 80% by 30 nM aclacinomycin A and the majority of cells (about 60 to 70%) of each line underwent granulocytic differentiation when treated with this agent, as assessed by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Measurement of the initial rates of uptake of daunorubicin and steady-state levels of adriamycin in sensitive and resistant lines indicated that transport differences do not fully account for the insensitivity of HL-60/AR cells to these anthracyclines. Furthermore, 30-fold greater levels of cell-associated adriamycin were required in HL-60/AR cells for toxic effects equivalent to those occurring in parental HL-60 cells. Analysis of DNA histograms of adriamycin treated HL-60 cells indicated that cell-cycle progression was blocked in G2-M, while this antibiotic blocked progression of resistant HL-60/AR cells in the S phase. These results suggest that, in addition to alterations in membrane permeability, differential sensitivity of multiple biochemical targets may be important in the toxicity and the development of resistance to anthracyclines. Furthermore, the finding that HL-60/AR cells do not exhibit cross-resistance to aclacinomycin A indicates that this oligosaccharide-containing anthracycline may have utility in the treatment of adriamycin resistant neoplasms.","['Burres, N S', 'Myers, M T', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Burres NS', 'Myers MT', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,IM,"['Aclarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute']",,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1988 Jul;10(1):47-57.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

In order to determine the significance of free radicals (FR) in this disorder, we determined the presence and localization of free radical scavengers (FRS) and scavenger-like systems in L1210 leukemia cells obtained in vivo and from in vitro cultures. FR are metabolized or detoxified by certain FRS such as glutathione (GSH and GSSG), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and enzymes such as epoxide hydrolase (EH). In all cases specific fractions of L1210 cells, bone marrow and liver were examined for FR/FRS levels. Reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were measured fluorometerically using o-opthalaldehyde (OPT). SOD was determined colorimetrically utilizing pyrogallol by substrate autolysis inhibition, and EH was determined by utilizing [3H] styrene oxide as a substrate. Ratios of GSH/GSSG in fractions prepared from in vivo and in vitro L1210 cells showed a predominance of GSH-reductase with the highest activity in mitochondria (ratio = 15 vs. 10). Normal liver showed a similar pattern whereas, leukemic liver showed altered GSH/GSSG ratios in mitochrondria and microsomes. Leukemic bone marrow showed a predominance of GSH-reductase in all fractions. EH activity was highest in microsomal fractions obtained from L1210 cells grown in vitro and found to become increased in both the mitrochondrial (100%) and microsomal (200%) fractions when cells were exposed to retinoic acid (RA) in culture. SOD activity in the cytosolic (21.2 U SOD/mg) and mitochondrial (12 U SOD/mg) fractions whereas, leukemic liver showed a significant decrease in activity in all fractions compared to normals. SOD was determined in fractions taken from L1210 cells in vivo and in vitro. Results demonstrated detectable but reduced SOD activity in the L1210 cell fractions as contrasted with liver activity. Results from these studies indicate that certain FRS systems are functional in L1210 leukemic animals. Furthermore, variations in the ratios or levels may be of significance in the leukemic and hematological states.","['Brown, A C', 'Lutton, J D']","['Brown AC', 'Lutton JD']","['Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/metabolism', '*Free Radicals', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Methylcholanthrene/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-5571-7_17 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1988;241:135-48. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-5571-7_17.,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,

Two techniques that detect low numbers of residual monoclonal B-lymphocytes currently include immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement and clonal excess analysis. Ig-gene rearrangement studies are time consuming and expensive. Clonal excess analysis by FC may be insensitive because of minimal surface immunoglobulin (SIg) expression. Three antigens, CD5, CD11c and CD14 are expressed on B-lymphocytes of CLL. CD14 is also expressed on most normal B-lymphocytes. In contrast, CD5 and CD11c are expressed on few normal B-lymphocytes. Consequently CD5 and CD11c are useful markers for detecting residual CLL cells. Appropriate selection of the second B-cell marker such as SIg, CD19, CD20 or other, is critical. We evaluated this approach in persons with CLL receiving therapy.

Disease progression from stage A to stage B or C and from stage B to stage C was found 50% of the A and B-diffuse patients as compared to 10% of the A and B-nondiffuse. The mean period during which this progression occurred was 18 months for the stages A and B with a diffuse pattern and 59 months for the stages A and B with a nondiffuse pattern. No differences could be observed in the nondiffuse group when our patients were analysed on the basis of nodular, interstitial and mixed pattern of bm involvement. All progressed patients required therapy. These findings support our previous observations, and present further evidence that in B-CLL patients with a diffuse pattern of bm disease at diagnosis, treatment should be initiated independently of their clinical stage.","['Pangalis, G A', 'Boussiotis, V A', 'Kittas, C']","['Pangalis GA', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Kittas C']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine, University of Athens, School of Medicine, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):373-5.,,,,,,,,,

Clinical staging systems, however, do not give information regarding disease progression. In this study the progression and survival of CLL in early clinical stages is analyzed. Among 261 patients with CLL, 134 (51%) were in stage A (M 60/F 74; mean age 64.2 years; DS = 11), and 87 (33%) in stage 0. Progression was analyzed as far as patients remained untreated (median: 11 months; range: 3-114). Thirty-three (24.6%) out of 134 patients in stage A progressed to more advanced stages (17 to B, 16 to C) with an actuarial cumulative risk for progression of 31% at 3 years. Variables at diagnosis predictive of a more likely progression were: number of lymph nodes involved (p less than 0.001), rapid lymphocyte doubling time (p = 0.0025), and markedly increased lymphocyte count (p = 0.02). Twenty-eight (32%) out of 87 patients in stage 0 progressed (8 to I, 12 to II, 7 to III), the actuarial cumulative risk being of 28% at 3 years. The only variable predictive of progression was a lower normal Hb level (p = 0.015). Although the survival probability of patients in stage A (0) was not statistically different from those in stage A (I, II), their median survivals were of 125.7 and 91 months, respectively.

These stimuli have now been found to cause a decrease in the cells' cytosolic pH. This acidification process was monitored by the fluorescent indicator 2',7'-bis (carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) introduced into these cells. The antigen induced acidification was the result of specific aggregation of membrane residing IgE, reached values up to 0.03 pH units and required the presence of sodium and calcium ions in the incubation medium. It was amiloride resistant but was blocked by the metabolic inhibitor deoxyglucose. Ionomycin caused a dose dependent decrease in cytosolic pH which was also sensitive to the pH of the extracellular medium. The acidification reached more than 0.1 pH units at optimal, non-cytotoxic, doses of ionomycin (1 microM) and decreased markedly as the medium pH increased from 7.0 to 8.0. The antigen and ionophore induced cytosolic acidification processes are interpreted as being the result of the increased concns of free cytosolic calcium ions rather than the effect of direct activation of a sodium-proton exchanger.

These observations suggest that conditioned medium contains a factor(s) that acts directly on hepatocytes to regulate SAA3 mRNA processing.","['Rienhoff, H Y Jr', 'Groudine, M']","['Rienhoff HY Jr', 'Groudine M']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', 'Histones/genetics', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Serum Amyloid A Protein/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1988/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.9.3710-3716.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Sep;8(9):3710-6. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.9.3710-3716.1988.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Serum Amyloid A Protein)']","['1 K11 AM 01537/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM31232/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC365427,,,,

We propose that light microscopy can be used (1) to detect quickly processing steps which have an adverse effect on the tissue antigenicity and (2) to check the specific reactivity of the immunogold detecting system normally employed at the ultrastructural level. The individual steps of fixation, dehydration and embedding were tested for their ability to preserve antigenicity by light microscopic peroxidase--anti-peroxidase cytochemistry. Steps that severely reduced antigenicity were replaced by less destructive alternatives compatible with reasonable ultrastructural preservation. The specific reactivity of the immunogold detecting system was assessed by using the light microscopic immunogold-silver staining method. We studied the antigen lactoferrin in human neutrophilic granulocytes from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. We obtained strong immunolabelling of specific granules and good ultrastructural preservation using routine methods at room temperature. For lactoferrin the method of choice was to fix in 3% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde followed by 1% OsO4, dehydrate in 70% ethanol, embed in LR White resin and polymerize at 40 degrees C for 40 h.

When compared with controls, the four leukaemic spleens examined showed a set of changes involving both the arterial and the venous system. A real increase in the absolute volume, surface and length of pulp arterial vessels was present. This increase was not so great as the enlargement of the spleen, thus resulting in a reduced density of distribution of arterial vessels in the infiltrated pulp. Enlargement of pulp cords and sinuses was also present: the pulp cord enlargement was apparent in the unit volume, which resulted in a disproportionately higher increase of the absolute volume, compared with that of sinuses. The sinus-cordal rearrangement and, particularly, the increase in the volume of pulp cords may cause a slowing down of blood cell circulation with resultant increased phagocytosis and hypersplenism. Moreover, it is suggested that the changes observed in the arterial bed of the spleen in hairy cell leukaemia involve both a reduced blood supply per unit volume of splenic pulp and a more marked conditioning of blood cells prior to their screening by cordal macrophages.","['Re, G', 'Pileri, S', 'Cau, R', 'Bucchi, M L', 'Casali, A M', 'Cavalli, G']","['Re G', 'Pileri S', 'Cau R', 'Bucchi ML', 'Casali AM', 'Cavalli G']","[""Cattedra di Patologia Speciale Medica II dell'Universita-Divisione di Medicina generale dell'Ospedale Bellaria, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arterioles/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/*blood supply/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/pathology']",,1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1988.tb02058.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1988 Oct;13(4):425-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1988.tb02058.x.,,,,,,,,,

There were significantly stronger serologic responses in the TSP patients than in their relatives or ATLL patients. High antibody titers in the presence of replicating virus often reflect the antigen load; however, these data are also consistent with the suggestion that neurologic damage in TSP may be immunologically mediated.","['Dalgleish, A', 'Richardson, J', 'Matutes, E', 'Cruickshank, K', 'Newell, A', 'Sinclair, A', 'Thorpe, R', 'Brasher, M', 'Weber, J', 'Catovsky, D']","['Dalgleish A', 'Richardson J', 'Matutes E', 'Cruickshank K', 'Newell A', 'Sinclair A', 'Thorpe R', 'Brasher M', 'Weber J', 'Catovsky D', 'et al.']","['MRC Clinical Research Centre, Harrow.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/immunology/*microbiology']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1988.4.475 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1988 Dec;4(6):475-85. doi: 10.1089/aid.1988.4.475.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",,,,,,,,

The ratio of KS to KA can be used as an indicator of the intensity of the selective constraints on the amino acid sequence of a protein. By this approach we have shown that for both gp120 and gp41, the rate of change in amino acid sequence relative to the overall rate of change in nucleotide sequence is higher than for any other protein yet analyzed. The gag proteins p15 and p17 evolve slightly less rapidly, but p24 is relatively strongly conserved. We have compared the env gene of HIV with those of two other retroviruses for which appropriate data are available. In neither murine leukemia virus nor feline leukemia virus do the envelope glycoproteins evolve particularly rapidly. These results suggest that HIV is unusual among retroviruses in that both gp120 and gp41 are evolving under extremely weak selective constraints relative to the rest of the viral genome; accordingly, much of the observed variation may be selectively neutral.","['Brown, A L', 'Monaghan, P']","['Brown AL', 'Monaghan P']","['Department of Genetics, University of Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Genes, Viral', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1988.4.399 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1988 Dec;4(6):399-407. doi: 10.1089/aid.1988.4.399.,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",,,,,,,,

Blast cells from a patient with ANLL-M1-M2 underwent morphological, functional and histochemical changes after treatment with 1 x 10(-7) and 1 x 10(-8) M TPA. The changes included adhesion to the plastic substrate, 2-4 fold increase in the number of NBT positive cells and an increase in the number of alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase (alpha-NAE) positive cells. These differentiation changes after treatment with TPA were followed by decrease in proliferative index and G1 cells containing high RNA as estimated by flow cytometry. Of the thirteen cases of undifferentiated or unclassified leukemias studied, two failed to respond to TPA. These data suggest that leukemic blasts retain their ability to express a variety of differentiated functions on induction by TPA.

The binding of 9-aminoacridine to tumour cells allows these cells to be located by fluorescent microscopy. Pre-treatment of these sections with BZAR, a known inhibitor of guanidinobenzoatase inhibited the binding of 9-aminoacridine to the tumour cells. These techniques defined the tumour cells in the sections; we then demonstrated by fluorescent microscopy that both Texas red-agmatine and BZAR also bound to the guanidinobenzoatase of these tumour cells. These fluorescent probes have been used as model compounds to illustrate the ability of both N-substituted agmatines and N-substituted arginines to deliver desired molecules to an enzyme on the surface of tumour cells.

Both thyroid hormones enhanced the colony growth from normal peripheral blood CFU-GM and the response was more evident with T4 than T3.

Patients treated with 32P showed a substantially higher incidence of malignancy than the group of patients not receiving 32P (p less than 0.001). The development of malignancies also seems to be related to the dosage of 32P. Patients who developed malignancies generally received higher doses of 32P (30 vs 20 mCi).

Our data indicate that c-abl is translocated to chromosome 22 where it is inserted after exon ""2"" or ""3"" of the bcr gene.

Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and blast phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia (BC/CML) are the two most common leukemias where metaphases with as low as 23 chromosomes have been reported. Recent studies have indicated that during the course of malignant development, cells undergo numerous changes, however, it is still not known whether malignant transformation proceeds or results from the near-haploid state. Retrospectively, we have examined 100 metaphases with chromosome counts of 23 to 35 in patients with CML who have not yet progressed to the blastic phase, to see whether such metaphases share any common characteristics with published cases. The unusual behavior of chromosomes 8, 17 and the presence of Ph-chromosomes in 85% of the cells are highly unique features in our study. These observations are compatible with those found in BC/CML patients reported earlier. Therefore, it is hypothesized that selective chromosome loss is a gradual phenomenon and one of these near-haploid clones may replace a diploid clone as the dominant component of the population during blast transformation. Several hypotheses are proposed as to the origin of such clones in malignant hematopoietic stem cells.","['Verma, R S', 'Macera, M J', 'Silver, R T', 'Coleman, M']","['Verma RS', 'Macera MJ', 'Silver RT', 'Coleman M']","['Division of Genetics, Long Island College Hospital, Brooklyn, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', '*Haploidy', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90022-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(11-12):941-50. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90022-7.,,"['CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'LCA25119/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Cytochemical stainings indicated that C2M cells had myelomonocytic characteristics. Chromosomal analysis showed the partial deletion of No. 2 chromosome. Intravenous injection of C2M cells resulted in the development of myeloid leukemia in syngeneic mice owing to the growth of C2M cells. When C2M cells were transplanted to C3H/He mice with B-type PGK, PGK of spleen expressed two bands on electrophoresis; A-type PGK from transplanted C2M cells and B-type PGK from recipient mice, and the density of A-type PGK became prominent as the disease progressed. When granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells of bone marrow cells from leukemic mice were cultured, two types of colonies were observed. By determining PGK types of the colonies, leukemic colonies could be differentiated from normal granulocyte/macrophage colonies. Since C2M cell line has an advantage of processing A-type PGK which can be readily distinguished by the electrophoresis from normal cells, it will serve as a useful tool to study the interaction between leukemic cells and normal hematopoietic cells.","['Kawai, N', 'Bessho, M', 'Hirashima, K']","['Kawai N', 'Bessho M', 'Hirashima K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Aberrations/enzymology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/*analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90018-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(11-12):911-6. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90018-5.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",,,,,,,,

Hemopoietic cells are especially dependent on the function of cobalamin for the folate-dependent synthesis of thymidylate (dTMP). Inhibition of methionine synthetase may therefore be of potential value in the treatment of hematological malignancies. In the present study we investigated the effect of nitrous oxide induced cobalamin inactivation on folate metabolism of fresh leukemic cells and the human myelomonocytic cell line U937. Cells were exposed to nitrous oxide for 20 h. Subsequently they were subjected to the deoxyuridine suppression test (dU test), which measures the disturbance of folate-dependent dTMP synthesis. In all bone marrow samples, cobalamin inactivation resulted in a 200% increase of the dU test value, implicating a decreased de-novo synthesis of dTMP. Incubation of leukemic cells with methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil or cycloleucine induced similar increases of the dU test values which could be further raised to 400% with the addition of N2O exposure. Prolonged experiments with U937 cells revealed that the disturbance of folate metabolism aggravated up to 48 h of nitrous oxide exposure. It can be concluded that cobalamin inactivation in human leukemic cells results in disturbed folate-dependent dTMP synthesis. Moreover, effects of several drugs interfering with folate metabolism can be enhanced.","['Ermens, A A', 'Kroes, A C', 'Schoester, M', 'van Lom, K', 'Lindemans, J', 'Abels, J']","['Ermens AA', 'Kroes AC', 'Schoester M', 'van Lom K', 'Lindemans J', 'Abels J']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyuridine', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Nitrous Oxide/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12/*metabolism']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90017-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(11-12):905-10. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90017-3.,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,

Fourteen patients were not evaluable because 10 patients were subjected to additional therapy such as gamma-globulin, interferon, radiation and pulse therapy of a large dose of methylprednisolone, 3 were prophylactically treated and the remaining one was a patient with disseminated bone marrow metastasis of prostatic cancer and not a patient with a hematologic malignancy. Excellent responses were obtained in 24 (42.1%) patients and good response in 12 (21.1%) patients, with a total rate of effectiveness of 63.2%. Three patients who were treated prophylactically and one patient who suffered from prostatic cancer with metastasis to bone marrow, were included in the final evaluation of side effects. Side effects were observed in only one patient (1/61, 1.6%). Mild neutropenia was identified in a patient of 78 years of age in 4 days after the combined regimen was started.

Only 15 cases involving IT MTX have been documented and even fewer with IT Ara-C. Three patients were studied who developed permanent or ascending myelopathy from treatment of their leukemia or rhabdomyosarcoma with IT chemotherapy. The patients' ages ranged from 7 to 62 years. Two of the three patients had electromyographic examinations. These revealed a primary motor neuron degeneration or a polyradiculopathy, superimposed on a mild axonal peripheral neuropathy associated with vincristine therapy. This is consistent with other electromyographic studies. Two of the patients showed an elevation of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein before development of paraplegia; one also showed a rise in myelin basic protein associated with his myelopathy. Neuropathologic findings suggest demyelination as the primary process leading to myelopathy. Increasing evidence has shown that total CSF protein, or more specifically, the myelin basic protein, may be elevated before development of paraplegia.

Still to be determined are (1) the optimal method of intensification, (2) the subset or subsets of patients for whom such treatment may be excessive, and (3) whether or not cure rates in ALL can be further improved by alternative approaches to intensification. St. Jude Total Therapy Study XI, based on predictions of the Goldie-Coldmand model of drug resistance, addresses some of these questions by use of rotational ""non-cross-resistant"" drug pairs throughout the course of therapy. A new method of risk classification has been developed to refine distinctions among prognostic subgroups, especially to identify patients with biologically unfavorable ALL.

Observations were recently reported where extreme hyperphosphatemia may represent another pathophysiological mechanism. We describe 2 cases, in 36- and 77-year-old women, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Acute renal failure was observed 2 days after cytotoxic treatment. Maximal blood creatinine values were 860 and 550 mumol/l respectively, and for phosphate 6.3 and 7.5 mmol/l. With oral phosphate binders, and after four peritoneal exchanges for the second patient, renal function gradually returned to normal values within 4 weeks. Tumor lysis syndrome with associated hyperphosphatemia is described exclusively in lymphoblastic malignancies and renal failure is probably a consequence of intratubular calcium phosphate precipitation.

Contribution to the monocyte-derived cytostatic activity towards human leukaemia K562 cells.,627-37,"Monocyte supernatants are cytotoxic towards WEHI 164 clone 13 cells and cytostatic towards K562 cells. The cytotoxic activity towards the clone 13 cells is entirely due to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), since it was completely neutralized by recombinant TNF alpha (rTNF) antiserum, and identical dose-response curves were obtained with supernatants and rTNF alpha. The cytostatic activity towards the K562 cells, however, was only partly due to TNF alpha, since this activity was only partly neutralized by the rTNF alpha antiserum. Moreover, the supernatants were found to be more cytostatic towards K562 cells than rTNF alpha preparations that contained comparable amounts of TNF. Alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) also contributed to cytostasis of the K562 cells, since antibodies against IFN-alpha partially inhibited the cytostatic activity in the supernatants, and further inhibition, although not complete, was obtained in the presence of both IFN-alpha antibodies and rTNF alpha antiserum. Moreover, recombinant IFN-alpha-2c (rIFN-alpha-2c) inhibited the growth of K562 cells, acting synergistically with rTNF alpha. Upon cation exchange chromatography, natural TNF in the monocyte supernatants eluted more broadly than rTNF, and significant amounts of TNF alpha were found in all column fractions containing cytostatic activity.","['Nissen-Meyer, J', 'Austgulen, R', 'Espevik, T']","['Nissen-Meyer J', 'Austgulen R', 'Espevik T']","['Cell Research Laboratory, University of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Monocytes/analysis/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*pharmacology']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb01495.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1988 Nov;28(5):627-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb01495.x.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,

By use of cell fusion between two genetically marked MEL cells, this finding was further investigated. We found that the drug, along with other agents which inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis, blocked the induction and turnover of the DMSO-inducible intracellular-erythroid-inducing activity (differentiation-inducing factor II) in a manner similar to that of cycloheximide, an inhibitor for nuclear protein synthesis. The inhibitory effect was confirmed by directly assaying differentiation-inducing factor II in the cell extracts.

The cell lines used were SP1, a nonmetastatic, aneuploid mouse mammary adenocarcinoma, and SP1HU9L, a metastatic variant of SP1. Cells were infected with delta e delta pMoTN, a replication-defective retrovirus vector which possesses the dominant selectable neo gene and crippled long terminal repeats. G418r colonies were obtained at a frequency of 4 x 10(-3). Southern blot analysis of a number of clones provided evidence of random and heritable integration of one or two copies of the proviral DNA. Clonal evolution of primary tumor growth and the nature of lineage relationships among spontaneous metastases and primary tumors were analyzed by subcutaneously injecting 10(5) cells from a pooled mixture of 3.6 x 10(2) G418r SP1HU9L or 10(4) G418r SP1 colonies into syngeneic CBA/J mice. The most striking finding was the relative clonal homogeneity of advanced primary tumors; they invariably consisted of a small number (less than 10) of distinct clones despite the fact that hundreds or thousands of uniquely marked clones had been injected. In the case of the metastatic SP1HU9L cells, the nature of these ""dominant"" clones varied from one tumor to another. Analysis of a number of lung metastases revealed that a proportion of them were derived from dominant primary tumor clones and were composed of one, and sometimes two, distinct progenitors. In some animals, all the lung metastases were derived from a common progenitor clone, whereas in others, each metastatic nodule had a different progenitor. The results show the following. (i) Retrovirus vector infection can be used to introduce large numbers of unique and stable clonal markers into tumor cell populations. (ii) The progeny of a very limited number of clones dominate in advanced primary tumors. (iii) Mammary carcinoma metastases are of mono- or biclonal origin. The significance of the results is discussed.","['Korczak, B', 'Robson, I B', 'Lamarche, C', 'Bernstein, A', 'Kerbel, R S']","['Korczak B', 'Robson IB', 'Lamarche C', 'Bernstein A', 'Kerbel RS']","['Division of Cancer and Cell Biology, Mount Sinai Hospital Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Metastasis']",,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.8.3143-3149.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Aug;8(8):3143-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.8.3143-3149.1988.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",['CA 41233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC363542,,,,

Single-base mutational analysis of this 132-base-pair promoter fragment identified three sequence elements required for transcription in MEL cells. These are the ATATAA sequence at -31 to -26, the CCAATC sequence between -77 and -72, and the GCCACACCC sequence between -95 and -87. In addition, we found a requirement for sequences adjacent to the CCAAT and ATATAA consensus motifs.

RNAs from induced and uninduced cells were analyzed for epsilon-, gamma-, delta-, and beta-, zeta-globin-specific transcripts. While high-level gamma-globin expression was common, the lines differed in their expression of embryonic (epsilon, zeta) and adult (delta, beta) globin mRNAs. The patterns of globin gene methylation were generally consistent with their observed expression profiles, with many of the same correlations being seen in normal cells. Although the programs of globin gene expression and methylation displayed by the lines appeared to be diverse, they were not random; rather, they made developmental sense, mimicking defined globin gene programs observed during normal human development. The characteristics exhibited by several of these lines suggest that they may have been derived from the transformation of multi- or oligopotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. We speculate that the expression of fetal or embryonic globins in these adult erythroleukemic cell lines is not an aberration of neoplastic transformation but is indicative of a fetal or embryonic potential in normal adult hematopoietic progenitors.","['Enver, T', 'Zhang, J W', 'Anagnou, N P', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, G', 'Papayannopoulou, T']","['Enver T', 'Zhang JW', 'Anagnou NP', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G', 'Papayannopoulou T']","['Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.11.4917-4926.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Nov;8(11):4917-26. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.11.4917-4926.1988.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,PMC365585,,,,

Selected sera were also tested by particle agglutination and immunoblotting. Six of the populations had prevalences of antibodies greater than 4%, two populations had prevalences greater than 15%. Six populations had antibody prevalences of 2% or less. Three populations from the coast and northern islands of New Guinea had high prevalences of antibodies, while three New Guinea highland groups had virtually none. One population from the Solomon Islands had a high prevalence, while two others had very low prevalences. Two populations from small remote islands in Vanuatu both had high prevalences. Pacific sera did not neutralize a standard strain of virus readily neutralized by Japanese, European, and American sera. We conclude that infections with HTLV-I, some acquired more than 20 years ago, are widespread throughout the southwestern Pacific, even in several very isolated populations, although others have been spared.

Comparison of LDH isoenzyme pattern in peripheral blood cells with that of serum, both in normal and in leukaemia cases showed more ""M"" type enzyme in the cells than in the serum. However, the ""M"" type enzyme was significantly elevated only in AML cases (p less than 0.005). Serum LDH and peripheral blood leukocyte count compared in normal subjects and in leukaemia cases showed no correlation.","['Ghosh, K', 'Malik, K', 'Das, K C']","['Ghosh K', 'Malik K', 'Das KC']","['Department of Haematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Pgimer, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*blood', 'Leukemia/blood/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1988;21(4):227-32.,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],,,,,,,,

Hairy cell leukaemia in mother and daughter.,205-18,"Two familial cases of hairy cell leukaemia are reported: a daughter, 44-years-old, with a very unusual ultrastructural pattern found in hairy cells, the ""tubuloreticular inclusions"", and her mother, 71-years-old, who was affected six years later. Routine laboratory investigations, cytochemical and cytogenetic studies including HLA typing, as well as in vitro proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to polyclonal mitogens and to exogenous interleukin 2, were performed. The immunological characterization by assessing the cell surface phenotypic markers with monoclonal antibodies and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were also carried out. In case 2 all tests were performed both on PBMC and on the bone marrow cells. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first reports of such familial association. The possibility that genetic factors might play a role in the etiology of leukaemia in man is discussed: in our two cases, however, cytogenetic studies did not support this, while HLA typing revealed a non-significant association of HCL with DQw3 allele. Alternatively, an environmental factor has been considered, and a viral infection-perhaps by a retrovirus of the HTLV family has been suggested as tubuloreticular inclusions have been found in both hairy cell leukaemia, as reported, by us, and AIDS-LAS. However, a long time elapsed between the manifestation of HCL in the daughter and in the mother, and as the two patients had not been living together at that time, the possibility of a viral transmission seems minimal. The results of TEM and of immunological investigations are presented and discussed. Both, but particularly the latter, support the B cell nature of the hairy cell.","['Mantovani, G', 'Piso, A', 'Santa Cruz, G', 'Arangino, V', 'Farci, G', 'Leone, A L', 'Orru, S', 'Coiana, A', 'Massidda, A', 'Zucca, G']","['Mantovani G', 'Piso A', 'Santa Cruz G', 'Arangino V', 'Farci G', 'Leone AL', 'Orru S', 'Coiana A', 'Massidda A', 'Zucca G', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phenotype']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1988;21(4):205-18.,,,,,,,,,

Five relapsed patients entered second CR and two were still in CR at this time. CNS relapse occurred in a total of eight patients (three without prophylaxis), and was isolated in two of six patients who achieved CR (despite CNS prophylaxis). In an analysis of prognostic factors, only the attainment of a CR was statistically significant (P less than 0.001).
