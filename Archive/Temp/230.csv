In this review we summarize the literature relating specifically to malignancies developing in the wake of treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In these patients, the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute non lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) is reported to be increased 10-105 fold over that of the general population. Factors in the development of MDS and ANLL include basic defects in cellular immunity in NHL patients as well as treatment with alkylating agents and low dose total body irradiation. Biologically these secondary MDS and ANLLs are characterized by specific cytogenetic abnormalities and results of treatment are poor. Currently bone marrow transplantation offers the only potential cure. There is no clear statistical evidence that solid tumors occur more frequently after NHL. However, bladder carcinoma, in cyclophosphamide treated patients, and lung cancer have been reported by some to occur with an increased incidence. Further investigation of the molecular events leading to the occurrence of second malignancies in NHL patients and the role played by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in this process is still needed.","['Ellis, M', 'Lishner, M']","['Ellis M', 'Lishner M']","['Department of Medicine, Meir Hospital, Kfar Saba, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Preleukemia/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148531 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Mar;9(4-5):337-42. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148531.,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part of the tumor cells, however, can escape from therapy due to resistance. Tumor-specific delivery of toxins that do not interfere with conventional drugs and are not cell cycle dependent seems to be a reasonable approach to overcome this problem. Natural ribosome-inhibiting-proteins (RIPs) from plants, bacteria and fungi which are extremely toxic inhibitors of protein synthesis are isolated and coupled to monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and receptor-specific ligands, immunotoxins (ITs), to fulfil this purpose. ITs are very suitable to eliminate malignant cells in vitro and in vivo. RIPs contain two or three active sites: a binding site which can be absent in a part of the RIPs and can be replaced by the MoAb; a translocation site that facilitates transport into the cytosol after internalization, and a cytotoxic site that enzymatically inhibits protein synthesis. Binding site containing toxins induce strong nonspecific cytotoxicity when coupled to MoAbs. Recent developments in recombinant DNA techniques enable genetic elimination of the binding site to reduce nonspecific cytotoxicity of these toxins. In this review the structures and mechanisms of action of RIPs as well as factors that influence cytotoxicity of immunotoxins are discussed. Moreover the problems dealing with in vivo application of ITs such as blood clearance by instability of the IT and hepatic entrapment, and production of antibodies directed against MoAb and toxin are reviewed.","['Preijers, F W']",['Preijers FW'],"['Department of Hematology, University Hospital St. Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/surgery', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemistry/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Ribosomes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148526 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Mar;9(4-5):293-304. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148526.,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modulation by interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha.,57-63,"A specific radioimmunoassay was employed to demonstrate that human articular cartilage and chondrocyte monolayers in organ and cell culture, respectively, produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in response to stimulation with interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and TNF beta. Optimum doses were 10-100 U/ml for IL-1 (0.06-0.6 nM IL-1 alpha; 0.02-0.2 nM IL-1 beta) and 1-10 nM for TNF alpha. Low levels of M-CSF were observed in the supernatants of nonstimulated cultures while increased levels of M-CSF in response to IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha were detected following 2 h exposure to the cytokines. IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha did not show synergy for the production of M-CSF when both cytokines were added to cultures. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide inhibited both the basal and IL-1 alpha-induced production of M-CSF, suggesting a requirement for de novo RNA and protein synthesis. Cytokine-induced M-CSF production was also inhibited by the antiinflammatory corticosteroid, dexamethasone, but not by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. The cytokines IL-4, IL-6, platelet-derived growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-beta and interferons -alpha and -gamma, each had little or no effect on M-CSF levels, while basic fibroblast growth factor, lipopolysaccharide, and retinoic acid were each weak stimuli. We propose that chondrocyte M-CSF production in response to IL-1 and TNF alpha, and the concurrent destruction of cartilage by these cytokines, could provide a mechanism for the chronic nature of rheumatoid disease.","['Campbell, I K', 'Ianches, G', 'Hamilton, J A']","['Campbell IK', 'Ianches G', 'Hamilton JA']","['University of Melbourne, Department of Medicine, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Cartilage, Articular/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/08/04 00:00,1993/08/04 00:01,['1993/08/04 00:00'],"['1993/08/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/04 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0925-4439(93)90153-R [pii]', '10.1016/0925-4439(93)90153-r [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Aug 4;1182(1):57-63. doi: 10.1016/0925-4439(93)90153-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human ER cDNA was introduced by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into the Rat1 cell line, which does not express functional ER endogenously. Rat1+ER cells express functional ER based on radioreceptor assays, immunoblotting, and transient transfection experiments using E2-responsive reporter plasmids. The effects of this ectopic ER expression were studied on three endogenous E2-responsive genes, prolactin (PRL), progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). PRL, usually expressed in the lactotrophs of the pituitary, is not expressed at all in Rat1+ER cells, with or without E2 addition, and appears to require other factors for expression. In contrast, although PR is not expressed in Rat1 cells, it is induced in Rat1+ER cells upon the addition of E2. This induction appears to occur at the transcriptional level and is insensitive to cycloheximide treatment. This is one of the few examples where the expression of one gene activates an otherwise silent gene. Another contrasting observation is that, although EGFR is basally expressed in Rat1+ER cells, the addition of E2 has no effect. Our studies paint a complicated picture of E2 regulation of endogenous genes: the activation of the PR gene may only require the presence of E2 and ER, whereas EGFR and PRL genes require factors in addition to ER for basal as well as E2-regulated expression.","['Kaneko, K J', 'Gelinas, C', 'Gorski, J']","['Kaneko KJ', 'Gelinas C', 'Gorski J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pou1f1 protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '17197F0KYM (afimoxifene)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Prolactin/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*genetics', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*genetics', 'Tamoxifen/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transfection']",1993/08/17 00:00,1993/08/17 00:01,['1993/08/17 00:00'],"['1993/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00083a039 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Aug 17;32(32):8348-59. doi: 10.1021/bi00083a039.,,['HD08192/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is identical to a macrophage surface antigen, Mac-2, and lectins designated as CBP35, L-34, and RL-29, for which various functions have been suggested. Studies from other groups as well as ours have indicated that epsilon BP is secreted by cells such as macrophages and is present in extracellular fluids. We demonstrated previously that binding sites for epsilon BP are present on the surface of RBL cells. In this report, we show that epsilon BP binds to a small number of glycoprotein species on the surface of RBL cells. Significantly, one of these glycoproteins is the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI). Preliminary studies showed that epsilon BP causes mediator release from RBL cells, possibly through cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI. The results suggest a function of epsilon BP as an activator of mast cells.","['Frigeri, L G', 'Zuberi, R I', 'Liu, F T']","['Frigeri LG', 'Zuberi RI', 'Liu FT']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Galectin 3', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/03 00:00,1993/08/03 00:01,['1993/08/03 00:00'],"['1993/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00081a007 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Aug 3;32(30):7644-9. doi: 10.1021/bi00081a007.,,"['A119747/PHS HHS/United States', 'A120958/PHS HHS/United States', 'A132834/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nineteen patients with advanced solid tumours were entered into a phase I study to evaluate the toxicity and biological effects of bryostatin 1. Bryostatin 1 was given as a one hour intravenous infusion at the beginning of each 2 week treatment cycle. A maximum of three treatment cycles were given. Doses were escalated in steps from 5 to 65 micrograms m-2 in successive patient groups. The maximum tolerated dose was 50 micrograms m-2. Myalgia was the dose limiting toxicity and was of WHO grade 3 in all three patients treated at 65 micrograms m-2. Flu-like symptoms were common but were of maximum WHO grade 2. Hypotension, of maximum WHO grade 1, occurred in six patients treated at doses up to and including 20 micrograms m-2 and may not have been attributable to treatment with bryostatin 1. Cellulitis and thrombophlebitis occurred at the bryostatin 1 infusion site of patients treated at all dose levels up to 50 micrograms m-2, attributable to the 60% ethanol diluent in the bryostatin 1 infusion. Subsequent patients treated at 50 and 65 micrograms m-2 received treatment with an intravenous normal saline flush and they did not develop these complications. Significant decreases of the platelet count and total leucocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were seen in the first 24 h after treatment at the dose of 65 micrograms m-2. Immediate decreases in haemoglobin of up to 1.9g dl-1 were also noted in patients treated with 65 micrograms m-2, in the absence of clinical evidence of bleeding or haemodynamic compromise. No effect was observed on the incidence of haemopoietic progenitor cells in the marrow. Some patients' neutrophils demonstrated enhanced superoxide radical formation in response to in vitro stimulation with opsonised zymosan (a bacterial polysaccharide) but in the absence of this additional stimulus, no bryostatin 1 effect was observed. Lymphocyte natural killing activity was decreased 2 h after treatment with bryostatin 1, but the effect was not consistently seen 24 h or 7 days later. With the dose schedule examined no antitumour effects were observed.

A few environmental causes have been identified which may damage the foetus and lead to malformation and cancer. However, most of the numerous recognised cancer/malformation syndromes are genetically determined. This report describes a case-control study of 555 newly diagnosed children with cancer and 1,110 matched controls, chosen from general practitioner lists (GP controls) and hospital admissions (H controls). Their parents were interviewed on topics of possible aetiological significance and medical records were checked to confirm reports at interview. The numbers of congenital malformations in the index and GP control children, and the relatives of the index children, the GP and H controls are described. There were more children with malformations among the cases (60/555) than among the GP controls (27/555), P < 0.001. The abnormalities in the cases included eight with specific chromosomal/genetic conditions (e.g. Down's syndrome, XY gonadal dysgenesis, Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis, Goldenhar's syndrome) whereas only one GP control child had a chromosomal defect (P < 0.05). Five case children but no GP controls had neural tube defects; this is not statistically significant. No excess of malformations was found in the siblings of cases compared with GP and H control siblings. Case mothers had a small excess of malformations (22/555) compared with GP controls (8/555), P < 0.05. Among more distant relatives the results were difficult to interpret because of the relatively small numbers in the diagnostic subgroups and because of apparent under reporting in grandparents, but no striking differences were seen between case and control relatives. The excess of malformations found in children with cancer, compared with controls, without a similar excess of malformations in their close relatives may indicate that in some (perhaps very roughly one in 20) cases antenatal events may lead both to the malformation and the malignancy.","['Mann, J R', 'Dodd, H E', 'Draper, G J', 'Waterhouse, J A', 'Birch, J M', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Hartley, A L', 'McKinney, P A', 'Stiller, C A']","['Mann JR', 'Dodd HE', 'Draper GJ', 'Waterhouse JA', 'Birch JM', 'Cartwright RA', 'Hartley AL', 'McKinney PA', 'Stiller CA']","[""Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Congenital Abnormalities/epidemiology/*genetics', '*Family', 'Female', 'Goldenhar Syndrome/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Nuclear Family', 'Pedigree', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Teratoma/genetics']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.340 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 Aug;68(2):357-63. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.340.,,,,PMC1968541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five cases of benign reactive lymphocytic serous effusions and 11 cases of effusions in well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas were analyzed retrospectively. Each lymphoid cell was characterized by 24 densitometric features. Rank-order transformation was used for linear discriminant analysis given non-normal distributions of variables. In a first model formed by pooling all cells, discriminant function distinguished between 110 reactive and 216 malignant lymphocytes in the learning set and between 111 reactive and 226 malignant lymphocytes in the test set with better than 81% accuracy in both. In a second model, correct classification of cases as reactive or malignant was achieved in 5/5 reactive and 11/11 malignant lymphoid effusions.

Granulocytopenia is the single most important risk factor, but the pattern of infecting organisms can change according to nursing facilities or bacterial and fungal prophylaxis. METHODS: We reviewed the patterns and types of infections in 30 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. Eighty-nine periods of neutropenia following chemotherapy were evaluated: in 60 courses patients had central and in 29 had peripheral venous access. RESULTS: Almost all patients (97%) became febrile after the 1st course of therapy, but one-third remained apyretic after the fourth course (P = 0.002). In this series, the incidence of gram-positive, gram-negative and mycotic isolations were respectively 76%, 18% and 6%. The need for antimicrobic treatment varied in relation to the course of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia the first neutropenic period following the onset of disease is the most critical regarding infectious problems. Both quinolonic prophylaxis and central venous access could be responsible for the microbiologic findings.","['Fasola, G', 'Savignano, C', 'Revignas, M G', 'Virgolini, L', 'Baccarani, M']","['Fasola G', 'Savignano C', 'Revignas MG', 'Virgolini L', 'Baccarani M']","['Chair of Hematology, University of Udine School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', '*Catheterization, Central Venous', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications']",1993/04/30 00:00,1993/04/30 00:01,['1993/04/30 00:00'],"['1993/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1993 Apr 30;79(2):112-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the leukemogenic risk due to these treatment modalities. METHODS: We performed a case-control study on a population of 1410 patients treated for Hodgkin's disease from 1970 to 1990 in our Institute. Among these patients, we identified 25 cases of secondary leukemia and 3 cases of myelodysplasia, all occurring more than one year after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. Three cases occurred among the patients treated with radiotherapy alone. When we analyzed the risk in relation to the type of treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both), the comparisons were relative to patients treated with radiotherapy alone. RESULTS: We found that chemotherapy alone is associated with a fivefold increased risk (odds ratio = 5.4) compared with radiotherapy alone. When both treatments are used, the risk is not further increased (odds ratio = 4.4). Patients receiving more than 6 courses of chemotherapy have an excess risk (relative risk = 2.5) compared with those treated with 6 courses or less. No increased risk was observed after splenectomy. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms an increased incidence of secondary leukemia occurring in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease. The increased risk seems to be correlated with the number of courses of alkylating agent therapy, whereas it is unaffected by the addition of radiotherapy.","['Salvagno, L', 'Simonato, L', 'Soraru, M', 'Bianco, A', 'Chiarion-Sileni, V', 'Aversa, S M', 'Camporese, R', 'Garofolin, P', 'Fiorentino, M']","['Salvagno L', 'Simonato L', 'Soraru M', 'Bianco A', 'Chiarion-Sileni V', 'Aversa SM', 'Camporese R', 'Garofolin P', 'Fiorentino M']","['Divisione di Oncologia Medica, Centro Oncologico Regionale, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Splenectomy', 'Time Factors']",1993/04/30 00:00,1993/04/30 00:01,['1993/04/30 00:00'],"['1993/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1993 Apr 30;79(2):103-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the aspiration of bone marrow is not possible in spite of correct technique (punctiosicca), myelofibrosis must be suspected. The diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.

We have studied complement-mediated enhancement of infection of the human CD4-positive T-cell line HPB-ALL which expresses the CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) receptors for C3. CR1 and CR2 are present on 15% and 40% of normal peripheral blood CD4-positive T lymphocytes respectively. Opsonization of the virus with complement resulted in a 3- to 10-fold enhancement of infection of HPB-ALL cells, as assessed by measuring the release of p24 antigen in culture supernatants throughout the culture period. Blockade of CR2 with cross-linked anti-CR2 monoclonal antibodies decreased infection to the level observed with unopsonized virus. Blocking CR1 reduced complement-mediated infection by 50-80%. Experiments using serum deficient in complement factor I demonstrated that CR1 mediates the interaction between opsonized virus and T cells in addition to its ability to serve as a cofactor for the cleavage of C3b into smaller fragments that interact with CR2. A requirement for CD4 in complement-mediated enhancement of infection was observed with HIV-1 Bru but not with HIV-1 RF. Thus, CR1 and CR2 contribute in an independent and complementary fashion to penetration of opsonized virus into complement receptor-expressing T cells.

Tax does not bind DNA directly but appears to trans-activate through an interaction with host-cell transcription factors that recognize sequences within the promoters of Tax-responsive genes. Cellular transcriptional activators implicated in mediating Tax trans-activation include members of the activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding protein (ATF/CREB) family of proteins, serum response factor, Fos-Jun, and NF-kappa B. Recent evidence suggests that Tax may stimulate human T-cell leukemia virus type I transcription, at least in part, through enhanced binding of ATF/CREB proteins to their recognition elements within the Tax-responsive 21-bp repeats of the viral promoter. In this report, we demonstrate that Tax also enhances the site-specific DNA binding activity of serum response factor and Fos-Jun and modestly enhances the binding of the NF-kappa B subunits, p50 and p65. We also show that Tax increases the DNA binding activity of the eukaryotic transcription factors ATF-1, Sp1, and GAL4. These results are consistent with the finding that Tax is highly pleiotropic and suggest that Tax trans-activation may involve enhancement in the DNA binding activity of target transcriptional regulatory proteins. In addition, we show that the mechanism of Tax-enhanced DNA binding activity does not involve an alteration in the redox state of the target protein.","['Armstrong, A P', 'Franklin, A A', 'Uittenbogaard, M N', 'Giebler, H A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Armstrong AP', 'Franklin AA', 'Uittenbogaard MN', 'Giebler HA', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.15.7303 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Aug 1;90(15):7303-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.15.7303.,,['1 R55 CA55035-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC47125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were obtained from approximately 9000 rats (4000 males and 5000 females) used to study the carcinogenicity of a variety of alkylating compounds, including N-nitroso compounds, azoxyalkanes, and triazenes. In these experiments treated rats and controls were allowed to die naturally and were necropsied, and the tissues were examined histopathologically. The spontaneous neoplasms of interest were mononuclear cell leukemia and neoplasms of the anterior pituitary, adrenal medulla, pancreas, thyroid gland, mammary gland, and testis. These tumors were generally absent from control animals that (rarely) died before 70 wk of age. Although many carcinogen-treated rats died early with treatment-related tumors, a substantial number (1700 males and 2300 females) survived as long as controls. The incidence of spontaneous neoplasms was determined among controls and chemically treated rats at 10-wk intervals from 0 to 140 wk. The incidence of spontaneous tumors was not higher and was frequently statistically lower among treated rats than the corresponding incidence in controls, with the exception of leukemia in female rats. The same result was obtained with the subset of carcinogens not requiring metabolic activation (mostly alkylnitrosoureas). These data indicate that in this rat tumor model system, the alkylating carcinogens, while capable collectively of tumor induction at more than 20 sites, did not accelerate the development of any of the six spontaneously arising solid tumors. This suggests that these spontaneous tumors might arise by a mechanism that is unresponsive to the actions of the alkylating carcinogens.","['Lijinsky, W', 'Riggs, C W', 'Walters, P T']","['Lijinsky W', 'Riggs CW', 'Walters PT']","['ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Toxicol Environ Health,Journal of toxicology and environmental health,7513622,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced/mortality/pathology', 'Nitroso Compounds/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15287399309531769 [doi]'],ppublish,J Toxicol Environ Health. 1993 Aug;39(4):527-38. doi: 10.1080/15287399309531769.,,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of an investigation of the regulation of gene expression by GM-CSF, we have previously identified a novel murine GM-CSF-inducible gene, A1. In this report, we present the complete nucleotide sequence of the A1 mRNA as well as a portion of the 5' flanking region, and describe the expression pattern of the gene. The results demonstrate that A1 is a hemopoietic tissue-specific gene that is expressed in several hemopoietic cell lineages, including T-helper lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. In murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, A1 gene expression is rapidly and transiently induced by GM-CSF, and the induction was independent of de novo protein synthesis. In addition to GM-CSF, a transient induction of A1 mRNA accumulation was observed in response to LPS in macrophages. This induction is not mediated by IL-1 alpha or IL-6, neither of which stimulate A1. In the myeloid precursor cell line, 32D cl3, A1 gene expression is stably induced during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-stimulated myeloid cell differentiation. The A1 message encodes a predicted polypeptide with an M(r) of 20,024 and no signal peptide. The peptide sequence contains a region of 80 amino acids that shows similarity to bcl-2 and to the recently described bcl-2-related gene, MCL1. These data demonstrate that A1 is a novel early-response gene whose expression is associated with a variety of stimuli and occurs in several hemopoietic cell types.","['Lin, E Y', 'Orlofsky, A', 'Berger, M S', 'Prystowsky, M B']","['Lin EY', 'Orlofsky A', 'Berger MS', 'Prystowsky MB']","['Biology graduate Group, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (MATA1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (Replication Protein C)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Genes', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Replication Protein C', '*Repressor Proteins', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Aug 15;151(4):1979-88.,,"['CA-48648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32HD07067/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['A1', 'BCK2', 'MCL1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 5' (or 6') carboxyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2-CDCF) diacetate as starting material, we synthesized its succinimidyl ester derivative. H2-CDCF-conjugated IgG prepared from the succinimidyl ester derivative was used to opsonize targets. In vitro studies have shown that H2-CDCF becomes fluorescent upon exposure to reactive oxygen metabolites, including hydrogen peroxide. Using video intensified epifluorescence microscopy, we observed that reactive oxygen metabolites are deposited on tumor cell membranes during neutrophil-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This deposition process is catalase sensitive. The role of reactive oxygen metabolites produced by neutrophils in triggering the oxidation of H2-CDCF is further supported by the observation that neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients did not affect target fluorescence. YAC tumor cells were also labeled with dihydrorhodamine 123 or dihydrotetramethylrosamine. The oxidized forms of these reagents were found within the cytoplasm of YAC cells. During ADCC normal neutrophils, but not neutrophils obtained from CGD patients, triggered the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 and dihydrotetramethylrosamine within tumor cells. Using two-color automated epifluorescence microscopy, we could not detect temporal intermediates with fluorescence in only one compartment, i.e., either solely on the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that reactive oxygen metabolites cross target membranes (< 12 sec. These studies show that reactive oxygen metabolites are deposited both onto and into tumor cells during ADCC, wherein both compartments could become vulnerable to oxidant-mediated damage.","['Cao, D', 'Boxer, L A', 'Petty, H R']","['Cao D', 'Boxer LA', 'Petty HR']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '105284-17-1 (dihydrotetramethylrosamine)', '109244-58-8 (dihydrorhodamine 123)', ""142975-81-3 (5'-carboxyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein)"", ""144316-86-9 (6'-carboxyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein)"", 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neutrophils/pathology/*physiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis/*metabolism', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041560227 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Aug;156(2):428-36. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041560227.,,"['AI/CA 27409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI20065/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL31963/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRL conditioned medium (CM) contains a differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA) that is synonymous with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). ES cells in monolayer culture can be induced to differentiate by addition of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) to the BRL CM, when they mainly form cells resembling parietal endoderm, or by culture in medium not conditioned by BRL cells. ES cells thus deprived of LIF/DIA differentiate spontaneously to a cell type that expresses Brachyury (T), a marker of early mesoderm. Northern blot analyses have shown previously that transcripts for transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are detected in undifferentiated cells while transcripts for TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 only become detectable after differentiation. We have now determined levels of TGF-beta protein in CM and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and have used neutralizing antibodies specific for TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 that do not react with recombinant human TGF-beta 3 to determine the isoform secreted. Using the growth inhibition of mink lung CCL64 cells as a bioassay for TGF-beta activity, we demonstrate that undifferentiated ES cells secrete latent TGF-beta 1 into the medium but no activity is found in their ECM. Cells induced to differentiate with RA contain TGF-beta 2 in both active and latent forms in their CM. Likewise their ECM contains TGF-beta 2 as the sole isoform. ES cells deprived of LIF/DIA secrete both TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 isoforms in their CM but TGF-beta-like activity remains after addition of neutralizing antibodies for TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2. This active TGF beta is the major component of the TGF-beta activity in this CM. By contrast, ECM from LIF/DIA deprived cells contains only the TGF-beta 1 and beta 2 isoforms. The remaining activity in CM correlates with high expression of TGF-beta 3 by Northern blot analysis in these cells. We speculate that TGF-beta 3 is secreted by these cells and may be activated more efficiently and/or in a different manner to TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2, since it is present in CM only in its active form.","['Slager, H G', 'Freund, E', 'Buiting, A M', 'Feijen, A', 'Mummery, C L']","['Slager HG', 'Freund E', 'Buiting AM', 'Feijen A', 'Mummery CL']","['Hubrecht Laboratory, Netherlands Institute of Developmental Biology, Utrecht.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EQ43SC3GDB (Brachyury protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/analysis/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Fetal Proteins/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Lung/cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mesoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', '*T-Box Domain Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041560205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Aug;156(2):247-56. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041560205.,,,,,['TGF-&bgr;'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using promyelocytic HL-60 cells, we have observed an exquisite sensitivity to Ca2+ of c-fos, c-jun, and zif268 mRNA accumulation, since early and maximal inductions were observed at 200-300 nM [Ca2+]i. At early times (10-20 min), the [Ca2+]i dose dependence of c-fos transcription and mRNA accumulation displayed a bell shape since c-fos expression was barely modified at high (700-1,250 nM) [Ca2+]i. The threshold [Ca2+]i concentration for prolonged (60 min) c-fos mRNA accumulation was greater than 200 nM. This indicates that the quantitative effects of Ca2+ on a given gene can vary markedly as a function of both the [Ca2+]i concentration and the duration of stimulation. Strikingly, a [Ca2+]i perturbation of only 1 min was sufficient for full induction of c-fos and zif268 transcripts. This demonstrates that a transient perturbation of [Ca2+]i has long term effects on gene expression. The half-life of c-fos mRNA (16 min) was unaltered by Ca2+. Nuclear run-on analysis of the distribution of RNA polymerase II along the c-fos locus indicated that Ca2+ promotes a small increase in transcriptional initiation and a pronounced relief of a block to transcriptional elongation beyond intron 1. The extreme sensitivity to [Ca2+]i, in terms of both the length of time and the dose of [Ca2+]i required for maximal gene induction, demonstrates that Ca2+ is a major physiological regulator of early response gene expression. In addition, the results indicate that a c-fos intragenic element is the main target of Ca(2+)-regulated transcriptional activation.","['Werlen, G', 'Belin, D', 'Conne, B', 'Roche, E', 'Lew, D P', 'Prentki, M']","['Werlen G', 'Belin D', 'Conne B', 'Roche E', 'Lew DP', 'Prentki M']","['Department of Medicine, University of Geneva Medical School, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/05 00:00,1993/08/05 00:01,['1993/08/05 00:00'],"['1993/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85461-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 5;268(22):16596-601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several obstacles to the use of this approach include the availability of histocompatible siblings and the increased toxicity even in HLA-matched patients owing to graft-versus-host disease and interstitial pneumonitis. The use of autologous marrow in support of high-dose therapy has lower toxicity; however, there is the issue that residual tumor cells may be reinfused into the patient. There are several laboratory studies demonstrating that residual tumor cells persist in the marrow despite histologic remission. In addition, case reports suggest that contaminated marrow has led to widespread early relapse owing to reinfusion of tumor cells. A variety of techniques have been developed that can deplete up to 5 logs of tumor cells from the marrow. These techniques include very specific immunologic as well as less specific pharmacologic purging. Both approaches have been refined so that normal hematopoietic stem cell reconstitution is relatively preserved. Although a large number of studies have been reported that have utilized ex vivo marrow purging, few have examined whether there has been an impact on disease-free survival. Although randomized studies have not been performed to date, several recent studies in ANLL and B-cell NHL strongly suggest that there is a relationship between the quality of elimination of the disease ex vivo in the marrow and disease-free survival. With further improvements in marrow treatment, whereby all detectable cells are depleted, as determined by highly sensitive molecular biologic techniques, and randomized trials involving purged and unpurged BM, the question of the impact of ex vivo marrow treatment can be better answered.","['Freedman, A S', 'Nadler, L M']","['Freedman AS', 'Nadler LM']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1993 Jun;7(3):687-715.,211,"['CA40216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the transition to the acute terminal phase or blastic crisis is often associated with additional cytogenetic abnormalities, the molecular events which correlate the initial cytogenetic lesion with the terminal phase are poorly understood. Defective cellular DNA repair capacity is often associated with chromosomal instability, increased mutation frequency, and biologic alterations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We, therefore, tested whether the protein product of the bcr/abl translocation (p210) could alter DNA repair after gamma-irradiation of murine cell lines expressing the bcr/abl cDNA. RESULTS: The 32D cl 3 parent, 32D cl 3 pYN (containing the control vector plasmid) and each of two sources of 32D cl 3 cells expressing p210 bcr/abl cDNA (32D-PC1 cell line and 32D-LG7 subclone) showed a D0 of 1.62, 1.57, 1.16, and 1.27 Gy, respectively. Thus, expression of the p210 bcr/abl product induced a significant (p < 0.05) increase in radiosensitivity at the clinically relevant radiation therapy dose-rate (1.16 Gy/min). The increased radiosensitivity of p210 bcr/abl expressing cells persisted if cells were held before plating in a density-inhibited state for 8 hr after gamma-irradiation, indicating little effect on the repair of potentially lethal gamma-irradiation damage. The IL-3 dependent parent 32D cl 3 cells demonstrated programmed cell death in the absence of growth factor or following gamma-irradiation to 200 cGy. Expression of bcr/abl cDNA in the 32D-PC1 and 32D-LG7 sub clones abrogated IL-3 requirement of these cell lines and inhibited gamma-irradiation induced programmed cell death. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a role for bcr/abl p210 in amplifying gamma-irradiation DNA damage or broadly inhibiting DNA repair, conditions that may stimulate further cytogenetic alterations in hematopoietic cells.","['Santucci, M A', 'Anklesaria, P', 'Laneuville, P', 'Das, I J', 'Sakakeeny, M A', 'FitzGerald, T J', 'Greenberger, J S']","['Santucci MA', 'Anklesaria P', 'Laneuville P', 'Das IJ', 'Sakakeeny MA', 'FitzGerald TJ', 'Greenberger JS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', '*DNA Repair', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Radiation Genetics', '*Radiation Tolerance', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(93)90498-K [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(93)90498-k [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Aug 1;26(5):831-6. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(93)90498-k.,,"['CA39851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE08798/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,['BCR/ABL'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of children diagnosed with cancer today, 80% are predicted to be long-term survivors. Although there are differences between children and adults with respect to the tumor types, biology, and outcome, there are common lessons which we can learn from our children regarding the genetics of cancer, its management and treatment, and the importance of longitudinal studies of the survivors. Specific pediatric cancers, such as retinoblastoma, have led to the recognition of tumor suppressor genes, now also observed among adult tumors including sarcomas, breast, lung, and bladder cancer. The presence of the tumor suppressor gene provides an understanding for the incidence of second malignant tumors among patients with heritable diseases. Furthermore, cancer prone families, such as those with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, also carry the p 53 tumor suppressor gene; the presence of which greatly increases the risk of developing invasive cancer. Childhood cancer is rare; it represents only 1% of the total US cancer problem. However, 53% of all children with cancer, but only 2% of all adults, are studied via the NCI cooperative group mechanism. For some specific childhood tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms' tumor, as many as 70-85% of all cases are managed via NCI sponsored trials. Essentially all pediatric cancer is treated by interdigitating radiation with surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy. This approach has contributed to high cure rates. Finally, our understanding of the late effects of being a cancer survivor have come from longitudinal studies of children. The most severe long-term effects related to radiation in childhood pertain to growth and development, infertility, and second malignant tumor induction. Here the children treated for Hodgkin's disease have taught us the dose and volume effects on axial skeletal and soft tissue growth. Infertility issues are also treatment-related and may often be obviated by using gonadal shielding. The risk of secondary leukemia is related to dose and class of specific chemotherapeutic agents administered; it is 5.5% among children receiving 6 cycles of MOPP. There is a 22-fold risk at 30 years of age of solid tumor induction following radiotherapy for children with Hodgkin's disease.

TR treatment of cells perturbed nucleic acid and catecholamine pathways. As biochemical markers of TR action decreased cellular GTP pools, increased inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations and depleted dopamine content were found. Incubation of tumour specimens obtained from paediatric patients with grade-IV neuroblastoma with TR resulted in the formation of the active metabolite, thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide, in concentrations sufficient to inhibit tumour growth. Cytotoxic and biochemical effects of TR were enhanced by combining it with allopurinol (an inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase), and hypoxanthine (an alternate substrate for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase). Induction of transdifferentiation of SK-N-SH cells from a neuroblast to an epitheloid, substrate-adherent phenotype was more pronounced with TR than with all-trans-retinoic acid. Transdifferentiating treatment with TR resulted in a 2-fold-enhanced sensitivity towards adriamycin. However, differentiation with all-trans-retinoic acid rendered the cells more resistant to adriamycin. Our results suggest that TR might be a promising agent for the treatment of children suffering from neuroblastoma.","['Pillwein, K', 'Schuchter, K', 'Ressmann, G', 'Gharehbaghi, K', 'Knoflach, A', 'Cermak, B', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Szalay, S M', 'Szekeres, T', 'Chiba, P']","['Pillwein K', 'Schuchter K', 'Ressmann G', 'Gharehbaghi K', 'Knoflach A', 'Cermak B', 'Jayaram HN', 'Szalay SM', 'Szekeres T', 'Chiba P']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Pteridines)', '0 (Purines)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.14.18.1 (Monophenol Monooxygenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Catecholamines/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Monophenol Monooxygenase/drug effects', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Pteridines/metabolism', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/19 00:00,1993/08/19 00:01,['1993/08/19 00:00'],"['1993/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910550117 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Aug 19;55(1):92-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910550117.,,['CA-51770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that Registry, codes for tumours were based solely on topography until the end of 1977. In order to obtain a uniform data set, coded by the system of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) now used at the Cancer Registry, all cases of teenage cancer diagnosed prior to 1978 were re-evaluated, and an ICD-O code was applied. Tumours were further aggregated into diagnostic groups using an internationally agreed scheme. The average incidence rates for all histological types combined were 136 per million for boys and 108 per million for girls, which are close to those reported in Connecticut, USA. Central nervous system tumours, leukaemia and malignant lymphomas accounted for 60% of all cancers among teenagers. An overall excess of cancers among boys was mainly due to more frequent occurrence of leukaemias, malignant lymphomas, sarcomas and germ-cell tumours. Increasing trends with time were seen for malignant lymphomas in both boys and girls and for subtypes of non-seminoma germ-cell tumour among boys aged 15-19. For other diagnostic groups, including the main group of leukaemias, the rates have remained largely unchanged, suggesting that environmental factors associated with modern society play a minor role in the aetiology of cancer among teenagers.","['Martos, M C', 'Winther, J F', 'Olsen, J H']","['Martos MC', 'Winther JF', 'Olsen JH']","['Danish Cancer Society, Division for Cancer Epidemiology, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1993/08/19 00:00,1993/08/19 00:01,['1993/08/19 00:00'],"['1993/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910550111 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Aug 19;55(1):57-62. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910550111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the different forms of activin appear to be differentially expressed during early amphibian, avian, and murine development, little is known about the factors that regulate their expression. In this study we report the qualitative effects of several growth and differentiation factors on the expression of inhibin subunits in three differentiated cell lines derived from P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. These cell lines include mesodermal (MES-1), neuroepithelial (EPI-7), and visceral endoderm-like (END-2) cell types, expressing both inhibin beta A and beta B subunit mRNAs. We have shown for the first time that this expression is modulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)beta 1 and TGF beta 2 but not significantly by other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor or members of the fibroblast growth factor family (aFGF, bFGF, or kFGF). beta A mRNA expression is increased while beta B expression is simultaneously decreased by TGF beta. Furthermore, TGF beta increased the amount of bioactive activin secreted by MES-1 and END-2 cells. Inhibin alpha subunit mRNA expression is not affected by TGF beta.

Most of this data comes from studies using lines or clones of stromal cells after multiple passage in culture, which could alter gene expression. Our aim in the present study was to determine which cytokines are produced by normal stromal cells under conditions that promote B lymphopoiesis. Primary cultured stromal cells were isolated on FACS from active Whitlock cultures. These cells proved to be relatively homogeneous in expression of cell surface antigens (CD44, VCAM-1, MECA10, and a molecule marked by hamster anti-mouse 8.28 monoclonal antibody). RNA from unselected Whitlock cultured adherent cells and sorted stromal cells from the same cultures were subjected to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to assess constitutive expression of several cytokine genes. Transcripts for interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-7, macrophage (M)-colony-stimulating factor (CSF), stem cell growth factor (SCGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and occasionally leukemia inhibitory factor were detected in RNA from intact cultures. Messages for IL-7, M-CSF, and SCGF were selectively contained within the isolated stromal cell fraction; whereas, IL-1 beta was found solely within the non-stromal cell fraction. IGF-1 was transcribed by both stromal cells and macrophages in Whitlock cultures. No evidence was found for constitutive expression of IL-1 alpha, IL-4, IL-6, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. This is in contrast to some reported stromal cell lines and clones. To determine if all primary stromal cells from active lymphopoietic cultures produced IL-7, the isolated cells were stained to reveal cytoplasmic IL-7 protein. A majority of the cells produced IL-7, but about 20% had no detectable IL-7 protein. Taken together, our results suggest that the primary stromal cells are a distinguishable cell type but functional subsets may exist. In regard to the differences in IL-7 production, the primary cell phenotype appears to mirror at least one division noted among the stromal cell lines.","['Witte, P L', 'Frantsve, L M', 'Hergott, M', 'Rahbe, S M']","['Witte PL', 'Frantsve LM', 'Hergott M', 'Rahbe SM']","['Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Interleukin-7/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Stromal Cells/physiology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830230812 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1993 Aug;23(8):1809-17. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830230812.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On this basis the six cases in those born in Seascale compare with 0.38 expected (15.8; p < 0.001), of which two were associated with paternal preconceptional life-time levels of 100 mSv or greater and three others with levels of 90-99 mSv. Among those born elsewhere, there were five cases (expected 0.74; ratio 6.7, p < 0.01), of which only one was associated with a high level of such radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Paternal preconceptional radiation cannot be the sole cause of the excess in Seascale since it will not explain the excess among those born outside Seascale. It follows that, unless two causes are to be postulated, any single cause must be a factor other than paternal preconceptional radiation. On this basis, the association found among those born there, if not partly due to chance, may reflect an indirect relation with the true cause. The recent hypothesis about such paternal radiation has originated in a subgroup of the excess cases that have aroused concern.","['Kinlen, L J']",['Kinlen LJ'],"['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Fathers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Radioactive Pollutants', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1993/06/26 00:00,1993/06/26 00:01,['1993/06/26 00:00'],"['1993/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.306.6894.1718 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1993 Jun 26;306(6894):1718-21. doi: 10.1136/bmj.306.6894.1718.,,,,PMC1678289,,"['BMJ. 1993 Aug 14;307(6901):444-5.

Abnormal karyotypes were found in bone marrow cells of 33 patients (30%). Most pathological karyotypes were complex with numerous modal and structural anomalies. Numerical anomalies most frequently involved chromosome 11 and structural aberrations occurred most often in chromosomes 1, 11 and 14. The most consistent structural aberration was a 14q+ chromosome (10 patients) resulting from a t(11;14)(q13;q32) in 4 patients and a t(8;14)(q24;q32) in 1 patient. Sequential cytogenetic studies were performed in 15 patients. In 5 of 8 cases with a normal karyotype at diagnosis, chromosomal anomalies were detected when disease progressed. In concomitant cytogenetic/cytological studies it was found that in the majority of patients with normal karyotype the mitoses originated from contaminating normal bone marrow cells. Pathological karyotypes were detected more frequently in pretreated than in untreated patients, in patients with plasma cell leukaemia than in patients with multiple myeloma, in patients with stage III and dense bone marrow infiltration than in patients with stage I. Patients with abnormal karyotype, irrespective if pretreated or not, had a significantly shorter median survival than those with normal karyotype.

Concomitant with diminished GPX and PHGPX activity was a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in catalase (CAT) activity, which reverted to control levels when L.Se(-) cells were given sufficient Se for full expression of selenoperoxidase activity. Selenium manipulation affected total glutathione content similarly, but had no effect on glutathione-S-transferase or superoxide dismutase activity. Long-term growth under Se-deficient conditions resulted in a progressive additional increase in CAT activity, which maximized after ca. 5 months. These cells [referred to as L'.Se(-)] attained CAT activity levels at least 100-times greater than those of Se-supplemented [L'.Se(+)] controls, whereas their glutathione content remained elevated by approximately 70%. Supplying L'.Se(-) cells with Se resulted in a rapid elevation to full GPX activity; however, CAT failed to decline in this case, suggesting that a selection for stable CAT hyperexpressing variants had been accomplished. Quantitative immunoblot analysis indicated that the high CAT activity of L'.Se(-) cells is accounted for by an elevated level of enzyme protein. Induction of CAT and selection for CAT-rich phenotypes, as apparent for Se-starved L1210 cells, was not observed in human K562 counterparts, which lack GPX and express only a low level of PHGPX. L.Se(-) cells were found to be more sensitive to H2O2-induced killing than L.Se(+) controls, whereas L'.Se(-) cells were exceedingly more resistant to H2O2 than L'.Se(+) counterparts. By contrast, L.Se(-) and L'.Se(-) cells were both more sensitive to t-butyl hydroperoxide than Se(+) controls, consistent with CAT being unimportant in the detoxification of this peroxide compared with GPX.

These ALT-cells combined with cimetidine (CIM) as autolymphocyte therapy (ALT), have previously been demonstrated to be a safe and active form of outpatient adoptive immunotherapy (AIT) in human TBH with metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC). We have previously described an effective ACIT protocol using ALT and cyclophosphamide (CY) for patients with relapsed and refractory non-RCC solid tumors. We now report a case of a patient with a metastatic gastric leiomyosarcoma to the liver, who developed a clinical picture consistent with a tumor-lysis syndrome (TLS), following salvage therapy for his tumor with ACIT using ALT and CY. TLS is a well-known complication resulting from the treatment of rapidly proliferating hematopoietic tumors such as Burkitt's lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia. TLS has also been rarely described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as certain solid tumors such as breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, and medulloblastoma. However, there have been no previous reports of TLS occurring either secondary to immunotherapy or in sarcomas.

Continuous infusions of cytarabine in doses of 15-30 mg/m2/day were therefore administered for extended periods to patients with CML in stable phase to determine if this treatment could achieve selective cytoreduction of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cells. Five patients demonstrating > 90% Ph-positive metaphases before treatment received a total of 43 cycles of cytarabine infusional therapy. Cytarabine was administered on an outpatient basis using a portable, battery-operated syringe pump until the total leukocyte count reached 2500/microliters or the platelet count reached 75,000/microliters. A new cycle was begun when the total leukocyte count exceeded 4,000/microliters and the platelet count exceeded 100,000/microliters. The median duration of cytarabine administration per cycle was 29 days (range 15-72 days). Leukocytosis was readily controlled by low-dose cytarabine therapy in all patients. All five patients experienced complete hematologic responses during cytarabine therapy. The fraction of Ph-positive metaphases in the marrow of the five patients was reduced to 0, 10%, 43%, 72%, and 84%, respectively, during therapy. The median time to achieve optimal cytogenetic response was 4.8 months (range 2.8-8.6 months). One patient demonstrated a complete cytogenetic response after three cycles of cytarabine. Another patient demonstrated persistent cytogenetic improvement during 20 cycles of cytarabine, with a median 38% Ph-positive marrow metaphases (range 10-53%) over 32 months. Cytarabine therapy was generally well-tolerated, but was discontinued in one patient because of persistent asymptomatic elevations in hepatic enzymes, which resolved within 2 months after discontinuing therapy. There were no episodes of fever during neutropenia, and platelet transfusions were not required. However, symptomatic anemia requiring transfusion of red cells occurred during most cycles of treatment. In summary, treatment of CML with low-dose cytarabine can induce prolonged cytogenetic improvement in some patients with acceptable toxicity. Further evaluation is needed to ascertain the effect of this treatment on duration of stable phase and overall survival.","['Robertson, M J', 'Tantravahi, R', 'Griffin, J D', 'Canellos, G P', 'Cannistra, S A']","['Robertson MJ', 'Tantravahi R', 'Griffin JD', 'Canellos GP', 'Cannistra SA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cells/drug effects']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830430205 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1993 Jun;43(2):95-102. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830430205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen patients (76%) achieved complete remission and 12 (57%) remain disease free. The regimen-related mortality rate in this study was 14%. The three treatment-related deaths were all due to pulmonary toxicity. The results of these clinical trials indicate that both the carmustine/etoposide/cisplatin regimen and the busulfan/etoposide/cyclophosphamide regimen are effective in treating lymphoid malignancies. Treatment-related toxicities and deaths are significant, but not prohibitive. Accordingly, these new preparative regimens deserve further evaluation in the treatment of patients with lymphoma or leukemia.","['Crilley, P', 'Lazarus, H', 'Topolsky, D', 'Ciobanu, N', 'Creger, R J', 'Fox, R M', 'Bulova, S I', 'Shina, D C', 'Gucalp, R', 'Cooper, B W']","['Crilley P', 'Lazarus H', 'Topolsky D', 'Ciobanu N', 'Creger RJ', 'Fox RM', 'Bulova SI', 'Shina DC', 'Gucalp R', 'Cooper BW', 'et al.']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA 19102.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Aug;20(4 Suppl 4):50-4; quiz 55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the use of BuCy2 as preparation for allogeneic BMT in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. In patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, the leukemia-free survival and regimen-related toxicity rates obtained in our study appear similar to those achieved with other preparative regimens, including those containing Cy and total body irradiation (TBI). BuCy2 is also an effective BMT preparative regimen in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Treatment with BuCy2 results in a lower incidence of severe stomatitis and probably of interstitial pneumonia than does treatment with Cy/TBI, but hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurs more frequently in BuCy-treated patients. The incidence of veno-occlusive disease appears to be affected by agents used as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease. Compared with Cy/TBI regimens, BuCy treatment is likely to result in fewer delayed effects of treatment, such as impairment of fertility and second malignancies.

We present an update of a study in which a BMT preparative regimen consisting of a 4-day course of busulfan and a 2-day course of cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) was used in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Patient survival depended on disease stage, with a 58% survival rate for patients in first chronic phase, 41% for those in accelerated phase, and 25% for those in the blast transformation stage. There was a significant difference in patient survival between those who received transplants within 1 year of diagnosis and those who received transplants more than 1 year after diagnosis (70% v 40%). This difference appeared to be due to the extent of previous exposure to busulfan. The overall mortality rate in this study was 46%. We conclude that the BuCy2 preparative regimen is similar in effectiveness to regimens that include total body irradiation and results in comparable levels of transplant-related mortality.

The essentially lymphocytic haematopoietic growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3) reduce the infectious morbidity associated with the deep and prolonged neuropoenia induced by the myelo-ablative conditioning for autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantations, and widening their indications is tempting. The reluctance expressed about their use in chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukaemia is abating now that controlled studies have shown that they preserve the complete response rate and shorten the duration of leucopoenia. Moreover, they modify the leukaemia biological response, which makes it possible to increase the cytotoxicity of certain drugs and constitutes a new approach to drug-resistant leukaemias. Immuno-modulating cytokines (interferon alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-2) act through mechanisms that are still ill-defined: antitumoral activity, modification of biological responses, immunoactivation. Nevertheless, interferon alpha has revolutionized the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia and myeloid leukaemia, with a 70% remission rate. The scarcity of complete responses (10% of hairy cell leukaemias) or cytogenetic responses (20% of chronic myeloid leukaemias) justifies a combined treatment (chemotherapy+immunotherapy?) to improve these patients' cure rate. The anti-leukaemic activity of interleukin-2, observed in patients with refractory relapses, produces 33% of responses, including 10% of complete responses, and it is tempting to test the impact of this immunotherapy on the control of residual leukaemia as adjuvant of complete remission using randomized trials.","['Blaise, D', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Maraninchi, D']","['Blaise D', 'Stoppa AM', 'Maraninchi D']","['Unite de transplantation medullaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Prat,La Revue du praticien,0404334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytokines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/therapy']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Prat. 1993 Mar 1;43(5):574-9.,24,,Cytokines et hemopathies malignes: leucemies et greffe de moelle osseuse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of them, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), play a major role in coordinating mechanisms which command inflammation. Under their action many cells produce lipidic mediators, proteolytic enzymes or free radicals, all factors that are directly responsible for the noxious effects observed. IL-1 and/or TNF exert cytotoxic activities on vascular epithelium, cartilage, bone, muscle or beta cells of pancreatic islets. Such cytokines as interferon gamma (IFN gamma), IL-3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) amplify the inflammatory response by increasing the production of IL-1 and TNF by macrophages. GM-CSF also produces other cytokines, such as IL-8 and the macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), the chemotactic properties of which participate in the recruitment of leucocytes within the focus of inflammation. IL-6 abounds in inflammatory processes and induces the production by hepatocytes of acute inflammation phase proteins. The same applies to IL-1, TNF, IL-11, the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). The latter also possesses a number of anti-inflammatory activities and, like IL-4 and IL-10, can inhibit IL-1 and TNF production. Glucocorticoids have this potential activity, and they may be produced by a cascade of events initiated by IL-1, TNF and IL-6, involving the neuroendocrine system. The concept of ""cytokine network"", therefore, perfectly illustrates the participation of these mediators in inflammatory mechanisms.","['Cavaillon, J M', 'Haeffner-Cavaillon, N']","['Cavaillon JM', 'Haeffner-Cavaillon N']","[""Unite d'immuno-allergie, Institut Pateur, Paris.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Prat,La Revue du praticien,0404334,['0 (Cytokines)'],,"['Cytokines/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*physiopathology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Prat. 1993 Mar 1;43(5):547-52.,29,,Cytokines et inflammation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have hypothesized that total body irradiation (TBI) which has been used for pretreatment may influence the subsequent development of BrOb in patients undergoing allogeneic BMT. Since 1976, we have treated 104 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT with non-TBI preconditioning. Of 60 patients that survived and were evaluable for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) 26 developed chronic GVHD (43%). Four of 104 patients (3.9%) developed BrOb by clinical and/or pathologic findings. Four of 4 patients (100%) with BrOb had chronic GVHD. Two of these 4 patients (50%) were alive at the end of 2 years. These data demonstrate that chronic GVHD is a risk factor for BrOb in patients receiving non-TBI preconditioning regimens. The similar incidence of BrOb in this population compared to other studies using TBI suggest that the preconditioning regimen is not a factor in the development of BrOb. Further study is needed to confirm these findings.

In contrast to the 64- and 66-kDa EPOR proteins, these high molecular mass forms of EPOR (hmm-EPOR) correlated well with the number of binding sites and endocytosis of EPO. The hypothesis that hmm-EPOR are more highly glycosylated forms of the EPOR, appear on the cell surface, and represent at least one component of the biologically active EPOR was tested. Consistent findings were as follows. (i) Only hmm-EPOR increased following withdrawal of EPO from HC-D57 cells, correlating with a 10-fold increase in binding of 125I-labeled EPO. In addition, the EPO-dependent downregulation of 125I-EPO binding and disappearance of hmm-EPOR occurred in parallel while the amount of 66-kDa EPOR did not change. (ii) The 78-kDa EPOR was detected in COS cells expressing EPOR cDNA. (iii) Probing of the intact surface of these cells with anti-NH2-terminal antibody recovered only the 78-kDa EPOR. (iv) Enzymatic deglycosylation and dephosphorylation showed that hmm-EPOR apparently resulted from additional N-linked glycosylation of a 62-kDa EPOR. (v) The hmm-EPOR turnover in HC-D57 cells was accelerated 12-fold in the presence of EPO (half-life changed from 3 hr to 15 min). (vi) Anti-phosphotyrosine antiserum detected an EPO-dependent phosphorylation of the 78-kDa EPOR. The kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of a 97-kDa protein correlated with the occupancy and internalization of hmm-EPOR.

Removal of HMBA prior to the G1 phase aborts commitment. To further define the relationship between the G1 phase and commitment to differentiation, we used two inhibitors of cell cycle progression: aphidicolin, which blocks cells at the G1/S interphase, and deferoxamine, which blocks cells at an earlier stage during G1. HMBA-induced prolongation of G1 is associated with the accumulation of underphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, decrease in cyclin A protein levels, and commitment to differentiation. G1 arrest of murine erythroleukemia cells induced by aphidicolin or deferoxamine is not associated with accumulation of under-phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, suppression of cyclin A protein, or commitment of cells to terminal differentiation. Neither of the cell cycle inhibitors alters the effect of HMBA in inducing the G1-associated changes or commitment to differentiation. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the site of action of HMBA which leads to commitment is in a stage of the G1 phase prior to the point of cell cycle block caused by deferoxamine or aphidicolin. HMBA appears to cause cell differentiation with suppression of cell cycle progression by an action that affects events required for cell progression through G1, including accumulation of underphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein and changes in regulation of cyclin levels.","['Kiyokawa, H', 'Richon, V M', 'Venta-Perez, G', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Kiyokawa H', 'Richon VM', 'Venta-Perez G', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']","['Program of Cell Biology and Genetics, DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.14.6746 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jul 15;90(14):6746-50. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.14.6746.,,['CA-0874823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC47009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that the aberrant expression of the Evi-1 gene impairs the normal response of erythroid cells or bone-marrow progenitors to erythropoietin. Erythroid differentiation has been shown to require the GATA-1 transcription factor that binds to a sequence contained within the consensus binding sequence identified for Evi-1. In the studies presented here we also show that Evi-1 can repress GATA-1-dependent transactivation in transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays.

Thus LS lost 50% of their adherent cells within 3-6 h in culture and up to 90% by 24 h, whereas adherence to MS was undiminished during this time. Rapid loss of adherent cells was unique to schistosomula that had developed to the lung stage because schistosomula recovered from the skin up to 3 days post-infection did not exhibit the rapid cell loss shown by 3-day LS. To determine whether cell loss was caused by loss of surface antigenicity during culture LS were cultured on their own for up to 24 h and at various intervals samples of schistosomula were tested for antigenicity by addition of immune serum and cells. Levels of adherence to both MS and LS were maintained throughout the incubation period. When antibody-opsonized schistosomula were washed and indicator cells added at progressive intervals, persistence of adherence was again demonstrated, showing that antibody binding to LS had not promoted surface antigen loss or degradation of bound antibody. It was then shown, by adding fresh macrophages to cultures up to 24 h old that LS which had lost their adherent cells nevertheless retained bound antibody, and comparison of adherence of 'used' and 'fresh' cells to MS and LS showed that the cytoadherence properties of macrophages were not significantly reduced during their culture with LS from which cells had been lost.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lawson, B W', 'Bickle, Q D', 'Taylor, M G']","['Lawson BW', 'Bickle QD', 'Taylor MG']","['Department of Medical Parasitology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Parasitology,Parasitology,0401121,"['0 (Antibodies, Helminth)', '0 (Antigens, Helminth)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Helminth/*immunology', 'Antigens, Helminth/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Larva/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lung/parasitology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*parasitology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Opsonin Proteins/immunology', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Schistosoma mansoni/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1017/s0031182000076757 [doi]'],ppublish,Parasitology. 1993 Jun;106 ( Pt 5):463-9. doi: 10.1017/s0031182000076757.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Age and social class standardised mortality ratios were calculated for males 15-64 years for all cancers combined and for site specific cancers by occupational group. RESULTS: In general, higher socio-economic groups had a lower all cancer mortality and lower socio-economic groups a higher mortality. After standardisation for age and social class, mortality ratios were increased for lung cancer in bricklayers and carpenters (SMR = 125; 95% CI: 110-141), machine tool operators (SMR = 218; 95% CI: 131-342), and welders (SMR = 140; 95% CI: 120-161), with the first group also having an increased risk for pleural mesothelioma (SMR = 222; 95% CI: 70-522). Malignant melanoma risk was increased in clerical workers (SMR = 147; 95% CI: 106-199) and not in outdoor occupations. Colon cancer mortality risk was increased in managers (SMR = 125; 95% CI: 104-148), and woodworkers (SMR = 147; 95% CI: 115-186). Stomach cancer mortality risk was raised for machine tool operators (SMR = 357; 95% CI: 128-782). Painters had an increased ratio for multiple myeloma (SMR = 352; 95% CI: 140-729) and machine tool operators an increase for leukaemia (SMR = 172; 95% CI: 45-446). CONCLUSIONS: The use of routinely collected data to examine cancer mortality by occupation is a useful method to identify groups with increased risks and provide information for hypothesis generation. Further research may be warranted to investigate lung and digestive cancers in woodworkers and machine tool operators, and cancer of the haemopoietic and lymphatic systems in painters and machine tool operators.","['Firth, H M', 'Herbison, G P', 'Cooke, K R', 'Fraser, J']","['Firth HM', 'Herbison GP', 'Cooke KR', 'Fraser J']","['Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Otago Medical School, Dunedin.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,N Z Med J,The New Zealand medical journal,0401067,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupations/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class']",1993/08/11 00:00,1993/08/11 00:01,['1993/08/11 00:00'],"['1993/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,N Z Med J. 1993 Aug 11;106(961):328-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow growth factors have also been used to enhance yield. Both these manoeuvres may necessitate alterations to standard treatment programmes. In order to determine whether adequate peripheral stem cell yields could be obtained without altering chemotherapy regimens, 18 children with either leukaemia or solid tumours were studied. Circulating bone marrow progenitor cells were estimated by CFU-GM cultures in soft agar. There were 8 males and 10 females, median age 5.6 years (range 2-13 years). Six out of 13 studies in leukaemia patients were done when the bone marrow contained significant leukaemic blasts, and in 2 of 9 studies in patients with solid tumours, there was active infiltration of the bone marrow. In 15 of 23 studies, a rise in CFU-GM levels to greater than 1,000 x 10(3)/l were observed following postchemotherapy aplasia. Maximum CFU-GM levels were maintained for only 1-2 days and could be predicted by the achievement of a total white cell count in the region of 2 x 10(9)/l and platelet count around 100 x 10(9)/l. Neutrophil recovery did not predict the rise in CFU-GM levels. A rapid rise in monocyte levels also preceded maximum CFU-GM levels. Predictably, the CFU-GM counts were lower in patients who were heavily pretreated, but in several children, the counts were sufficient to predict an adequate harvest to be used in conjunction with bone marrow autotransplantation. It is concluded that in children with active bone marrow recovery, chemotherapy priming or the use of bone marrow growth factors may not be necessary to achieve useful stem cell harvests.","['Fernandez, J M', 'Shepherd, V', 'Millar, J', 'Powles, R', 'Pinkerton, C R']","['Fernandez JM', 'Shepherd V', 'Millar J', 'Powles R', 'Pinkerton CR']","['Paediatric Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950210702 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1993;21(7):465-9. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950210702.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent, is an ideal candidate for dose escalation: A log-linear relationship between cell kill and dose has been demonstrated, and the drug spares hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, studies suggest that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can enhance the ability to achieve optimal dose intensity as well as ameliorating chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the toxic effects of cyclophosphamide administered every 2 weeks with GM-CSF support. METHODS: For this trial by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), cohorts of patients were treated with cyclophosphamide as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 14 days; GM-CSF was given subcutaneously on days 3-10. Four dose levels of cyclophosphamide (1.5, 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 g/m2) and three dose levels of GM-CSF (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 micrograms/kg per day) were evaluated. There was no dose escalation in individual patients. Fifty-one patients with solid tumors who had CALGB performance status 0 or 1 and minimal prior radiotherapy were eligible for analysis. Drug clearance and area under the curve for plasma drug concentration x time (AUC) were estimated at completion of the infusion and at 4 and 24 hours after the start of the infusion. RESULTS: Ninety-five courses of therapy were analyzed. Treatment with cyclophosphamide at 3.0 g/m2 or more resulted in neutropenia (absolute neutrophil counts < 100/microL) in all cycles of therapy. At those doses, blood cell count recovery adequate for re-treatment occurred in 67%-85% of cycles (median, 16 days). Doses of 6.0 g/m2 were associated with the greatest degree of myelosuppression and frequent hospitalization (88% of cycles); requirements for blood transfusion prohibited further dose escalation. Nonhematologic toxic effects were tolerable, with two episodes of reversible cardiotoxicity and four episodes of hemorrhagic cystitis that precluded further therapy. Degree of myelosuppression was not correlated with cyclophosphamide AUC or clearance. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II dose of cyclophosphamide is 4.5 g/m2 administered every 2 weeks with GM-CSF given at 5.0 micrograms/kg per day of GM-CSF. Our results suggest that, with GM-CSF support, high cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide can be given to achieve optimal dose intensity, with reproducible blood cell count recovery and without the need for autologous bone marrow transplantation. IMPLICATIONS: Phase II studies of this intensive regimen in malignant diseases sensitive to alkylating agents are currently being done in CALGB.","['Lichtman, S M', 'Ratain, M J', 'Van Echo, D A', 'Rosner, G', 'Egorin, M J', 'Budman, D R', 'Vogelzang, N J', 'Norton, L', 'Schilsky, R L']","['Lichtman SM', 'Ratain MJ', 'Van Echo DA', 'Rosner G', 'Egorin MJ', 'Budman DR', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Norton L', 'Schilsky RL']","['North Shore University Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, N.Y. 11030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism']",1993/08/18 00:00,1993/08/18 00:01,['1993/08/18 00:00'],"['1993/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.16.1319 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Aug 18;85(16):1319-26. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.16.1319.,,"['CA3196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To tackle this problem, the c-fes protooncogene expression has been inhibited in HL60 cells, and fresh leukemic promyelocytes of acute promyelocytic leukemia have been induced to differentiate with retinoic acid (RA) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Inhibition was obtained by incubating the cells with a specific c-fes antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. It was observed that the cells, rather than differentiating, underwent premature cell death showing the morphological and molecular characteristics of apoptosis.

Cell membrane proteins of resting and TPA-treated CLL B-lymphocytes were studied using ultrahigh resolution giant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Cellular proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and, in separate experiments, membrane proteins were photoaffinity labeled with [125I] iodoazidophenylalanine, an amino acid transporter by the L-system and which binds at or near the L-system transport carrier. In a partially purified membrane preparation, approximately 1400 proteins were identified by metabolic labeling. Following TPA treatment for 17 h, 14 new metabolically labeled membrane proteins were identified, and five of these also were labeled by the L-system photoprobe. Photolabeling of four of these proteins was inhibited by an excess of the L-system prototype amino acid, 2-aminobicyclo(2.2.1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid.

Evidence that beta II protein kinase C is required for proliferation.,15847-53,"The human erythroleukemia (K562) cell line undergoes megakaryocytic differentiation and cessation of proliferation when treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). To investigate the role of individual protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes in these events, we have assessed PKC isotype expression during leukemic proliferation and PMA-induced differentiation. Immunoblot analysis using isotype-specific antibodies demonstrates that proliferating K562 cells express the alpha, beta II, and zeta PKC isotypes. PMA-induced differentiation and cytostasis lead to a decrease in beta II PKC and increases in alpha and zeta PKC levels. The role of the alpha and beta II PKC isotypes was further assessed in cells overexpressing these isotypes. K562 cells overexpressing human alpha PKC grew more slowly and were more sensitive to the cytostatic effects of PMA than control cells, whereas cells overexpressing beta II PKC were less sensitive to PMA. PMA-induced cytostasis is reversed upon removal of PMA. Resumption of proliferation is accompanied by reexpression of beta II PKC to near control levels, whereas alpha and zeta PKC levels remain elevated for several days after removal of PMA. Proliferation of PMA-withdrawn cells can be partially inhibited by antisense beta II PKC oligodeoxyribonucleotide. Growth inhibition is dose-dependent, specific for beta II PKC-directed antisense oligonucleotide, and associated with significant inhibition of beta II PKC levels indicating that beta II PKC is essential for K562 cell proliferation. Sodium butyrate, which unlike PMA induces megakaryocytic differentiation without cytostasis, causes increases in both alpha and beta II PKC levels. These data demonstrate that beta II PKC is required for K562 cell proliferation, whereas alpha PKC is involved in megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Murray, N R', 'Baumgardner, G P', 'Burns, D J', 'Fields, A P']","['Murray NR', 'Baumgardner GP', 'Burns DJ', 'Fields AP']","['Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/25 00:00,1993/07/25 00:01,['1993/07/25 00:00'],"['1993/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)82331-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jul 25;268(21):15847-53.,,"['CA-56869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-43186/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This latter stage can exhibit either myeloid or lymphoid blast clones. Our recent results have demonstrated the presence of the P210 BCR-ABL protein in blood cells from benign phase CML patients (Guo et al., Cancer Research 51:3048, 1991). This protein is the product of an 8.5 kb chimeric RNA encoded by fused BCR-ABL genes produced by the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Using this new assay we have identified a patient with benign-phase CML who produces P190 BCR-ABL, the form of the BCR-ABL protein found in about 50% of cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This patient lacked detectable P210 BCR-ABL protein and did not contain a DNA rearrangement in the major breakpoint cluster region of the BCR gene. Consistent with this result, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses detected a BCR-ABL mRNA with BCR exon 1 fused to ABL exon 2. No BCR-ABL mRNAs with 2'- or 3'-bcr exon to ABL exon 2 fusions were detected in these analyses. Blood cells from this patient lost P190 BCR-ABL after the patient underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, but regained this protein although the patient was still in chronic phase after a subsequent autologous transplant as treatment for graft failure. These findings indicate that P190 BCR-ABL alone is not sufficient to induce a blast crisis phenotype in leukemia patients who are Ph chromosome-positive.","['Guo, J Q', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, C F', 'Xian, Y M', 'Stass, S A', 'Champlin, R E', 'Giralt, S A', 'McCredie, K B', 'Campbell, M L', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Guo JQ', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg CF', 'Xian YM', 'Stass SA', 'Champlin RE', 'Giralt SA', 'McCredie KB', 'Campbell ML', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas, M.

This study was carried out on five patients with refractory CLL, with DOX administered either as a bolus injection (35 mg/m2; CHOP protocol) or as a constant-rate infusion for a period of 96 h (9 mg/m2 per day; VAD protocol). The two types of drug administration were used alternatively with the same patient. Plasma and cellular DOX concentration were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak plasma DOX levels were higher after the bolus injection than after continuous administration (1509 +/- 80 ng/ml vs 11.6 +/- 1.8 ng/ml, respectively), whereas the plasma area under the curve (AUC) levels were similar. Maximum DOX cellular concentrations were 8629 +/- 2902 ng/10(9) cells (bolus injection) and 2745 +/- 673 ng/10(9) cells (96 h infusion). The cellular AUC after the bolus injection was 2.85 times greater than that observed after continuous administration. This difference was due to a higher cellular peak level followed by a relatively prolonged retention of the drug, with a loss of only 25% in the first 24 h following. These findings demonstrated that in CLL the cellular DOX exposure can be notably modified by the method of drug administration, with higher drug intracellular concentrations being achieved after bolus administration than with the infusion schedule.","['Muller, C', 'Chatelut, E', 'Gualano, V', 'De Forni, M', 'Huguet, F', 'Attal, M', 'Canal, P', 'Laurent, G']","['Muller C', 'Chatelut E', 'Gualano V', 'De Forni M', 'Huguet F', 'Attal M', 'Canal P', 'Laurent G']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'VAD protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00735923 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;32(5):379-84. doi: 10.1007/BF00735923.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A genomic locus named ALL-1 or MLL, where 11q23 breakpoints are clustered, has been recently cloned and characterized. We have made use of an ALL-1-specific probe in Southern blot experiments to analyze the configuration of this gene in a large series of acute leukemia patients, representative of all different myeloid and lymphoid subtypes. Nine of 145 cases (6.2%) showed abnormal ALL-1 restriction fragments in leukemic DNAs. Of these nine cases, five patients in whom karyotypic data were available displayed chromosome 11q23 aberrations, including t(4;11) (three cases) and t(9;11) (two cases). Immunophenotypic and morphocytochemical characterization of ALL-1-rearranged acute leukemia revealed prevalence of poorly differentiated B lymphoid and/or monoblastic features. Considering the whole series, ALL-1 rearrangements were significantly associated with female sex, higher white blood cell counts at presentation, and very poor clinical outcome. The presence of residual disease was molecularly documented in one case at the time of clinical remission after induction treatment and was followed by early relapse.

When measured with the human tumor cloning assay in agar or methyl-cellulose the surviving fraction showed an inverse correlation with the concentrations of ET-18-OCH3. After a 4-h exposure with 75 micrograms/ml ET-18-OCH3 at a cell density of 2 x 10(5)/ml the number of colonies of HTB 19 decreased from 75 +/- 10/10(3) cells (100%) to 1 +/- 0/10(3) cells (1%), and after subsequent cryopreservation no remaining colonies were found. In order to simulate the situation in autologous bone marrow transplantation we contaminated normal human bone marrow cells with malignant HTB 19 breast cancer cells at a ratio of 100:1. After incubation with 75 micrograms/ml ET-18-OCH3 for 4 h and subsequent cryopreservation there was a considerable reduction of HTB 19 colonies whereas the majority of normal human hematopoietic progenitors recovered. We conclude that ET-18-OCH3, in combination with cryopreservation, can remove breast cancer cells from bone marrow by up to 1 log and may be useful for purging bone marrow for autologous bone marrow transplantation not only in acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma but also in breast cancer.","['Dietzfelbinger, H F', 'Kuhn, D', 'Zafferani, M', 'Hanauske, A R', 'Rastetter, J W', 'Berdel, W E']","['Dietzfelbinger HF', 'Kuhn D', 'Zafferani M', 'Hanauske AR', 'Rastetter JW', 'Berdel WE']","['Department of Medicine I, Technische Universitaet of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', '*Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Phospholipid Ethers', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Aug 15;53(16):3747-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells exhibited multiple copies of the Philadelphia chromosome, and a high level of p210Bcr-Abl kinase activity was detected with rabbit anti-Abl and anti-Bcr (exon 3) peptide antisera. Use of specific primers and polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern blotting revealed that KBM-5 cells carried a bcr3-ABLII splice junction. While a normal BCR message was detected, no normal ABL message was found. The cells were phenotypically myeloid with monocytic differentiation. The high cloning efficiency in semisolid media was independent of the presence of exogenous colony-stimulating factors. In vitro exposure to induces of differentiation, such as retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, or hemin, failed to influence the growth rate of the cells and their level of differentiation. KBM-5 cells are highly resistant to the antiproliferative action of recombinant alpha- and gamma-interferons. Although sensitive to recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha, they were completely resistant to natural killer cell action. KBM-5 cells constitutively expressed mRNA for tumor necrosis factor alpha but not for gamma-interferon, other interleukins, or hematopoietic growth factors.

Neutrophilic granulocytes obtained by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid to the culture medium showed only slight changes in cellular glucocorticoid receptor levels and receptor-specific mRNA as compared to undifferentiated control cells. Monocytic cells induced by incubation with dihydroxy-vitamin D3 had a moderate increase in receptor hormone-binding activity. However, differentiation toward macrophages by exposure to phorbol ester resulted in a 5- to 6- fold increase in both cellular hormone-binding capacity and immunochemically cross-reacting receptor protein. An even greater increase in glucocorticoid receptor-specific mRNA was observed.

METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied the short- and long-term effects of plateletpheresis combined with three different chemotherapy regimens (busulfan, hydroxyurea, or busulfan/hydroxyurea) in 30 patients with MPD with symptomatic thrombocytosis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients entered first remission (FR) with initial treatment. The average number of plateletphereses to FR was three (standard deviation [SD], +/- 3). Average total dose of busulfan (216 mg) and time to FR (1.6 months) were less than for previously reported patients treated without plateletphereses. Addition of hydroxyurea to busulfan decreased the number of plateletpheresis needed (P = 0.02) but did not additionally reduce the amount of busulfan needed or the time to FR. The shortest time to FR was in the hydroxyurea group (mean, 0.6 +/- 0.3 months), but unmaintained remission could be achieved only in the busulfan-treated groups. With median follow-up of 68 months, median survival was 53 months for the busulfan group, 55 months for the hydroxyurea group, and was undefined with no deaths for the busulfan/hydroxyurea group. Neither fatal complications of recurrent symptomatic thrombocytosis nor development of acute leukemia has occurred, except for progression to blast crisis in two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSION: Combined plateletpheresis and chemotherapy is a rapidly effective initial treatment for patients with MPD with symptomatic thrombocytosis.

B-immunoblastic lymphoma (BIBL) is a rapidly progressive, aggressive lymphoma. As patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) live longer, BIBL is becoming an increasing problem. We asked three questions in our study. What is the frequency of p53 mutations in BIBL? Is it more frequent in patients with AIDS? Can immunohistochemical staining of lymph nodes for expression of p53 substitute for mutational analysis of p53 to detect lymphomas with mutated p53? Exons 5, 6, 7, 8 of the p53 gene (hot-spots for mutations) were amplified and examined for mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Altered migration was observed in 7 of 52 BIBL samples. Of these, 4 of 25 were from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 3 of 27 were not infected with HIV. Direct sequencing of amplified material confirmed the presence of mutations in exons 5, 7, 8 of p53. A total of 26 BIBL as well as other lymphoma/leukemia samples, stained strongly by immunohistochemistry with three antibodies directed against human p53. Five of 6 BIBL samples with p53 mutations stained strongly for p53, but 20 lymphoma samples with no detectable p53 mutations also stained strongly for p53. Of note, however, 10 hyperplastic, nonmalignant lymph nodes from individuals either infected or not infected with HIV had negligible staining for p53 protein. In conclusion, p53 mutations occur in about 14% BIBL samples; the frequency of p53 mutations in BIBL in individuals with and without AIDS was similar. Positive p53 immunohistochemistry did not correlate with detectable p53 mutations in the same tissue, but positive immunohistochemical staining for p53 was only found in neoplastic lymph nodes. This latter finding provides a strong warning that p53 immunochemistry with available reagents cannot be used to determine which tumors have mutations of p53.","['Nakamura, H', 'Said, J W', 'Miller, C W', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Nakamura H', 'Said JW', 'Miller CW', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90048.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82380-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 1;82(3):920-6.,,"['CA26038-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cut-off value for -7 was 18% one-spot cells, and for +8 was 3% three-spot cells.

Interphase cytogenetics of the 34 samples without -7 or +8 did not show significant cell populations with -7 or +8. In four patients, -7 or +8 could not be confirmed by FISH due to additional structural aberrations, marker chromosomes, or wrongly interpreted banding results.

Here we have analyzed whether the presence of in vitro autonomous growth characteristics has any clinical relevance in AML. We have studied 50 patients (age 2 to 64 years), all of whom were treated with combination chemotherapy, excluding patients with a history of antecedent myelodysplasia. Leukemic cells from 34 of 50 patients (68%) exhibited either partial or totally autonomous growth in a blast cell colony assay. Cells from the remaining patients exhibited nonautonomous growth and were either totally dependent on exogenous growth factor (n = 8) or failed to proliferate at all in the culture system used (n = 8). All 50 patients were treated by intensive chemotherapy and 69% achieved complete remission (CR). Patients whose blasts exhibited autonomous growth in vitro had a significantly lower CR rate (57%) compared with the 16 patients with nonautonomous growth (94%, P = .02). White blood cell count was the only other significant factor (P = .03), but in multivariate analysis growth characteristics remains the most important predictor of CR. Actuarial relapse risk is 80% and 42% at 5 years for autonomous and nonautonomous groups respectively (P = .1). Overall disease-free survival is 21.8% and is higher in the nonautonomous growth group at 54.2% compared with 11.3% at 5 years (P = .0015) in the autonomous growth characteristics was found to be the single most important indicator of CR and disease-free survival.

A combined technique of May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) for cell morphology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific DNA probes for detection of cytogenetic aberrations allowed us to investigate cell-lineage-specific chromosomal abnormalities. We introduced video recordings to examine large numbers of cells. Briefly, evaluation was first performed on MGG slides, during which cell position and morphology were recorded on an S-VHS recorder. Subsequently, the same slides were used for FISH. This resulted in the identification of MGG-stained cells on the video screen and, at the same time, the interpretation of FISH signals in the fluorescence microscope. Specimens of bone marrow or blood samples from four patients with different hematologic malignancies were studied. One of these patients was studied before and after cytotoxic treatment. The gain or loss of chromosomes could be detected easily and morphologically assigned to the blasts in all patients and to a variable proportion of the myelomonocytic lineage in two patients, but not to the lymphocytes.

Using probes that map both 5' and 3' of JH, the 3' (centromeric) boundary of the deletions was mapped to an approximately 30-kb central region of the 60 kb between C delta and C gamma 3 in 10 of the 12 deleted chromosomes. In the remaining two chromosomes, the 3' boundary mapped to S mu. The 5' (telomeric) boundary could not be defined. However, three cases with biallelic deletion of JH showed biallelic deletion of the most proximal variable (VH) (VH6 and VH5-B2) genes, indicating that the deletions spanned over 500 kb. VH5-B1 and VH5-B3 were retained in germline configuration and no gross deletions were observed using a VH3 subgroup-specific probe, indicating that the 5' boundary mapped within the VH locus. Unusual deletions of the portion of the IgH locus including JH segments and the C mu and C delta genes may occur in acute leukemias with immunophenotypic evidence of commitment to the B cell differentiation pathway. The possible consequences of the deletions remain to be determined. However, the clustering of the centromeric boundary of the deletions to S mu and to a region between the C delta-C gamma 3 genes, a known ""hot spot"" for recombination, may indicate the operation of a distinct pathogenic mechanism.","['Dyer, M J', 'Heward, J M', 'Zani, V J', 'Buccheri, V', 'Catovsky, D']","['Dyer MJ', 'Heward JM', 'Zani VJ', 'Buccheri V', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research-Royal Marsden Hospital, Haddow Laboratories, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Sequence Deletion']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82371-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 1;82(3):865-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the study was to investigate the specificity of this reagent for B-lineage cases and its reactivity on leukemias that coexpress myeloid and B-cell antigens (biphenotypic). The majority (89%) of 72 B-cell precursor ALL patients were positive. Of these, mb-1 was expressed in all 9 patients with early-B-ALL (CD10-, c mu-), in all 11 patients with pre-B-ALL (c mu+) and in the single case of B-ALL (smIgM+). Forty-three of 51 patients with common-ALL (CD10+, c mu+) were also positive. All 16 T-lineage ALL patients and 72 (93.5%) of the AML patients examined were mb-1 negative. Four of the 5 mb-1-positive AML patients were considered biphenotypic and expressed other B-cell antigens such as CD10, CD19, and/or cCD22 and all showed rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain genes. Within the AML cases, mb-1 and cCD22 were more useful than other B-cell antigens in detecting biphenotypic cases, and mb-1 showed the highest correlation with the clonal rearrangement of Ig heavy chain genes. These results indicate that mb-1 is a sensitive and specific reagent for B-lineage blasts that will aid in the classification of B-cell precursor ALL and in the identification of biphenotypic leukemia presenting as AML.","['Buccheri, V', 'Mihaljevic, B', 'Matutes, E', 'Dyer, M J', 'Mason, D Y', 'Catovsky, D']","['Buccheri V', 'Mihaljevic B', 'Matutes E', 'Dyer MJ', 'Mason DY', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82369-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 1;82(3):853-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HTLV-I can immortalize T lymphocytes in culture, factors leading to tumor progression after HTLV-I infection remain elusive. Previous attempts to propagate the ATL tumor cells in animals have been unsuccessful. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice have previously been used to support the survival of human lymphoid cell populations when inoculated with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). SCID mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBL from patients diagnosed with ATL, HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), or from asymptomatic HTLV-I-seropositive patients. Many of these mice become persistently infected with HTLV-I. Furthermore, after human reconstitution was established in these mice, HTLV-I-infected cells displayed a proliferative advantage over uninfected human cells. Lymphoblastic lymphomas of human origin developed in animals injected with PBL from two ATL patients. The tumor cells represented outgrowth of the original ATL leukemic clone in that they had monoclonal or oligoclonal integrations of the HTLV-I provirus identical to the leukemic clone and predominantly expressed the cell surface markers, CD4 and CD25. In contrast, cell lines derived by HTLV immortalization of T cells in vitro did not persist or form tumors when inoculated into SCID mice, indicating differences between in vitro immortalized cells and ATL leukemic cells. This system represents the first small animal model to study HTLV-I tumorigenesis in vivo.","['Feuer, G', 'Zack, J A', 'Harrington, W J Jr', 'Valderama, R', 'Rosenblatt, J D', 'Wachsman, W', 'Baird, S M', 'Chen, I S']","['Feuer G', 'Zack JA', 'Harrington WJ Jr', 'Valderama R', 'Rosenblatt JD', 'Wachsman W', 'Baird SM', 'Chen IS']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/microbiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/microbiology/pathology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82353-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 1;82(3):722-31.,,"['1 F32 CA09108-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 54551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CFAR AI28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When applied to patient cells, rapid and unambiguous identification of the inversion resulted. Using FISH analysis, cosmid clones associated with the hybrids were identified that bracketed the p-arm breakpoint. A repeat-free fragment of one of these cosmids (35B11) when used as probe on Southern blots from pulsed-field gels identified rearranged macrorestriction fragments in patient DNA. Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) were isolated using sequences derived from cosmids flanking 35B11 in a cosmid contig. Of 4 YACs so identified, 3 were shown by FISH to cross the inversion-16 p-arm breakpoint. Therefore, the breakpoint has been molecularly cloned, and identified as being within these 3 YACs.

The rearrangement of the two chromosomes results in a fusion gene and in the production of a consistent fusion transcript on the der(8) chromosome. We have used oligonucleotide primers derived from both sides of the fusion cDNA junction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to analyze six AML-M2 patients with a t(8;21) during various stages of their disease. Two patients studied at diagnosis and one studied at first relapse are alive off therapy and in continuous complete remission for 83 to 94 months. We have detected the AML/ETO fusion transcript in recent peripheral blood samples from each of them. Three other patients also had a fusion transcript detected after 1 to 4 months in remission. Two of these patients subsequently relapsed and died whereas the third patient is alive and in continuous complete remission 70 months later. Thus, our preliminary data suggest that cells with the translocation are still circulating in t(8;21) patients in long-term remission.

All patients were HLA class I identical with their donors as determined by serology and one-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF); two were serologically matched with their donors for HLA class II antigens, whereas three donor-recipient pairs were serologically mismatched for one HLA-DR antigen. All patients received total body irradiation (fractionated, 1,500 rads), VP-16 (750 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) pre-BMT and antithymocyte globulin (15 mg/kg every other day) and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg) post-BMT. Three patients experienced primary nonengraftment and two experienced secondary GF. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the patients at the time of GF were studied to examine their functional and phenotypic characteristics. Emerging cells were of host origin and were found to be specifically cytotoxic to donor target cells and suppressive to the in vitro growth of donor BM, especially in the cases of primary nonengraftment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these patients were expanded to form T-cell lines (TcLs). The cytotoxic activities of TcLs were tested in the presence of blocking MoAbs directed against various HLA determinants in an attempt to determine if HLA antigens expressed on donor cells were the target for cytotoxicity. The observed cytotoxic activity was blocked by antibodies to HLA-B, -C (1 patient), HLA-DR (1 patient), and HLA-DQ (1 patient). In two cases, antidonor cytotoxicity could not be blocked by MoAb directed against HLA-A, -B, -C, or -DR. Phenotypic characterization of four successfully maintained TcLs showed 100% CD3+ cells with 100% CD4+ (3 patients) or 50% CD4+/50% CD8+ (1 patient). In two of the three patients with 100% CD4+ cells, antidonor cytotoxicity was blocked by an anti-HLA class II MoAb. In contrast to our previous findings in cases of GF following T-cell-depleted HLA nonidentical family member BMT in which host T cells were CD8+ and cytotoxicity was directed against HLA class I antigens, our present study indicates host T cells emerging at the time of GF following BMT from an HLA class I IEF-identical unrelated donor can be of the CD4+ subset and seem to be capable of recognizing antigenic disparities in the HLA class II region.","['Donohue, J', 'Homge, M', 'Kernan, N A']","['Donohue J', 'Homge M', 'Kernan NA']","['Charles A.

Responses of isolated cell populations were assessed in diffusion chamber inserts which permitted contact with fluid phase molecules but not with the adherent stromal cell layer of the LTMC system. Growth of AML cells in diffusion chambers was inhibited during co-culture with LTMC of autologous leukaemic bone marrow, and the same effect was produced during co-culture with normal LTMC. No inhibitory action was exerted on growth of normal haemopoietic precursors under the same conditions. Comparable responses were observed with human leukaemic cell lines and patient leukaemic cells, and studies on cell lines demonstrated inhibition of growth was induced by molecules generated in LTMC which caused accumulation in G1 phase of leukaemic cells of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage. The inhibitory effect was not reproduced by TGF beta, IFN gamma, IFN alpha, TNF alpha, LIF, SCF or Il-6, and was not impaired by inhibitors of nitric oxide or PGE production in the LTMC. These observations suggest the action of diffusible molecules of undefined constitution contributes to the preferential loss of leukaemic cells in LTMC.","['Firkin, F C', 'Birner, R', 'Farag, S']","['Firkin FC', 'Birner R', 'Farag S']","[""University of Melbourne Department of Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03019.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 May;84(1):8-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03019.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease was detected by the amplification of the leukaemia-specific BCR-ABL fusion mRNA with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a highly sensitive nested primer strategy. As a general pattern, patients often had detectable BCR-ABL (PCR positive) for up to 6 or 9 months post BMT after which time BCR-ABL became undetectable (PCR negative). The conversion from PCR positive to PCR negative was not associated with the time at which cyclosporin A treatment was stopped. Six patients (10%) have relapsed during the period of this study, two within 1 year and four more than 1 year after transplant. The relationship between PCR positivity more than 1 year post transplant and relapse was significant (P = 0.036) but 15 patients who were PCR positive beyond 1 year remain in complete clinical and cytogenetic remission. Thus late positivity identifies a group of patients at increased risk of relapse but is of little predictive value for individual patients. Of the four late relapses, two had been persistently PCR positive and two were initially PCR positive, converted to negative and subsequently to positive again. Although all relapses were preceded by PCR positivity, relapse may occur only 12 months after a PCR negative result. The proportion of patients PCR negative at 3/4 months after BMT was found to increase significantly with the severity of acute GVHD (P = 0.002) but no relationship was found between acute GVHD and subsequent PCR results.

All V alpha and V beta families were detectable in blood mononuclear cells from four of six healthy donors. In two donors only V alpha 22 was missing, and all other V alpha and V beta families were detected. V beta family expression was observed in T-leukaemic cell lines Jurkat, HSB, Molt-3 and Molt-4. In contrast, V alpha family expression was not detectable in any cell line except Jurkat cells. In T-cell malignancies (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and mycosis fungoides), one or two V alpha and V beta families were detectable. Four of 10 cases investigated showed two V alpha transcripts and one V beta transcript. This fits with concepts in literature that allelic exclusion for the genes encoding alpha chains is not strictly required in the DNA rearrangement, or that this exclusion is a post-translational event. Using a limited series of antibodies to V beta gene family products, blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were analysed by flow cytometry in a follow-up study.

Both hypericin and rose bengal, however, inactivated the FLV inoculum at low doses (< 11 micrograms), provided that the mixture was illuminated for 1 h under a normal fluorescent desk lamp. This procedure protected mice completely from FLV-induced splenomegaly, and provided a possible explanation for the discrepancy between our results and those reported previously.

Tax1 does not bind directly to DNA, but associates indirectly with DNA via cellular transcription factors. To further investigate the activation of HTLV-I transcription by Tax1, a chimeric protein containing Tax1 fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 was created (Gal4-Tax). HTLV-I long terminal repeat (LTR) reporter plasmids were constructed in which specific Tax1 responsive elements were replaced with Gal4 binding sites. Cotransfection of Gal4-Tax or Tax1 with HTLV-I LTR reporter constructs containing Gal4 binding sites demonstrated that Gal4 sequences were necessary but not sufficient for maximal activation of the promoter by Gal4-Tax. Sequences surrounding the Gal4 binding sites were important in determining the level of Gal4-Tax activation. Association of Gal4-Tax with promoters which contained six Gal4 binding sites, but which lacked flanking LTR sequences, were weakly transactivated by Gal4-Tax (sevenfold). In contrast, LTR-CAT reporter constructs containing three Gal4 binding sites flanked by two 21 base pair repeat elements demonstrated a ninefold greater response to Gal4-Tax. These results suggest that cellular transcription factors, which bind the 21 base pair repeat elements, influence the ability of Tax1 to function as a transactivator. Furthermore, this effect is not fully explained by the ability of these factors to physically direct Tax1 to the LTR.","['Connor, L M', 'Oxman, M N', 'Brady, J N', 'Marriott, S J']","['Connor LM', 'Oxman MN', 'Brady JN', 'Marriott SJ']","['Division of Molecular Virology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(83)71408-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1408 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Aug;195(2):569-77. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1408.,,['1R01CA55684-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: The odds of corticosteroid exposure were compared among 35 children with severe varicella and 10,000 control subjects. RESULTS: Five (26.3%) of 19 case patients without known immunosuppression had received steroids within 30 days prior to the onset of their rash compared with 20 of the 10,000 control subjects (0.2%), giving an odds ratio of 178 (95% confidence interval 59 to 541). If 16 case patients with leukemia or other known immunosuppressive conditions were included, the odds ratio was larger (odds ratio 420, 95% confidence interval 189 to 935). Of the 13 case patients whose dosage was recorded, 7 received less than the equivalent of 2 mg/kg per day of prednisone. The timing of the steroid use in those who had severe varicella clustered within the incubation period for the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic corticosteroid use appears to increase substantially the risk of severe or fatal varicella. The timing of corticosteroid exposure, in addition to dose and duration, may be an important factor in determining vulnerability. Further studies are needed to determine whether short-course, low-dose, or inhaled steroids are associated with similarly increased risk. Physicians should be aware that varicella-susceptible patients receiving corticosteroids are at considerably increased risk for severe varicella and should consider how to counsel their patients.","['Dowell, S F', 'Bresee, J S']","['Dowell SF', 'Bresee JS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*adverse effects', 'Chickenpox/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/adverse effects', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Male', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatrics. 1993 Aug;92(2):223-8.,,,,,,"['Pediatrics. 1995 Jul;96(1 Pt 1):170-1.

The v-myb oncogenes of E26 leukemia virus and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) encode proteins truncated at both the amino and carboxy termini, deleting portions of the DNA-binding and negative regulatory domains present in c-Myb. Similar truncations of c-Myb alter its function, suggesting that the viral proteins lack important regulatory sequences. Interestingly, eight potential sites of phosphorylation by proline-directed protein kinases conserved between the avian, murine and human Myb proteins are clustered in or near the negative regulatory domain of c-Myb. The majority of these sites are deleted in both the E26 and AMV viral proteins. In this paper we show that one proline-directed protein kinase, p42mapk, phosphorylates bacterially synthesized avian and murine c-Myb but not AMV v-Myb in vitro. We find that p42mapk phosphorylates c-Myb on serine and threonine, but not on tyrosine. Furthermore, deletion analysis indicates that the sites of phosphorylation map to the C-terminal negative regulatory domain. We speculate that the inability of v-Myb to be phosphorylated by p42mapk may contribute to its oncogenic properties.","['Aziz, N', 'Wu, J', 'Dubendorff, J W', 'Lipsick, J S', 'Sturgill, T W', 'Bender, T P']","['Aziz N', 'Wu J', 'Dubendorff JW', 'Lipsick JS', 'Sturgill TW', 'Bender TP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Aug;8(8):2259-65.,,['CA 40042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fli-1 gene was found to be rearranged in 75% of the erythroleukemias induced by Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV), suggesting that it could play a key role in cellular transformation. We have previously isolated and characterized the human Fli-1 gene and have found it to be highly homologous (80%) to the human erg-2 gene. Human Fli-1 was also shown to be rearranged in Ewing's sarcoma cases, in which the amino-terminal region of the Fli-1 gene was replaced with a novel coding region of a putative RNA-binding protein, EWS. In this report, we show that the recombinant Fli-1 protein expressed in bacteria binds to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. It appears that Fli-1 and erg proteins fall into the category of ets proteins that recognize limited ets target sequences, unlike c-ets-1, ets-2 and Elk-1. The Fli-1 gene was found to activate the transcription of the reporter gene that was linked to Fli-1 target sequences, suggesting that Fli-1 is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. Deletion analysis revealed the presence of two autonomous transcriptional activation domains, one at the amino-terminal region (amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain, ATA) and the other at the carboxy-terminal region (carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain, CTA). Secondary structural analysis of ATA and CTA domains revealed the presence of helix-loop-helix (H-L-H) and/or turn-loop-turn (T-L-T) regions. From these results it appears that a portion of the Fli-1 ATA domain (H-L-H region) was replaced by the amino-terminal domain of EWS gene in Ewing's sarcoma cases. Therefore alteration in the transcriptional activation function of Fli-1 may be responsible for human malignancies such as sarcomas, leukemias and lymphomas in which this gene is rearranged.","['Rao, V N', 'Ohno, T', 'Prasad, D D', 'Bhattacharya, G', 'Reddy, E S']","['Rao VN', 'Ohno T', 'Prasad DD', 'Bhattacharya G', 'Reddy ES']","['Jefferson Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Aug;8(8):2167-73.,,"['CA 51083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Fli-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The downmodulation of c-myc in differentiating cells is due to at least two different mechanisms: (i) an elongation block to c-myc transcription activated during an early phase of differentiation and (ii) an inhibition of transcription initiation activated during a later phase. In order to determine cis-acting target structures of the c-myc gene required for the late-phase downregulation of transcriptional initiation, we permanently transfected U937 cells with constructs containing the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene driven by a 2.8 kb c-myc promoter region or deletions thereof. We determined two distinct domains in the c-myc promoter region both of which are essential for efficient terminal downregulation: a proximal domain and a distal domain which are located between base pairs -606 to -101, and between -2392 to -1396, respectively, relative to P1. The identification of two distinct regulatory elements suggests the requirement and cooperation of two regulatory factors as an essential event for mediating differentiation-induced downregulation of c-myc in monocytic cells. The implications of these results for deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt's lymphoma are discussed.","['Skerka, C', 'Zipfel, P F', 'Siebenlist, U']","['Skerka C', 'Zipfel PF', 'Siebenlist U']","['Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Aug;8(8):2135-43.,,,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minisatellites are unstable repetitive sequences of DNA that are present throughout the human genome. The highly polymorphic HRAS1 minisatellite locus just downstream from the protooncogene H-ras-1 consists of four common progenitor alleles and several dozen rare alleles, which apparently derive from mutations of the progenitors. We previously observed an association of the rare mutant alleles with many forms of cancer, and we undertook the present study to pursue this observation further. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study, typing 736 HRAS1 alleles from patients with cancer and 652 from controls by Southern blotting of leukocyte DNA. We also carried out a meta-analysis of this study and 22 other published studies, estimating the relative risk of cancer (such as bladder, breast, or colorectal cancer) when one of the rare HRAS1 alleles was present. RESULTS: Both the present case-control study (odds ratio, 1.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.67; P = 0.002) and the present study combined with our previous study (odds ratio, 2.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.47 to 2.92; P < 0.001), as well as the meta-analysis of all 23 studies (odds ratio, 1.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.63 to 2.30; chi-square = 57.58; P < 0.001), replicated our original finding and demonstrated a significant association of rare HRAS1 alleles with cancer. We found significant associations for four types of cancer: carcinomas of the breast, colorectum, and urinary bladder and acute leukemia. We also identified suggestive but not statistically significant associations for cancers of the lung and prostate and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Mutant alleles of the HRAS1 minisatellite locus represent a major risk factor for common types of cancer. Although the relative risk associated with the presence of one rare allele is moderate, the aggregate prevalence of one rare allele is moderate, the aggregate prevalence of this class of mutant alleles implies an extremely important attributable risk: 1 in 11 cancers of the breast, colorectum, and bladder.","['Krontiris, T G', 'Devlin, B', 'Karp, D D', 'Robert, N J', 'Risch, N']","['Krontiris TG', 'Devlin B', 'Karp DD', 'Robert NJ', 'Risch N']","['Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Bias', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, ras', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/08/19 00:00,1993/08/19 00:01,['1993/08/19 00:00'],"['1993/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199308193290801 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Aug 19;329(8):517-23. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199308193290801.,,['CA-45052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['N Engl J Med. 1993 Aug 19;329(8):571-2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine patients were entered between June 1984 and October 1986. Eligibility included a performance status of 0 to 2 by CALGB criteria, and no prior chemotherapy. Central pathology review was performed. Randomization was stratified according to the cell type (epithelial v mixed or sarcomatous) and the presence of measurable versus assessable disease. Of the 79 patients entered, 70 were included in this analysis (35 on CM and 35 on CD), including 48 with epithelial cell type and 22 with mixed or sarcomatous cell types. Sixty-six patients had pleural mesothelioma and four had peritoneal mesothelioma. There were 34 cases with measurable disease and 36 with assessable disease. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 26% for CM (two complete responses [CRs], three partial responses [PRs], and four regressions) and 14% for CD (four PRs and one regression). Median time to treatment failure was 3.6 months for CM and 4.8 months for CD, and median survival duration from study entry was 7.7 and 8.8 months, respectively, with no significant differences between treatments. Good performance status (0 or 1) was associated with significantly longer survival duration (P = .013). Both regimens were well tolerated and there were no treatment-related deaths due to toxicity. CONCLUSION: Moderate antitumor activity has been observed with both regimens. In this randomized phase II trial, the overall response rates, time to treatment failure, and overall survival appear to be similar for the two regimens tested.","['Chahinian, A P', 'Antman, K', 'Goutsou, M', 'Corson, J M', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Modeas, C', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Aisner, J', 'Ellison, R R', 'Leone, L']","['Chahinian AP', 'Antman K', 'Goutsou M', 'Corson JM', 'Suzuki Y', 'Modeas C', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Aisner J', 'Ellison RR', 'Leone L', 'et al.']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitomycins/administration & dosage', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Pleural Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.8.1559 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Aug;11(8):1559-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.8.1559.,,"['CA-11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1988 and October 1989, 142 patients were eligible for study. All patients entered received a timing-intensive five-drug induction of dexamethasone, cytarabine (Ara-C), thioguanine, etoposide, and daunorubicin (DCTER) over 4 days with a second cycle administered after 6 days of rest, irrespective of hematologic status at that time. Most patients subsequently received a second two-cycle induction course. Those who achieved remission were eligible for bone marrow ablative therapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, followed by 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (4-HC)-purged autologous or allogeneic BMT rescue. RESULTS: One hundred eight (76%) patients achieved remission: 19 (13%) died of complications of the leukemia and/or chemotherapy, and 15 (11%) failed to achieve remission. Seventy-four patients subsequently underwent BMT with either autologous (n = 58) or allogeneic (n = 16) rescue. For patients who received autologous rescue with 4-HC-purged grafts, the actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 3 years from the day of transplant is 51%, compared with 55% for patients who received allogeneic grafts (P = .92). At 3 years, the overall actuarial survival rate for all 142 patients entered on this study is 45%, with an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 37%. Adverse prognostic factors for outcome included an elevated WBC count or the presence of CNS leukemia at the time of AML diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that aggressively timed induction therapy followed by marrow ablation and BMT rescue with either autologous or allogeneic grafts for children with newly diagnosed AML or MDS is both feasible and effective.","['Woods, W G', 'Kobrinsky, N', 'Buckley, J', 'Neudorf, S', 'Sanders, J', 'Miller, L', 'Barnard, D', 'Benjamin, D', 'DeSwarte, J', 'Kalousek, D']","['Woods WG', 'Kobrinsky N', 'Buckley J', 'Neudorf S', 'Sanders J', 'Miller L', 'Barnard D', 'Benjamin D', 'DeSwarte J', 'Kalousek D', 'et al.']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Minnesota Hospitals, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.8.1448 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Aug;11(8):1448-57. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.8.1448.,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1993 Aug;11(8):1439-40.

We investigated the effect of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on the differentiated cells and on the intracellular growth of the bacteria. An examination of morphological and antigenic changes in the cells was also included in the study. After 4-day incubation with 10(-6)M D3 or A, the HL-60 cells differentiated into monocyte-like (D3-HL-60) or mature granulocyte-like (A-HL-60) cells, respectively. They were then infected with L. pneumophila. Intracellular multiplication of the bacteria was evident in D3-HL-60 cells but not in HL-60 or A-HL-60 cells. D3-HL-60 cells required a 24-h infection time for the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. D3-HL-60 cells activated with human recombinant IFN-gamma for 1-24 h (gamma-IFN-D3-HL-60 cells) before infection markedly inhibited L. pneumophila multiplication, the effect of IFN-gamma being dose dependent. Surface marker analysis was carried out in HL-60, D3-HL-60, and gamma-IFN-D3-HL-60 cells. On D3-HL-60 cells, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and CD35 antigen increased, whereas CD71 and HLA-DR antigen decreased. This finding suggested that HL-60 cells differentiated into monocyte-like cells; the acquisition of the complement receptors, CD11b(CR3) and CD35(CR1), seemed to be important for phagocytosis and for the subsequent intracellular multiplication of L. pneumophila. The gamma-IFN-D3-HL-60 cells showed an increase of CD16, CD36, CD71, and HLA-DR antigen, suggesting that they were in an activated state. Our study indicated, first, that D3 can induce human leukemic cells to differentiate into functional monocyte-macrophage-like cells that can support the intracellular multiplication of L. pneumophila and, second, that these differentiated leukemic cells can be activated by IFN-gamma to markedly inhibit bacterial growth.","['Watanabe, M', 'Shimamoto, Y', 'Yoshida, S', 'Suga, K', 'Mizuguchi, Y', 'Kohashi, O', 'Yamaguchi, M']","['Watanabe M', 'Shimamoto Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Suga K', 'Mizuguchi Y', 'Kohashi O', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Microbiology, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial/analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/microbiology', 'Legionella pneumophila/drug effects/*growth & development/immunology', ""Legionnaires' Disease/drug therapy/pathology"", 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.54.1.40 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1993 Jul;54(1):40-6. doi: 10.1002/jlb.54.1.40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soluble CR1 was measured with a specific ELISA assay in normal individuals and in patients with different diseases. The mean serum concentration of sCR1 in 31 normal donors was 31.4 +/- 7.8 ng/ml, and was identical in plasma. An increase in sCR1 was observed in 36 patients with end-stage renal failure on dialysis (54.8 +/- 11.7 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), and in 22 patients with liver cirrhosis (158.3 +/- 49.9 ng/ml, p < 0.0001). The mean sCR1 levels dropped from 181 +/- 62.7 to 52.1 +/- 24.0 ng/ml (p < 0.001) in nine patients who underwent liver transplantation, and was 33.5 +/- 7.3 in 10 patients with functioning renal grafts, indicating that the increase in sCR1 was reversible. Soluble CR1 was elevated in some hematologic malignancies (> 47 ng/ml), which included B cell lymphoma (12/19 patients), Hodgkin's lymphoma (4/4), and chronic myeloproliferative syndromes (4/5). By contrast, no increase was observed in acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia (10) or myeloma (5). In two patients with chronic myeloproliferative syndromes, sCR1 decreased rapidly after chemotherapy. The mean concentration of sCR1 was not significantly modified in 181 HIV-infected patients at various stages of the disease (34.8 +/- 14.4 ng/ml), and in 13 patients with active SLE (38.3 +/- 19.6 ng/ml), although in both groups the number of CR1 was diminished on E. There was a weak but significant correlation between sCR1 and CR1 per E in HIV infection and SLE (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001, and r = 0.60, p < 0.03 respectively). In vitro, monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils were found to release sCR1 into culture supernatants. In vivo, sCR1 was detected in the serum of SCID mice populated with human peripheral blood leukocytes. The sCR1 levels correlated with those of human IgG (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001), suggesting synthesis of sCR1 by the transferred lymphocytes.

A complete blood cell count demonstrated a white cell count of 9100 cells/microliter with 61% polymorphonuclear neutrophils, 16% eosinophils, and 17% lymphocytes. A serum protein electrophoresis revealed an M spike identified as IgG kappa. His IgE level was 11,900 IU/ml. A bone marrow biopsy specimen demonstrated ""atypical plasma cells"" but was not diagnostic for myeloma. Peripheral blood smear was remarkable for highly convoluted lymphoid cells diagnostic for Sezary T cells. Consistent with this diagnosis, 89% of his peripheral blood CD2+ cells expressed CD4. The eosinophilia, elevated IgE level, and monoclonal gammopathy led to further investigations. Circulating adherent monocytes were 96% positive for presumed low-affinity IgE receptor expression as shown by surface IgE binding.

In situ hybridization with an Sulfur-35-labeled cDNA probe revealed interleukin-4 mRNA expression by 84% and interleukin-2 mRNA expression by 62% of nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interleukin-5 mRNA was shown by reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction.

The interaction of LIF with ECM-localized binding sites is not dependent upon either glycosylation of LIF or the presence of extracellular glycosyaminoglycans. Chemical cross-linking studies demonstrate that LIF interacts with a 200-kD cell-associated protein and a 140-kD ECM-localized protein. A 140-kD protein could also be specifically precipitated from solubilised metabolically radiolabeled UMR ECM by antibodies directed against LIF by virtue of its ability to form a stable complex with unlabeled LIF. In addition, soluble LIF associated with this ECM-localized protein is biologically active in terms of inhibition of ES cell differentiation. The properties of ECM-localized 140-kD species are very similar to those of the secreted form of the LIF receptor suggesting that the ECM localization of LIF and LIF signal transduction may be closely coupled.","['Mereau, A', 'Grey, L', 'Piquet-Pellorce, C', 'Heath, J K']","['Mereau A', 'Grey L', 'Piquet-Pellorce C', 'Heath JK']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/physiology', 'Rats', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.122.3.713 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1993 Aug;122(3):713-9. doi: 10.1083/jcb.122.3.713.,,,,PMC2119673,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that the t(8;21) breakpoints on chromosome 21 cluster within a single specific intron of the AML1 gene, which is highly homologous to the Drosophila segmentation gene runt. Here we report that this translocation juxtaposes the AML1 gene with a novel gene, named MTG8, on chromosome 8, resulting in the synthesis of an AML1-MTG8 fusion transcript. The fusion protein predicted by the AML1-MTG8 transcript consists of the runt homology region of AML1 and the most part of MTG8, which contains putative zinc finger DNA binding motifs and proline-rich regions constituting a characteristic feature of transcription factors. The MTG8 gene is not expressed in normal hematopoietic cells, whereas AML1 is expressed at high levels.

We have isolated cDNA and genomic clones encoding murine c-mpl and localized the c-mpl gene to mouse chromosome 4. Since some members of this superfamily function by transducing a proliferative signal and since the putative ligand of mpl is unknown, we have generated a chimeric receptor to test the functional potential of mpl. The chimera consists of the extracellular domain of the human interleukin-4 receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of mpl. A mouse hematopoietic cell line transfected with this construct proliferates in response to human interleukin-4, thereby demonstrating that the cytoplasmic domain of mpl contains all elements necessary to transmit a growth stimulatory signal. In addition, we show that 25-40% of mpl mRNA found in the spleen corresponds to a novel truncated and potentially soluble isoform of mpl and that both full-length and truncated forms of mpl protein can be immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected COS cells. Interestingly, however, although the truncated form of the receptor possesses a functional signal sequence and lacks a transmembrane domain, it is not detected in the culture media of transfected cells.","['Skoda, R C', 'Seldin, D C', 'Chiang, M K', 'Peichel, C L', 'Vogt, T F', 'Leder, P']","['Skoda RC', 'Seldin DC', 'Chiang MK', 'Peichel CL', 'Vogt TF', 'Leder P']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', '*Signal Transduction']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Jul;12(7):2645-53.,,['5K08HL02686-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC413511,['c-mpl'],,,"['GENBANK/Z22649', 'GENBANK/Z22657']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report from the Childrens Cancer Group.,917-22,"BACKGROUND: Carboplatin is an analogue of cisplatin with less nonhematologic toxicity and a similar spectrum of antineoplastic activity as the parent compound. Although cisplatin has not been found to be an active agent in leukemia, carboplatin induced complete remissions in adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Therefore, a pediatric Phase I study in acute leukemia was performed. METHODS: Between January 1988 and April 1990, the Childrens Cancer Group performed a Phase I study of carboplatin administered by a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion to children with acute leukemia in bone marrow relapse. RESULTS: Mild to moderate glomerular and tubular nephrotoxicity was seen in most patients treated at the initial dose level of 336 mg/m2/day. Therefore, patients at the second dose level were treated at 270 mg/m2/day. At this level, one patient died of acute hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy, and a second patient had presumed hemorrhagic cystitis develop. The third dose level tested, 216 mg/m2/day, was not associated with unacceptable toxic effects and was considered the maximum tolerated dose (dose-limiting toxicity was not observed). Within the confines of this Phase I study, antileukemic activity was shown in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and AML. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric Phase I trial of carboplatin in acute leukemia, glomerular and tubular nephrotoxicity was considered dose-limiting. In addition, hepatotoxicity and hemorrhagic cystitis were observed. Antileukemic activity was shown in patients with ALL and AML. The recommended Phase II dose is 216 mg/m2/day by 5-day continuous intravenous infusion.","['Ettinger, L J', 'Krailo, M D', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Hammond, G D']","['Ettinger LJ', 'Krailo MD', 'Gaynon PS', 'Hammond GD']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Male', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3<917::aid-cncr2820720342>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Aug 1;72(3):917-22. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3<917::aid-cncr2820720342>3.0.co;2-q.,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 05436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors have studied, by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical examination, the expression of several CAM, mediating cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions, on B-zone small lymphocytic lymphoma (BZSLL) and other B-cell low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including intermediate lymphocytic/mantle zone lymphoma (ILL/MZL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). RESULTS: Relevant differences in the ""adhesion phenotype"" of BZSLL compared with other low-grade NHL examined were evidenced. Cells from BZSLL displayed a higher rate of expression and/or a stronger intensity of LFA-1, LFA-3, ICAM-1, and BL-CAM and a lower density of H-CAM and LAM-1 homing receptors, as opposed to SLL or CLL. A lower intensity of H-CAM along with a stronger expression of LFA-1, LFA-3, ICAM-1, and BL-CAM were also detected by comparing BZSLL with ILL/MZL: Malignant cells from BZSLL expressed Leu-CAMb determinants in three cases. BZSLL cells lacked VLA-alpha 5-integrins as opposed to CLL lymphocytes and displayed a stronger reactivity with anti-VLA-alpha 4 antibodies with respect to ILL/MZL and CLL. beta 1-integrins were consistently detected on BZSLL lymphocytes as opposed to ILL/MZL: CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the adhesion phenotype of BZSLL, by favoring homotypic and heterotypic adhesive interactions of tumor cells, might account at least in part for the peculiar intranodal compartmentalization leading to a deceptively benign (reactive) histologic appearance, and for the smoldering clinical course of this lymphoma. The pattern of CAM expression detected by the authors on malignant lymphocytes also is suggestive for a cellular origin of BZSLL from a rare subset of interfollicular or external mantle B-lymphocytes.","['Pinto, A', 'Carbone, A', 'Gloghini, A', 'Marotta, G', 'Volpe, R', 'Zagonel, V']","['Pinto A', 'Carbone A', 'Gloghini A', 'Marotta G', 'Volpe R', 'Zagonel V']","['Leukemia Unit, Instituto Nazionale di Ricovero, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrins)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Integrins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3<894::aid-cncr2820720339>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Aug 1;72(3):894-904. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930801)72:3<894::aid-cncr2820720339>3.0.co;2-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several reports have shown that human GM-CSF can affect certain T lymphocyte in vitro cytotoxic functions. To assess whether recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) has a more broadly based activity in the immune system, we studied its in vivo effects on endogenously-generated killer function in patients undergoing ABMT for hematologic malignancies. Eleven patients received rhGM-CSF after ABMT: eight received rhGM-CSF as a 2-h infusion daily from days +3 to +17 and three received rhGM-CSF until reaching > 500 x 10(6)/l granulocytes. Eight patients not enrolled in the rhGM-CSF therapy protocol served as controls. Natural killer (NK) cell activity and activated killer (AK) cell activity were studied before conditioning, during rhGM-CSF therapy and after withdrawal of GM-CSF. rhGM-CSF therapy does not affect NK activity. Circulating lymphocytes with the ability to kill AK-sensitive targets appear spontaneously in control ABMT patients.

Thirteen patients also received methylprednisolone (MP) before BMT to enhance immunosuppression. Differences in immunosuppression between the TBI with or without TLI or MP regimens and the influence of different levels of graft T cell depletion were measured in terms of transplant rejection, and complete versus mixed chimerism. The treatment-related complications were evaluated in terms of GVHD and incidence of pneumonitis. The overall transplant rejection rate was 6% (3 of 49). Complete chimerism was not significantly modified by increasing the TBI dose or by additional TLI (p > 0.10) but was more often seen in patients receiving MP given as pre-transplant immunosuppressor booster (p = 0.01). The incidence of GVHD was only influenced by the level of T cell depletion (p = 0.003). All 49 patients received a TBI lung dose in the range 9.5-10 Gy. A crude pneumonitis range of 19% (9 of 47 evaluable patients) was found.

A lethal dose 95 (LD95) was calculated from the dose-response curve. Despite standardized treatment conditions of marrow buffy-coat cells, LD95 values that were normally distributed (median 100 micrograms/ml; mean +/- SEM 95.6 +/- 4.0 micrograms/ml) varied considerably from patient to patient (range 30-160 micrograms/ml). Three independent factors appeared to confer greater sensitivity of CFU-GM: low patient age, low CFU-GM rate in treated cells and prolonged delay of CFU-GM sensitivity test from last chemotherapy course. In contrast, sex, pathology, disease status, number of previous chemotherapies and use of CY before the test did not influence CFU-GM sensitivity. Forty-six patients were autografted with mafosfamide-treated marrows according to their LD95. The mean percentage of CFU-GM effectively recovered after graft purging was 3.96 +/- 2.09%. All patients engrafted well and their peripheral blood cell recoveries were correlated with graft CFU-GM content evaluated before purging but not after purging or after freezing. In multivariate analysis, this parameter remained the only factor predicting hematopoietic recovery among other patient variables such as sex, age, pathology, disease status, previous chemotherapies or TBI in conditioning regimens. In a subgroup of 39 patients with lymphoid malignancies compared with 25 patients autografted for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with unpurged marrows, the delay in days (medians) was similar for leukocytes > 1 x 10(9)/l (19 vs 17 days) and for neutrophils > 0.5 x 10(9)/l (18 vs 17 days) while it was longer for platelets > 50 x 10(9)/l (34 vs 128 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Domenech, J', 'Desbois, I', 'Linassier, C', 'Gihana, E', 'Chenault, S', 'Bremond, J L', 'Colombat, P', 'Lamagnere, J P', 'Binet, C']","['Domenech J', 'Desbois I', 'Linassier C', 'Gihana E', 'Chenault S', 'Bremond JL', 'Colombat P', 'Lamagnere JP', 'Binet C']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Bretonneau, Tours, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Jun;11(6):425-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cellular sources for soluble cytokine receptors are not well characterized and the regulation of soluble receptor production is not clear. We recently found that interleukin 6 (IL-6) induces the expression of membrane-bound interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptors (mIL-4R) in the murine myeloid leukemia M1 cell line. In the present study we show that IL-6 induces the expression and secretion of the soluble form of the IL-4 receptor (sIL-4R) in these cells as well, with the protein accumulating for up to 72 hours in the cell supernatants. This inducible production of sIL-4R protein is accompanied by the induction of mRNA specific for sIL-4R. In mature bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages sIL-4R expression can be induced by exposure to either IL-6 or interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). The data suggest that myeloid cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli are one possible source for sIL-4R enabling them to modulate the effects of IL-4 on the immune response by the regulated production of the soluble receptor for this cytokine.","['Ruhl, S', 'Pluznik, D H', 'Feldman, G M']","['Ruhl S', 'Pluznik DH', 'Feldman GM']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(93)90053-8 [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(93)90053-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1993 Mar;5(2):144-9. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(93)90053-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within 1 month after the diagnosis, monocytosis and thrombocytopenia without excess of blasts became prominent and transformation from RA to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was recognized. Combination chemotherapy including daunorubicin (DNR) and cytosine arabinoside (ara-c) did not subdue the progressive monocytosis and thrombocytopenia.

Although p93c-fes contains two autophosphorylation sites, it is not known what role they play in its catalytic or biological activities. To address this question, the major autophosphorylation site at tyrosine 713 was mutated to phenylalanine (YF713), and the mutated cDNA was expressed in a baculovirus system to assess catalytic activity, as well as in an inducible retrovirus to determine its biological activity. The major phosphopeptide in p93c-fes in vitro contained Y713 and was absent in the YF713 mutant, which exhibited an 85% loss of autophosphorylation activity. The catalytic activity of p93c-fesYF713 with either RCM-lysozyme or poly(Glu,Tyr)4:1 as substrate was reduced by 85 and 78%, respectively, in comparison to p93c-fes. Retroviral infection of K562 cells with the c-fes cDNA under the control of the mouse metallothionein promoter increased superoxide formation, phagocytosis, CD13 and CD33 antigen expression, and doubling time 4-6 days after induction. Cells infected with c-fesYF713 exhibited 40% less superoxide formation but similar levels of phagocytosis, CD13/CD33 antigen, and doubling time in comparison to cells infected with c-fes. The level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins did not markedly differ between K562 cells expressing either neo, c-fes, or c-fesYF713, with the exception of a reduction in the level of a 210-kDa protein specifically in both c-fes-expressing cell lines. The p210 was tentatively identified as bcr-abl, whose level was also reduced in cells expressing c-fes or c-fesYF713.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fang, F', 'Ahmad, S', 'Lei, J', 'Klecker, R W', 'Trepel, J B', 'Smithgall, T E', 'Glazer, R I']","['Fang F', 'Ahmad S', 'Lei J', 'Klecker RW', 'Trepel JB', 'Smithgall TE', 'Glazer RI']","['Department of Pharmacology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moths', '*Mutation', 'Phagocytosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/genetics/*metabolism']",1993/07/13 00:00,1993/07/13 00:01,['1993/07/13 00:00'],"['1993/07/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/13 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00078a026 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Jul 13;32(27):6995-7001. doi: 10.1021/bi00078a026.,,['1 RO1CA54231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['c-fes', 'neo']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytes with 1.3% dimethylsulfoxide or 1 microM cis or trans retinoic acid, no significant changes in PCP mRNA levels were observed. In contrast, cells cultured in the presence of the phorbol ester TPA, which promotes the cells to be differentiated into monocytes/macrophages, were associated with a marked decrease in the steady-state concentration of PCP mRNA. When cells were simultaneously treated with a combination of TPA and staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, the TPA-elicited decrease in PCP mRNA was partially prevented.

Detection of measles virus antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions or intrathecal synthesis of specific antibody was not possible in all instances. Early diagnosis by direct detection of viral antigen in the brain was confounded by difficulties in identifying areas of the brain suitable for biopsy. Increasing herd immunity to measles in the general population by vaccination is the only effective intervention against measles encephalitis in immunosuppressed children. Measles encephalitis must be remembered as a possible explanation of encephalopathy in the immunocompromised child: the benefits of early use of antiviral agents need to be evaluated.","['Hughes, I', 'Jenney, M E', 'Newton, R W', 'Morris, D J', 'Klapper, P E']","['Hughes I', 'Jenney ME', 'Newton RW', 'Morris DJ', 'Klapper PE']","[""Department of Neurology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Brain/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Encephalitis/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Measles/*etiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Time Factors']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.68.6.775 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1993 Jun;68(6):775-8. doi: 10.1136/adc.68.6.775.,,,,PMC1029373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Age was significantly associated with lag time, older children presenting later. In the diagnostic groups, mean lag time ranged from 2.8 weeks in nephroblastoma to 13.3 weeks for brain tumours. Diagnostic group was predictive for lag time after adjustment for age, with for example, a significantly longer lag time for those with brain tumours. However lag time was not predictive of event free survival and it is likely that lag time has other major determinants.

Mortality was exacerbated by murine retrovirus infection alone and exacerbated with concomitant chronic alcohol feeding (42.8 and 69.4%). Chronic ethanol ingestion decreased production of interferon-gamma and soluble interleukin-2 receptor released in supernatants of splenocytes when stimulated with concanavalin A, compared with the control group. Decreased production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 receptor was further exacerbated due to retrovirus infection. Tumor necrosis factor production by splenocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, however, was significantly increased because of retrovirus infection.

Correlation with eradication of residual disease.,31-7,"IL-2 has been used after autologous BMT (ABMT) with the aim of inducing graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. Our studies in mice have shown that IL-2 therapy induces GVL effect when employed after BMT with bone marrow (BM) that has been activated with IL-2 in vitro (ABM). The present study was carried out to define the time of optimal GVL effect after BMT so that the immunomodulatory approaches could be concentrated at the time of maximum GVL effect. Our data show that GVL effect was induced if IL-2 was instituted immediately after BMT with ABM in mice with acute myeloid leukemia; institution of IL-2 1 week after BMT with ABM did not induce GVL effect. IL-2 therapy instituted immediately or 1 week after BMT with fresh bone marrow (FBM) did not induce any GVL effect. A significant increase in the NK activity was noticed whether IL-2 was instituted immediately or 1 week after BMT, either with FBM or with ABM. To evaluate the ability of IL-2 in the eradication of residual disease from the autograft and the host, BM with variable infiltration with leukemia was activated with IL-2 and used for BMT in leukemic mice. The GVL effect of BM with minimal leukemic infiltration (absence of morphologically demonstrable disease) was comparable to the GVL effect of normal BM. These findings suggest that: (a) maximum GVL effect after BMT with ABM is concentrated in the early post-transplant period possibly because of minimal residual disease during this time; (b) an increase in the NK activity induced by IL-2 therapy may not predict for an improved GVL effect; and (c) for optimum GVL effect, BM with minimal leukemic infiltration should be activated with IL-2 before BMT.","['Charak, B S', 'Brynes, R K', 'Chogyoji, M', 'Kortes, V', 'Tefft, M', 'Mazumder, A']","['Charak BS', 'Brynes RK', 'Chogyoji M', 'Kortes V', 'Tefft M', 'Mazumder A']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199307000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1993 Jul;56(1):31-7. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199307000-00006.,,"['1P30 CA 51008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 01222/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pilot studies established that marrow transplantation between phenotypically HLA-identical, unrelated individuals can be accomplished successfully. Therefore, the National Marrow Donor Program was established to develop a large file of volunteer marrow donors and to serve as a center for the coordination of the donor search and donor-recipient matching processes. By November 1991, 63 months after the program was established, 457,205 potential marrow donors typed for HLA-A and -B antigens had agreed to be listed in the marrow donor registry. A donor search had been initiated for 8481 patients. At least one potential donor matched for at least three of the four HLA-A and -B antigens was located for 99.8 percent of patients. Among the 3156 searches that were completed, 940 (29.8%) resulted in a transplant. The median time in which to locate a matched donor, complete all predonation evaluations, and obtain donor consent was 208 days. The most common diagnosis in patients who underwent transplantation was chronic myelogenous leukemia (42.0%). When this analysis was completed in November 1991, the National Marrow Donor Program was operating a national network of 99 donor centers and 53 transplant centers. The donor file was increasing rapidly, and a follow-up system was in place to determine the effects of donation on the donors and the outcome in the patients who underwent transplantation. This national network of donor and transplant centers exists and is now facilitating unrelated-donor marrow transplants. The National Marrow Donor Program made it possible to locate donors for many patients in need of a transplant and helped to determine the role of unrelated-donor marrow transplants in the treatment of many diseases.","['Stroncek, D', 'Bartsch, G', 'Perkins, H A', 'Randall, B L', 'Hansen, J A', 'McCullough, J']","['Stroncek D', 'Bartsch G', 'Perkins HA', 'Randall BL', 'Hansen JA', 'McCullough J']","['American Red Cross Blood Services, St. Paul, MN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Donors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'HLA-A Antigens/analysis/blood/genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens/analysis/blood/genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis/blood/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'National Health Programs/*organization & administration', 'Phenotype', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Racial Groups', '*Registries', '*Tissue Donors', 'United States']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1993.33793325052.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1993 Jul;33(7):567-77. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1993.33793325052.x.,,['N01-HB-97075/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear run-on transcription experiments indicate that the accumulation and decay of these mRNAs are controlled at the post-transcriptional level.

In the present study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is shown to be a method of choice for detection of trisomy 12 in interphase cells. Seventy-five cases of B-cell CLL were analysed with a chromosome 12 specific alpha satellite DNA probe and results compared with those from cytogenetic analysis. FISH showed the three hybridization spots characteristic of trisomy 12 in 32/75 patients (42.6%). Sixty-three patients were also studied by conventional cytogenetics: failure in 7 cases, normal karyotype in 28, trisomy 12 in 9 (14.3%) and in 19 cases abnormalities other than trisomy 12. In these same 63 patients, trisomy 12 was detected on 29 occasions by FISH (46%): in one case of failure by cytogenetic analysis, in 9 cases thought to have a normal karyotype, in 10 cases carrying abnormalities other than trisomy 12 and in all 9 cases showing trisomy 12 by conventional cytogenetic investigation. Correlation between trisomy 12 and the three stages of the Binet classification indicated an increasing proportion of trisomy 12 from stage A to stage C. It is concluded that fluorescence in situ hybridization is a powerful and sensitive technique for detection of trisomy 12 in CLL and although more cases will be required to confirm a correlation between the incidence of trisomy 12 and the stage of the disease, this link could be important from a prognostic point of view.","['Coignet, L', 'Bertheas, M F', 'Vasselon, C', 'Jaubert, J', 'Reynaud, J', 'Calmard-Oriol, P', 'Brizard, C P', 'Guyotat, D']","['Coignet L', 'Bertheas MF', 'Vasselon C', 'Jaubert J', 'Reynaud J', 'Calmard-Oriol P', 'Brizard CP', 'Guyotat D']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Nord, Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Trisomy']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1993 Apr;35(2):129-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vif was found to be essential for the spread of HIV-1 in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in primary macrophages, as well as in some but not all established T-cell lines. Vif was required at the stage of viral particle formation, for cell-to-cell as well as for cell-free transmission of HIV-1. Accordingly, vif-defective viruses could be complemented by the expression of vif in the producer but not in the target cell. vif-defective virions contained wild-type amounts of Gag and Env proteins, reverse transcriptase, integrase, genomic RNA, and partial reverse transcripts. Most importantly, they could enter cells normally, and the vif defect could not be rescued through the use of HIV(MLV [murine leukemia virus]) pseudotypes. Instead, vif-mutant viruses were severely impaired in their ability to complete the synthesis of proviral DNA, once internalized in the target cell. These results suggest that Vif plays a role which is novel for a retroviral protein, in allowing the processing and/or the transport of the internalized HIV core.","['von Schwedler, U', 'Song, J', 'Aiken, C', 'Trono, D']","['von Schwedler U', 'Song J', 'Aiken C', 'Trono D']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California 92037-1099.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Genes, vif', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phenotype', 'Proviruses/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.8.4945-4955.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Aug;67(8):4945-55. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.8.4945-4955.1993.,,"['AI08625/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI32349/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC237882,"['nef', 'vif', 'vpr', 'vpu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three classes of recombinant envelopes were examined: insertions, deletions, and chimeras. Insertion (4 to 5 amino acids) and deletion (31 to 62 amino acids) mutants spanned most of the SU (gp70)-coding region and were all biologically inactive. Radioimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the mutant envelope proteins were incorrectly processed. The Pr80env envelope precursor proteins failed to obtain the proper posttranslational modifications and were not cleaved into SU (gp70) and TM (p15E), suggesting that disruption of Pr80env structure prevents intracellular transport and processing. To analyze the functional domains of the SU portion of the Env protein, we assembled several chimeric constructs. In these constructs, portions of the ecotropic Mo-MuLV envelope gene were replaced with corresponding sequences from the 4070A amphotropic MuLV envelope. Using a retroviral vector pseudotyping assay, 5 of 12 chimeric envelope proteins were shown to be biologically active. Host range was determined by retroviral vector transduction of the appropriate cell, by viral interference studies, and by the productive infection of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the murine ecotropic receptor. These results permit assignment of the amino acids responsible for host range determination. Ecotropic host range is determined by the first 88 amino acids of the Mo-MuLV SU, while the amphotropic host range-determining region spans the first 157 amino acids of the 4070A SU.","['Morgan, R A', 'Nussbaum, O', 'Muenchau, D D', 'Shu, L', 'Couture, L', 'Anderson, W F']","['Morgan RA', 'Nussbaum O', 'Muenchau DD', 'Shu L', 'Couture L', 'Anderson WF']","['Molecular Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Genes, env', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.8.4712-4721.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Aug;67(8):4712-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.8.4712-4721.1993.,,,,PMC237857,['env'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XXV: Role of N-nitrosated amadori compounds derived from glucose-amino acid conjugates in cancer promotion or inhibition.,649-56,"Earlier investigators found that some N-nitrosated Amadori compounds, derived from glucose and amino acid condensation reactions, exhibit mutagenic properties and theorized that these potentially carcinogenic compounds might be formed in the human digestive system.

Acute toxicity tests of 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, and 5f in male Swiss mice produced the following lowest lethal limits of toxicity: 2000, 2000, 4000, 3000, 2000, and 6000 mg/kg, respectively, whereas the highest tolerated doses were 1750, 1500, 3000, 1500, and 5000 mg/kg, respectively. The 50% lethal dose (intraperitoneally) for 5b in mice was approximately 1777 mg/kg. This value is at least three times higher than that for the over-the-counter drug ibuprofen (i.e., 495 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, in mice).

This concept arose several decades ago on the basis of the observation that experimental manipulation of the amount of target tissue could modulate the size of neuronal populations. By making the survival of neurons dependent on their target, nature would provide a means to match neuron and target cell populations. NGF, discovered in the 1950s, represents the first known molecular realization of the neurotrophic factor concept. NGF was found to regulate survival, neurite growth, and neurotransmitter production of a particular neuronal type, the sympathetic neurons of the PNS. NGF produced by target cells is specifically bound and internalized by sympathetic neurons, followed by retrograde axonal transport of NGF to the cell soma, where NGF exerts its effects via the cotransported receptor molecule (Levi-Montalcini, 1987; Thoenen et al., 1987). Strictly speaking, increased neurite growth and neurotransmitter production are not trophic effects; however, I will use the term ""neurotrophic"" in the extended meaning of enhancing neuronal differentiation as well as neuronal survival. It was expected that these results could be generalized to a model of multiple, mutually independent, retrograde trophic messengers, which are synthesized in distinct target areas and act on restricted neuronal types (Fig. 1). This assumption leads to a conceptually simple way to arrange and maintain a variety of neuronal subsystems. One might call this a modular approach to the construction of the nervous system. The hypothesis of multiple retrograde signals has gained widespread experimental support in recent years. Originally proposed for the PNS, the model could be extended to the CNS, in which target neurons synthesize trophic factors for their afferent neurons (Ernfors et al., 1990b). In addition to NGF, a family of NGF-related molecules (now commonly called neurotrophins), which are thought to exert retrograde trophic influences (DiStefano et al., 1992), has been identified.","['Korsching, S']",['Korsching S'],"['Max-Planck-Institut fur Entwicklungsbiologie, Abteilung Physikalische Biologie, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Models, Neurological', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/physiology', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/physiology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1993 Jul;13(7):2739-48.,132,,,PMC6576699,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a well-characterized regulator of growth and function of mast cells. The human mast cell line HMC-1 was established from a patient suffering from mast cell leukemia and was shown to expose IL-4 binding sites. In the present study, the effects of recombinant human (rh) IL-4 and other rh cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8) on expression of cytokine mRNA in HMC-1 cells were examined by Northern blot analysis using oligonucleotide probes. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1 beta transcripts were found to be expressed constitutively in HMC-1 cells, whereas transcripts for IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could not be detected. Of all cytokines tested, rhIL-4 was found to down-regulate IL-1 beta mRNA expression and formation of immunoreactive IL-1 beta protein in HMC-1 cells. The effect of IL-4 on IL-1 beta gene product expression was time- and dose-dependent (maximum effects obtained with 100 U/mL of rhIL-4). No effect of IL-4 on expression of TNF-alpha mRNA in HMC-1 cells was observed. These results raise the possibility that human mast cells are a source of both TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that IL-4 regulates IL-1 beta gene product expression in HMC-1 cells.

As part of initial studies to develop a clinical protocol to exploit this phenomenon in combination with culture purging of leukemic cells, we examined a number of variables that might affect either IL-2 stimulation of natural killer (NK) cell activity or maintenance of primitive hematopoietic cells in cultures suitable for manipulating human marrow autografts. Cytotoxicity of IL-2 A-NK cells was determined using K562 and Daudi target cells in a standard 4-hour 51Cr release assay. Primitive hematopoietic cells were quantitated using both direct clonogenic progenitor assays and the long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay. The latter measures a very primitive cell type that gives rise to clonogenic cells after > 5 weeks of culture on pre-established marrow feeder layers. Light-density (< 1.070 g/cm3) human marrow cells cultured at 10(6) cells/mL for 7 days at 37 degrees C in the presence of 1000 U of either natural or recombinant human IL-2 showed a marked generation of A-NK cell function that was not seen if IL-2 was not added. The cytotoxicity was the same whether the cells had been maintained in standard fetal calf serum (FCS)-supplemented medium or in LTC medium (which also contains horse serum and 10(-6) M hydrocortisone) or whether adherence of cells during the culture period was promoted or prevented. The level of NK activity in IL-2-stimulated cultures of marrow cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission was not significantly different from that obtained with normal marrow. The initial numbers of clonogenic cells in these samples were close to normal values (60%). For both normal and AML patient samples, these declined slightly during the 7-day culture period, regardless of whether IL-2 was present. Starting values for LTC-IC in patient marrow samples were markedly reduced to approximately 7% of normal values, but as in normal cultures, did not decrease further in culture with or without IL-2. These results indicate that activation of bone marrow-derived NK cells can be obtained in 7-day cultures containing IL-2 under conditions that preserve the most primitive hematopoietic cells currently detectable.","['Klingemann, H G', 'Deal, H', 'Reid, D', 'Eaves, C J']","['Klingemann HG', 'Deal H', 'Reid D', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*immunology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Aug;21(9):1263-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we report characterization of the effects of ascorbic acid on growth of two ascorbic acid sensitive and one ascorbic acid resistant lymphocyte tumor cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of ascorbic acid on the sensitive cell lines were time and dosage dependent. Furthermore, the energy state of the ascorbic acid sensitive cells was affected by the presence of ascorbic acid before the cells became apparently non-viable, as demonstrated by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Therefore, identification of a translocation breakpoint has become a more important means by which to identify genes involved in cellular transformation. A common site of translocation in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies involves 11q23. One human protooncogene, ETS1, has been localized to this chromosomal segment, and several tumours with 11q23 translocations have been shown to have altered ETS1 DNA migration after restriction enzyme digestion. Two laboratories, however, have recently localized the 11q23 breakpoint region to a small region of DNA telomeric of the CD3 loci, a region at considerable distance from the ETS1 gene locus. Therefore, it is difficult to reconcile the studies that suggest altered migration of fragments associated with ETS1 and lack of a localization of the breakpoint to a region near the ETS1 gene. Recently, in our studies to characterize the promoter/enhancer region of the ETS1 protooncogene, we had the opportunity to analyze DNA from 18 patients with acute leukemia involving chromosome 11q23 aberrations. We were unable to demonstrate rearrangement of the ETS1 gene in this group, thus confirming that the 11q23 breakpoint does not involve ETS1 protooncogene. In one patient, however, a DNA break in the region of the ETS1 promoter was detected reproducibly. This DNA break was mapped to the major DNaseI hypersensitive site in the ETS1 promoter. Mapping from both sides of the break demonstrated that the break must have occurred during processing of the leukemic cells for DNA analysis. Therefore, artifactual DNA breaks can occur at nuclease-hypersensitive sites of active genes. These data suggest that previous reports of chromosomal translocations involving the ETS1 protooncogene may have resulted from DNA breaks at nuclease hypersensitive sites. This mechanism may account for sporadic case reports of altered restriction enzyme fragment migration involving genes that are not ultimately shown to be associated with the chromosome translocation being examined.","['Miesfeldt, S', 'Kim, S', 'Hanson, C A', 'Bohjanen, P R', 'Leiden, J M', 'Crist, W M', 'Carroll, A J', 'Thompson, C B']","['Miesfeldt S', 'Kim S', 'Hanson CA', 'Bohjanen PR', 'Leiden JM', 'Crist WM', 'Carroll AJ', 'Thompson CB']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.21.3 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type I Site-Specific)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type I Site-Specific/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(93)90071-S [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(93)90071-s [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1993 Jul 1;68(1):34-41. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(93)90071-s.,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['ETS1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these patients, the frequency of additional cytogenetic change (numerical or structural) was low, with 10 of the 43 DS patients showing no additional cytogenetic change.

The remaining AMKL patients had a median age of 30 years with much more frequent cytogenetic changes, including rearrangement of 3q21 and 3q26-27, trisomy 21, and other specific changes.

The rates of glucose and glutamine utilization were studied in HL60 cells that were either undifferentiated or fully differentiated by 9 days exposure to DMSO. Differentiation did not alter the rate of utilization of exogenous glucose, approximately 75% of which was converted to lactate in each case. The activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and citrate synthase were similarly unaffected. In contrast, the activity of the oxidative segment of the pentose-phosphate pathway was enhanced by differentiation, and no glycogen synthase activity could be detected. These observations are consistent with the significantly lower content of glycogen, the increased activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and the increased oxidation of [1-14C] glucose relative to [6-14C] glucose in the differentiated cells. Glucose utilization was depressed by exogenous glutamine but, at the same time, glutamine utilization was enhanced by glucose in both cell types; these reciprocal effects were more pronounced in the undifferentiated HL60 cells. Glucose utilization may be depressed in the presence of glutamine as a result of the allosteric inhibition of a rate-limiting step of glycolysis (eg. phosphofructokinase). In spite of having glutaminase activity twice that of their differentiated counterparts, the uptake of glutamine by undifferentiated HL60 cells was low, especially when it was the sole substrate. The stimulation of glutaminolysis by glucose may be due to activation of mitochondrial glutamine transport. A large proportion of the glutamine utilized by both cells contributed to a net accumulation of glutamate, aspartate and alanine, whilst up to 35% was oxidized to CO2. In contrast, almost all of the glucose utilized was converted to lactate and very little was oxidized. The high rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis observed before and after differentiation may not contribute primarily to energy production but may supply, in undifferentiated cells, substrates for biosynthetic processes that generate nucleic acid precursors or, in the case of differentiated cells which synthesize reactive oxygen intermediates, substrates that maintain NADP in a reduced state.","['Ahmed, N', 'Williams, J F', 'Weidemann, M J']","['Ahmed N', 'Williams JF', 'Weidemann MJ']","['Division of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, Australian National University, Canberra ACT.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'EC 1.1.1.37 (Malate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.43 (Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.3.3.1 (Citrate (si)-Synthase)', 'EC 2.4.1.11 (Glycogen Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Phosphofructokinase-1)', 'EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Glutaminase/metabolism', 'Glutamine/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase/metabolism', '*Glycolysis', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Hexokinase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Malate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', '*Pentose Phosphate Pathway', 'Phosphofructokinase-1/metabolism', 'Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Pyruvate Kinase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1993 Apr;29(6):1055-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have designed and synthesized a unique ribozyme that is directed against bcr-abl mRNA. The ribozyme cleaved bcr-abl mRNA in a cell-free in vitro system. A DNA-RNA hybrid ribozyme was then incorporated into a liposome vector and transfected into EM-2 cells, a cell line derived from a patient with blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The ribozyme decreased levels of detectable bcr-abl mRNA in these cells, inhibited expression of the bcr-abl gene product, p210bcr-abl, and inhibited cell growth.

Subsequently, clinical information about these patients was obtained and analyzed. Of 220 evaluable patients, 20 (9%) had point mutation of N-ras involving codon 12. Individuals with N-ras mutation had a significantly shorter survival period than those who were N-ras negative (P = .02). An increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was also found in patients with N-ras mutations (P = .005). N-ras mutations were not associated with any French-American-British (FAB) subtype, with the presence of increased myeloblasts, or with chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow. However, the presence of increased bone marrow blasts was strongly associated with poor survival rate and risk of AML (P < .001 for each). After stratifying for the percentage of blasts, N-ras mutations remained significantly associated with shorter survival period (P = .04) and increased risk of AML (P = .02). Bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly when multiple abnormalities were present, were significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P < .001). In conclusion, N-ras mutation, although relatively infrequent in MDS, is associated with short survival period and increased probability of developing AML.","['Paquette, R L', 'Landaw, E M', 'Pierre, R V', 'Kahan, J', 'Lubbert, M', 'Lazcano, O', 'Isaac, G', 'McCormick, F', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Paquette RL', 'Landaw EM', 'Pierre RV', 'Kahan J', 'Lubbert M', 'Lazcano O', 'Isaac G', 'McCormick F', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73093-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):590-9.,,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,['N-ras'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, an oligoclonal Ig heavy chain (IgH) rearrangement pattern has been observed in 30% of ALL patients and was shown to be the result of ongoing rearrangement events. The extent and nature of these ongoing rearrangement processes in individual patients has so far remained obscure. We performed a detailed analysis of leukemic VHDJH rearrangements in three children with B-precursor ALL at diagnosis and one B-lymphoid blast crisis of a child with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia at diagnosis and relapse. The children were selected because they presented with multiple IgH rearrangements on Southern blot analysis. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of leukemic cells from two B-precursor ALL patients showed exclusively two groups of related sequences resulting from VH gene replacement events. Most VH gene replacements involved 3' located acceptor VH genes. Analysis of cells from the other B-precursor ALL patient showed exclusively related sequences as a result of VH gene joinings to a pre-existing DJH rearrangement. In the B-lymphoid blast crisis, a single germline precursor cell had generated multiple unrelated rearrangements and additional groups of related rearrangements resulting from VH to DJH joinings. Direct proof for the VH to DJH joining mechanism was obtained by amplification of the expected preexisting DJH rearrangements. Our findings suggest that the pattern of ongoing rearrangements in an individual patient reflects the IgH rearrangement status of the precursor cell at the time of malignant transformation. Sequence analysis of VHDJH rearrangements at diagnosis may therefore allow a prediction of the reliability of complementarity determining region 3 probes for the detection of minimal residual disease.","['Steenbergen, E J', 'Verhagen, O J', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['Steenbergen EJ', 'Verhagen OJ', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Central Laboratory of The Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73092-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):581-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of this study suggest that the expression of the alpha and beta chains of the IL-2 receptor appears to be upregulated or downregulated during the process of B-cell-lineage activation and differentiation.","['de Totero, D', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Lauria, F', 'Raspadori, D', 'di Celle, P F', 'Carbone, A', 'Gobbi, M', 'Foa, R']","['de Totero D', 'Tazzari PL', 'Lauria F', 'Raspadori D', 'di Celle PF', 'Carbone A', 'Gobbi M', 'Foa R']","['Instituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis/chemistry/genetics']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73084-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):528-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the effect of Epo on proliferation and differentiation of UT-7, we maintained the UT-7 cell culture for more than 6 months in the presence of Epo. As a result, a subline, UT-7/Epo, was established. The growth of UT-7/Epo could be supported by Epo but not by GM-CSF or IL-3. UT-7/Epo showed a greater level of heme content and ratio of benzidine-positive staining cells than did UT-7. Butyric acid promoted the synthesis of hemoglobin in UT-7/Epo, but not UT-7. Further, the mRNA concentrations of the c-myb oncogene and GM-CSF receptor beta-subunit were decreased substantially in UT-7/Epo cells. These findings showed that UT-7/Epo cells had progressed further in erythroid development than UT-7 cells, and suggested that long-term culture in Epo had promoted this differentiation. Whereas availability of the Epo receptor (Epo-R) for binding of Epo was reduced in UT-7/Epo cells compared with UT-7 cells, the Epo-R showed a similar affinity for Epo. This observation suggested that change(s) in postreceptor signaling step might be involved in the establishment and maintenance of the UT-7/Epo phenotype.","['Komatsu, N', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Fujita, H', 'Miwa, A', 'Hatake, K', 'Endo, T', 'Okano, H', 'Katsube, T', 'Fukumaki, Y', 'Sassa, S']","['Komatsu N', 'Yamamoto M', 'Fujita H', 'Miwa A', 'Hatake K', 'Endo T', 'Okano H', 'Katsube T', 'Fukumaki Y', 'Sassa S', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73075-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):456-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The German CML Study Group.,398-407,"In a randomized multicenter study the influence of hydroxyurea versus busulfan on the duration of the chronic phase and on survival of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was determined. In addition cross resistance and adverse reactions of the drugs were analyzed. From July 1983 to January 1991, 441 CML patients were randomized to receive hydroxyurea or busulfan. Of these, 90.7% were Philadelphia positive; 25.7% were low, 38.2% intermediate, and 36.2% high risk patients according to Sokal's score. The median survival of the busulfan treated Philadelphia-positive patients is 45.4 months and of the hydroxyurea group 58.2 months (P = .008). The survival advantage for the hydroxyurea treated patients is recognized in all risk groups. Sixty four patients reached therapy resistance before blast crisis and were crossed over to the alternative drug. The 23 patients with primary hydroxyurea had a median survival of 5.6 years, the 41 patients with primary busulfan therapy a median survival of 2.7 years (P = .02). Adverse reactions were less frequent with hydroxyurea with no severe adverse effects (lung fibrosis, long lasting bone marrow aplasia). The analysis of white blood cell counts in the course of treatment showed lower counts in the hydroxyurea patients. We conclude that hydroxyurea is superior to busulfan in therapy of CML in chronic phase and should be used as first line therapy. Busulfan may have a role as secondary therapy after hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance.","['Hehlmann, R', 'Heimpel, H', 'Hasford, J', 'Kolb, H J', 'Pralle, H', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Queisser, W', 'Loffler, H', 'Heinze, B', 'Georgii, A']","['Hehlmann R', 'Heimpel H', 'Hasford J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Pralle H', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Queisser W', 'Loffler H', 'Heinze B', 'Georgii A', 'et al.']","['Klinikum Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Deutschland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73069-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):398-407.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such studies have also enhanced our understanding of normal lymphocyte development, permitting reproducible identification of lymphoid cells in discrete developmental stages. By elucidating the functions of lymphoid cell differentiation antigens, it has been possible to gain insight into the signal transduction mechanisms by which these cells interact among themselves and with other cell types. Similar studies have shown that ALL is an immunophenotypically heterogeneous disease with clinically important subtypes representing clonal expansions of lymphoblasts at different stages of maturation. Furthermore, successful correlation of immunophenotype with certain karyotypic and molecular abnormalities, which appear to underlie most or all leukemias, were made possible by the inclusion of immunologic marker assessment. Interestingly, many of these phenotype-related abnormalities have involved either the Ig or TCR genes, thus providing additional clues to the mechanisms of leukemogenesis. Knowledge of the immunologic features of leukemic cells has been essential for the generation of phenotype-specific response data in the context of modern therapy for ALL. With wider use of intensive treatment, the traditional prognostic distinctions among immunophenotypes have begun to disappear; however, certain classes of agents have more favorable toxicity/efficacy ratios against some immunophenotypes than others, justifying continued efforts to target therapy by immunologic species of ALL. Antibody-toxin conjugates, or immunotoxins, have induced complete responses in preliminary trials and may prove clinically useful, perhaps in combination with chemotherapy, if their toxic side effects can be controlled. Finally, immunologic markers may serve as sensitive targets for the detection of minimal residual disease; the clinical usefulness of this approach will depend on prospective comparisons with molecular methods.","['Pui, C H', 'Behm, F G', 'Crist, W M']","['Pui CH', 'Behm FG', 'Crist WM']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73063-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):343-62.,260,"['P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated whether the synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, would inhibit agonist induction of tissue factor expression in both monocytes and endothelial cells. Surprisingly, dexamethasone significantly enhanced the induction of tissue factor expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and an established monocytic cell line, THP-1, in response to lipopolysaccharide or tumour necrosis factor-alpha. However, unlike monocytic cells, dexamethasone did not enhance agonist induction of tissue factor in endothelial cells. Synergistic enhancement of tissue factor expression by dexamethasone was also reflected in tissue factor mRNA levels in THP-1 cells, but was not the result of improved TF mRNA stability. Synergism between bacterial lipopolysaccharide and glucocorticoid in the induction of monocyte effector function is extremely unusual and may help to explain the variable outcome of glucocorticoid treatment of septic shock.","['Bottles, K D', 'Morrissey, J H']","['Bottles KD', 'Morrissey JH']","['Cardiovascular Biology Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/pharmacology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001721-199306000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 1993 Jun;4(3):405-14. doi: 10.1097/00001721-199306000-00002.,,"['HL08545/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL44225/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No healthy worker effect was found for ischaemic heart disease, and raised mortality from this disease was found in particular for one company and in several job groups. Raised mortality was also found for aortic aneurysm. Mortality from all neoplasms was lower than expected overall, largely due to a deficit of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung. Raised mortality patterns from all neoplasms, malignant neoplasm of the lung, and several non-malignant disease groups were found for general manual workers although the mortality from many of these diseases for all men in this social class in the national population is also high.

There was no effect of chloroquine, monensin or cytochalasin B, which are known inhibitors of endocytosis. The inhibitory effect of lower temperature on uptake was moderate in extent and compatible with passive diffusion. There was no efflux of drug from preloaded cells which indicates intense binding of incorporated drug to cells. In human serum, edelfosine bound to several protein components, primarily high density lipoprotein and albumin, and this may explain why cellular uptake was slowed considerably by the presence of serum or albumin in the incubation medium.

The diagnosis was based on the clinical data, ultrasonography (US), vena cavography and hepatic venography, computed tomography (CT), and liver biopsy. Behcet's disease (BD) was found in 10 patients with BCS as an underlying disease. Two patients used oral contraceptive drugs, 2 had liver tumor hepatocellular carcinoma and liver lymphoma, and 1 patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Despite full investigation, the authors could not find any obvious underlying cause in the other 15 patients. The results suggest that (1) BCS must be considered as a possible complication in patients with Behcet's disease when they have hepatomegaly even if there were no cardinal manifestations of the disease at the time of admission, and BD is the most common etiologic factor in BCS (33%) in Turkey, where the incidence of Behcet's disease is relatively high. (2) Anti-aggregant treatment seems to be effective in many instances. (3) There were space-occupying lesion-like appearances in the liver of 7 cases by CT and US examination in the acute stage, and these disappeared on the follow-up CT and US in 5 patients but continued in 2. BCS should thus be differentiated from other liver lesions. (4) There were other great-vessel involvements in 43% of the cases, mostly venous, but only 1 pulmonary arterial occlusion.","['Bayraktar, Y', 'Balkanci, F', 'Kansu, E', 'Kayhan, B', 'Arslan, S', 'Eryilmaz, M', 'Telatar, H']","['Bayraktar Y', 'Balkanci F', 'Kansu E', 'Kayhan B', 'Arslan S', 'Eryilmaz M', 'Telatar H']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Angiology,Angiology,0203706,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Budd-Chiari Syndrome/diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/000331979304400706 [doi]'],ppublish,Angiology. 1993 Jul;44(7):541-51. doi: 10.1177/000331979304400706.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum thiamine level was 9 ng/ml (normal: 20-50). Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed a low density area bilaterally at the neostriatum. Thiamine 100 mg/day was administered intravenously. RESULTS: The patient's neurological signs improved dramatically. However, he subsequently developed pancytopenia and died of pneumonia.

This consists of three to five levels of function within each of seven attributes: sensation, mobility, emotion, cognition, self-care, pain, and fertility. The system was applied to survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: Overall burdens of morbidity were greater in those who had had ""high-risk"" disease than in children treated less intensively for ""standard-risk"" ALL. Deficits in emotional and cognitive status were especially common (alone and in combination). These were more prevalent in younger patients and exhibited a dose relationship to cranial irradiation.

PATIENTS, METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients were treated according to current protocols. Cranial irradiation dose was 1,800 rad in 10 fractions for 50 patients, and 2,400 rad in 18 fractions for the remaining 30. The mean percentile and SDS for height were 42.5 +/- 26 and -0.3 +/- 1.1 for boys, and 37.8 +/- 15.3 and -0.54 +/- 0.9 for girls, respectively. The final height and the corresponding SDS was 171 +/- 5.75 cm and -0.35 +/- 0.8 for boys, and 158 +/- 7.1 cm and -0.89 +/- 1.1 for girls, respectively. Using skin fold thickness, obesity was observed in a high percentage of patients. The head circumference (HC) percentile was 36.8 +/- 24 for boys and 40.9 +/- 29 for girls, and was even lower (30.96 +/- 25.5) for those who received a radiation dose of 2,400 rad. Menarche was earlier in girls with ALL than in normal girls (11.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 12.4 +/- 1.02 years). Testicular size was within normal limits, except in three boys whose size was at or below the third percentile. In two of them, testes had been irradiated. The mean thyroxin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin values were within normal limits (8.6 +/- 2 micrograms/dl, 2.6 +/- 1.1 microU/dl, and 5.9 +/- 4.8 ng/ml, respectively). The somatomedin-C values for patients in the prepubertal stage were 1.49 +/- 0.85 versus 0.96 +/- 0.6 in the controls (p < 0.05), whereas for patients in the pubertal stage they were 1.92 +/- 1 versus 1.88 +/- 1 in the controls. The sex steroid and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate values were within normal limits. In a high percentage of children, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone values were above the normal range for their age, sex, and pubertal stage. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin values were normal. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Linear growth, although impaired in the group as a whole, is within the normal range for the majority of children with ALL. A small percentage of children have significantly impaired growth, and must be identified early and receive appropriate therapy. 2. Obesity is more frequently present in patients with ALL. 3. HC is lower than expected, indicating impaired brain growth, which is worse in children irradiated with 2,400 rad. 4. Menarche is earlier and the gonadotrophin level is higher than normal, suggestive of either hypothalamic dysfunction, subtle ovarian failure, or both.","['Dacou-Voutetakis, C', 'Kitra, V', 'Grafakos, S', 'Polychronopoulou, S', 'Drakopoulou, M', 'Haidas, S']","['Dacou-Voutetakis C', 'Kitra V', 'Grafakos S', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Drakopoulou M', 'Haidas S']","['First Pediatric Department, Athens University, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)', '0 (Hormones)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', '57B09Q7FJR (Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Child', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/analysis', 'Growth Disorders/*etiology', 'Hormones/*blood', 'Humans', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*physiopathology', 'Prolactin/blood', 'Puberty', 'Skinfold Thickness', 'Testis/growth & development', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Thyrotropin/blood', 'Thyroxine/blood']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Aug;15(3):277-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No evidence of consistent chemotherapy-induced intestinal malabsorption.,271-6,"PURPOSE: The impact of chemotherapeutic agents on intestinal functional integrity was assessed in 16 consecutive children treated for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and in remission on maintenance therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measurements of height, weight, nutrient intake, fecal fat, D-xylose absorption, and lactose absorption were obtained at diagnosis and every 6 months during therapy. RESULTS: At diagnosis all children were age appropriate for height and weight. A decrease in height velocity occurred in 73% at 12 months and 29% at 24 months. A reduced weight velocity was seen in 40% at 12 months and 14% at 24 months. Nutrient intake was more than two thirds the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for energy in 70% of the children and > 100% RNI for protein in all but one child. Gastrointestinal investigations at diagnosis were normal, and no child had symptoms suggestive of malabsorption. Fecal fat excretion was abnormal in only one child, after therapy-induced pancreatitis, and returned to normal with pancreatic enzyme supplementation. D-xylose absorption became abnormal in two children at 6 months on therapy, normalized at 12 months, and remained normal on further evaluations. Intestinal lactose absorption was abnormal in four of 12 children. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that habitual nutrient intake is adequate and that there is no generalized malabsorption in children during treatment for ALL that might interfere with their overall nutritional status. However, mild to moderate alteration in intestinal functional integrity may occur transiently in some children.","['Halton, J', 'Atkinson, S A', 'Bradley, C', 'Dawson, S', 'Barr, R D']","['Halton J', 'Atkinson SA', 'Bradley C', 'Dawson S', 'Barr RD']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Fats)', 'A1TA934AKO (Xylose)', 'J2B2A4N98G (Lactose)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fats/analysis', 'Feces/chemistry', 'Female', 'Growth/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Lactose/pharmacokinetics', 'Malabsorption Syndromes/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Xylose/pharmacokinetics']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Aug;15(3):271-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collateral toxicological evidence suggests that certain causes of death are likely to be associated with firefighting: lung cancer, heart disease, and obstructive pulmonary disease. To date there has not been a clear and consistent demonstration of excess risk due to occupational exposure for these outcomes, but certain other cancers, including genitourinary, colon and rectum, and leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloma, appear to be consistently elevated. A major unproven hypothesis is that risk increased following the introduction, in the 1950s of combustible plastic furnishing and building materials known to generate toxic combustion products. Mortality by cause of death was examined for two cohorts totalling 3,328 firefighters active from 1927 to 1987 in Edmonton and Calgary, the two major urban centers in the province of Alberta, Canada, examining associations with cohort (before and after the 1950s) and years of service weighted by exposure opportunity. The study attained 96% follow-up of vital status and over 64,983 person-years of observation, yielding 370 deaths. Mortality from all causes was close to the expected standardized mortality ratio (96; 95% confidence limits (CL) 87, 107) as was that for heart disease (110; 95% CL 92, 131), and neither was statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level (N.S.). Excesses were observed for all malignant neoplasms (127; 95% CL 102, 155, p < 0.05) and for cancer of lung (142; 95% CL 91, 211, N.S.), bladder (315; 95% CL 86, 808, N.S.), kidney and ureter (414; 95% CL 166, 853, p < 0.05), colon and rectum (161; 95% CL 88, 271, N.S.), pancreas (155; 95% CL 50, 362, N.S.) and leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma (127; 95% CL 61, 233, N.S.); obstructive pulmonary diseases (157; 95% CL 79, 281, N.S.). Fire-related causes showed a marked excess (486; 95% CL 233, 895, p < 0.01), but external causes overall showed a significant deficit (66; 95% CL 49, 87, p < 0.05). The lung cancer excess was confined to Edmonton; there was no consistent association with duration of employment, exposure opportunity, or cohort of entry (before or after the 1950s) except that the highest risk was observed among Edmonton firefighters with over 35 weighted years. The excess of cancers of the urinary tract was observed mostly among firefighters entering service after 1950, appeared to increase with length of service and exposure opportunity, and was observed in both cities. An occupational association with heart disease and chronic pulmonary disease is not supported in this study on this population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Guidotti, T L']",['Guidotti TL'],"['Occupational Health Program, University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alberta/epidemiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', '*Fires', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/etiology/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Time Factors', 'Urban Population', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/etiology/mortality']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700230608 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1993 Jun;23(6):921-40. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700230608.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To answer basic questions regarding leukemic cell survival kinetics, a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line (Reh), with the common ALL antigen (CALLA-positive), has been used to assess in vitro the efficacy of one widely used hyperfractionated TBI (HTBI) regimen versus single dose TBI (SDTBI). The regimen studied in this model was 1.2-1.25 Gy/fraction, 3 fractions/day, 5 h apart each day, for 5 days (11-12 fractions) for a total dose of 13.2-15.0 Gy. It was found that: (i) cell survival was consistent with the linear-quadratic model for early responding tissues (alpha/beta = 7.0 Gy). (ii) The change in shape of the 'effective' cell survival curve for three fractions/day was consistent with the hypothesis that there was complete repair between fractions. (iii) Cell regrowth between fractions was minimal (< or = 5%). (iv) Division delay between fractions (2.9 h/Gy) could explain the small contribution to the survival curve of regrowth between fractions. (v) For a full HTBI course to 15 Gy, cell survival was predicted to be approximately 5 x 10(-5), compared with approximately 10(-3) for a low dose rate (0.04-0.07 Gy/min) SDTBI to 10 Gy; the latter projected from the initial slope of the high dose rate, single dose survival curve.","['Shank, B']",['Shank B'],"['Radiation Oncology Department, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10029-6574.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count/radiation effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*radiotherapy/surgery', '*Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-8140(93)90041-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-8140(93)90041-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 1993 Apr;27(1):30-5. doi: 10.1016/0167-8140(93)90041-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average age at treatment was 46.5 years, and the mean dose to active bone marrow among irradiated women was 119 cGy. Forty deaths due to acute, myelocytic, or monocytic leukemia were observed among irradiated women. This number was 70% higher than expected based on U.S. mortality rates [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.7; 90% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.3]. A deficit was recorded among nonirradiated women, based on three observed deaths (SMR = 0.5; 90% CI 0.1-1.2). A well-defined gradient in the SMR with dose among exposed women was not detected. The SMR was highest within 5 years after irradiation but remained elevated even after 30 years. The temporal pattern differed by subtype of leukemia: excess mortality due to chronic myelocytic leukemia occurred almost exclusively within the first 15 years, whereas the SMR for acute leukemia, though also elevated, varied little over time. Cancers of lymphoreticular tissue occurred more often than expected based on U.S. mortality rates, but not appreciably differently for irradiated and nonirradiated women.

Therefore psychosocial care during the acute treatment is needed. In this paper a psychosocial liaison service in a BMT unit as part of a comprehensive psychosocial care on different oncology wards of an acute clinic is presented. Based on a systematic clinical documentation of the psychosocial interventions the practice and problems of the psychosocial care are described. Apart of common problems of psychosocial liaison services known from the literature the experiences show special demands reflecting the special environment of the treatment setting. These problems are discussed with regard to the different target groups (patients, relatives, medical staff).

We have found a motif present in All-1 that shows homology to the zinc-binding domain of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.63). Sequence analysis of the murine All-1 gene has identified distinct regions of homology with the human ALL-1 gene; these highly conserved domains may define regions of functional significance in mammals. In addition, we have identified alternatively spliced forms of All-1 within one of the zinc-finger domains, suggesting that there may be different targets and/or functions for All-1 proteins.

The purpose of the present studies was to analyze potential mechanisms of immunosuppression by DMBA and to examine effects on Ca2+ homeostasis and antigen-receptor signaling in human T cells. DMBA produced a rapid and sustained increase in Ca2+ levels in HPB-ALL cells by release of cytoplasmic Ca2+. DMBA also inhibited anti-CD3/CD4 mobilization of Ca2+ in HPB-ALL cells, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at approximately 4 hr. Thus, the kinetics for initial Ca2+ mobilization and inhibition of the anti-CD3/CD4 response differed. The rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ induced by DMBA alone was accompanied by a rapid but transient increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1. The pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by DMBA in HPB-ALL cells was remarkably similar to that induced by anti-CD3/CD4 activation. Thus, DMBA-induced phosphorylation may mimic antigen-receptor activation in T cells, which may lead to alterations in antigen responsiveness. The mechanism of DMBA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 may have been due to an increase in protein-tyrosine kinase activity, since it was found that DMBA produced a > 2-fold increase in the activity of the T-cell receptor-associated Src-family kinases Fyn and Lck. The kinetics of activation of protein-tyrosine kinases demonstrated that Fyn activity was increased within 10 min of exposure to DMBA, whereas maximal Lck activation required 30 min. Thus, it is likely that the Fyn kinase or other protein-tyrosine kinases may be responsible for the early tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1, which results in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+.","['Archuleta, M M', 'Schieven, G L', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Deanin, G G', 'Burchiel, S W']","['Archuleta MM', 'Schieven GL', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Deanin GG', 'Burchiel SW']","['University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy, Albuquerque 87131.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fyn protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'CD3 Complex/physiology', 'CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.13.6105 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jul 1;90(13):6105-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.13.6105.,,['ES05495/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC46876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of a factor in human serum that caused a similar increase was recently demonstrated. Several observations indicate that the serum factor consists of isoforms of TGF beta. Heat-treated serum and TGF beta both resulted in approximately 10-fold increased 5-LO activity of HL-60 cells, antiserum to TGF beta neutralized the 5-LO-increasing activity in serum, and physical properties of the serum factor (lipophilic nature, alkaline pI, stability to heat and acid) coincided with those of TGF beta. The pattern of activity of native and heat-treated sera is compatible with activation of a latent form of TGF beta in serum. This activity was specific for TGF beta, since none of several other cytokines could increase 5-LO activity in differentiating HL-60 cells. However, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha enhanced the effect of TGF beta. The most prominent effects of TGF beta, whether alone or together with GM-CSF, were observed for 5-LO activity in intact cells (10-fold or 30-fold induction, respectively). 5-LO protein levels were less affected (up to 2- or 5-fold, respectively, as judged from Western blots). There was no appreciable effect of TGF beta, or a combination of TGF beta and GM-CSF, on 5-LO mRNA expression.","['Steinhilber, D', 'Radmark, O', 'Samuelsson, B']","['Steinhilber D', 'Radmark O', 'Samuelsson B']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.13.5984 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jul 1;90(13):5984-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.13.5984.,,,,PMC46851,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Statistical analyses of international food supply data and leukemia incidence data were performed to define better the diet-human leukemia relationship. Incidence data for lymphoid, myeloid, and total leukemia (all leukemia subtypes combined) from 24 countries with reliable cancer registry data were regressed with estimates of per capita disappearance of macronutrients and alcohol, as well as gross national product and average height. RESULTS: Simple correlation analyses showed that the dietary variables were associated with leukemia in a gender- and site-specific fashion. Males consistently had higher correlations than females. The strongest correlations were found between total calorie intake and both lymphoid and total leukemia incidence, especially among males. Myeloid leukemia in either gender was most strongly associated with gross national product. To control for potential confounding, multiple regression analyses were performed, with all regression models adjusted for gross national product, height, and dietary covariates. Total calorie supply was the only significant explanatory variable for the international variation in lymphoid and total leukemia in these analyses. The calorie-leukemia association was stronger among males than among females. No significant association was observed between myeloid leukemia and any of the dietary variables studied, after adjusting for height and gross national product. CONCLUSION: The findings from this rigorous analysis of international data strengthen and expand the hypothesis based on previous simple correlation analyses and animal experiments that an underlying biological relationship exists between diet, particularly energy intake, and international variations in the incidence of certain types of human leukemia. Possible mechanisms for the calorie-leukemia associations are discussed.","['Hursting, S D', 'Margolin, B H', 'Switzer, B R']","['Hursting SD', 'Margolin BH', 'Switzer BR']","['Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7400.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Prev Med,Preventive medicine,0322116,,IM,"['Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects', 'Body Height', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Diet/*adverse effects', '*Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/classification/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0091-7435(83)71034-0 [pii]', '10.1006/pmed.1993.1034 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Med. 1993 May;22(3):409-22. doi: 10.1006/pmed.1993.1034.,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We incubated the cells with rGM-CSF alone, ara-C alone, or a combination of the two drugs. Treatment with rGM-CSF for 16 h increased the percentage of cells in S-phase both in normal BMMCs and leukemic marrow cells. The treatment with rGM-CSF alone produced an approximately two-fold increase in the intracellular dCTP pools in normal BMMCs, but this increment was not observed in leukemic marrow cells. Simultaneous exposure to rGM-CSF in combination with ara-C increased cytosine arabinoside triphosphate (ara-CTP) pools in leukemic blasts. In contrast, this treatment decreased ara-CTP pools in normal BMMCs. Moreover, when the cells were preincubated with rGM-CSF for 16 h prior to the exposure to ara-C, leukemic blasts achieved a 7-fold higher ara-CTP/dCTP ratio as compared with normal marrow cells. Treatment of the cells with rGM-CSF, either simultaneously or sequentially, resulted in significantly greater amounts of ara-C incorporation into DNA in leukemic marrow cells than normal counterparts. The higher accumulation of ara-CTP and subsequent increased incorporation of ara-C into DNA in leukemic cells treated with rGM-CSF lead to the enhanced ara-C-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis as compared with normal BMMCs. The selective accumulation of ara-CTP in leukemic vs normal cells have implications for the efficacy of the treatment of AML patients with high dose ara-C and rGM-CSF.","['Tanaka, M']",['Tanaka M'],"['Nagoya National Hospital, Department of Clinical Research, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90089-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90089-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Jul;17(7):585-92. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90089-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After culturing with 1,25(OH)2D3, HL-60 became able to bind Gc. This property seems to be related to the monocytic differentiation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Conversely, when present together, 1,25(OH)2D3 reduces binding on U-937.","['Petrini, M', 'Valentini, P', 'Allegrini, A', 'Sabbatini, A', 'Testi, R', 'Ambrogi, F', 'Arnaud, P', 'Galbraith, R M']","['Petrini M', 'Valentini P', 'Allegrini A', 'Sabbatini A', 'Testi R', 'Ambrogi F', 'Arnaud P', 'Galbraith RM']","['Haematology Unit, University of Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Vitamin D-Binding Protein)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90085-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90085-y [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Jul;17(7):561-5. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90085-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ph was the sole chromosomal abnormality at presentation, and neither eosinophilia, basophilia, thrombocytosis nor hepatosplenomegaly was present. In both cases, Ph+ myeloblasts showed positive stain for myeloperoxidase and naphthol ASD chloroacetate esterase, which fulfilled the FAB criteria of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Ph+ myeloblasts co-expressed myeloid and B-lymphoid antigens (CD10, CD13, CD19 and CD33). In case 1, myeloblasts rearranged M-BCR, and the expression of M-BCR/ABL chimeric RNA was demonstrated by using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). They also clonally rearranged IGH. Ph clone disappeared on cytogenetic analysis in remission, and granulocytes in remission did not have rearranged M-BCR. In case 2, morphocytochemically distinct myeloid and lymphoid blast populations were seen. Myeloblasts and lymphoblasts were enriched > 96% as CD19-/CD33+ and CD19+/CD33- populations, respectively. Both of them possessed the identical rearrangement of IGH and M-BCR, indicating a common leukemic progenitor cell origin. Furthermore, m-BCR/ABL was detected in addition to M-BCR/ABL on RT-PCR. Accordingly, both cases were diagnosed as de novo Ph+ acute leukemia rather than as chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic crisis. Their mixed B-lymphoid/myeloid characteristics strongly suggest that so-called 'Ph+ AML' is derived from Ph+ myeloid/B-lymphoid stem cells.","['Akashi, K', 'Taniguchi, S', 'Nagafuji, K', 'Harada, M', 'Shibuya, T', 'Hayashi, S', 'Gondo, H', 'Niho, Y']","['Akashi K', 'Taniguchi S', 'Nagafuji K', 'Harada M', 'Shibuya T', 'Hayashi S', 'Gondo H', 'Niho Y']","['Harasanshin General Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90083-W [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90083-w [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Jul;17(7):549-55. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90083-w.,,,,,"['ABL', 'ABL-BCR', 'BCR', 'IGH', 'TCRB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A group of patients who had previously received other antibiotics showed an efficacy rate of 79.2%, while the patients who had not received previous antibiotic treatment showed an efficacy rate of 80.6%. The difference between the 2 groups was statistically insignificant, however. Granulocyte counts appeared to have influence on the efficacy of the drug, but the influence was not strong. Three patients had nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 2 other patients showed abnormal liver function test parameters though they recovered soon after the cessation of the drug treatment.

Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated relative to the general population. The overall SMR was increased by 18 times during the first 3 years after Thorotrast injection. This rate reflects the often serious, underlying neurological conditions for which angiography was performed, however, mortality was increased by 3-4 fold even for the follow up period after the first 3 years. The increase in mortality was evident for all categories of cause of death, the SMR being 11.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1-16.4) for cirrhosis of the liver, 4.7 (4.1-5.3) for cancer, 1.6 (1.3-1.9) for cardiac disease, 3.3 (2.6-4.2) for cerebrovascular diseases, 3.9 (3.3-4.5) for other natural causes, and 4.4 (3.4-5.6) for violent causes (including suicides). The SMR was generally related positively to young age at injection, to time since injection, and to the amount injected. The excess mortality can be explained only partially by underlying neurological conditions and by diseases known to be induced by Thorotrast (cirrhosis and cancer of the liver, leukaemia and other haematological diseases), and it is suggested that unspecific effects induced by the alpha-radiation of Thorotrast may have contributed.","['Andersson, M', 'Juel, K', 'Storm, H H']","['Andersson M', 'Juel K', 'Storm HH']","['Danish Cancer Registry, Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Epidemiol,Journal of clinical epidemiology,8801383,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)']",IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Angiography/adverse effects', 'Contrast Media/adverse effects', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiation Injuries/*mortality', 'Thorium Dioxide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0895-4356(93)90037-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0895-4356(93)90037-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Epidemiol. 1993 Jul;46(7):637-44. doi: 10.1016/0895-4356(93)90037-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Analysis of cancer incidence by geographical area. SETTING: The north of England including the Northern and North Western Regional Health Authority regions and the Southport and South Sefton districts of the Mersey Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS: Altogether 6686 cases of malignant disease in people under 25 years old. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cases of cancer diagnosed before their 25th birthday between January 1968 and December 1985 identified from three regional cancer registries were allocated to a census ward on the basis of 'usual place of residence'. Population data were derived from the 1971 and 1981 censuses, and the cancer incidence was calculated for each ward. Of the 6686 cases, there were 1035 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 361 of non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Wards were ranked by cancer incidence and Poisson probability, using different population bases. Seascale ward is the most highly ranked ward for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for the time periods 1968-85 or 1968-76. It is not the most highly ranked for non-Hodgkins lymphoma. However, combining acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma incidence gives an even more extreme position for Seascale.

Cyclophosphamide derivatives such as mafosfamide and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide are used at high doses for purging of Philadelphia leukemic cells from marrows but such treatment can be associated with delayed engraftment and prolonged cytopenias. To develop a more effective procedure that might optimize the killing of leukemia cells and the sparing of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, a 1:1 mixture of Philadelphia leukemic cells and normal bone marrow cells was exposed to a combination of a low dose of mafosfamide and bcr-abl antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and assayed for growth ability in clonogenic assays and in immunodeficient mice. Bcr-abl transcripts were not detected in residual colonies, and cytogenetic analysis of individual colonies revealed a normal karyotype. Normal but not leukemic hematopoietic colonies of human origin were also detected in marrows of immunodeficient mice 1 mo after injection of the treated cells. Our results indicate that a combination of a conventional chemotherapeutic agent and a tumor-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide is highly effective in killing leukemic cells and in sparing a much higher number of normal progenitor cells as compared with high-dose mafosfamide treatment. This offers the prospect of a novel and more selective ex vivo treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Skorski, T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Barletta, C', 'Malaguarnera, L', 'Szcyzlik, C', 'Chen, S T', 'Lange, B', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Barletta C', 'Malaguarnera L', 'Szcyzlik C', 'Chen ST', 'Lange B', 'Calabretta B']","['Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116549 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 Jul;92(1):194-202. doi: 10.1172/JCI116549.,,['CA-46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC293565,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite extensive investigation, the factors essential for synovial cell proliferation remain to be identified. Recent studies suggest that human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) may play an important role in synovial overgrowth observed in patients with one type of chronic inflammatory synovitis. In order to confirm and extend these observations, we have established synovial cell clones (SCCs) from three HTLV-I carriers who demonstrated synovial overgrowth but were otherwise asymptomatic. HTLV-I proviral DNA randomly integrated into the cellular genome was present in 20-30% of SCCs. The SCCs carrying HTLV-I proviral DNA and expressing the tax gene exhibited high levels of proliferative potential. HTLV-I was found to function as a transcriptional trans-activator in these SCCs. Moreover, transfection of the tax expression plasmid into SCCs resulted in the same phenotype of increased proliferation and cytokine expression as exhibited by HTLV-I provirus-carrying and tax-expressing SCCs. These data suggest that tax plays a critical role not only in leukemogenesis but also in synovial overgrowth in humans.","['Nakajima, T', 'Aono, H', 'Hasunuma, T', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Maruyama, I', 'Nosaka, T', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Nishioka, K']","['Nakajima T', 'Aono H', 'Hasunuma T', 'Yamamoto K', 'Maruyama I', 'Nosaka T', 'Hatanaka M', 'Nishioka K']","['Division of Rheumatology and Molecular Immunology, St. Marianna University, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Arthritis/genetics/microbiology/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, pX', 'Growth Substances/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Synovial Membrane/*cytology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116548 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 Jul;92(1):186-93. doi: 10.1172/JCI116548.,,,,PMC293562,"['c-fos', 'tax']",,,"['GENBANK/J00074', 'GENBANK/J02029', 'GENBANK/K00650', 'GENBANK/M10278', 'GENBANK/M16287', 'GENBANK/X00351', 'GENBANK/Y00081']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of such cytokines in the evolution, pathophysiology, and treatment of B cell malignancies is an area of great interest. The in vitro response of freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and a high white cell count, to four cytokines, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF, was studied. No culture condition or cytokine resulted in a significant increase in cell number over 4 days, cells survived better in autologous serum than in heat inactivated foetal calf serum, and a small but significant increase in blast cells was seen when the cells were cultured in IL-2. There was a discrepancy between uptake of thymidine and increase in cell number which can be explained by the low labelling index of these cultures and the fact that cells can incorporate [3H]-thymidine without going into mitosis. The majority of cultures produced biologically active TNF at levels ranging from 1 to 40 pg/ml. In IFN-alpha treated cultures TNF levels were decreased. Cultures contained biologically active IL-6 at levels ranging from 2 to 2800 U/ml. IL-6 production was not influenced by other cytokines. Thirteen of 28 patients had detectable IL-6 in their serum, but in cells lysed no more than 2 h after removal from the patient, message for IL-6 could not be detected by Northern blotting. Cells also failed to express IL-1 beta mRNA but seven of eight patients had low levels of TNF message. Preliminary data using in situ hybridization techniques revealed that whilst no mRNA for IL-6 was detected, TNF and IL-1 beta mRNA were detected in a minority of mononuclear cells.","['Burke, F', 'Griffin, D', 'Elwood, N', 'Davis, C', 'Stamp, G', 'Rohatiner, A', 'Lister, T A', 'Balkwill, F']","['Burke F', 'Griffin D', 'Elwood N', 'Davis C', 'Stamp G', 'Rohatiner A', 'Lister TA', 'Balkwill F']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/blood/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Thymidine/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900110104 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1993 Jan-Feb;11(1):23-33. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900110104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examine the respective activities of LIF and nerve growth factor (NGF) throughout the embryonic development of sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and neural crest. In cultures of embryonic day 12 (E12) DRG, which contain sensory neuron precursor cells, a combination of both LIF and NGF are required for the differentiation of mature sensory neurons from their neurofilament negative (NF-) precursors. The primary differentiation step from NF- cell to NF+ immature neuron is promoted by LIF, whereas the survival and further maturation of the newly differentiated neurons depends on NGF. In cultures of sensory neurons isolated at the time of target innervation (E14 and E15 DRG), the survival of the majority of the neurons is dependent on NGF. However, LIF acts as a survival agent for a discrete population of NGF non-responsive neurons. From E16, the number of neurons maintained by LIF increases to > 90% by birth. Consistent with the in vitro observations, LIF mRNA could be detected at early developmental stages (E12-E13), within the spinal column and DRG as well as the limbs and, later (after E15), in areas of sensory innervation (skin, limbs, feet and gut). This supports the idea that LIF, as well as NGF, may regulate sensory development in vivo.","['Murphy, M', 'Reid, K', 'Brown, M A', 'Bartlett, P F']","['Murphy M', 'Reid K', 'Brown MA', 'Bartlett PF']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melboune Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*embryology', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Neurons/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1993 Mar;117(3):1173-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obstructive airways disease was defined as FEV1 less than 80 percent, ratio of FEV1 over the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) less than 80 percent of predicted, maximal midexpiratory flow rate at 50 percent vital capacity less than 65 percent of predicted, or residual volume greater than 120 percent of predicted. In the period prior to CyA prophylaxis for GVHD development (March 1983 to September 1986), 17 (39 percent) of the 44 patients undergoing BMT developed OAD, compared with 2 (4 percent) of 45 in the post-CyA period (September 1986 to March 1990) (chi 2 = 17; p < 0.00005). Age, sex, type of leukemia, severity of GVHD, histocompatibility status, presence of acute GVHD, and sex mismatch between donor and recipient were not associated with development of OAD. Although chronic GVHD was associated with OAD in univariate analysis, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the only significant independent predictor for OAD was the use of CyA.

Therefore, alternate half body irradiation (HBI) within this period would kill the residual leukemia cells, but hematopoietic stem cells would migrate from shielded marrow to irradiated marrow and reconstruct hematopoiesis. BN rats were injected i.v. with 10 BNML subline LT12nl #15 cells, which had been transfected with the E. coli Lac-Z and Neo genes by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Cytochemical X-gal staining was used to identify the leukemia cells in agar culture. At day 9 after inoculation of leukemia cells, the rats were treated with cyclophosphamide (Cy 120 mg/kg), and 3 days later irradiated with 10 Gy (2 Gy/min, 6 MV, X-rays) on the upper half body, with the lower body shielded by a lead brick. They were then irradiated with the same dosage in the lower body with the upper half body shielded a week later. The preliminary results were as follow: At day 9 after inoculation, the cellularity of bone marrow (humerus, sternum, femur and tibia) was in the normal range, and the number of L-CFU ranged from 3.6 x 10(-5) to 9.0 x 10(-5) in agar culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Chu, J']",['Chu J'],"['Institute of Hematology, Tianjin.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

As a result of this genetic change AKR.Fv-1b mice develop a low spontaneous incidence (7%) of T-cell lymphomas and about 28% of Ly-1+ B-cell lymphomas are observed in old mice. Characteristic changes in thymus subpopulations of AKR/J mice (related to the formation of the dual tropic mink cell focus inducing (MCF) type virus in the thymus) were not observed in the thymus of AKR.Fv-1b mice. In contrast to the low susceptibility to spontaneous T-cell lymphoma development, these mice were highly sensitive to fractionated irradiation or to radiation leukemia virus (a mixture of N- and B-tropic viruses) induced T-cell lymphoma. Potential lymphoma cells (that would ultimately develop into Ly-1+ B-cell lymphomas) were demonstrated in bone marrow and spleens of 16-24-month-old mice. Analysis of the Ly-1+ IgM+ B-cell population in spleens of 18-month-old mice revealed a significant increase in this population (35% versus 2% in young spleens). The spontaneous Ly-1+ B-cell lymphoma incidence could be enhanced (up to 77%) by in vivo administration of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody or IL-4 to 18-month-old mice. Virological analysis of T/B-cell lymphomas for class I MCF viruses indicated that Class I MCF development was tightly correlated with T-lymphoma development (except radiation induced tumors that showed no MCF provirus involvement). In contrast, Ly-1+ B-cell lymphoma development was independent of Class I MCF pathogenic virus involvement.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Peled, A', 'Brightman, B K', 'Fan, H']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Peled A', 'Brightman BK', 'Fan H']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, Viral', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology/immunology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mice, Inbred AKR/genetics', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology/immunology/microbiology']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jul 15;53(14):3433-8.,,,,,['Fv-1<up>b</up>'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OCI-AML1 cells were growth inhibited by TGF-beta 1 regardless of which growth factor was used as a stimulus. In contrast, AML-193 cells were resistant to TGF-beta 1 when grown with or without growth factors. UCSD/AML1 cells were sensitive to TGF-beta 1 inhibition when grown with most cytokines but were relatively resistant to TGF-beta 1 in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Although cells grown from 5 of 6 AML patients were inhibited by TGF-beta 1, cells from 1 AML patient were growth stimulated by TGF-beta 1 in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), M-CSF, or mast cell growth factor (kit ligand). Thus, 3 growth patterns with TGF-beta 1 were observed: (a) sensitivity to growth inhibition; (b) resistance; and (c) factor-dependent resistance. Further studies showed that AML-193 and UCSD/AML1 cells expressed type II TGF-beta 1 receptors and that ability of TGF-beta 1 to decrease GM-CSF receptors did not correlate with growth inhibition. AML-193 cells and UCSD/AML1 cells grown with M-CSF could be propagated in 1 ng/ml TGF-beta 1, but UCSD/AML1 cells grown with GM-CSF and TGF-beta 1 died. Morphology and agarose gel analysis of DNA showed UCSD/AML1 cells underwent apoptosis when grown with GM-CSF and TGF-beta 1 but not with M-CSF and TGF-beta 1. Similar studies of OCI-AML1 cells showed that TGF-beta 1 induced apoptosis of cells grown in 5637 bladder cell-conditioned medium or GM-CSF.

The conjugates retained the immunoreactivity of the unmodified antibody and were specifically cytotoxic toward antigen positive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Hydrazide analogues of less potent calicheamicin derivatives were also prepared and conjugated to CT-M-01. Comparison of the therapeutic efficacy of the conjugates against the MX-1 xenograft tumor implanted s.c. in nude mice showed that conjugates of derivatives missing the rhamnose, a sugar residue that is part of the DNA binding region of the drug, were not as promising as antitumor therapies. However, conjugates of two derivatives, alpha 3I and N-acetyl-gamma 1I, in which the rhamnose residue is present but the amino sugar residue of the parent drug is either missing or modified, significantly inhibited tumor growth over a 4-fold dose range and produced long-term tumor-free survivors.

In group 1, 10 patients with refractory hematopoietic malignancies received combination chemotherapy, total body irradiation (TBI), and immunosuppression (pre- and post-BMT), and hematopoietic rescue with a marrow transplant, depleted of T cells by elutriation. Potentially to promote engraftment and a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, 0.5 to 0.75 x 10(5) T cells/kg were added back. All 10 patients engrafted. Five patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; four grade II, one grade III) and two subsequently developed chronic GVHD. Two patients have relapsed (median follow-up, 206 days; range, 46 to 1,035). Four patients died of BMT-related complications (three of infection, one of veno-occlusive disease [VOD]). Four patient are disease-free survivors (median follow-up, 960 days; range, 670 to 1,035). Group 2 included five infants, four with congenital lymphohematopoietic deficiencies and one with refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In these infants, busulfan and increased cyclophosphamide were substituted for TBI. Only the ALL patient received added T cells. Three patients engrafted: one has stable mixed chimerism, one relapsed with ALL, and one rejected the marrow. One patient had primary autologous recovery, while another failed to engraft. None developed GVHD. We conclude that, in this setting of HLA-disparate BMT with post-BMT antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and corticosteroids, DCE significantly depletes T cells from the marrow and that a defined number of T cells can be added without the occurrence of severe GVHD.","['Quinones, R R', 'Gutierrez, R H', 'Dinndorf, P A', 'Gress, R E', 'Ney, A B', 'Taylor, B', 'Karandish, S', 'Carter, C S', 'Luban, N L', 'Reaman, G H']","['Quinones RR', 'Gutierrez RH', 'Dinndorf PA', 'Gress RE', 'Ney AB', 'Taylor B', 'Karandish S', 'Carter CS', 'Luban NL', 'Reaman GH']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Male', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81346-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 1;82(1):307-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the preliminary characterization of two cases that exhibited not only t(14;18)(q32.3;q21.3) but also the novel translocation t(8;9)(q24.1;p13.3), involving the C-MYC locus with unknown sequences at 9p13.3. From these cases, two Epstein-Barr virus negative cell lines (Karpas 231 and 353) with features identical to those seen in fresh cells from the patient have been derived. Both cell lines have complex karyotypes: in addition to both t(14;18)(q32.3;q21.3) and t(8;9)(q24.1;p13.3), cell line Karpas 231 exhibited three-way translocation t(1;3;11) (q42.3;q27.1;q23.1), whereas Karpas 353 exhibited t(1;3;7)(p32.1;q21.1;q22.1). Both cases retained immunophenotypes characteristic of mature B cells with no evidence for commitment to other hematopoietic lineages. Both cases expressed abundant, normal-sized C-MYC transcript, but no rearrangement of C-MYC DNA sequences could be detected using probes that span 80 kb around the C-MYC coding sequences. Breakpoints within the BCL-2 gene were divergent. In Karpas 353 the BCL-2 breakpoint occurred within the 3' untranslated major breakpoint region (mbr) of the gene, whereas, in Karpas 231, breaks in both the 3' mbr and in the region 5' of the gene were detected. The cytogenetic combination of t(14;18)(q32.3;q21.3) and t(8;9)(q24.1;p13.3) has been previously reported in diffuse B cell lymphomas. This combination may be a new recurrent abnormality, of central pathogenic importance in the transformation of B cells to high grade malignancies through simultaneous deregulation of BCL-2 and C-MYC genes, constitutive expression of C-MYC being driven by currently unknown DNA sequences on chromosome 9p13.3.

The idiotope (Id) is detectable on a high percentage of early B cells in fetal spleen, and is expressed by certain autoantibodies, particularly cold-reactive anti-red blood cell antibodies. Therefore, it was of interest to investigate usage of this VH gene by neoplastic B cells; 81 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) involving CD5+ B cells and 62 B-cell lymphomas of varying histologic type have been analyzed. The Id was expressed by only 3 of 81 (3.7%) of the CLLs, indicating a relatively low usage by these tumors. In contrast, the Id was expressed by 9 of 62 (14.5%) of the lymphomas across a range of histologic types, indicating a differential use of the VH4-21 gene among B-cell neoplasms. For three of the Id-positive lymphomas, each of a different histologic class, the nucleotide sequence of the tumor-derived VH gene was determined; the VH4-21 gene was identified, as expected. The sequence from the CLL was identical to the germline sequence, and the marginal zone lymphoma showed only 3 nucleotide changes, 2 of which gave rise to amino acid substitutions. In contrast, the sequence from the follicular lymphoma showed 29 nucleotide changes giving rise to 14 amino acid substitutions, which were scattered among the CDR and FW regions.","['Stevenson, F K', 'Spellerberg, M B', 'Treasure, J', 'Chapman, C J', 'Silberstein, L E', 'Hamblin, T J', 'Jones, D B']","['Stevenson FK', 'Spellerberg MB', 'Treasure J', 'Chapman CJ', 'Silberstein LE', 'Hamblin TJ', 'Jones DB']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81336-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 1;82(1):224-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of this normal process resulting in illegitimate cell survival can cause developmental abnormalities and facilitate cancer development. Normal cells require certain viability factors and undergo programmed cell death when these factors are withdrawn. The viability factors are required throughout the differentiation process from immature to mature cells. Although many viability factors are also growth factors, viability and growth are separately regulated. Viability factors can have clinical value in decreasing the loss of normal cells including the loss that occurs after irradiation, exposure to other cytotoxic agents or virus infection including AIDS. There is no evidence that occurs after irradiation, exposure to other cytotoxic agents or virus infection including AIDS. There is no evidence that cancer cells are immortal. Programmed cell death can be induced in leukemic cells by removal of viability factors, by cytotoxic therapeutic agents, or by the tumor-suppressor gene wild-type p53. All these forms of induction of programmed cell death in leukemic cells can be suppressed by the same viability factors that suppress programmed cell death in normal cells. A tumor-promoting phorbol ester can also suppress this death program. The induction of programmed cell death can be enhanced by deregulated expression of the gene c-myc and suppressed by the gene bcl-2. Mutant p53 and bcl-2 suppress the enhancing effect on cell death of deregulated c-myc, and thus allow induction of cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation which are other functions of deregulated c-myc. The suppression of cell death by mutant p53 and bcl-2 increases the probability of developing cancer. The suppression of programmed cell death in cancer cells by viability factors suggests that decreasing the level of these factors may increase the effectiveness of cytotoxic cancer therapy. Treatments that downregulate the expression or activity of mutant p53 and bcl-2 in cancer cells should also be useful for therapy.","['Sachs, L', 'Lotem, J']","['Sachs L', 'Lotem J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, p53', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81308-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 1;82(1):15-21.,105,,,,"['P53', 'c-bcl-2', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, deduced from the sequence of a non-decapeptide (produced by tryptic digestion of the factor), decreases the rate and the extent of MEL cell differentiation, induced by hexamethylenebisacetamide. In these cells the amount of the factor is reduced to one third of that constitutively present in untreated cells. Exogenous addition of the factor restores cell inducibility to normal values. Taken together, these results demonstrate the presence in MEL cells of a new factor, structurally and functionally unrelated to any of the known biologically active peptides, and suggest its crucial role in the promotion of an initial signal, in chemically induced erythroid differentiation.","['Sparatore, B', 'Patrone, M', 'Passalacqua, M', 'Pessino, A', 'Falchetto, R', 'Melloni, E', 'Pontremoli, S']","['Sparatore B', 'Patrone M', 'Passalacqua M', 'Pessino A', 'Falchetto R', 'Melloni E', 'Pontremoli S']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', '*HMGB1 Protein', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/toxicity']",1993/06/30 00:00,1993/06/30 00:01,['1993/06/30 00:00'],"['1993/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(83)71716-X [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1993.1716 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Jun 30;193(3):941-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1993.1716.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBSERVATIONS: A 63-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia developed a severe, mucocutaneous, vesiculobullous eruption with the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of lichen planus pemphigoides evolving into a Stevens-Johnson-like presentation and the immunofluorescence findings of pemphigus vulgaris. Evaluation of her serum confirmed the presence of autoantibodies specific for paraneoplastic pemphigus by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation criteria.

In the present paper, we report the localization of O-linked oligosaccharides exclusively to the hinge-like regions of lamp-1 and lamp-2 isolated from human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. In both glycoproteins, the O-glycans appear in clusters. In lamp-1, Thr-171, Thr-172, Ser-179, Ser-181, and Ser-183 were fully glycosylated, whereas Ser-169 was partially glycosylated. In lamp-2, complete glycosylation was found at Ser-167, Thr-168, Thr-172, Thr-175, Thr-176, Thr-182, and Thr-183, and partial glycosylation at Ser-179 and Thr-181, and possibly also at Thr-185. The amino acid sequences of these O-glycosylation sites are consistent with the previous reports that residues at positions -1 and +3 may influence the glycosylation reaction. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used for the structural characterization of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 167 to 190 of lamp-1. The results indicated that the proline-rich O-glycan acceptor region does not adopt any typical periodic structure but differs from random-coil structure. The circular dichroism spectrum of the peptide is, however, similar to that of porcine submaxillary apomucin. A significant conformational variability was observed in this region, presumably due to a slow (on the nuclear magnetic resonance time scale) cis-trans isomerization of several proline residues. These results, taken together, strongly suggest that a hinge region does not display any typical ordered structure. The presence of O-glycans thus likely protects this region from intralumenal lysosomal proteases.","['Carlsson, S R', 'Lycksell, P O', 'Fukuda, M']","['Carlsson SR', 'Lycksell PO', 'Fukuda M']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, CD', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Glycopeptides/chemistry', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polysaccharides/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(83)71322-6 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1993.1322 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1993 Jul;304(1):65-73. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1993.1322.,,['CA 48737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: A clinical and laboratory study of human immunodeficiency virus-infected children was undertaken at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven human immunodeficiency virus-infected children aged 1 to 13 years who were treated between 1987 and 1992. Twenty-one children had acquired the infection through blood transfusion, 18 during the neonatal period and three during their early years of life. Six infants had acquired the infection perinatally. RESULTS: Seventeen children have developed varicella, of whom 10 had an uncomplicated course and seven suffered from chronic, recurrent, or persistent varicella. Uncomplicated or recurrent varicella was a relatively benign illness that did not require antiviral therapy except in one child. In contrast, patients with persistent varicella required antiviral therapy as they were sicker and had a prolonged course. One had pneumonia, and another patient developed hyperkeratotic lesions that were refractory to therapy. They had lower CD4 counts (P < .01) and had a more advanced stage of the human immunodeficiency virus disease than the other children. Three patients who were receiving regular intravenous immunoglobulin developed their initial attack of varicella despite the presence of the varicella-zoster antibody. Four patients, three of whom had uncomplicated varicella, developed zoster involving one or two dermatomes. One patient developed zoster while receiving acyclovir therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 may suffer unusual manifestations of varicella-zoster infection. The incidence of zoster in these children is higher than in the general population and is close to that in patients with leukemia. The effectiveness of antiviral therapy in these patients was difficult to evaluate.","['Srugo, I', 'Israele, V', 'Wittek, A E', 'Courville, T', 'Vimal, V M', 'Brunell, P A']","['Srugo I', 'Israele V', 'Wittek AE', 'Courville T', 'Vimal VM', 'Brunell PA']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Ahmanson Pediatric Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA, School of Medicine 90048.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Dis Child,American journal of diseases of children (1960),0370471,['X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)'],IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Chickenpox/*complications/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'HIV Infections/*complications/etiology', '*HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Recurrence']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archpedi.1993.02160310044016 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dis Child. 1993 Jul;147(7):742-5. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1993.02160310044016.,,['U62/CUU 904451/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) These cytoplasmic fragments were surrounded by abundant fibrin fibers, forming the fibrin-cytoplasmic fragment complex (FCF complex). (3) Slight fibrin deposition was seen around the leukemic cells and in the intercellular space of the bone marrow.

However, it has become necessary to characterize the malignant clone with various markers, which give either knowledge of the prognosis of the disease or give tools for the laboratory follow up of the patient. In lymphatic diseases there are excellent markers of clonality. On the contrary in myeloid malignancies the few well characterized markers are mostly helpful in the clinical management of rare myeloid subgroups. The aim of our project has been to develop methods for laboratory monitoring of myeloid diseases by two major approaches 1) detection of methylation alterations in the short arm of chromosome 11 and 2) novel approaches for sensitive point mutation detection. The short arm of chromosome 11 has areas where the DNA becomes hypermethylated in acute leukemias and lymphomas. In this chromosomal area the calcitonin gene serves as a good marker for methylation alterations due to several CpG sites in the 5'area of the gene. Even if the gene is normally methylated in most cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we have found that the hypermethylation of the calcitonin gene marks progression of CML and precedes any other signs of acceleration with several months. The point mutations of certain proto-oncogenes, such as the N-ras gene, are attractive markers for detecting residual diseases after chemotherapy of high malignant haematological disorders. However, conventional methods for detecting point mutations have been both insensitive and cumbersome, and thus unsuitable for clinical routine laboratories. With the solid-phase minisequencing we can technically easily and accurately detect small quantities of mutated cells.","['Palotie, A', 'Syvanen, A C']","['Palotie A', 'Syvanen AC']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Norway,Scand J Clin Lab Invest Suppl,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation.

The intensity and timing of the therapy are based on the presence or predicted risk of central nervous system leukemia as assessed according to criteria that remain controversial. METHODS: The clinical importance of leukemic blast cells detected in cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis was evaluated in 351 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a randomized trial of intensive chemotherapy. All patients received intrathecal chemotherapy during the first year. Patients considered to be at high risk of relapse because of their clinical and cytogenetic features also received cranial irradiation and intrathecal chemotherapy one year after remission. Patients were considered to have central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis if they had at least 5 leukocytes per microliter of cerebrospinal fluid, with leukemic blast cells apparent in cytocentrifuged preparations, or cranial-nerve palsy; they received additional intrathecal injections of chemotherapeutic agents and cranial irradiation. Patients were retrospectively classified on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid findings: 291 patients had no detectable blast cells, 42 had fewer than 5 leukocytes per microliter and blast cells, and 18 had central nervous system leukemia as defined above. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of treatment in these groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The five-year probability of survival free of relapses confined to the central nervous system in patients with detectable blast cells and fewer than 5 leukocytes per microliter of cerebrospinal fluid was lower than in patients without blast cells (mean [+/- SE], 87 +/- 13 vs. 96 +/- 2 percent), but was not different from the probability in patients with central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis. All such isolated relapses of leukemia in patients with detectable blast cells occurred during the first year of treatment, before scheduled cranial irradiation. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of cerebrospinal fluid blast cells with fewer than 5 leukocytes per microliter was independently related to the risk of relapse confined to the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leukemic blast cells in their cerebrospinal fluid are at increased risk for central nervous system relapse when cranial irradiation is delayed. Such patients require intensified central nervous system treatment early in the course of therapy.","['Mahmoud, H H', 'Rivera, G K', 'Hancock, M L', 'Krance, R A', 'Kun, L E', 'Behm, F G', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Crist, W M', 'Pui, C H']","['Mahmoud HH', 'Rivera GK', 'Hancock ML', 'Krance RA', 'Kun LE', 'Behm FG', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Sandlund JT', 'Crist WM', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/mortality', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Child', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1993/07/29 00:00,1993/07/29 00:01,['1993/07/29 00:00'],"['1993/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199307293290504 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Jul 29;329(5):314-9. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199307293290504.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This binding activity, which we term beta DRf, for beta-globin direct repeat factor, was detected in fractionated nuclear extracts from the murine erythroleukemia cell line and has been partially purified from undifferentiated cells. beta DRf makes symmetric contacts on the two copies of its recognition sequence on both strands and introduces a bend into the DNA helix upon binding. While the factor displays a low binding affinity for the beta DRE in isolation, it binds to the intact beta-globin promoter and DNA fragments containing multiple beta DRE-binding sites with high affinity.

Our data indicate that TNF-alpha treatment of these cells is associated with transcriptional activation of c-jun, resulting in accumulation of c-jun mRNA and protein expression. In order to elucidate the role of c-Jun/AP-1 in TNF-mediated growth stimulation, the antisense (AS) technique was used. Uptake studies of oligonucleotides were performed with fibroblasts, demonstrating that incorporation of oligomers was maximal at 4 h. Oligodeoxynucleotides remained stable in these cells for up to 24 h. Treatment of fibroblasts with the AS oligonucleotide resulted in intracellular duplex formation followed by an efficient translation blockade of c-Jun/AP-1. In contrast, sense (S) and nonsense (NS) oligodeoxynucleotides failed to form intracellular duplexes and also did not interfere with translation of c-Jun/AP-1, suggesting specific elimination of c-Jun/AP-1 by the AS oligomer. Fibroblasts cultured in the presence of the AS oligonucleotide but not those cultured in the presence of the S or NS oligonucleotide failed to respond proliferatively to TNF-alpha. These findings could be confirmed by experiments with primary acute myelogenous leukemia blasts, which also demonstrated that TNF-induced growth stimulation required c-Jun/AP-1 function. Taken together, our results indicate that activation of c-Jun/AP-1 plays a pivotal role in the signaling cascade initiated by TNF, which leads to a proliferative response of its target cells.","['Brach, M A', 'Gruss, H J', 'Sott, C', 'Herrmann, F']","['Brach MA', 'Gruss HJ', 'Sott C', 'Herrmann F']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.7.4284-4290.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Jul;13(7):4284-90. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.7.4284-4290.1993.,,,,PMC359978,['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with LMC, examined with CPITN index, revealed a high presence of tartar (44.87%) and periodontal pockets, 4-5 mm deep, (23.72%). DMFT was 22.60, a rather high value caused by the large number of missing teeth. The data analysis evidences the severe clinical conditions of the patients and the urgent necessity for proper prophylactic and therapeutic treatment.","['Cotti, S', 'Cagetti, M G', 'Muscas, G']","['Cotti S', 'Cagetti MG', 'Muscas G']","['Corso di Laurea in Odontoiatria e Protesi Dentaria, Clinica Odontostomatologica, Universita degli Studi di Cagliari.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Stomatol,Minerva stomatologica,0421071,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DMF Index', 'Female', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oral Health', 'Periodontal Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Periodontal Index']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Stomatol. 1993 Mar;42(3):77-86.,,,Indagine odontostomatologica su pazienti affetti da patologia leucemica.

Here, we monitored the release of protein and LPS through the growth cycle of C. rectus ATCC 33238 and identified the 104 kDa protein as the cytotoxin. LPS in media supernatants was quantitated by a KDO assay; the 104 kDa protein was detected on immunoblots with specific antibody (A104) and quantitated by amino acid analysis of membrane immobilized protein bands. C. rectus cell product release was independent of cell lysis. Over 24 h, the 104 kDa protein was released linearly while LPS was released in two plateaus; both increased in C. rectus culture supernatants 3 h after inoculation achieving maximum concentrations at 21 h of 3.1 micrograms/ml and 14.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. In 2 h, trypan blue viability assays, 37-47 micrograms of 12, 18 and 24 h supernatant protein killed 33-43% of HL-60 cells. Supernatant toxicity was heat sensitive and inhibited by A104. Sequencing the 16 N-terminal amino acids of the cytotoxin distinguished it from described C. rectus proteins. Similarities between epitopes and amino acid compositions of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin and C. rectus cytotoxin were observed. These data indicate that C. rectus secretes a 104 kDa cytotoxin.","['Gillespie, M J', 'Smutko, J', 'Haraszthy, G G', 'Zambon, J J']","['Gillespie MJ', 'Smutko J', 'Haraszthy GG', 'Zambon JJ']","['Department of Oral Biology, State University of New York, Buffalo 14214.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (cytotoxin, Campylobacter rectus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Campylobacter/*chemistry/growth & development', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0882-4010(83)71020-X [pii]', '10.1006/mpat.1993.1020 [doi]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 1993 Mar;14(3):203-15. doi: 10.1006/mpat.1993.1020.,,"['DE07497/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DEO09661/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DEO8240/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the cultures the nucleoside F-ara-A was used. Blast cells from the continuous lines OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-3 were grown, either in methylcellulose to quantify clonogenic cells, or in suspension to measure self-renewal as reflected in changes in numbers of clonogenic cells. F-ara-A, like ara-C, was found to be more toxic to blast stem cells in suspension than in the clonogenic assay, indicating that F-ara-A might, in addition to general cytotoxicity, have some specific inhibitory effects on self-renewing stem cells. F-ara-A was less cytotoxic than ara-C; but, when F-ara-A was given before ara-C, synergism was seen at some F-ara-A doses, as manifested by increased ara-C cytotoxicity. In contrast, when ara-C was given before F-ara-A, protection was observed. Control experiments make it unlikely that this effect is related to changes in the cell cycle following ara-C exposure. We conclude that the cellular studies reported here confirm previous pharmacological data indicating that F-ara-A before ara-C increases the effectiveness of ara-C by increasing the accumulation of ara-CTP. However the present experiments show that the synergism between F-ara-A and ara-C is dependent on both dose and schedule.","['Rayappa, C', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Rayappa C', 'McCulloch EA']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, U.T.

None of 19 patient bone marrow samples available for Southern blot analysis showed rearrangements in the p53 gene and only one patient showed loss of the p53 locus. DNA encompassing exons 5, 7, and 8, where p53 mutations commonly cluster, was amplified by PCR. Single-strand conformation polymorphisms of the PCR-amplified exon 5 region were detected in two patients. Direct sequencing of the mutant band revealed that one patient had a C to T transition at codon 138 (Ala to Val) and one patient had a G to C transversion at codon 139 (Lys to Asn). p53 mutations in germline cells in hereditary cancer syndromes predispose the family members to the development of malignancies. We therefore searched for p53 germline mutations in exons 5, 7, and 8 in the affected individuals from three families each with two multiple myeloma patients (these patients include three individuals from the non-related group mentioned above). Using Southern blotting, polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing, no germline mutations were found.

Recently mutations in codons 301 and 969 of c-fms, preferentially involving TAT-to-TGT at codon 969, have also been identified in these disorders by allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization. We have developed allele specific restriction analysis (ASRA) protocols for the detection of point mutations in the critical codons of these genes. ASRA involves enzymatic digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-induced restriction sites which are specific for normal but not mutant alleles. A total of 11 N-ras mutations were observed in 10 out of 46 AML patients, consistent with the reported frequency of N-ras mutations when alternative techniques of comparable sensitivity are used. In contrast, c-fms point mutations were not detected in a similar number of patients with AML, including 39 studied for mutations in both N-ras and c-fms, and this difference is statistically significant (p < 0.003). A more sensitive technique (ASRA + ASO hybridization) also failed to detect TAT-to-TGT substitutions at codon 969 in a subgroup of M4-AML patients considered to be at greatest risk of harboring c-fms mutations. This study suggests that c-fms mutations at codons 301 and 969 are not important in the pathogenesis of AML in the vast majority of patients.","['Springall, F', ""O'Mara, S"", 'Shounan, Y', 'Todd, A', 'Ford, D', 'Iland, H']","['Springall F', ""O'Mara S"", 'Shounan Y', 'Todd A', 'Ford D', 'Iland H']","['Kanematsu Laboratories, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Genes, fms', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Point Mutation', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jul;7(7):978-85.,,,,,"['N-ras', 'c-fms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we can agree on this, there is some small hope that we can reach a fair consensus regarding cases like Mrs. Washburn's. If experimental therapy is distinguished from standard therapy not only in terms of efficacy, but in terms of method and intent, it becomes apparent that experimental therapy is not a monolithic entity, and has a large and sometimes predictable range of probabilities of benefiting the individual patient.

Best results are observed when patients are transplanted early in chronic phase. T-lymphocyte depletion of donor marrow can effectively prevent chronic graft versus host disease, but is associated with a high incidence of relapse. Hematologic relapse after marrow transplantation can be treated successfully with alpha-interferon, donor buffy coat cells or second transplant. HLA phenotypically matched and, in some cases, 1 HLA antigen mismatched unrelated donors can also be used successfully for marrow transplantation therapy of CML. Complications include an increased incidence of graft failure and graft vs. host disease. Chronic phase patients transplanted early in the disease course have the best outcome. The development of the National Marrow Donor Program in the United States and a network of donor registries throughout the world as well as the establishment of new techniques for histocompatibility testing will increase the availability of unrelated donors and expedite the donor search process. Autologous marrow transplantation can induce complete hematologic and cytogenetic remissions and may prolong survival when compared with results expected from conventional therapy for CML. Strategies are being developed to obtain benign primitive progenitors suitable for autologous marrow transplantation by positive selection techniques and to develop further post-transplant anti-leukemia cell therapy to use as an adjunct to autologous marrow transplantation for CML.","['McGlave, P']",['McGlave P'],"['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Male']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jul;7(7):1082-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case of acute myeloid leukemia (CD13, CD33, CD14, CD11b) which at presentation showed a co-expression of B-lymphoid markers (CD19, CD10, CD20), at the time of the first relapse revealed a morphologic, phenotypic and genotypic switch of the blasts to a purely lymphoid form. Analysis of the immunoglobulin (Ig) H chain locus and of the T-cell receptor (TCR) genes showed at diagnosis a germline configuration of the IgH, TCR beta and tau genes, and a deletion of the TCR delta gene at the second chromosome. At relapse, monoclonal rearrangements of the IgH, TCR tau, and TCR delta were detected. At a subsequent relapse, the blasts re-expressed myeloid morphologic features and myeloid-associated antigens, while they retained the same rearranged configuration of the IgH and TCR beta and delta genes. The TCR delta gene configuration, which links each phase of the disease, may represent an early pathogenetic event and makes the emergence of a second malignancy unlikely. Each phenotypic change occurred after anti-myeloid and anti-lymphoid oriented chemotherapy. The close correlation between the progressive acquisition of different phenotypes and the switch at the genomic level represent the peculiar features of this unusual case.","['Ciolli, S', 'Leoni, F', 'Caporale, R', 'Carbone, A', 'Francia di Celle, P', 'Foa, R', 'Ferrini, P R']","['Ciolli S', 'Leoni F', 'Caporale R', 'Carbone A', 'Francia di Celle P', 'Foa R', 'Ferrini PR']","['Division at Hematology, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jul;7(7):1061-5.,,,,,"['TCRD', 'TCRG', 'bcr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 57 MDS patients and 27 cases of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) for mutations at codon 1423 in the so-called FLR exon of NF1 by an assay based on restriction enzyme digestion. We investigated the entire FLR exon and its flanking intron sequences using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products and sequencing. None of the cases exhibited a codon 1423 mutation. However, a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) showed a 3 bp deletion within the splice acceptor region in front of the FLR exon.

In the two Ph-negative BCR-positive cases, seven (patient 1) and 18 (patient 2) mitoses had been examined at diagnosis. In patient 1, Ph negativity at diagnosis could certainly be explained by the small number of mitoses analyzed, as a Ph chromosome was found at relapse. This was less probable in patient 2, who raised the issue of whether authentic Ph-negative BCR-ABL-positive ALL exists (as in the chronic myeloid leukemia model) or not.

The results indicated that B6-->C3H chimeras never developed FLV-induced leukemias when infected with FLV 4 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Spleen cells from B6-->C3H chimeras that were preimmunized with 100 Gy-irradiated FBL-3 cells (FLV-induced leukemic cell line originated from B6 mice) were shown to generate anti-FBL-3 specific T-cell proliferation as well as cytotoxic T cells. We also found that when bone marrow cells from B6 mice were mixed with those from C3H mice and then grafted into supralethally irradiated C3H mice, resulting chimeras whose peripheral blood contained less than 30% C3H-derived (susceptible) cells were refractory to FLV-induced leukemogenesis. On the other hand, when C3H mice were infected with FLV and then supralethally irradiated 5 days later and grafted with bone marrow from B6 donors, they developed leukemias which were of B6 origin. Athymic nu/nu mice of B6 background were again shown to develop leukemia following infection with FLV. Possible implication of these findings on the role of T cell-mediated immune response in resistance to FLV-induced leukemogenesis and the immunocompetent nature of fully H-2 incompatible RBMC were discussed.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Kamisaku, H', 'Sado, T', 'Kasuga, T']","['Kitagawa M', 'Kamisaku H', 'Sado T', 'Kasuga T']","['Division of Physiology and Pathology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jul;7(7):1041-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was considerable variation in the ability of growth factors to stimulate thymidine incorporation among individual cases of AML. Blasts from almost one half of the patients (25 out of 52) with AML were responsive to growth factors such as IL-3, G-CSF, or GM-CSF. Alternatively, 37% of AML cases (19 out of 52) showed little (< 2.5 times background) thymidine incorporation in the presence of growth factors; such cases were classified as nonresponsive. All AML cases expressing mixed-lineage characteristics (expression of lymphoid-associated antigens) were non-responsive. In 15% of the cases (9 out of 52), blasts incorporated high levels of thymidine without growth factors and there was no increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of growth factors. Such cases were classified as independent. The response to growth factors did not correlate with other biological characteristics such as the FAB morphologic classification or specific chromosomal abnormalities. In striking contrast to AML cases, blast sells from only a few of the ALL cases studied showed any response to growth factors. These results demonstrate that growth factor responsiveness is a unique biological characteristic of the leukemic blasts and does not appear to correlate with other easily identified biological features.","['Mirro, J Jr', 'Hurwitz, C A', 'Behm, F G', 'Head, D R', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Crist, W M', 'Ihle, J N']","['Mirro J Jr', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Behm FG', 'Head DR', 'Raimondi SC', 'Crist WM', 'Ihle JN']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1993/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jul;7(7):1026-33.,,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,459-64,"OBJECTIVE: To report on data collected during on-site audits of source documents in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). DESIGN: A retrospective review of audit reports in four audit cycles. SETTING: A cooperative group of institutions conducting clinical trials in cancer treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients taking part in clinical trials at collaborating CALGB institutions, members of the CALGB Data Audit Committee, and group chairmen of CALGB. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The results of 691 institutional audits conducted by the CALGB in 1982 through 1992 with comparisons of main CALGB institutions vs affiliates. RESULTS: In four full reviews of all participating institutions in the CALGB, 3787 patients have had their on-site medical records compared with data submitted to the CALGB Data Management Center. Compliance with federal regulations for oversight by an institutional review board improved from a deficiency rate of 28.0% among the main institutions and 49.6% of the affiliate institutions in the first audit cycle to respective figures of 13.3% and 28.2% in the fourth cycle. Consent form deficiencies also dropped overall from 18.5% in the first cycle to 3.9% in the fourth. Patient eligibility was verified by auditors in 94.5%, and assessment of tumor changes in response to treatment was verified in 96.4% in the fourth cycle; both figures were only slightly lower in the first cycle. Two instances of scientific impropriety were discovered for a rate of only 0.28% of all audits. Both occurred prior to 1984, and none have occurred since. Major protocol deviations in drug dosing have held steady at about 11% over four audit cycles. Over the 11-year period of audits, three main institutions and 96 affiliate institutions have discontinued CALGB membership due solely, or at least partly, to unfavorable audit results. CONCLUSION: Scientific improprieties have occurred very rarely in clinical trials conducted by the CALGB. Protocol compliance in assessing patient eligibility and tumor responses has been high. Attention to administrative matters of consent forms, institutional review board approval, and ancillary data submission has measurably improved in the CALGB, which is at least partly due to the pressure from this on-site peer review of investigator performance.","['Weiss, R B', 'Vogelzang, N J', 'Peterson, B A', 'Panasci, L C', 'Carpenter, J T', 'Gavigan, M', 'Sartell, K', 'Frei, E 3rd', 'McIntyre, O R']","['Weiss RB', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Peterson BA', 'Panasci LC', 'Carpenter JT', 'Gavigan M', 'Sartell K', 'Frei E 3rd', 'McIntyre OR']","['Department of Medicine, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Data Collection/standards', 'Humans', '*Medical Audit', 'Medical Records/*standards', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scientific Misconduct/statistics & numerical data', 'United States']",1993/07/28 00:00,1993/07/28 00:01,['1993/07/28 00:00'],"['1993/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1993 Jul 28;270(4):459-64.,,"['CA 16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,"['JAMA. 1993 Dec 8;270(22):2685.

The change in height SDS between diagnosis and achievement of final height was significant for all treatment groups: -0.49 +/- 0.14, no CRT; -0.65 +/- 0.15, 1800 cGy; and -1.38 +/- 0.16, 2400 cGy. Irradiated patients had a greater loss in height SDS compared with the nonirradiated patients (p < 0.01), and those treated with 2400 cGy CRT had a greater decrease in final height SDS than the patients treated with 1800 cGy (p < 0.01). Both younger age and female sex were significantly associated with a greater decrease in height SDS in the patients treated with CRT; girls < or = 4 years of age at diagnosis had a mean loss in height SDS that was more than twice that observed for others treated with the same dose of CRT. Thus, although modern regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (no CRT or 1800 cGy CRT) appear overall to have only a modest impact on final height, patients, especially girls, treated with 1800 cGy CRT at a young age remain at risk for clinically significant growth failure.","['Sklar, C', 'Mertens, A', 'Walter, A', 'Mitchell, D', 'Nesbit, M', ""O'Leary, M"", 'Hutchinson, R', 'Meadows, A', 'Robison, L']","['Sklar C', 'Mertens A', 'Walter A', 'Mitchell D', 'Nesbit M', ""O'Leary M"", 'Hutchinson R', 'Meadows A', 'Robison L']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Body Height/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Growth/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Michigan/epidemiology', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Philadelphia/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)81537-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)81537-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1993 Jul;123(1):59-64. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)81537-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to discriminate Ph1-positive ALL from Ph1-positive CML as a clinical entity, I studied on biological and genetic characteristics of Ph1-positive ALL cells. Two cases out of 11 Ph1-positive ALL showed hybrid leukemia phenotypes; in one hybrid case simultaneous proliferation of lymphoid and myeloid blast cells was observed and contained rearranged alleles of heavy chain genes, thus indicating that both blast cells might originate from a common precursor. Two Ph1-positive ALL cell lines (TOM-1 and ALL-MIK) were established from two patients and were investigated for their differentiation potential in vitro. Both cell lines showed the potency to differentiate into monocytic lineage cells, thus suggesting that these Ph1-positive ALL cells might reside at the stage of multipotent progenitor cell along hematopoietic cell differentiation. As to Ph1-chromosome, 4 out of 9 Ph1-positive ALL cases showed rearrangements within the classical sequence (M-bcr), similar to those in CML cases. Two out of 5 cases without rearrangement of M-bcr showed breakpoints in the first intron of the BCR gene. In the rest of 3 cases, BCR-ABL rearrangement was not detected by Southern analysis. However, a leukemic cell line established from one of these patients (TOM-1) were contained P190bcr-abl mRNA as analyzed through RT-PCR. Thus, breakpoints of the BCR gene in Ph1-positive ALL cases were heterogenous, in contrast to those of CML. Then, I investigated whether or not the activation of transforming genes other than BCR-ABL might be involved in pathogenesis of Ph1-positive ALL.

In the present study, we addressed the potential role of endogenous production of TNF-alpha and/or IL-1 in the in vitro growth of AML clonogenic cells supported by IL-3. Addition of a specific neutralizing antibody against TNF-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) to the culture significantly reduced the growth-stimulating effect of IL-3 on the cells in 11 of 14 patients. Simultaneous addition of anti-IL-1 alpha and anti-IL-1 beta also partly affected the growth, although to a much lesser extent when compared to the effect observed with anti-TNF-alpha. In 3 patients, the growth-stimulating effect of IL-3 was completely abrogated by anti-TNF-alpha or a combination of all three antibodies. Constitutive TNF-alpha transcript was observed in 5 patients and TNF-alpha protein was present in culture supernatant. Following in vitro culture, a transient but profound increase in c-fos, c-jun, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA levels was observed. Anti-TNF-alpha inhibited the accumulation of TNF-alpha transcript, suggesting that membrane-integrated TNF-alpha may be partly responsible for the induction of TNF-alpha mRNA. It seems likely that the accumulation of these genes occurs through a protein kinase C-independent signaling pathway.","['Murohashi, I', 'Tohda, S', 'Imai, Y', 'Hirai, Y', 'Nara, N']","['Murohashi I', 'Tohda S', 'Imai Y', 'Hirai Y', 'Nara N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, fos', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Jul;21(7):846-51.,,,,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies using 5'-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5'-deoxyadenosine, a suicide inhibitor of the enzyme.",671-6,"Cell proliferation is dependent on an adequate supply of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine. One of the key steps in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC). In the present study we have used a newly synthesized enzyme-activated irreversible AdoMetDC inhibitor, 5'-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5'-deoxyadenosine [(Z)-AbeAdo], to investigate the regulation of this enzyme. Treatment of mouse L1210 leukemia cells with (Z)-AbeAdo resulted in a total inhibition of their AdoMetDC activity followed by depletion of the spermidine and spermine content. The putrescine content, however, was dramatically increased after treatment with (Z)-AbeAdo. In spite of the cellular depletion of spermidine and spermine, only a minor inhibitory effect was obtained on cell growth, indicating that putrescine at a high concentration might partly replace spermidine and spermine in their growth-promoting functions. Cells grown in the presence of (Z)-AbeAdo exhibited an increased synthesis of AdoMetDC, which was counteracted by the addition of either spermidine or spermine. The change in AdoMetDC synthesis could not be fully explained by a change in the level of AdoMetDC mRNA, indicating also a translational control. Mammalian AdoMetDC is synthesized as a larger proenzyme, which is then cleaved into two subunits of different sizes. The conversion of the proenzyme into the subunits is a very rapid process, which is stimulated greatly by putrescine in vitro. However, the processing of the proenzyme in the (Z)-AbeAdo-treated L1210 cells was not affected by their very high putrescine content, indicating that the conversion might be saturated at low levels of putrescine, or that most of the putrescine in the (Z)-AbeAdo-treated L1210 cells might be bound to sites normally occupied by spermidine and spermine.","['Stjernborg, L', 'Heby, O', 'Mamont, P', 'Persson, L']","['Stjernborg L', 'Heby O', 'Mamont P', 'Persson L']","['Department of Animal Physiology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '7GI49JB39O (MDL 73811)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/drug effects/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17967.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Jun 15;214(3):671-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17967.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exponentially growing HL-60 cells were treated with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin; the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors teniposide, m-AMSA, Mitoxantrone, or Fostriecin; the presumed tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein; a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7; the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide; the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea; the nucleoside antimetabolites 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and 5-azacytidine; and the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard, cisplatin, hyperthermia, and gamma irradiation. Endonucleolysis, which accompanied apoptosis induced by these agents, was assessed by two different flow cytometric methods, one based on DNA content measurements following extraction of low molecular weight DNA, and another using exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to label in situ DNA strand breaks. Each method allowed for both identification of apoptotic cells and analysis of the cell cycle distribution of the unaffected cell population; the method using terminal transferase also allowed for identification of the cell cycle position of apoptotic cells. Confirmed by analysis of DNA degradation by gel electrophoresis and changes in cell morphology, apoptosis was observed as early as 3 h after administration of most drugs and for some drugs was cell cycle phase specific. Cells progressing through S phase were selectively susceptible when treated with camptothecin, teniposide, m-AMSA, Mitoxantrone, H7, hydroxyurea, and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Cells in G2-M preferentially underwent apoptosis in cultures treated with H7 or with gamma-irradiation. Cells in G1 phase were preferentially affected by 5-azacytidine, nitrogen mustard, and hyperthermia. No significant cell cycle specificity was observed in the case of Fostriecin, genistein, cycloheximide, or cisplatin. The cell cycle related difference in susceptibility to apoptosis may be a reflection of both the severity of the lesion induced by a given drug and the ability of the cells to repair that lesion; both can vary depending on the cell cycle phase.","['Gorczyca, W', 'Gong, J', 'Ardelt, B', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Gorczyca W', 'Gong J', 'Ardelt B', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electrophoresis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Interphase/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jul 1;53(13):3186-92.,,['R01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increase in life span of over 100% was produced for the analogues in the latter two models. The maximally effective concentrations for the analogues were 20 to 25 mg/kg while Magainin2 required 50-60 mg/kg for in vivo efficacy.

Analysis of protein synthesis had previously shown an early (< 12 h) fall in the synthesis of M(r) 70,000 heat shock proteins (F. M. Richards, A. Watson, and J. A. Hickman. Cancer Res., 48: 6715-6720, 1988). The changes have now been characterized in detail and their kinetics compared to those of the expression of the c-myc protein. Immunoanalysis, using antibodies to either the stress-inducible heat shock protein hsp70 (4G4) or a pan-M(r) 70,000 heat shock protein antibody (3A3), showed that there was a striking reduction in the levels of the constitutive heat shock protein hsc70 when cells were incubated continuously with 170 mM N-methylformamide. A reduction in the level of hsc70 RNA was observed within 3 h and continued thereafter. In contrast, transcription of the hsc70 gene was induced within 1-2 h, after which the rate returned to basal level. There were no significant changes in the rate of transcription of the stress-inducible heat shock proteins hsp70 or hsp90. When N-methylformamide was removed from the cells, prior to commitment to differentiation, the levels of hsc70 were reestablished, whereas after 36 h of treatment there was no recovery. Western blotting with an antibody to the c-myc protein showed this to fall to virtually undetectable levels by 3 h under the same conditions. The results suggest that the loss of hsc70, which may perform a protein chaperoning role, was mediated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels of regulation and was an early event closely associated with the commitment of HL-60 cells to differentiation. The fall in hsc70 was not associated with alterations in the cell cycle, nor were the kinetics of the change suggestive of a relationship with the decrease in content of c-myc protein.","['Beere, H M', 'Morimoto, R I', 'Hickman, J A']","['Beere HM', 'Morimoto RI', 'Hickman JA']","['Cancer Research Campaign Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Formamides)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Formamides/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jul 1;53(13):3034-9.,,['6M3/PHS HHS/United States'],,,"['c-myc', 'hcs70', 'hsc90']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy and toxicity of Acetyldinaline for remission-induction treatment of leukemia were evaluated and compared with those observed in previous studies of Dinaline in the Brown Norway acute myelocytic leukemia, as a preclinical model for human acute myelocytic leukemia. There were three treatment groups. Leukemic animals received either 1 or 2 courses of 5 daily p.o. administrations of Acetyldinaline with a ""full dose"" of 23.7 mg/kg once daily (first group), a twice daily ""half dose"" of 11.85 mg/kg with an interval of 8 h (second group), or a ""half dose"" of 11.85 mg/kg once daily (third group). The drug-free interval between the 2 courses was 2 or 9 days. With repeated daily p.o. administrations of 23.7 mg/kg either in a single daily dose or a split daily dose of 2 x 11.85 mg/kg for 1 course, at least an 8-log leukemic cell kill was achieved. In contrast, with these treatment schedules, less than a 1-log cell kill of normal pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) in the femoral bone marrow was found. Split daily dose treatment was more effective resulting in 37.5% cures, while no cures were observed with the single daily treatment for one course. Treatment with single daily dose of 23.7 mg/kg or a split daily dose of 2 x 11.85 mg/kg for 2 courses, with either a 2- or 9-day interval in between, resulted in lethal toxicity in most of rats. This result was comparable with that previously observed after equimolar doses of Dinaline (20 mg/kg). The half-dose once daily treatment with Acetyldinaline (11.85 mg/kg) for 1 or 2 cycles resulted in about a 4.5 or > 8-log leukemic cell kill, respectively. Toxic side effects, i.e., damage to the gastro-intestinal tract and hemorrhages in the lungs, were more pronounced with full dose either in the single or the split daily dose regimen. No significant toxicity was observed at the half-dose treatment once daily.

Clinical results in 46 patients.,439-45,"BACKGROUND: Given the good penetration of systemic high-dose cytarabine (HDara-C) into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), this approach was used to treat patients with central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, either isolated or with concurrent extraneurologic disease (END). METHODS: From 1983 to 1991, 46 adults with CNS involvement were treated with systemic HDara-C: 25 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 15 had high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 5 had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 1 had lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Induction consisted of HDara-C 3 g/m2 every 12 hours, by 3-hour infusion, for 8 doses (30 patients), or 6 doses (16 patients), followed by 4 doses at day 21. RESULTS: Of 46 patients, 29 (63%) achieved complete remission (CR): 15/15 with isolated CNS leukemia, and 14/31 (45%) with CNS and concurrent marrow or lymph node disease. Of 17 patients not meeting CR criteria because of persistent END, 11 showed complete CNS response. The first 10 remitters were consolidated with monthly 4-dose courses of HDara-C. The remaining 19 received postinduction multidrug chemotherapy (including vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, L-asparaginase, etoposide plus intermediate-dose ara-C, mitoxantrone plus HDara-C) and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) +/- cranial radiation therapy. One patient underwent autologous and one allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Median CR duration was 7 months (range, 2-56+): 8 months for patients with isolated CNS leukemia, and 4 months for those with concurrent END: In only two patients was CNS the primary site of relapse. Three patients with isolated CNS leukemia are disease-free at 23, 40, and 56 months. The main toxicity was myelosuppression. No patient showed dose-limiting neurologic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic HDara-C appears effective therapy for CNS leukemia, maximally in cases with isolated CNS involvement. HDara-C may be combined safely with cranial radiation therapy and intrathecal MTX. This approach for CNS leukemia, however, needs to be combined with additional treatments to eradicate residual disease in extraneurologic compartments.","['Morra, E', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Brusamolino, E', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Castagnola, C', 'Bernasconi, P', 'Orlandi, E', 'Corso, A', 'Santagostino, A', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Morra E', 'Lazzarino M', 'Brusamolino E', 'Pagnucco G', 'Castagnola C', 'Bernasconi P', 'Orlandi E', 'Corso A', 'Santagostino A', 'Bernasconi C']","['Chair of Hematology University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930715)72:2<439::aid-cncr2820720220>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jul 15;72(2):439-45. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930715)72:2<439::aid-cncr2820720220>3.0.co;2-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fibronectin (Fn) receptor integrin, alpha 5 beta 1, was the only integrin expressed in suspension cultured K562 cells. When the cells were exposed to 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) immunoreactivity for the beta 1 integrin subunit was slightly enhanced. TPA exposure also induced the appearance of the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha v and beta 3 integrin subunits, but the platelet integrin subunit alpha IIb was not detected. On the other hand, hemin chloride-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells diminished the expression of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin on the surface of the cells. Adhesion experiments with TPA-exposed K562 cells indicated that although the adherence to the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as a rule was low a few cells spread on these proteins. The present results specify the effects of differentiation inducers on the integrin profile of K562 cells and excludes the comprehension that TPA would induce expression of the platelet integrin alpha IIb on their surface.

The latter two systems represent terminally differentiated erythroblasts. Using these model systems, we have shown asynchronous synthesis of membrane proteins during erythroid differentiation. At the early stages of erythroid development, the synthesis of spectrin, ankyrin and band 4.1 proteins is initiated before that of the band 3 protein. Following erythroid induction with erythropoietin and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), there is a dramatic increase in the synthesis of the band 3 protein without noticeable changes in the synthesis of other membrane proteins. This increase in band 3 synthesis is accompanied by increased stability and recruitment of the skeletal proteins into the membrane skeleton, leading to increased steady state levels. The progressive increase in band 3 synthesis continues during terminal maturation of erythroblasts. This is accompanied by increased stability and assembly of spectrin and ankyrin on the membrane, despite their reduced synthesis. These results point to a key role for the band 3 protein in anchoring and stabilizing these proteins into the permanent skeletal network. Finally, to detect defects of skeletal biosynthesis, we have extended these studies to a patient with severe hereditary spherocytosis characterized by a combined deficiency of spectrin and ankyrin. We have shown that this combined deficiency is a consequence of reduced ankyrin synthesis and mRNA content representing a thalassemia-like membrane protein mutation.","['Hanspal, M', 'Prchal, J T', 'Palek, J']","['Hanspal M', 'Prchal JT', 'Palek J']","[""Department of Biomedical Research, St. Elizabeth's Hospital of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts 02135.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Ankyrins)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ankyrins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Spectrin/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110605 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 May;11 Suppl 1:8-12. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110605.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant clinical and hematological improvements have been described following infusions of fetal liver cells without evidence of engraftment. These improvements have been attributed to the ability of the infused cells to promote regeneration of autologous hematopoiesis and to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. These possibilities are worthy of evaluation in relation to the production of putative regulators of cellular proliferation in the liver. Meanwhile a suppressor of tumor growth is being used to purge bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation.

We provide evidence that a characteristic shared by a diverse group of compounds with demonstrated leukemogenic potential is the ability to act synergistically with GM-CSF. This results in an increase in recruitment of a resting population of hematopoietic progenitor cells normally unresponsive to the cytokine and a twofold increase in the size of the proliferating cell population normally regarded to be at risk of transformation in leukemogenesis.

The aim of the present work was to assess, quantitatively and functionally, the possibility that prostaglandin E2, (PGE2), an NK cell inhibitor, may be responsible for the absence of NK-cell-mediated activity in normal and/or erythroleukemia-bearing infant DBA/2 mice prior to the normal age-related onset of NK-cell-mediated lytic capacity. Infants (7 days after birth) were exposed daily to indomethacin via intraperitoneal injection for 10 days and/or recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) daily for 4 days. Significant increases in the number of NK cells in both the spleen and bone marrow were found after 10 days of indomethacin or 4 days of rIL-2 in normal mice. The spleens but not the bone marrow of infants treated with indomethacin from tumor onset (7 days after birth) contained significantly more NK cells 10 days later than did control (tumor+vehicle) infants. Infants treated with rIL-2 during the last 4 days of tumor bearing, i.e., days 13-16 after birth, contained significantly more NK cells in both their spleen and bone marrow, while combined administration of rIL-2 and indomethacin to tumor-bearing, but not normal, infants resulted in a more than additive increase in the NK cell numbers in both organs relative to control (tumor+vehicle or vehicle alone). However, in neither normal nor tumor-bearing infants, could indomethacin, rIL-2, or a combination of both, induce the development of NK-cell-mediated functional (lytic) activity in spite of the generation, in nearly all instances, of high levels of NK cells in the presence of these agents. The observations collectively suggest that the lack of functional (lytic) reactivity of infant-source NK cells, in the presence of agents which potently enhance adult-source NK cells, reflects (1) the innate immaturity of infant NK lineage cells, or (2) the presence in infant NK-cell-containing organs of a function-suppressive mechanism which is indomethacin insensitive, i.e., not PGE2-mediated. The significantly prolonged survival, and even cure, of infant leukemic mice treated with indomethacin and/or rIL-2 may result from the agent-mediated elevated levels of precursor NK cells coming under the influence of some age-related, as yet unidentified, endogenous factor imbuing them with functional capacity.","['Dussault, I', 'Miller, S C']","['Dussault I', 'Miller SC']","['Department of Anatomy, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun,Natural immunity,9206126,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Suckling/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Dinoprostone/physiology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun. 1993 Mar-Apr;12(2):66-78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urinary neopterin and pseudouridine concentrations in healthy subjects amounted to: 106.6 +/- 34.6 mumol/mol creatinine, and 19.6 +/- 5.2 mmol/mol creatinine (mean +/- SD), respectively. The increase of neopterin excretion in patients with haematological neoplasms ranged from 146% in Hodgkin's disease to 534% in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, whereas the increase in cancer cases ranged from 95% in adenocarcinoma of the gaster to 741% in hepatocellular carcinoma. The changes in pseudouridine excretion were much less pronounced: 63% in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 120% in carcinoma of the urinary bladder. The correlation coefficient between neopterin and pseudouridine was relatively low (r = 0.43), although statistically significant (P < 0.01). In the case of several neoplasms e.g. Hodgkin's disease, polycythaemia vera, and adenocarcinoma of the gaster, neopterin was significantly elevated, whereas pseudouridine remained at a normal concentration. There was a positive relationship between the stage of the disease (primary focus, regional metastases, dissemination) and urinary concentration of pseudouridine in patients with adenocarcinoma of the large intestine. In the same patients the increase of neopterin excretion was noticed both in early and advanced stages, with the highest values in disseminated disease.","['Motyl, T', 'Traczyk, Z', 'Holska, W', 'Daniewska-Michalska, D', 'Ciesluk, S', 'Kukulska, W', 'Kaluzny, Z', 'Podgurniak, M']","['Motyl T', 'Traczyk Z', 'Holska W', 'Daniewska-Michalska D', 'Ciesluk S', 'Kukulska W', 'Kaluzny Z', 'Podgurniak M']","['Department of Animal Physiology, Veterinary Faculty, Warsaw Agricultural University, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem,European journal of clinical chemistry and clinical biochemistry : journal of the Forum of European Clinical Chemistry Societies,9105775,"['1445-07-4 (Pseudouridine)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/urine', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Creatinine/*urine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*urine', 'Lymphoma/*urine', 'Neoplasms/*urine', 'Neopterin', 'Pseudouridine/*urine', 'RNA, Transfer/metabolism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/cclm.1993.31.4.205 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem. 1993 Apr;31(4):205-9. doi: 10.1515/cclm.1993.31.4.205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For identification of all cell elements of the megakaryocytopoiesis we used the monoclonal antibody CD61 (Y2/51) and for the macrophages, the recently characterized antibody PG-M1. Density of argyrophilic fibers was determined per fat cell-free marrow area. Based on a multivariate analysis-derived risk model, the reproducibility of the prognostic score described by Sokal and co-workers was tested, particularly with regard to histological variables. Additionally, we calculated the disease-specific loss in life expectancy. Our prognostic model (Cox model) consisted of the variables: age, spleen size, peripheral erythro-normoblasts, pseudo-Gaucher cells, and fiber density. To assess the validity of this new CML score, a receiver-operating curve (ROC) of sensitivity and specificity was constructed. The improved prognostic efficiency of this newly developed risk model in predicting death within 3 years after diagnosis of CML was demonstrated in comparison with generally accepted staging systems. Immunohistochemistry revealed that not the total number of macrophages, but only the subfraction of pseudo-Gaucher cells exerted a significant impact on survival. Furthermore, it was feasible to calculate the number of atypical micromegakaryocytes and pro- and megakaryoblasts. This abnormal and immature cell population showed a significant correlation with fiber density and prognosis. Finally, the practical value of the Hannover classification was tested. This histological classification enabled a discrimination between two groups with different survival patterns, i.e., granulocyte and/or megakaryocyte-rich subtypes versus subtypes with increase in reticulin and collagen fibers.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Titius, B R', 'Parpert, U', 'Nebel, R', 'Zankovich, R', 'Dienemann, D', 'Stein, H', 'Diehl, V', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Titius BR', 'Parpert U', 'Nebel R', 'Zankovich R', 'Dienemann D', 'Stein H', 'Diehl V', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01695971 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 Jun;66(6):291-302. doi: 10.1007/BF01695971.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed the effects of R-VPM in vitro, on clonogenic leukemia cells (CFU-L) from 15 patients with acute nonlymphoid leukemia (ANLL) at diagnosis, and on bone marrow erythroid (BFU-E) and myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitors from 15 healthy volunteers. On CFU-L, continuous exposure to VPM or R-VPM alone showed a slight inhibitory activity; in combination with daunorubicin (DNR), R-VPM proved more effective (mean IC50 of DNR: alone = 24.53 ng/ml +/- 6.2 SE, + VPM = 18.8 ng/ml +/- 4.6 SE, +R-VPM = 17.9 ng/ml +/- 4.8 SE). On CFU-GM, both VPM and R-VPM were minimally toxic at the lowest concentration used, but 30 microM VPM were significantly more toxic than R-VPM at the same dose (residual growth = 39.2% +/- 6.5% vs. 71.8% +/- 9.3% with R-VPM, p = 0.005). On BFU-E, both VPM and R-VPM caused more consistent growth inhibition; at high doses, VPM was again more toxic than R-VPM (33.4% +/- 12.8% vs 53.4% +/- 10.4% residual growth at 30 microM, p = 0.03). DNR toxicity on bone marrow was more greatly enhanced by VPM than R-VPM, and this difference was statistically significant on erythroid progenitor colony growth (p = 0.04). In conclusion, in comparison to VPM, R-VPM appeared to be at least equally effective on leukemic clonogenic cells and less toxic on normal bone marrow precursors, thus suggesting a possible safe use in vivo, even in concentrations that cannot be achieved with VPM, owing to its toxic effects.","['Visani, G', 'Fogli, M', 'Tosi, P', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Gamberi, B', 'Cenacchi, A', 'Manfroi, S', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Fogli M', 'Tosi P', 'Ottaviani E', 'Gamberi B', 'Cenacchi A', 'Manfroi S', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology L e A.

We attempted to assess its suitability as an alternative by comparing the pharmacokinetics of both drugs in a small group of children with lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Patients were included who were in their second or subsequent remission, who would otherwise have received 6-MP, and on whom pharmacokinetic data concerning 6-MP metabolism had been collected in a previous remission. Plasma 6-TG concentrations were assayed following an oral dose of 40 mg m-2, and the accumulation and fluctuation of intracellular (erythrocyte, RBC) 6-TG nucleotides (6-TGNs) were measured at regular intervals during daily oral therapy. Seven children were studied. Plasma 6-TG concentrations were low and cleared within 6 h of oral dosing. At 7 days, 6-TGN concentrations ranged from 959 to 2361 pmol 8 x 10(-8) RBCs, in all cases significantly higher (P = 0.002) than those produced by the same patients on 6-MP. After a total therapy time of 35 patient months, a modest rise of alanine aminotransferase was seen on one occasion, otherwise no toxicity apart from myelosuppression was encountered. In the context used, 6-TG appears well tolerated and produces higher concentrations of intracellular cytotoxic metabolites than 6-MP.

The number of people around the world infected with HTLV-I can be estimated as between 10 and 20 million (Table 1). HTLV-I causes a rapidly progressing adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and an incurable progressive neuromyelopathy named tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM), as well as a number of less well-studied syndromes. There is evidence that coinfection with HTLV-I or -II accelerates progression to AIDS. The cumulative lifetime risk of developing ATLL or TSP/HAM is around 5%, which, in terms of the induction of serious diseases, places HTLV-I in the same category of viruses for which efficient vaccines are made and used. Furthermore, there are factors favoring the feasibility of a vaccine against HTLV-I, in that the virus displays relatively low antigenic variability, natural immunity occurs in humans, and experimental vaccination with the envelope (Env) antigen is successful in animal models. A vaccine against HTLV-I would be of significant public health value in the fields of oncology, neurology, and AIDS, and it would serve as a pathfinder for a vaccine against HIV.","['de The, G', 'Bomford, R']","['de The G', 'Bomford R']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (AIDS Vaccines)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['AIDS Vaccines/isolation & purification', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/immunology', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Viral Vaccines/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1993.9.381 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1993 May;9(5):381-6. doi: 10.1089/aid.1993.9.381.,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the amino acid sequence of the V3 loop is hypervariable, it contains a conserved region, Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg, that shows similarity to the active-site Gly-Pro-Cys-Arg sequence of inter-alpha-trypsin and trypstatin proteinase inhibitors. The purpose of the present work was to identify proteinases recognizing substrates with basic amino acids in the P1 substrate site that are present in MOLT-4 cells, a human CD4-positive T helper lymphocyte cell line, and to characterize these enzymes in terms of substrate, pH and ionic-strength preferences, size and susceptibility to various inhibitors, including 24- and 36-amino-acid-long V3 loop peptides. Extraction of MOLT-4 cells at low ionic strength solubilized nearly all of the trypsin-like activity, which was separable into five peaks of activity by chromatography on Mono-Q: Peaks 1, 2a, 2b, 3 and 4. All showed a neutral pH optimum, and all except Peak 4 showed optimal activity at high ionic strength. Peak 1 preferred Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg, p-nitroanilide (-pNA) substrate; Peaks 2-4 preferred benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA. Peak 1, a zinc-dependent enzyme with serine and histidine in the active site, exhibited an M(r) of 75,000 on Superose 12 and was poorly inhibited by V3 loop peptides. Peak 2 contained two overlapping peaks, called 2a and 2b, that exhibited properties of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. Gel filtration of Peak 2 activities revealed a major peak of activity at 81 kDa and a shoulder centred at 240 kDa. Each was modestly inhibited by V3 loop peptides. Peak 3, a zinc-dependent proteinase, exhibited a molecular mass of 100 kDa by gel filtration and was particularly sensitive to inhibition by V3 loop peptides. Peak 4 exhibited a molecular mass of 1100 kDa by gel filtration and was not inhibited by V3 loop peptides. None of these enzymes could be classified as mast-cell tryptase, and material in MOLT-4 cells cross-reactive with anti-(human tryptase) antibodies was not detected. Whether any of the MOLT-4 proteinases described in this study play a role in HIV-1 infectivity remains to be examined.","['Harvima, I T', 'Harvima, R J', 'Nilsson, G', 'Ivanoff, L', 'Schwartz, L B']","['Harvima IT', 'Harvima RJ', 'Nilsson G', 'Ivanoff L', 'Schwartz LB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amino Acids, Diamino)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Amino Acids, Diamino', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Endopeptidases/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/metabolism', 'HIV-1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2920711 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1993 Jun 15;292 ( Pt 3):711-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2920711.,,['AI-20487/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC1134172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together with infectious, inflammatory and neoplasic processes, invasion of haematopoietic tissue explains the haematological alterations which are seen during the course of infection with HIV-1. Anaemia develops in the large proportion of patients. Thrombocytopenia frequently occurs during the course of the disease, but may be seen in some patients already at the time of diagnosis, where the condition may be misdiagnosed as ""idiopathic"" thrombocytopenic purpura. Neutropenia is seen in all disease stages, but is most severe in patients with advanced disease. Bone marrow changes include varying degrees of dysplasia in one or more cell lines, which in some patients may mimic a myelodysplastic syndrome. The number of plasma cells is always increased. In many patients the bone marrow stroma exhibits an increased amount of reticular fibres. HIV-1 infection is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma. Acute myelogenous leukaemia and myelomatosis have been described in patients with advanced disease. Treatment of the above mentioned haematological abnormalities aims primarily at reducing replication of HIV-1, thereby diminishing suppression of haematopoiesis by the virus infection, and at controlling the opportunistic infections during the course of the disease. Specific antiviral therapy (AZT) is most successful in correcting thrombocytopenia. The possibility of bone marrow suppression mediated by a toxic drug effect should always be considered in this patient group.","['Moller, T', 'Hasselbalch, H C']","['Moller T', 'Hasselbalch HC']","['Epidemiafdeling M, Rigshospitalet, Kobenhavn.']",['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*blood/complications/pathology', '*HIV-1', 'Hematologic Diseases/*etiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male']",1993/05/10 00:00,1993/05/10 00:01,['1993/05/10 00:00'],"['1993/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 1993 May 10;155(19):1442-6.,30,,Haematologiske forandringer ved infektion med human immundefekt virus (HIV-1).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast it was detected only in trace quantities in a minority of healthy subjects. In the CLL group no significant correlation was observed between monomeric IgM and the total serum IgM level or the absolute lymphocyte count. Mitogen stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients were observed to secrete monomeric and oligomeric IgM in-vitro. Experiments manipulating the microenvironment of an IgM secreting cell line revealed that the addition of low concentrations of the reducing reagent 2-mercaptoethanol to the culture medium would enhance the proportions of monomeric IgM in the culture supernatant and the cellular cytoplasmic lysate. However the same concentrations would not directly reduce the secreted IgM.

Originating from the wild-type CEM-C7 cells are two dex-resistant clones which are not lysed by 1 microM dex and have functionally defective glucocorticoid receptors (GR). They are receptorless ICR27TK.3 and activation-labile 4R4 cells. ICR27TK.3 and 4R4 cells have distinct cellular phenotypes, as indicated by dissimilar numbers of dex-binding sites despite similar levels of GR mRNA and immunochemically detectable GR. We have now investigated the molecular defects in the GR of ICR27TK.3 and 4R4 cells by determining the nucleotide sequence of their GR. Our results support the biochemical evidence previously reported by others for the presence of both a normal (GR+) and a mutant (GR*) allele in CEM-C7 cells. We clearly show that the wild-type CEM-C7 cells express two alleles of GR, the normal GR+ and the abnormal GR*, which has a Leu753--> Phe753 mutation. We demonstrate that both ICR27TK.3 and 4R4 cells contain only the abnormal GR* and that the normal GR+ gene is deleted in both of these GR defective clones. Our results further show that the GR* is basically an activation-labile receptor and has diminished functional capability in a transfection assay measuring GR-driven transcription. Thus, these two phenotypically different cell lines express similar amounts of an identical GR* containing a single point mutation at amino acid 753. A single point mutation in the steroid-binding domain of the GR, therefore, may behave differently, depending on the cellular milieu in which it is expressed.","['Ashraf, J', 'Thompson, E B']","['Ashraf J', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550-0645.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.7.5.8316249 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1993 May;7(5):631-42. doi: 10.1210/mend.7.5.8316249.,,['CA-41407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SERA: Samples from 1897 Aborigines, including 1569 sera received by the Royal Darwin Hospital Pathology Department for syphilis serology between March and July 1988. Most of the specimens were from public health surveys and antenatal screening. RESULTS: Ninety-four samples (5.0%) were positive by the particle-agglutination assay method but only 36 (1.9%) were positive by both particle-agglutination assay and indirect immunofluorescence. After confirmation by western blot, the seroprevalence of HTLV-I was 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.3%).

Rearrangements and/or delections of the IgH and Ig kappa genes were detected in 100 and 47% of patients in this series of precursor B-ALL, respectively. Multiple rearranged IgH gene bands, generally differing in density, were found in 10 precursor B-ALL samples. This multi-band pattern is most probably caused by subclone formation due to continuing rearrangement processes. In five of the 10 bi/oligoclonal cases (50%) differences in IgH gene rearrangement patterns between BM and PB samples were observed, which could be interpreted as the presence of an edeletections of the IgH and Ig kappa genestra subclone in two cases and differences in the size of the subclones in three cases. In the 20 monoclonal precursor B-ALL, no dissimilarities in IgH gene rearrangement patterns between BM and the corresponding PB samples were found. Differences in Ig kappa gene rearrangement patterns between BM and PB were not observed in this series of precursor B-ALL, which is in line with the finding that no multiple Ig kappa gene rearrangements were detectable. In all five cases, the edelections of the IgH and Ig kappa genestra subclones or the relatively larger sized subclones were found in the BM samples, suggesting that subclone formation in precursor B-ALL occurs in the tissue compartment from which the precursor B-ALL cells are thought to originate. This phenomenon will lead to underestimation of subclone formation, if only IgH gene analysis of PB samples is performed. In addition, it will hamper the detection of minimal residual disease by the polymerase chain reaction mediated amplification of 'leukemia-specific' IgH gene junctional regions, because it is unpredictable which subclone will cause minimal residual disease and/or relapse.","['Beishuizen, A', 'Verhoeven, M A', 'Hahlen, K', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Beishuizen A', 'Verhoeven MA', 'Hahlen K', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Corrected and Republished Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jun;7(6):60-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia 1992 Jan;6(1):60-3'],,,

The surface characters of the blasts were CD13+, CD33+, and HLA-DR+, and blood culture tests were positive. Coagulation tests revealed DIC. Based on the foregoing results, hypoplastic leukemia was diagnosed accompanied by sepsis and DIC, and was placed on the concomitant administration of a combination of low dose Ara-C and M-CSF. After 14 days of Ara-C administration and 26 days of M-CSF, her clinical symptoms improved, with the peripheral blood showing a WBC of 2,800/microliters and platelet count of 111,000/microliters. The percentage of myeloblasts decreased to 7.0%. After the administration of Ara-C was suspended for 2 weeks, another course of low dose Ara-C plus M-CSF administration was carried out and the patient achieved full remission. M-CSF stimulates not only the production of monocytes but increases the number of neutrophils and platelets through monocytes. It is also expected that tumoricidal activity may be realized by the activation of monocytes. In this patients, the concomitant administration of M-CSF and low dose Ara-C was remarkably effective in treating hypoplastic leukemia with severe complication.

The surface antigen on U937 cells recognized by NI-58 had a molecular size of 65 kDa as determined by immunoblotting analysis. As a biological function, NI-58 strongly inhibited the homotypic cell adhesion of LPS-stimulated U937 cells.

Four of 14 patients with myelopathy and three of 16 patients with lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma were seropositive for HTLV-I/II. Sixty-three of 68 HTLV-I/II-positive specimens were then typed: 53 patients were HTLV-I positive, three patients were HTLV-II positive, and in seven patients the assay could not distinguish infection by HTLV-I or II. The finding among HIV-seropositive intravenous drug users in Bahia of coinfection with HTLV-I is contrasted with reports from other areas in which dual infection occurs with HTLV-II.

These viruses are transmitted horizontally by intimate contact or through blood products. The study of chromosomal changes in these T cells may enhance our understanding of the nature and mechanism of these viral infections. However, because of the cytopathic effect of these viruses on T cells, the direct observation of abnormalities in these cells is sometimes difficult. We performed chromosomal analysis on six HTLV-I cell lines from patients with HTLV-I-positive leukemia/lymphoma, one HTLV-I variant cell line, and two HTLV-II-positive cell lines. The results of these studies were compared with the findings in an earlier (published) study of direct preparations and short-term cultures of cells from 11 HTLV-I-positive NIH patients. Our study also included cytogenetic analysis of seven established cell lines and six normal peripheral bloods infected in vitro with the HTLV-IIIB strain of HIV-1 (five cell lines and six bloods) or HIV-2 (two lines); all were studied both before and after viral infection. The results showed that all six HTLV-I cell lines and the variant cell line had multiple chromosomal changes: three lines had deletions of chromosome 6, with breakpoints between q21 and q25. Nine of the 11 NIH patients with HTLV-I had clonal abnormalities, and six of these nine had chromosome 6 deletions with breakpoints ranging from band q11 to band q23. The high incidence of 6q involvement may be of considerable significance in this clinical subgroup of HTLV-I patients. The two HTLV-II cell lines were established from patients suffering from HTLV-II infection. Both of these cell lines had translocations of chromosome 21 at p11, and both had extra copies of chromosome 20; no known oncogenes or receptors are located on these two chromosomes. Chromosome 17 was the chromosome most frequently involved (three lines) in the five HIV-1-infected cell lines, followed by chromosomes 3 and 21; it is of interest that NGL (also known as C-ERBB2 or NEU oncogene), CD7 (a lymphocyte antigen), HTLV-1 receptor, NGFR (nerve growth factor receptor), and MIC6 are all cell surface antigens coded by genes on chromosome 17q. No specific chromosome abnormalities were found in the normal blood samples infected with HIV-1, and no unique chromosome changes were noted in the two cell lines infected with HIV-2; however, the infected H9 line had a chromosome 17 abnormality, a translocation involving band 17p11.","['Whang-Peng, J', 'Chen, Y M', 'Knutsen, T', 'Zhao, W P', 'Tsai, S']","['Whang-Peng J', 'Chen YM', 'Knutsen T', 'Zhao WP', 'Tsai S']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*microbiology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'HIV-2/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1993 Aug;6(8):930-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Presenting features and leukemic cell characteristics were compared for 76 patients with Down syndrome and 4,733 other patients with newly diagnosed ALL treated on protocols of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) and St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). Treatment outcome was analyzed for the patients with non-T-cell disease enrolled on a single trial, for whom adequate follow-up data were available. RESULTS: Down syndrome patients had lower platelet counts (P < .01) and were less likely to have an anterior mediastinal mass (P < .01) or CNS leukemia (P = .01). They were significantly more likely to have the pre-B immunophenotype (49% v 25.5%, P < .01) and less likely to have T-cell ALL (5.5% v 16%, P = .01). There was a notable absence among patients with Down syndrome of the t(4;11), t(1;19), and t(9;22), which are chromosomal translocations associated with an adverse prognosis in ALL. Treatment outcome did not differ significantly between patients with Down syndrome and the other children with non-T-cell ALL (P = .21); a third of the treatment failures in the former group resulted from treatment-related toxicities. CONCLUSION: Children with Down syndrome and ALL had a low frequency of adverse clinicobiologic features at diagnosis. However, these findings did not translate into a superior outcome, apparently because of treatment-related toxicity in this group. Future trials should focus on pharmacokinetics and other strategies to reduce toxicity in these compromised patients.","['Pui, C H', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Land, V J', 'Behm, F G', 'Pullen, D J', 'Hancock, M L', 'Shuster, J J', 'Steuber, C P', 'Crist, W M']","['Pui CH', 'Raimondi SC', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Land VJ', 'Behm FG', 'Pullen DJ', 'Hancock ML', 'Shuster JJ', 'Steuber CP', 'Crist WM', 'et al.']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*genetics']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.7.1361 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jul;11(7):1361-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.7.1361.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with AML in REL1 (n = 21) or in REM2 (n = 26) were treated with busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) with or without total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by ABMT. All REL1 patients and four REM2 patients had marrow stored during first remission (REM1). Twenty-seven had marrow stored with and 20 without treatment in vitro with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC). Eighteen patients received BU and CY and 29 received BU, CY, and TBI. REL1 patients relapsed within a median of 9 months (range, 2 to 26) after marrow harvest and were transplanted a median of 30 days (range, 9 to 87) from detection of relapse. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 2.1 years (range, 0.4 to 5.3), 19 patients survive in remission (10 of 21 in REL1; nine of 26 in REM2). The actuarial probabilities of relapse-free survival at 2 years for patients transplanted in REL1 and REM2 were 45% +/- 22% and 32% +/- 18%, respectively (P = .33). The corresponding probabilities of relapse were 30% +/- 26% and 44% +/- 23%, respectively (P = .45). No conclusions could be drawn about the benefits of adding TBI to BU plus CY. There were no significant differences in neutrophil or platelet recovery or in posttransplant probabilities of relapse and nonrelapse mortality between patients who received marrow treated or not treated with 4-HC. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ABMT may produce long-term leukemia-free survival in approximately one third of patients with AML in REL1 or in REM2. There is no apparent clinical advantage in attempting to obtain second remissions in relapsed patients before ABMT if marrow has been cryopreserved during REM1. Although a strategy of transplantation in REL1 has advantages for the patient, such an approach involves the storage of marrow, which may not be used, and is impractical without the coordinated support of the treating physician, the patient, and the marrow transplant center.","['Petersen, F B', 'Lynch, M H', 'Clift, R A', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Sanders, J E', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Benyunes, M C', 'Doney, K', 'Fefer, A', 'Martin, P']","['Petersen FB', 'Lynch MH', 'Clift RA', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Sanders JE', 'Bensinger WI', 'Benyunes MC', 'Doney K', 'Fefer A', 'Martin P', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.7.1353 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jul;11(7):1353-60. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.7.1353.,,"['T32 CA009515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients who presented with primary, mediastinal large-cell and immunoblastic lymphoma were retrospectively studied to determine initial sites of disease, radiologic characteristics, treatment, outcome, and factors that have prognostic significance for progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Fifty-six of the 57 patients had disease that was confined to sites above the diaphragm. Bulky disease and extensive intrathoracic infiltration were common in these patients. All patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens, and 44% of patients received chest irradiation. The overall 5-year survival by Kaplan-Meier estimation was 50% with a freedom-from-relapse rate of 45%. Predictors of disease relapse after chemotherapy included the presence of a pleural effusion (P = .015), a number of involved extranodal sites (P < .01), and a lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) ratio > 3.0 (LDH value/upper limit of assay; P = .04) as well as an incomplete treatment response as evidenced by residual mass on chest radiograph (P = .02) or persistent gallium 67 avidity (P = .01) after chemotherapy. Predictors of decreased survival included the presence of pleural effusion (P = .001), the number of involved extranodal sites (P = .022), and a positive posttreatment 67Ga scan (P = .027). CONCLUSION: Patients with primary mediastinal large-cell and immunoblastic lymphoma have an approximate 50% chance of surviving disease-free after initial therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; n = 23), Hodgkin's disease (HD, n = 32), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 2) with a history of previous radiation therapy were treated with cyclophosphamide (Cy; 7.2 g/m2), carmustine (300 mg/m2 or 600 mg/m2), and etoposide (2,400 mg/m2) (CBV) followed by ABMT. RESULTS: The projected 2-year probabilities of survival, event-free survival (EFS), and relapse were .31, .24, and .76, respectively. For patients with intermediate- and high-grade lymphoma and HD the probabilities were .27, .10, and .14 for EFS and .57, .90, and .77 for relapse. The probability of nonrelapse mortality in the first 100 days post-ABMT was 33%. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) was observed in no patients who received carmustine 300 mg/m2 and 23% of patients who received carmustine 600 mg/m2 (P = .05). Eight-three percent of patients who received mediastinal radiation therapy less than 3 months before transplant developed IPS, compared with 13% who received radiation therapy more than 3 months before transplant (P = .001). CONCLUSION: ABMT following high-dose CBV resulted in long-term disease-free survival in 25% of patients with lymphoid malignancies who had previously received dose-limiting radiation therapy. Fatal IPS and a high relapse rate were major factors limiting successful outcome following ABMT. The morbidity and mortality rates associated with the administration of carmustine 600 mg/m2 were prohibitively high, especially in patients who received mediastinal radiation immediately before ABMT, and were not associated with a decrease in post-ABMT relapse.","['Weaver, C H', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Petersen, F B', 'Clift, R', 'Singer, J', 'Press, O', 'Bensinger, W', 'Bianco, J', 'Martin, P', 'Anasetti, C']","['Weaver CH', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Petersen FB', 'Clift R', 'Singer J', 'Press O', 'Bensinger W', 'Bianco J', 'Martin P', 'Anasetti C', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'CBV protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.7.1329 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jul;11(7):1329-35. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.7.1329.,,"['CA 09319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chimeric gene was expressed in Escherichia coli where large amounts of the chimeric toxin, hIL4-PE4E, was produced. Purified hIL4-PE4E was very cytotoxic to cancer cell lines of both hematopoietic and solid tumor origin. In the HUT 102 T cell leukemia and Daudi B cell lymphoma cell lines, protein synthesis was inhibited by 50% (ID50) at a hIL4-PE4E concentration of 2 and 7 ng/ml (25 and 86 pM, respectively). hIL4-PE4E was also very cytotoxic to cell lines derived from carcinomas of the colon, breast, stomach, liver, adrenals, and prostate, as well as melanoma and epidermoid carcinoma, indicating that hIL4 receptors are widely expressed on human malignancies. We also found that human phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes were extremely sensitive to hIL4-PE4E with an ID50 of 0.2 ng/ml (2.5 pM). The cytotoxic action of hIL4-PE4E was specific because it was blocked by an excess of hIL4 and not of human interleukin 2. In addition, hIL4-PE4ED553, an enzymatically inactive form of the chimeric toxin, was not cytotoxic. These results suggest that the hIL4 receptor may be a target for therapy in malignant and immunologic disorders using hIL4 chimeric toxin.","['Debinski, W', 'Puri, R K', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Pastan, I']","['Debinski W', 'Puri RK', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Exotoxins/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virulence Factors']",1993/07/05 00:00,1993/07/05 00:01,['1993/07/05 00:00'],"['1993/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85209-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jul 5;268(19):14065-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The N-terminal 19-amino acid segment of Rex has been identified as the nucleolar targeting signal (NOS) and shown to be important for Rex function. To study the molecular interaction between the NOS region of Rex and its binding host protein(s) in the nucleolus, we chemically synthesized a functional NOS peptide (wild type) and mutant NOS peptides. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated functional NOS peptide was rapidly taken up by human cells and was transported to the nucleolus. Using affinity chromatography, we identified nucleolar protein B-23 as the major protein that binds to NOS. We also identified two highly acidic regions of B-23 (amino acids 120-132 and 161-188) as acceptor regions for NOS. Previous experiments have suggested that B-23 functions as a shuttle protein for the nucleolar transport of ribosomal components. Our results suggest that B-23 may also serve as a shuttle for the import of Rex from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus coupled to the export of viral mRNAs containing the Rex-responsive element.","['Adachi, Y', 'Copeland, T D', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Adachi Y', 'Copeland TD', 'Hatanaka M', 'Oroszlan S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/05 00:00,1993/07/05 00:01,['1993/07/05 00:00'],"['1993/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85191-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jul 5;268(19):13930-4.,,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to the short half-life of Ara-C in blood due to rapid deamination, varying infusion velocities will result in markedly varying plasma levels. Higher peak plasma levels lead to proportionally higher diffusion into compartments like tears, aqueous humor and cerebrospinal fluid. In compartments which lack noteworthy deaminase activity, dose intensity will be much more enhanced than in plasma. Peak plasma levels, therefore, may be associated with multifold local toxicity without concurrent increase of hematological toxicity. Especially when the drug is given in small volumes of infusion, these considerations should be taken into account. Precise control of infusion parameters and application of artificial tears for dilution of the Ara-C concentration on the corneal surface should be part of keratitis prophylaxis.","['Boos, J', 'Bomelburg, T', 'Gerding, H', 'Jurgens, H']","['Boos J', 'Bomelburg T', 'Gerding H', 'Jurgens H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol,"International journal of clinical pharmacology, therapy, and toxicology",8003415,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Keratitis/*chemically induced']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol. 1993 Dec;31(12):593-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfer of graded numbers of thymocytes from an irradiated mouse into recipient mice indicated that PL cells first appear in the thymus 6 weeks after irradiation. The initial proportion of the thymic PL cells is > or = 10(-5) and their frequency continuously increases with time, reaching > or = 10(-3) 10 weeks after irradiation. The PL cell population that emerges early during the pre-malignant latency consists of pleioclonal T lymphocytes. However, within 4 weeks a dominant PL clone can be detected which becomes the progenitor of a clonal lymphoma 9 to 15 weeks later. These results suggest that radiation leukemogenesis involves continuous accumulation of pleioclonal PL cells in the thymus, one of which is then selected for further maturation into frank lymphoma.","['Kotler, M', 'Ruchlemer, R', 'Avni, O', 'Yefenof, E']","['Kotler M', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Avni O', 'Yefenof E']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Preleukemia/etiology', 'Thymus Gland/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910560525 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Mar 1;56(5):761-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910560525.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 390 samples from 20 diagnoses were tested with up to 12 standard cytotoxic drugs. The technical success rate for different tumor types ranged from 67 to 95%. Fluorescence was linearly related to cell number but variably steep depending on tumor type. Samples from most solid tumors thus showed higher signal-to-noise ratios than hematological samples. A wide spectrum of in vitro drug activity was obtained, with acute leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas being sensitive to almost all tested drugs, whereas renal and adrenocortical carcinomas were essentially totally resistant. Between these extremes were samples of breast and ovarian carcinomas and sarcomas. When in vitro response was compared with known clinical response patterns, a good correspondence was observed. The results indicate that the FMCA is a rapid and efficient method for in vitro measurement of tumor-specific drug activity both in hematological and in solid tumors.

In females a steady decline in mortality was observed for all sites combined. Major decreases were seen for oesophageal, gastric, cervical and total uterine cancers. The only cancers showing significant increases were breast cancer, and lung cancer for the most recent period.

Studies on alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (n = 10), acute myeloid leukaemias (3), B-lymphoblastic lymphomas (8), blastema-rich nephroblastomas (9), neuroblastomas (20) and retinoblastomas (10) as well as single examples of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Ki-1 anaplastic lymphoma of indeterminate phenotype and intra-abdominal desmoplastic tumour with divergent differentiation were negative. 12E7 is a sensitive marker for the Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal group of tumours and is useful in distinguishing them from neuroblastoma and blastema-rich nephroblastoma. However, immunopositivity for 12E7 should be interpreted in conjunction with the results of neural and lymphoid markers.","['Ramani, P', 'Rampling, D', 'Link, M']","['Ramani P', 'Rampling D', 'Link M']","['Department of Histopathology, Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibromatosis, Aggressive/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/*pathology', 'Retinoblastoma/pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*pathology', 'Wilms Tumor/pathology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1993.tb01243.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1993 Dec;23(6):557-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1993.tb01243.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An immunohistochemical study was designed to study the follicular dendritic cell patterns in 21 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma which had been classified using the updated Kiel classification. Three patterns of distribution were observed: 1 follicular dendritic cells not detected (3 cases); 2 follicular dendritic cells restricted to remnant follicle centres (7); 3 follicular dendritic cells present as an expanded network of cells exceeding the confines of germinal centres (11). Ten out of 11 angioimmunoblastic lymphomas showed an expanded network of follicular dendritic cells. The only negative case showed features which, on review, were in keeping with a pleomorphic, medium and large cell lymphoma showing an unusual proliferation of small venules. Other than angioimmunoblastic lymphomas, only one other case showed follicular dendritic cell hyperplasia. This was an unclassified peripheral T-cell lymphoma. We conclude that follicular dendritic cell hyperplasia may be used an an aid to diagnosis of the angioimmunoblastic type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and we recommend the routine staining of these cells in typing of T-cell lymphomas to facilitate comparison between centres.","['Leung, C Y', 'Ho, F C', 'Srivastava, G', 'Loke, S L', 'Liu, Y T', 'Chan, A C']","['Leung CY', 'Ho FC', 'Srivastava G', 'Loke SL', 'Liu YT', 'Chan AC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1993.tb00491.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1993 Nov;23(5):433-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1993.tb00491.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIEOP Cooperative Group for Immunology of Acute Leukemias.,297-305,"BACKGROUND: Sensitive methods for detecting residual disease may complement conventional morphology while monitoring the response to treatment in leukemia patients. METHODS: We studied minimal residual disease (MRD) by selecting via a colony assay a peripheral blood (PB) cell population enriched in putative malignant cells and detecting occult leukemic cells by double immunologic analysis performed on colonyforming cells (CFC). Using this combined technique we assayed the PB of high risk children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in order to demonstrate possible differences in ""the residual tumor cell burden"" among leukemia patients and to correlate these with a 3-year clinical follow-up. RESULTS: In all 22 patients positive results were obtained for up to 18 months following induction chemotherapy at times of apparent hematologic remission. Common ALL (cALL) patients exhibited a mean of 9.6% cAlla+ cells (range: 2% to 30%), whereas cALL antigen (cALLA) and cALLA/Tdt or CD1a/Tdt combination were never found in the colonies derived from healthy individuals. Six out of 22 cALL patients expressed a mean of 16.5% cALLA+/Tdt+ CFC (range: 2% to 35%). Five T-ALL children presented a mean of 24% CD1a/Tdt+ cells (range: 8% to 44%). Extensive follow-up indicates a correlation between the percentage of CFC Tdt+/lymphoid marker+ cells (more than 10%) and subsequent clinical relapse. In one patient relapse occurred after 16 months with a dramatic increase in the number of leukemic cells. In contrast, the decline in malignant cells, observed in two cases, predicted a favourable course. Five patients tested before autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) presented high number of positive cells and relapsed at various times. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this approach to the study of MRD could be valuable in monitoring the efficacy of chemotherapy, as well in evaluating the quality of purged marrow.","['Consolini, R', 'Scamardella, F', 'Legitimo, A', 'Putti, C', 'Granchi, D', 'Paolucci, P', 'Lippi, A', 'Guazzelli, C', 'Acquaviva, A', 'Rosanda, C']","['Consolini R', 'Scamardella F', 'Legitimo A', 'Putti C', 'Granchi D', 'Paolucci P', 'Lippi A', 'Guazzelli C', 'Acquaviva A', 'Rosanda C', 'et al.']","['Istituto Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Pisa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1993 Sep-Oct;78(5):297-305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been claimed that interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy contributes to the occurrence of autoantibodies in HCL. The study was undertaken to determine the occurrence of autoantibodies in HCL patients prior to IFN-alpha therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera of 24 patients with HCL of B-cell origin (as determined previously by peripheral blood mononuclear cell surface markers and/or DNA rearrangement studies) were investigated. In addition serum from a T-HCL patient was studied. Nineteen of the 25 HCL patients had been splenectomized prior to the study. One patient was found to have IgM lambda monoclonal protein in her serum. Antinuclear antibodies were determined with an indirect IF test using Hep-2 cells. Rheumatoid factors of the IgM and IgA classes were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Granulocyte-specific antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: No clinical syndrome of an autoimmune disease was apparent in any of our HCL-patients. Rheumatoid factors of either IgM or IgA class were found in the sera of six B-HCL patients and antinuclear antibodies in five cases, while anti-cytoplasmic antibodies were identified in only three cases. The occurrence of antibodies seemed to be independent of the clinical stage of the disease as determined according to the functional criteria. Two patients with arthralgias and one with vitiligo had no autoantibodies in their sera.

Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP).,264-9,"BACKGROUND: Since juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML) represents no more than 2% of leukemia in children, clinical and investigative experience of this disorder has been limited. In order to evaluate the diagnostic criteria currently applied, to provide centralized facilities for blood culture and to collect data on treatment, and to propose a uniform treatment protocol in our country, a National Registry for JCML was recently established in the ""Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica"" (AIEOP). PATIENTS: Out of the 24 cases reported from 9/35 centres, 22 were considered sufficiently documented and were enrolled in the Registry. Clonogenic assay on marrow and peripheral blood cells was performed in all available cases. RESULTS: Common features were non-specific clinical (fever, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenomegaly) and hematologic alterations (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis usually < 50 x 10(9)/l, monocytosis, circulating immature granulocytes, increased HbF, normal karyotype). In 11 out of 11 cases, in vitro blood cultures showed the spontaneous growth of CFU-C in the absence of any exogenous source of colony-stimulating activity. Twelve of the 22 patients (55%) are alive (probability of survival 47.7%); most patients were treated according to an acute myeloid leukemia-directed schedule; 5/7 children treated with interferon were alive with disease after a median time of 29 months from diagnosis (range 8-95 months); 4/5 children who underwent bone marrow transplantation were alive in complete remission 10, 24, 42 and 118 months, after the diagnosis. Age < 1 year at presentation was the most significant prognostic factor in terms of probability of survival (80% vs 28%; p = 0.0024). CONCLUSIONS: JCML must be considered in young children for whom acute leukemia has been suspected but ruled out; in vitro cultures should be considered mandatory to confirm the diagnosis. Age less than one year at the presentation was associated with prolonged survival. Only bone marrow transplantation was followed by prolonged disease-free survival, whereas intensive chemotherapy seemed not very effective and potentially associated with life-threatening complications. Interferon therapy appears to be a promising alternative to chemotherapy while the value of unrelated marrow donor is explored.","['Arico, M', 'Bossi, G', 'Schiro, R', 'Galimberti, M', 'Longoni, D', 'Macchia, P', 'Miniero, R', 'Natale, D', 'Pession, A', 'Pillon, M']","['Arico M', 'Bossi G', 'Schiro R', 'Galimberti M', 'Longoni D', 'Macchia P', 'Miniero R', 'Natale D', 'Pession A', 'Pillon M', 'et al.']","[""Clinica Pediatrica dell'Universita di, Pavia IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1993 Sep-Oct;78(5):264-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether development of NGF-independent sensory neurons could be similarly regulated, the present study examined the effects of LIF and the related cytokine-like growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), on survival of rat nodose ganglion (NG) cells in culture. In addition, survival in LIF-treated cultures was compared in the presence and absence of the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NT-3, and NT-4, factors previously shown to target NG sensory neurons, to determine whether the cytokine-like factors and neurotrophins act on the same population of ganglion cells. Treatment of dissociate cultures of Embryonic Day (E) 16.5 NG with LIF or CNTF (10 ng/ml) resulted in a four- to fivefold increase in neuronal survival; the number of neurons supported by either factor represented approximately 50% of the total NG population. In contrast, less than 10% of newborn NG neurons survived in the presence of LIF or CNTF, suggesting a loss in responsiveness to these factors during fetal development in vivo. In cultures of E16.5 ganglia, BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4 alone each increased cell survival to varying degrees (BDNF > NT-4 = LIF > NT-3); NGF, on the other hand, had no effect. Combining LIF with BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4 had only partially additive effects on NG neuron number (LIF + BDNF, 36% greater than BDNF alone; LIF + NT-3, 21% greater than LIF alone; LIF + NT-4, 49% greater than NT-4 or LIF alone; P < 0.05), indicating that LIF and these neurotrophins support survival of overlapping subsets of NG neurons in culture. To begin defining whether NG neurons were capable of responding to CNTF and LIF in vivo, Northern blots were used to examine expression of mRNAs coding for CNTF and LIF receptor components (CNTFR alpha, gp130, and LIFR beta) in the intact ganglion. mRNAs for all three receptor components were present in both E16.5 and newborn ganglia, suggesting that LIF and CNTF receptors are expressed in the NG in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate that LIF and CNTF can support survival of NGF-independent sensory neurons in culture and indicate that cytokine-like growth factors may play a role in regulating visceral sensory development in vivo.","['Thaler, C D', 'Suhr, L', 'Ip, N', 'Katz, D M']","['Thaler CD', 'Suhr L', 'Ip N', 'Katz DM']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/drug effects/*physiology', 'Nodose Ganglion/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/dbio.1994.1035 [doi]', 'S0012-1606(84)71035-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1994 Feb;161(2):338-44. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1994.1035.,,"['HL-42131/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32NS07118/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that two regions are necessary for efficient SNV replication. The first region is a double hairpin structure as proposed by Konings et al. (1992, J. Virol., 66, 632-640); the second region is located downstream of the hairpins. We showed further that the double hairpin structure is required for efficient SNV RNA encapsidation. Our work is the first to demonstrate, via linker-scanning and site-directed mutagenesis, that a specific RNA secondary structure is required for the encapsidation of retroviral RNA. Analysis of a series of mutations within the E region indicates (i) that preserving the secondary structure of the two hairpins is important for efficient encapsidation and (ii) that the stem regions of the hairpins contain specific sequences critical for encapsidation. Within the hairpins, the presence of at least one of the two conserved GACG four-residue loops, but not the moderately conserved bulge sequence of the first hairpin, is crucial for function. The function of the hairpins is independent of the relative order of the two hairpins. However, the two hairpins are not redundant and are not functionally identical. Replacement of SNV double hairpin sequences with those of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) has no detectable effect on the replication of SNV-based retrovirus vectors with reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A (REV-A) helper virus. Furthermore, replacement of the entire E sequence of SNV with that of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV) and M-MLV results in retroviral vectors that replicate as well as SNV vectors with wild type SNV E. This result indicates that the encapsidation sequences of M-MSV/M-MLV and SNV are not virus specific and that, during packaging of SNV and MLV RNA with viral proteins from REV-A, the encapsidation sequences are recognized largely by their secondary or tertiary structures.","['Yang, S', 'Temin, H M']","['Yang S', 'Temin HM']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Feb 1;13(3):713-26.,,"['CA07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC394863,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings strongly suggest that the t(3;21) translocation results in the formation of a new class of chimeric transcription factor which could contribute to the leukemic progression of CML through interference with cell growth and differentiation.","['Mitani, K', 'Ogawa, S', 'Tanaka, T', 'Miyoshi, H', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Mano, H', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Ohki, M', 'Hirai, H']","['Mitani K', 'Ogawa S', 'Tanaka T', 'Miyoshi H', 'Kurokawa M', 'Mano H', 'Yazaki Y', 'Ohki M', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Feb 1;13(3):504-10.,,,,PMC394839,"['AML1', 'EVI-1']",,,['GENBANK/S69002'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined whether human dermal fibroblast cultures could produce LIF after they were treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), a cytokine that is produced as an early inflammatory response of activated monocytes. We found that treatment of the cultures with as little as 0.5 units/ml (1.5 pM) caused a detectable increase in both LIF message and protein as measured by Northern blot assay and ELISA, respectively. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of TNF alpha produced a dose-dependent increase in both steady-state LIF mRNA and protein levels up to a maximum response with 500 units/ml (1.5 nM). Increases in LIF mRNA levels were rapid and could be detected 1 hr after treatment with 500 units/ml of TNF alpha. However, this effect was transient. It reached a maximum at 2 hr and returned almost to baseline at 24 hr. In contrast, levels of LIF protein in the conditioned media of the cultures increased progressively over 24 hr. The LIF produced by these cultures was biologically active and was inhibited by a polyclonal antibody to human LIF in a bioassay. These results demonstrate that LIF is produced by human dermal fibroblasts in response to treatment with TNF alpha, a mediator of acute inflammation. Furthermore, they suggest that production of LIF by these cells may be involved in the development of both the local and generalized immune response.","['Lorenzo, J A', 'Jastrzebski, S L', 'Kalinowski, J F', 'Downie, E', 'Korn, J H']","['Lorenzo JA', 'Jastrzebski SL', 'Kalinowski JF', 'Downie E', 'Korn JH']","['Department of Medicine, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut 06111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibroblasts/*chemistry', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Skin/cytology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122984710385 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1994.1038 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1994 Mar;70(3):260-5. doi: 10.1006/clin.1994.1038.,,"['AR31263/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR32343/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA single-strand breaks and DNA modifications sensitive to FPG protein (formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase), endonuclease III and exonuclease III were quantified in parallel. The light-induced cellular DNA damage was found to consist of many base modifications sensitive to FPG protein, which most probably are predominantly 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-hydroxyguanine) residues. Base modifications sensitive to endonuclease III are virtually absent. The yield of the FPG-sensitive base modifications is 10-fold higher than that of single-strand breaks plus AP sites (sites of base loss). The described ratios of the various modifications indicate that the damage most probably results from a reaction of DNA with singlet oxygen (type II reaction) or directly with an excited endogenous photosensitizer (type I reaction) and is not mediated by hydroxyl radicals. Experiments with cut-off filters indicate that wavelengths between 400 and 500 nm are responsible for most of the modifications. The FPG-sensitive base modifications are repaired efficiently (t1/2 approximately 1 h at 37 degrees C).

We used an MNCL transplant model, an in situ MNCL cell proliferation assay and immune competence assays to explore mechanism(s) underlying the effects of corn oil gavage on MNCL development in male rats. Relative to non-gavaged or water-gavaged rats, corn oil-gavaged rats had approximately 25% lower MNCL incidence as well as longer MNCL latency and increased survival. There were no differences in body weight or caloric intake between treatment groups, as corn oil-gavaged rats compensated for calories supplied by the gavaged oil by consuming less food. These data indicate that transplanted MNCL cells grew slower in corn oil-gavaged rats than in non-gavaged or water-gavaged rats and suggest that corn oil gavage may exert its effects through a decrease in protein or other nutrients. Five-day proliferation rates of cultured MNCL cells in diffusion chambers implanted in male corn oil-gavaged rats were 40% less than in water-gavaged rats, suggesting nutrition-sensitive endogenous factors mediate the suppression of MNCL cell proliferation in corn oil-gavaged rats. Corn oil-gavaged rats had 54% lower serum growth hormone (GH) levels, and replacement of GH into corn oil-gavaged rats by osmotic minipump infusion increased in situ MNCL cell proliferation to rates observed in water-gavaged animals. Corn oil-gavaged rats also showed enhanced cellular immune competence as measured by mitogen stimulation, natural cytotoxicity and immunofluorescence assays. Taken together, these findings suggest corn oil administered by oral gavage may decrease MNCL development by slowing MNCL cell proliferation, mediated at least in part by altered levels of diffusible factors such as GH, and/or by enhancing immune competence.","['Hursting, S D', 'Switzer, B R', 'French, J E', 'Kari, F W']","['Hursting SD', 'Switzer BR', 'French JE', 'Kari FW']","['Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['8001-30-7 (Corn Oil)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Corn Oil/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Immunocompetence', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/15.2.193 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1994 Feb;15(2):193-9. doi: 10.1093/carcin/15.2.193.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a statistically significant dose trend (P = 0.045) with flux density and Tesla-h for intermittent MF exposure for cumulated skin tumours per tumour-bearing animals.

No lectin-induced antiproliferative effect was observed after sialidase treatment of cells. The antiproliferative activity of SBL-C was also inhibited by ammonium chloride treatment.

Up-regulation of TNF-alpha mRNA was obtained using 5,6-MeXAA in vitro in cultures of murine splenocytes, the murine J774 macrophage cell line, and the human HL-60 myelomonocytic leukemia cell line. Maximal induction occurred at a 5,6-MeXAA concentration of 200 micrograms/ml for both murine J774 and human HL-60 cells. A direct comparison of FAA and 5,6-MeXAA (100-600 micrograms/ml) to stimulate TNF-alpha mRNA in HL-60 cells showed activity by 5,6-MeXAA at all doses but minimal activity with FAA. The results demonstrate that 5,6-MeXAA is equally potent in up-regulating TNF-alpha mRNA in human and murine cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, whereas FAA has demonstrable activity in murine cells only. The results suggest that 5,6-MeXAA would be a more active clinical agent than FAA because TNF-alpha induction appears to be a critical factor in the antitumor effects of this class of compounds.","['Ching, L M', 'Joseph, W R', 'Crosier, K E', 'Baguley, B C']","['Ching LM', 'Joseph WR', 'Crosier KE', 'Baguley BC']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '0 (Xanthones)', '0829J8133H (vadimezan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics', 'Xanthenes/*pharmacology', '*Xanthones']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Feb 15;54(4):870-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several clinically important issues have not previously been addressed. These include the potential of soluble interleukin 2 receptor in ATL patients to block immunotoxin effectiveness, the relative sensitivity of malignant lymph node cells (LNCs) versus PBMCs, the effect of an immunotoxin with a prolonged half-life, and finally whether ATL cells from patients in Japan have toxin sensitivity equal to those of the Caribbean patients. To resolve these questions, we studied 32 malignant PBMC and LNC samples from 30 ATL patients from Japan. PBMCs from 27 of 27 patients were very sensitive with 50% inhibition of protein synthesis achieved with 0.02-0.85 ng/ml (0.3-13 pM) of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL or anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40. LNCs had sensitivity very similar to that of PBMCs in the five patients tested. The fully recombinant immunotoxin, anti-Tac(Fab)-PE40, which has 8-10 times the t1/2 alpha and beta compared to the Fv-immunotoxins, was also very cytotoxic toward cells from 27 of 27 patients tested with 50% inhibition of protein synthesis of 0.08-25 ng/ml. It was found that purified soluble interleukin 2 receptor added to the cytotoxicity assay decreased the cytotoxic activity of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL or anti-Tac(Fab)-PE40, but that 1 x 10(4) units/ml or less had minimal competitive effects. It was found that ATL patients who have responded even incompletely to conventional chemotherapy have soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels lower than this at posttreatment. We conclude that recombinant immunotoxins containing anti-Tac(Fv) are effective against Japanese ATL PBMCs or LNCs and might be most effective if used in vivo after conventional chemotherapy. If it is found in humans that the effectiveness of single-chain recombinant toxins is limited by short half-life, anti-Tac(Fab)-PE40 should be considered as an alternative agent.","['Saito, T', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Hanada, S', 'Makino, T', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Sumizawa, T', 'Arima, T', 'Chang, C N', 'Hudson, D', 'Pastan, I']","['Saito T', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Hanada S', 'Makino T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Sumizawa T', 'Arima T', 'Chang CN', 'Hudson D', 'Pastan I', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis/*physiology', '*Virulence Factors']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Feb 15;54(4):1059-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children under the age of 18 years (n = 361) in whom primary brain tumors were diagnosed were identified from eight United States population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries and compared to matched controls (n = 1083) identified by random-digit dialing. Information regarding family history of birth defects or tumors was obtained, along with data on other potential risk factors, from interviews with the mothers and fathers of the index children. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in family history of epilepsy. However, moderate elevations in risk were observed for a history of birth defects in maternal relatives, particularly for female propositi. Significantly more mothers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, 95% confidence limits [CL] = 1.03, 2.57) and maternal female relatives (OR = 2.15, 95% CL = 1.14, 4.06) of cases than of controls were reported to have had birth defects. History of birth defects in maternal relatives was particularly associated with childhood brain tumors of ""other"" (not astrocytoma or medulloblastoma) histologic type (OR = 2.37, 95% CL = 1.25, 4.53) and infratentorial tumors (OR = 1.76, 95% CL = 1.06, 2.93). Slight excesses of tumors were observed in paternal relatives of children with astrocytomas (OR = 1.43, 95% CL 0.93, 2.20) or with infratentorial tumors (OR = 1.46, 95% CL 0.97, 2.20). Risk of childhood brain tumors did not increase with the number of relatives affected with brain tumors, breast cancer, leukemia or lymphoma, soft tissue sarcomas, or all of these tumor types combined (the Li-Fraumeni syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a modest increase in risk of childhood brain tumors associated with maternal family history of birth defects. Family history of tumors does not appear to contribute appreciably to an increased risk of brain tumors in children.","['Gold, E B', 'Leviton, A', 'Lopez, R', 'Austin, D F', 'Gilles, F H', 'Hedley-Whyte, E T', 'Kolonel, L N', 'Lyon, J L', 'Swanson, G M', 'Weiss, N S']","['Gold EB', 'Leviton A', 'Lopez R', 'Austin DF', 'Gilles FH', 'Hedley-Whyte ET', 'Kolonel LN', 'Lyon JL', 'Swanson GM', 'Weiss NS', 'et al.']","['Division of Occupational/Environmental Medicine and Epidemiology, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Catchment Area, Health', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical History Taking', 'Risk Factors']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940215)73:4<1302::aid-cncr2820730428>3.0.co;2-h [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Feb 15;73(4):1302-11. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940215)73:4<1302::aid-cncr2820730428>3.0.co;2-h.,,"['CA21919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice the preadministration of CPZ (i.p.) 1 h prior to CDDP (i.p.) injection efficiently reduced not only the lethal toxicity, but also the renal (indicated by increased blood urea nitrogen values) and intestinal toxicity (indicated by the incidence of diarrhea) which are usually observed in mice treated with CDDP alone. To further study the apparent protective activity of CPZ against CDDP nephrotoxicity we chose rats a species more commonly used as a model for nephrotoxicity. In F344 rats, CPZ ameliorated CDDP-induced increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine glucose, protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The preadministration of CPZ had no observed effect on the antitumor activity of CDDP in mice inoculated i.p. with Sarcoma 180, EL-4 lymphoma, or P-388 leukemia cells.

We use a combination of computer simulation and experiment to explore how a population of cells interacts with a ligand-coated substrate under shear flow. To simulate the binding of a single cell to a surface, we use a microvilli-hard sphere model in which receptor-ligand bonds are treated as springs, and the net motion of the cell is determined from a force balance involving hydrodynamic, bonding, and colloidal forces. We show that the adhesive phenotype of a cell depends strongly on the fractional spring slippage of receptor-ligand bonds, which relates the extension of a bond to its rate of breakage; a lower spring slippage indicates bonds can withstand a great deal of extension without a significant increase in the breakage rate, and hence leads to more strongly adherent cells. We construct the behavior of a population of cells by simulating many cells using this algorithm. We show that a homogeneous population of cells with identical numbers of receptors, modeled with parameters suitable to recreate neutrophil rolling, will display a distribution of translational velocities. In addition, we calculate the average velocity for a heterogeneous population of cells which has a Gaussian distribution in receptor number. As the standard deviation of this distribution increases, the average observed velocity for the population increases. Although the homogeneous and heterogeneous populations have the same average number of receptors (10(5)) per cell, there is a significant difference in their average velocity when the standard deviation of receptor number in the heterogeneous population is as little as 25% of the average receptor number. We also present experimental evidence that not all cells exhibit the slow rolling characteristic of neutrophil-endothelial interaction, but rather appear to exist in a ""binary"" state in which cells are either adherent or noninteracting. We have developed an experimental model system for studying adhesion under hydrodynamic flow, using the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) derivatized polyacrylamide gels in a flow chamber. Cells are injected into a portion of the flow chamber in which the substrate is not coated with antigen, and allowed to flow over the antigen-coated portion of the gel. We have measured the spatial distribution of cell binding for a population of cells at different flow rates, and have shown that cell binding decreases as shear rate increases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hammer, D A', 'Tempelman, L A', 'Apte, S M']","['Hammer DA', 'Tempelman LA', 'Apte SM']","['School of Chemical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Computer Simulation', 'Inflammation/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mathematics', 'Mice/immunology', '*Models, Biological', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Probability', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1993;19(2):261-75; discussion 275-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When these cell lines were stimulated in vitro with IL-1 their morphology changed into that of typical macrophages (M phi). Subsequent analysis of a particular clone, which displayed the morphological change at the highest efficiency among established cell lines, indicated that the clone possesses the capacity to differentiate into I-A-M phi capable of secreting several cytokines, and supporting the proliferation of fetal and adult thymocytes in vitro. If their surface markers are considered, their normal counterparts would be present in a minor subset of CD4-CD8- double-negative cells in the thymus in early development.

We have studied Fc epsilon RI-mediated expression of RNA coding for the protooncogene, c-fos, in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and specifically have examined the requirements for ongoing receptor aggregation in the generation of this signal. RBL cells were sensitized with IgE specific for 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) and incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of DNP24BSA or BSA alone. Following activation for 0 to 30 min, the reaction was terminated. RNA was isolated and separated on denaturing gels, blotted to nylon membranes and hybridized with a 32P-labelled cDNA probe for c-fos. Messenger RNA for c-fos is detectable as early as 5-10 min following the addition of antigen and increases in a time-dependent fashion over 30 min. Unexpectedly, the addition of the hapten, 10(-4) M DNP-lysine, 5 min after the addition of antigen (which causes immediate cessation of exocytosis) does not dramatically alter the amount of message detected at 30 min. This effect is present as early as 2 min after cross-linking of the receptor and occurs at various doses of the aggregating stimulus. Thus, in contrast to the case with exocytosis and other well-described intracellular events, Fc epsilon RI-mediated increases in the level of mRNA for c-fos does not require ongoing aggregation of Fc epsilon RI.","['Dogar, J H', 'Nemeth, G G', 'Durdik, J M', 'Dreskin, S C']","['Dogar JH', 'Nemeth GG', 'Durdik JM', 'Dreskin SC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dinitrobenzenes/immunology', 'Exocytosis', '*Genes, fos', 'Haptens', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0898-6568(93)90055-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0898-6568(93)90055-q [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 1993 Sep;5(5):605-13. doi: 10.1016/0898-6568(93)90055-q.,,,,,['c-fos'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial studies indicated an unusual result: accumulation of labeled adenallene was enhanced by decreasing the temperature of incubation, and (at 37 degrees C) by extracellular adenine, but not adenosine, cytosine, or thymine. We found that these phenomena resulted from the rapid deamination of intracellular adenallene to hypoxallene. Exodus of the latter was impaired at low temperatures and antagonized by hypoxanthine, the deamination product of adenine. In the presence of a deaminase inhibitor, adenallene transport was temperature-insensitive and nonsaturable and not affected by nucleoside transport inhibitors (dilazep, nitrobenzylthioinosine, and dipyridamole). These results support the view that adenallene enters cells by diffusion and is deaminated to hypoxallene, whose exodus occurs via a temperature-sensitive process exhibiting some structural specificity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three patients underwent transplantations for complications related to sickle cell disease, two with previous cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and one who had had multiple severe vasoocclusive crises. Two patients had other indications for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: one had acute myeloid leukemia and the other had Morquio's disease. The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 10 years, and four were girls. Ages of the donors ranged from 4 to 13 years; four of the donors were boys and three carried the sickle cell trait. For four patients, the preparative regimen consisted of busulfan and cyclophosphamide given either alone or combined with antithymocyte globulin (ATG). The patient with leukemia was prepared with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI). The regimens for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) included various combinations of cyclosporine A, methotrexate, and prednisone. RESULTS: The patient with Morquio's disease failed to engraft but underwent a successful retransplantation from the same donor. All patients eventually demonstrated donor engraftment and the donor's hemoglobin electrophoretic pattern posttransplant. Two patients had moderately severe GVHD of the skin and gastrointestinal tract, which resolved with prednisone therapy. One of these patients developed transient chronic GVHD involving the skin. Other acute complications included mild venoocclusive disease of the liver, central line infection with bacteremias, uterine hemorrhage in one patient, and pseudomonas sepsis in another. CONCLUSIONS: Both patients who underwent transplantation after CVAs have experienced subsequent neurological events. However, with a median follow-up of 16 months (range 8 months to 9.3 years), all patients are surviving in good to excellent clinical condition and appear to have benefitted from treatment by bone marrow transplantation.","['Johnson, F L', 'Mentzer, W C', 'Kalinyak, K A', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Abboud, M R']","['Johnson FL', 'Mentzer WC', 'Kalinyak KA', 'Sullivan KM', 'Abboud MR']","['University of Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'United States']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1994 Feb;16(1):22-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease was characterized by a dramatic decrease in megakaryocytes, multiple hemorrhages, anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, a massive myeloproliferation and splenic erythroproliferation with a defect in maturation of the myeloid elements similar to that in acute leukemia. This pathology in severe combined immunodeficient mice is very different from that of the well-characterized tumor profiles induced by PyV in normal newborn or nude mice. Viral T and capsid (VP1) antigens and viral genome were detected in some cells in the spleen, but not in the majority of the proliferating myeloid cells. This suggests that the myeloproliferation is induced by some indirect mechanism, such as secretion of growth factors or cytokines by virus-infected cells, rather than by direct transformation by PyV. Neither the spread of PyV, its replication in different organs, nor the pathogenesis or the time of death were altered by depleting natural killer cells in vivo by anti-natural killer cell antibodies. Analysis of the spleen leukocyte population indicated that the cells expressed high levels of class I major histocompatibility complex antigens and were resistant to lysis by activated natural killer cells.","['Szomolanyi-Tsuda, E', 'Dundon, P L', 'Joris, I', 'Shultz, L D', 'Woda, B A', 'Welsh, R M']","['Szomolanyi-Tsuda E', 'Dundon PL', 'Joris I', 'Shultz LD', 'Woda BA', 'Welsh RM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/immunology/microbiology/*pathology', '*Polyomavirus/genetics/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Polyomavirus Infections/immunology/*pathology', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/immunology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*pathology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1994 Feb;144(2):359-71.,,"['AI17672/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI30389/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1887132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Positive staining of the central nervous system (CNS) capillary endothelial cells with no labeling on neuronal or glial cells was observed in cats that were inoculated with the virus mixture. This was in contrast to brain tissue of cats infected with FeLV-C alone, which showed no such staining. While non-CNS endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein (HUVEC) could be readily infected in culture by FeLV-C, endothelial cells derived from human retina (REC) or brain (BEC) were resistant to infection by this parental virus. These latter cells in culture, however, could be infected by the viral mixture. The data suggested that at least one or more of the presumptive recombinant viruses could specifically infect CNS-derived endothelial cells. Using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing strategies to amplify and analyze DNA fragments of the proviral SU region from cells infected with REC-selected viruses, we found the occurrence of a single recombinant in which two-thirds of the SU gene from the N-terminus of FeLV-C was replaced by the endogenous FeLV element.

(1992) Cancer Res. 52: 3760-3767]. In the present study, we have investigated the modulating effect of the developmental stage of neural target cells and of the dose of the retroviral vector used in the grafting experiments. Exposure of fetal cells from embryonic day (E)12 or E14 produced a 100% incidence of malignant neuroectodermal tumors which led to the death of recipient animals after a median latency period of 32 days. A 100-fold reduction of the virus dose from 2.062 x 10(6) to 2.062 x 10(4) focus-forming units/ml resulted in a lower tumor incidence of 25%. Of six neural grafts exposed to v-Ha-ras and v-myc at E16, only one showed evidence of tumorigenesis (low-grade astrocytoma and hemangioma). All other transplants were morphologically normal for observation periods of 26 weeks, indicating a marked loss of transforming activity of ras and myc in more advanced stages of brain development. In retrovirus-exposed donor cells which caused the development of neural tumors in recipient rats, malignant transformation was also evident during culture in vitro, usually after 9-12 days. Oncogene complementation was also studied in the newborn rat brain. After microinjection of the retroviral vector into the brain at postnatal day (P)0, P1 and P3, 5 out of 20 animals (25%) developed a total of seven brain tumors. Histopathologically, three of these neoplasms were malignant neuroectodermal tumors which, in contrast to those induced in fetal brain transplants showed evidence of focal glial and/or neuronal differentiation. In addition, we observed one oligodendroglioma, two hemangiomas and a malignant hemangioendothelioma. These data indicate that neural precursor cells and endothelia of the rat brain represent the major target cells for the complementary action of ras and myc and that the use of target cells from later developmental stages (E16 and postnatal) leads to the induction of both primitive and more differentiated neoplasms.","['Radner, H', 'el-Shabrawi, Y', 'Eibl, R H', 'Brustle, O', 'Kenner, L', 'Kleihues, P', 'Wiestler, O D']","['Radner H', 'el-Shabrawi Y', 'Eibl RH', 'Brustle O', 'Kenner L', 'Kleihues P', 'Wiestler OD']","['Department of Pathology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Acta Neuropathol,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/genetics', 'Brain Neoplasms/embryology/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, myc', '*Genes, ras', 'Leukemia, Experimental/embryology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/embryology/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections/embryology/*genetics/pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00228580 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neuropathol. 1993;86(5):456-65. doi: 10.1007/BF00228580.,,,,,"['myc', 'ras']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 4 lymphoma cases (11.8%) a false-negative diagnosis and in 7 cases (10.6%) of viral meningitis a false-positive diagnosis were made. No false-positive diagnosis occurred in bacterial meningitis.

We evaluated the development of alloimmunization both by serological demonstration of HLA antibodies and by clinical demonstration of platelet refractoriness in 50 multitransfused children who exclusively received filtered, leukocyte-free blood products. The basic diagnoses included acute leukemia, pediatric solid tumors, and severe aplastic anemia. We also present a reference group of 10 similarly multitransfused children, who either deliberately or inadvertently had received nonfiltered blood products on some occasions. In the study group of 50 children, none developed platelet refractoriness. The median corrected increment was 11.1 x 10(9)/l at the time of initial diagnosis, and 10.4 at the time of the study 8 months later (median). None had detectable HLA antibodies in serum. In contrast, in the reference group 3/10 had HLA antibodies in serum, and 1/10 was clearly refractory to random pooled platelets. We conclude that systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components effectively prevents alloimmunization in heavily transfused children with cancer.

Antiviral properties of polyribonucleotides have been demonstrated in animals, especially in murine models of retroviral infection. In the early treatment of Friend virus infection, the antiretroviral effect of zidovudine is enhanced by combination with poly I poly C or poly A poly U. Polyribonucleotides also enhance the inhibitory effect of zidovudine on HIV replication in lymphocyte T or macrophage cultures.

To this end the MPO-positive acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB-4 was diluted into cell populations of the MPO-negative myeloma cell line MM-1 at different ratios. MPO protein was identified by classical cytochemical staining and by a specific anti-MPO monoclonal antibody in an immunofluorescent reaction. Cytochemical staining detected 1% positive cells among 99% negative cells. Careful, but time-consuming observation enabled the detection of positive cells in even higher dilutions. At least a 10-fold increase in sensitivity was achieved with the immunofluorescent method, as brightly fluorescent cells are more amenable for a screening of slides at lower microscopic magnification than the cytochemically visualized cells. MPO mRNA expression was examined in whole cell populations by Northern blotting (maximal sensitivity 1%), a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification assay (sensitivity 0.1%), and by RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting (sensitivity 0.05%). The high sensitivity of PCR-based techniques is offset by the fact that these methods do not allow for the identification and further characterization of the individual, MPO-positive cells. Thus, methods examining bulk populations require homogeneous cell samples in order to avoid false-positivity stemming from a few residual bystander cells. The five different techniques were used to determine the status of MPO expression in 20 randomly chosen leukemia cell lines of myelomonocytic origin. In 11 cell lines (8 positive and 3 negative) all five tests provided concordant results. Three cell lines were Northern-negative, but RT-PCR-positive and MPO protein-positive suggesting that Northern blot analysis is the least sensitive tool. Six cell lines were devoid of MPO protein, at least according to the methods used here, but trace expression of MPO message was documented by PCR. All five techniques have advantages and drawbacks and must be carefully selected in order to obtain useful data. The detection of MPO is of experimental and clinical importance in the distinction of myeloid from lymphoid leukemias, and in the lineage assignment of apparently biphenotypic or unclassifiable cases.","['Ma, W', 'Hu, Z B', 'Drexler, H G']","['Ma W', 'Hu ZB', 'Drexler HG']","['DSM, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/*analysis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Feb;8(2):336-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its effect is known to be mediated through binding to specific nuclear (RARs and RXRs) or cytoplasmic (CRABP) proteins. ATRA is strikingly effective in acute promyelocytic leukemia (the AML3 subtype) inducing a high incidence of complete remissions. Paradoxically, most AML3 cells harbor an abnormal retinoic acid receptor (PML/RAR alpha) resulting from the t(15;17) translocation. Though few AML3 patients do not respond to ATRA therapy, individualization of these cases is of practical importance. Recently the RAR alpha gene has been demonstrated to be involved in a novel fusion transcript (PLZF/RAR alpha) through a t(11;17) translocation. We describe here the second case of such a patient with a t(11;17)-PLZF/RAR alpha leukemic clone. Southern analysis revealed that the breakpoint in the RAR alpha gene was within the second intron (as for PML/RAR alpha) and the intron separating the second and third zinc finger of the PLZF gene. In vitro, the leukemic cells did not show increased NBT reduction or loss of self-renewal after incubation with ATRA. After therapy with ATRA, only partial remission was obtained. These results suggest that the t(11;17) (PLZF/RAR alpha) case of this study was less responsive to ATRA therapy than t(15;17) (PML/RAR alpha) cases and raises the question of the definition of this novel AML subtype.","['Guidez, F', 'Huang, W', 'Tong, J H', 'Dubois, C', 'Balitrand, N', 'Waxman, S', 'Michaux, J L', 'Martiat, P', 'Degos, L', 'Chen, Z']","['Guidez F', 'Huang W', 'Tong JH', 'Dubois C', 'Balitrand N', 'Waxman S', 'Michaux JL', 'Martiat P', 'Degos L', 'Chen Z', 'et al.']","[""Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Feb;8(2):312-7.,,['R01-CA 599-36-0/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This matrix, which is synthesized by the stroma, is capable of binding hematopoietic growth factors, and likely plays a major role in hematopoietic regulation. Clonally-derived non-transformed bone marrow stromal cells, propagated in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor, were studied for expression of collagenase, an enzyme whose substrate, collagen, is a major component of the extracellular matrix. Expression of steady-state collagenase mRNA was undetectable in both unstimulated dermal fibroblasts and non-transformed marrow stromal cells. However, stimulation with interleukin 1 alpha (10 U/ml) for 24 h resulted in marked accumulation of collagenase mRNA in dermal fibroblast cells, yet failed to elicit a similar response in bone marrow stromal cells. Both marrow stromal cells and dermal fibroblasts constitutively expressed transcripts of collagen I, and rhIL-1 alpha upregulated transcripts of interleukin 6 in both these cells as well. Although similar in morphology, these data indicate that bone marrow stromal cells differ from fibroblasts in their response to IL-1.

Nevertheless, in a proportion of patients with acute leukemia, such events will be responsible for the failure of therapy. Mutations which cause ara-C resistance in a chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell model have been identified as regulatory base substitutions, occurring in specific sites of the gene coding for an enzyme critical in pyrimidine metabolism, CTP synthetase (CTPs). These cells have elevated dCTP pools, a feature common to biochemical studies of other ara-C resistant leukemic cells. A 94% homology exists between the hamster and human ctps genes. In this study, similar mutations were sought in samples taken from 36 patients, with recurrent or resistant acute leukemia. No mutations were identified in the regions indicated by the CHO model using techniques capable of detecting mutations only if present in more than 10% of the cells studied. Thus, mutations in these sites within the human ctps gene do not appear to be a major mechanism of resistance to ara-C in acute leukemia. Further studies should be directed towards developing more sensitive methods of detection, and these then applied both to CTPs and to other enzymes involved in pyrimidine metabolism.","['Whelan, J', 'Smith, T', 'Phear, G', 'Rohatiner, A', 'Lister, A', 'Meuth, M']","['Whelan J', 'Smith T', 'Phear G', 'Rohatiner A', 'Lister A', 'Meuth M']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.2 (CTP synthetase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Ligases/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Feb;8(2):264-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although excessive PTK activity can result in hematopoietic cell transformation, perturbation of either of these two modulators may result in uncontrolled cell growth. Myeloid cells are responsive to growth factors and cytokines that induce tyrosine phosphorylation and can become ligand independent when endogenous PTKs become dysregulated. Specific PTPs, through mutation or altered expression, may enhance PTK activities and also cause myeloid ligand independence, though this has not yet been demonstrated. We have previously reported the isolation of a hematopoietic specific cytoplasmic PTP (HePTP). We now report that this gene maps to chromosome 1q32.1 utilizing fluorescent in situ chromosomal hybridization (FISH). This site is frequently amplified in preleukemic myeloproliferative diseases. FISH analysis of a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by myeloid hypoplasia and monocytosis reveals triplication of the HePTP gene on one allele with elevated protein expression in neoplastic myelomonocytic cells. Elevated expression is also identified in blasts from some patients with acute leukemia. These observations prompted us to examine the experimental effects on cell growth of HePTP overexpression. Though normal myeloid cells show minimal HePTP expression, all hematopoietic cell lines tested show high expression of HePTP. Gene transfer of HePTP into NIH 3T3 cells was therefore performed, which caused altered cell morphology, disorganized growth, anchorage independent colony formation and subtle differences in the pattern of tyrosine phosphoproteins compared to control cell lines. We conclude that amplification and overexpression of HePTP may be an important cofactor contributing to abnormal myeloid cell growth.","['Zanke, B', 'Squire, J', 'Griesser, H', 'Henry, M', 'Suzuki, H', 'Patterson, B', 'Minden, M', 'Mak, T W']","['Zanke B', 'Squire J', 'Griesser H', 'Henry M', 'Suzuki H', 'Patterson B', 'Minden M', 'Mak TW']","['Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Princess Margaret Hospital, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/pathology', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes', 'Hematopoietic System/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Feb;8(2):236-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, the p15 region of chromosome 11 with multiple genes related to cell growth regulation exhibits different methylation patterns in the 5' area of the calcitonin A gene in healthy bone marrow cells, and in leukemic cell populations. In this work the methylation status of the 5' area of the calcitonin gene in myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) other than chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is studied. A total number of 37 patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or myelofibrosis were studied. A control group of 18 healthy persons and patients with reactive hematologic changes was included. The DNA isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow cells was digested with the methylation-sensitive HpaII restriction enzyme. A Southern blot was hybridized with a 1.7 kb probe specific to the 5' area of the calcitonin gene. The result was visualized autoradiographically and analyzed with a densitometer. The results have been expressed as ratios between the abnormal and normal autoradiography band intensities, referred to as the calc-value or CALC. An increase in the calc-value signifies increasing methylation. In the control group the calc-value had a mean of 0.274. The myelofibrosis patients exhibited very strong hypermethylation in the calcitonin gene 5' area, with a mean calc-value of 11.1 (median 2.6). The polycythemia vera patients showed considerable variation in their methylation status, with a mean value of 1.52. The essential thrombocythemia patients exhibited weak hypermethylation, with a mean calc-value of 0.58. A correlation between karyotypic abnormalities and hypermethylation was observed.

AML blasts from bone marrow (BM) (n = 39) and peripheral blood (PB) (n = 17) were incubated for 48 h with or without GM-CSF (100 U/ml) followed by a concurrent treatment with increasing concentrations of araC (0.06-100 microM) for an additional 24 h. After GM-CSF a 1.5-8.4-fold (median 2.3) increase in 3H-araC incorporation into the DNA was observed in ten of 14 peripheral blast specimens and in 23 of 28 bone marrow samples, 18 of whom also showed an enhanced 3H-TdR incorporation (1.5-8.5-fold, median 2.0-fold). Four different types of response were identified when analyzing 3H-araC incorporation into the DNA of bone marrow samples in relation to the applied araC dose: (i) 8/28 cases had increases of the araC incorporation at all araC dose levels applied (0.06-100 microM), (ii) 12/28 at low araC concentrations only (0.06-1.0 microM), (iii) 3/28 at high araC concentrations only (10-100 microM), and (iv) 5/28 showed no increase at any dose level given. Hence, 20 of the 23 responding patients revealed a GM-CSF induced enhancement of araC incorporation at low or conventional doses of araC (0.06-1.0 microM). Fourteen of the 18 cases with concomitant rises of 3H-TdR and 3H-araC incorporation into the DNA after GM-CSF had elevated DNA polymerase alpha activity (16-531%, median 72%) and in ten cases overall DNA polymerase activity was enhanced (10-70%, median 22.5%). In contrast, thymidine kinase (TK) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activity were elevated after GM-CSF in only ten and five patients, respectively. An increase in the fraction of cells in S phase was found in 11/21 bone marrow specimens and in 5/9 peripheral blast samples. However, no correlation was observed between increases in the proportion of cells in S phase and enhancements in enzyme activities. In 13 cases the cytotoxicity of araC with and without GM-CSF was assessed by means of a blast cell colony assay. Preincubation with GM-CSF increased the araC mediated cytotoxicity in ten of 13 patients by a median of 3.2-fold (range 2.2-229-fold).

Unfortunately, such procedures can be associated with significant morbidity. Since 1981, we have used early thoracoscopic adhesiolysis and pleural debridement as an alternative to open thoracotomy in 9 children with acute empyema. The average age was 7.8 +/- 1.8 years (range, 2 to 16). All patients had failed initial treatment, which included antibiotics and chest tube drainage. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Following thoracoscopy, 8 of the 9 patients were managed with a single drainage tube and the average duration of tube drainage was 8.4 +/- 1.4 days. One patient died of underlying leukemia. Of the 8 patients who recovered, the average postoperative hospital stay was 13.4 +/- 2.9 days. No complications resulted from the thoracoscopies and there was no need for further surgical intervention in any of these patients. We conclude that thoracoscopy allows for minimally invasive, yet effective treatment of acute empyema with loculated collections. Thoracoscopic visualization of the pleural cavity permits efficient debridement, thorough adhesiolysis, and optimal placement of drainage tubes. Since we have begun using early thoracoscopy in the treatment of pediatric empyema, open drainage or decortication has not been required in any of these patients. Thoracoscopy is a useful adjunct in the treatment of empyema in children and its early application may eliminate the need for decortication.","['Kern, J A', 'Rodgers, B M']","['Kern JA', 'Rodgers BM']","['Department of Surgery, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Chest Tubes', 'Child', 'Debridement/methods', 'Empyema, Pleural/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging', 'Pleura/surgery', 'Radiography', 'Therapeutic Irrigation', '*Thoracoscopy']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-3468(93)90146-C [pii]', '10.1016/0022-3468(93)90146-c [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1993 Sep;28(9):1128-32. doi: 10.1016/0022-3468(93)90146-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with PKC beta-defective PET mutant.,4327-31,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces growth arrest and differentiation of a number of leukemia cell lines including HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia. We investigated the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes in phorbol ester-induced differentiation using the phorbol ester-tolerant PET mutant of HL-60 cells, which (in contrast to the parent phorbol ester-sensitive (wild-type) S variant of HL-60 cells) does not growth-arrest, become adherent, or undergo apoptosis when exposed to TPA (Macfarlane, D. E., Gailani, D., and Vann, K. (1988) Br. J. Haematol. 68, 291-302). In comparison to S cells, we found that proliferating PET cells markedly underexpress mRNA for PKC beta, but do express PKC alpha and PKC delta. The PKC beta-selective activator 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate induces growth arrest, adherence, surface expression of CD11a, and apoptosis in S cells, but not in PET cells. Expression of PKC beta in PET cells can be restored by exposing them to dihydroxyvitamin D3, and this treatment restores the ability of subsequently added 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate or TPA to induce immediate cell adherence and growth arrest of PET cells. These data led us to conclude that activation of PKC beta is both necessary and sufficient for phorbol ester-induced growth arrest and adherence in these myeloid cells.","['Macfarlane, D E', 'Manzel, L']","['Macfarlane DE', 'Manzel L']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Hospital, Iowa City, Iowa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/deficiency/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/11 00:00,1994/02/11 00:01,['1994/02/11 00:00'],"['1994/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)41782-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 11;269(6):4327-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this line, the reduced folate carrier had unchanged affinity for methotrexate, was present at the cell surface in usual quantity, but did not deliver drug into the cell, indicative of a functional defect in the translocation process. In this study, we further characterize this cell line along with a subline (F2-MTXrA) selected for growth in low levels of folic acid. This subline demonstrates continued high resistance to methotrexate and very low influx of [3H]methotrexate and 5-[3H]formyltetrahydrofolate, indicating the persistence of the defect in the reduced folate carrier. Both MTXrA and F2-MTXrA are shown to overexpress FBP2, the murine homolog of a folate-binding protein initially isolated from human placenta. Compared with parent L1210 cells, Northern analysis revealed FBP2 expression to be elevated 40-fold in the MTXrA line and 500-fold in F2-MTXrA. The large increase in FBP2 expression in the F2-MTXrA line correlates with a 10-fold increase in [3H]folic acid membrane surface binding and a 1000-fold decrease in the folic acid growth requirement compared with parental L1210 cells. Also, there are 20- and 500-fold decreases in the 5-formyltetrahydrofolate growth requirement compared with parent L1210 and MTXrA cells, respectively. Finally, the genomic organization of the FBP2 locus is presented. The results of Northern analyses using probes specific to FBP2 5'-untranslated sequences or to a splice junction within this region suggest that the up-regulated FBP2-specific message in F2-MTXrA utilizes 5'-noncoding sequences distinct from those used in the message encoded in L1210 cell lines with low level FBP2 expression. The MTXrA cells provide an example of a line selected for primary resistance to methotrexate that also exhibits concomitant increased expression of a folate-binding protein. Further overexpression of this folate-binding protein (which has homology to that initially identified in placenta) provides cells with the ability to meet cellular folate needs in a folate-deprived environment.","['Brigle, K E', 'Seither, R L', 'Westin, E H', 'Goldman, I D']","['Brigle KE', 'Seither RL', 'Westin EH', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Introns', 'Leucovorin/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Placenta/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/11 00:00,1994/02/11 00:01,['1994/02/11 00:00'],"['1994/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)41773-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 11;269(6):4267-72.,,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['FBP2'],,,['GENBANK/L25338'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past, splenectomy has been the mainstay of treatment, resulting in symptomatic palliation and hematological improvement in 90 percent of patients. However, most patients undergoing splenectomy eventually require additional therapy; hematologic parameters and the degree of bone marrow cellularity are now utilized to identify to identify subsets of patients who might derive long-term benefit from the procedure. 2'-Deoxycoformycin (DCF) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-cda) are experimental agents that have demonstrated curative potential in HCL; however, unresolved concerns about the long-term toxicity of DCF currently preclude its routine use, and further studies are required to define the toxicity and duration of responses obtained with 2-cda. As a result, alpha-interferon (alpha IFN) presently represents the treatment of choice for most patients with HCL. While alpha IFN has not been shown to cure HCL, its advantages include a high rate of response, a favorable side effect profile, its ability to be used safely in patients with active infections, and its ability to re-induce remission in relapsing patients. The mechanisms underlying alpha IFN's effectiveness seem to involve its immunomodulatory actions, which decrease the frequency of infectious complications in the early stages of therapy, and its ability to induce hairy cells to differentiate into more mature cells less responsive to proliferative signals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Vedantam, S', 'Gamliel, Kh', 'Golomb, Kh M']","['Vedantam S', 'Gamliel Kh', 'Golomb KhM']",,['rus'],"['Editorial', 'English Abstract']",Russia (Federation),Gematol Transfuziol,Gematologiia i transfuziologiia,8301796,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gematol Transfuziol. 1993 Sep-Oct;38(8):3-7.,,,Rol' al'fa-interferona v lechenii volosatokletochnogo leikoza.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases were divided on the basis of FB findings into abnormal (44 patients) and normal (67 patients). Pulmonary symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, and chest pain) prompted referral significantly more often in the abnormal FB group (34/44) than in the normal FB group (24/67). The finding of atelectasis on chest radiograph occurred more frequently in patients with endobronchial abnormalities. The spectrum of extrapulmonary malignancies that metastasize endobronchially has changed during the AIDS epidemic. Our study shows the most frequent causes of endobronchial mass lesions were Kaposi's sarcoma and the lymphoma group (Hodgkin's disease, nonHodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and the most common malignancies causing submucosal metastases were breast and the lymphoma group. In summary, the highest yield from FB can be expected in patients experiencing symptoms of cough or hemoptysis and/or having radiographic evidence of atelectasis.

The fate of cells labeled in the S phase with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was analysed using a bivariate BrdUrd/PI (propidium iodide) technique. Bistratene A and cycloxazoline treatment prevented the majority of BrdUrd-labeled cells from progressing through to the G1 phase. Approximately 50% of the cells were delayed at G2/M, and a significant proportion of cells appeared to be polyploid. Light and electron microscopy revealed the presence of multinucleated cells accounting for the apparent polyploidy. The progression of cells out of the G1 phase was also examined by synchronising cells with mimosine and releasing them from mimosine block in the presence of bistratene A. There was no evidence of a block at the G1/S phase transition or through the S phase since DNA synthesis was not inhibited. The mechanism by which these compounds interfere with cytokinesis is presently unknown but, in the case of bistratene A, may be linked to altered phosphorylation of cellular proteins involved in cell-cycle control.","['Watters, D J', 'Beamish, H J', 'Marshall, K A', 'Gardiner, R A', 'Seymour, G J', 'Lavin, M F']","['Watters DJ', 'Beamish HJ', 'Marshall KA', 'Gardiner RA', 'Seymour GJ', 'Lavin MF']","['Queensland Cancer Fund Research Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Bancroft Centre, Herston, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '115566-02-4 (bistratene A)', '131998-54-4 (westiellamide)']",IM,"['*Acetamides', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Marine Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', '*Pyrans', 'Spiro Compounds', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686269 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;33(5):399-409. doi: 10.1007/BF00686269.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these compounds, cis-bis-neodecanoato-trans-R,R-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum++ +(II) (NDDP), which contains two branched leaving groups of 10 carbons, showed a favorable toxicity profile in a liposomal formulation in early clinical trials. However, like many other DACH platinum compounds with branched leaving groups, it is unstable within the liposomes, thus preventing its widespread clinical evaluation. We studied the effect of the configuration of leaving groups on intraliposomal complex stability by studying a series of DACH platinum complexes containing linear alkyl carboxylato leaving groups of 5-18 carbons. The entrapment efficiency was greater than 90% for all liposomal preparations of the complexes and was independent of lipid composition and length of the leaving group. The drug leakage from the liposomes was minimal, but was directly related to the length of the leaving group. Intraliposomal stability was inversely related to the length of the leaving group and the content of DMPG (dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol) in the liposomes. The effect of length of leaving group on intraliposomal stability was minimal in compounds with leaving groups smaller than 10 carbons, but very pronounced in compounds with longer leaving groups. Stable liposomal formulations of selected compounds with leaving groups of 6 and 10 carbons had significant in vivo antitumor activity against both L1210/S and L1210/PDD leukemias. The results indicate (1) that compounds with linear leaving groups are much more stable within DMPG-containing liposomes than compounds with branched leaving groups and (2) that DMPG is required for in vivo antitumor activity. Stable and active liposomal formulations of selected compounds with linear leaving groups have been identified. These formulations are candidates for clinical development.","['Perez-Soler, R', 'Han, I', 'al-Baker, S', 'Khokhar, A R']","['Perez-Soler R', 'Han I', 'al-Baker S', 'Khokhar AR']","['Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', 'C82TX76BHH (1,2-cyclohexanediamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Carboxylic Acids/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cyclohexylamines/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Stability', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686266 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;33(5):378-84. doi: 10.1007/BF00686266.,,"['CA 41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 50270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which these aziridinyl analogues of spermidine inhibit cell growth remain unknown. As a result, we have studied: (a) the effect of pretreatment with difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO) and coincubation with exogenous spermidine on cytotoxicity induced by the aziridinyl spermidines; (b) the reversibility of the cytotoxicity induced by the aziridinyl spermidines; (c) the accumulation of N1- and N8-aziridinyl spermidine by cells and the effects of DFMO on this process; and (d) the impact of N1- and N8-aziridinyl spermidine on cellular polyamine pools and on cellular accumulation of spermidine. The cytotoxicity induced by these 2 aziridinyl derivatives of spermidine [concentration required to inhibit cell growth or incorporation of radiolabeled precursor into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material by 50% (IC50) N1 = 0.2 microM, IC50 N8 = 0.4 microM)] was potentiated by pretreatment of L1210 cells for 24 h with 100 microM DFMO (IC50 N1 = 0.05 microM, IC50 N8 = 0.15 microM) and was prevented by coincubation with 3.7 microM spermidine (IC50 N1 = 1.1 microM, IC50 N8 = 2.4 microM). In contrast, similar pretreatment with DFMO or coincubation with spermidine had no effect on the cytotoxicity induced by the aziridine-containing alkylating agent, N,N',N""-triethylenethiophosphoramide (thiotepa) (IC50 = 2.4 microM). The cytotoxicity induced by 24-h incubation with either N1- or N8-aziridinyl spermidine was not altered by removal of those compounds and incubating treated cells in medium augmented with 3.7 microM spermidine. However, and as expected, similar maneuvers did not reverse the cell growth-inhibitory effect induced by 24-h incubation with 100 microM DFMO. Cellular accumulation of both N1- and N8-aziridinyl spermidine increased with increasing extracellular concentrations. N1-Aziridinyl spermidine was accumulated to a greater degree than was the N8-analogue, achieving up to 6-fold higher intracellular concentrations at the same extracellular concentration. Cellular accumulation of both aziridinyl compounds was greatly enhanced by 24-h pretreatment with DFMO. Both N1- and N8-aziridinyl spermidine inhibited the uptake of spermidine in a dose-dependent manner. The perturbation of polyamine biochemistry by the test compounds was characterized by their ability to deplete cellular putrescine, as well as spermidine and spermine. These results imply that the cytotoxic mechanism of the aziridinyl spermidine analogues is, to a great extent, dependent on their polyamine nature and may imply selectivity for rapidly growing and neoplastic cells.","['Yuan, Z M', 'Egorin, M J', 'Rosen, D M', 'Simon, M A', 'Callery, P S']","['Yuan ZM', 'Egorin MJ', 'Rosen DM', 'Simon MA', 'Callery PS']","['Department of Biomedicinal Chemistry, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '154264-46-7 (N(1)-aziridinylspermidine)', '154264-47-8 (N(8)-aziridinylspermidine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Aziridines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Spermidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Feb 1;54(3):742-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The poor solubility of aphidicolin has led to the development of aphidicolin glycinate (AG; NSC 303812), a water soluble ester currently in early clinical trials. The antitumor activity of AG was investigated in a series of transplantable murine tumors in vivo. The drug demonstrated activity against the i.p. implanted B16 melanoma, producing maximum increased life spans of 75% following i.p. administration every 3 h for three doses on days 1-9. Treatment schedules involving both single injections per day on days 1-9 and multiple injections per day on days 1, 5, and 9 were less effective, indicating that this antitumor activity is schedule dependent. Similarly, greater activity was observed against the i.p. M5076 sarcoma when three daily injections were given on days 1-9 (57% increased life span) than with a single injection either on days 1-9 (36% increased life span) or on days 1, 5, 9, and 13 (inactive). Further scheduling studies in the s.c. M5076 sarcoma model showed that a 7-day infusion was superior to both a 24-h infusion and a 7-day course of three bolus treatments per day. On the assumption that DNA polymerase inhibition is the basis for this antitumor activity, inhibition of DNA synthesis in BALB/c x DBA/2 F1 mice was investigated by measuring incorporation of [3H]thymidine (20 microCi, i.v.) into DNA of spleen and jejunum. At 2 h after administration of AG, inhibition of DNA synthesis was dose dependent (median inhibitory dose, 60 mg/kg in both tissues) and was > 99% at 300 mg/kg. The inhibition was rapid in onset; AG (100 mg/kg i.p.) produced maximal (> 98%) inhibition in both tissues at 30 min. Recovery occurred in the intestine within 16 h; in spleen recovery was delayed to 24 h, and was followed by a rebound incorporation at 48 h (203%). A comparison of the inhibition of thymidine incorporation in tumor cells (B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia) and normal jejunum revealed no significant differences in the extent of inhibition or the rapidity of recovery in these tissues. The rapid recovery of DNA synthesis inhibition supports the use of prolonged infusion schedules in clinical trials, but the lack of evidence of selectivity for tumor cells suggests that AG may be of limited therapeutic value as a single agent.

Murine M195 (131I-M195), an anti-CD33, immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a monoclonal antibody has reactivity restricted to early myeloid cells and myeloid leukemic blasts but not hematopoietic progenitors. Previous trials in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid leukemia showed that 131I-M195 rapidly targeted to the bone marrow and internalized into target cells. This article describes a therapeutic dose escalation study in which 24 patients received from 50 mCi/m2 to 210 mCi/m2 of 131I-M195 in divided doses. Cytoreduction of peripheral cell counts and bone marrow blasts occurred without nonhematopoietic toxicity. Doses of 131I-M195 greater than 135 mCi/m2 were associated with marrow cytoreduction sufficient to necessitate bone marrow transplant. However, 37% of the patients developed human anti-mouse antibody, preventing retreatment. To decrease immunogenicity and improve effector function, chimeric IgG1 and IgG3, and complementarity-determining region-grafted, humanized IgG1 and IgG3 versions of mouse M195 were developed by genetic engineering techniques. The new versions maintained specificity and biologic function, and they were superior to the mouse M195 in their ability to perform antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against leukemia cells. Humanized M195, but not chimeric M195, showed a 4-8.6 times higher avidity than its mouse counterpart. Because effector function of IgG depends to a large extent on Fc clustering, a homodimeric HuG1 also was developed. Homodimeric HuG1 showed an ability to cause additional dramatic improvements in effector functions, as well as an ability to internalize and retain radioisotope in target leukemia cells.

Myelotoxicity can be assessed directly by biopsy examination of the bone marrow and indirectly by peripheral blood counts. In patients with B-cell malignancies, thrombocytopenia has been the initial and most severe manifestation of 131I-Lym-1 radiation toxicity from treatment. Manifestations of myelotoxicity varied greatly among the patients and from one treatment dose to another in the same patient, suggesting that additional factors were present. There was an increased likelihood of Grade 3-4 hematopoietic toxicity after 131I-Lym-1 treatment if the patient had peripheral blood cell abnormalities before undergoing 131I-Lym-1 treatment. Fractionation of the total 131I-Lym-1 dose was associated with less toxicity. In many patients, myelotoxicity could not be explained by marrow radiation dose (0.36 +/- 0.13 rads per administered mCi) from 131I-Lym-1 in the blood and body alone. Bone marrow examination and 131I-Lym-1 imaging usually provided evidence for additional marrow radiation from 131I-Lym-1-targeting of marrow malignancy and also for residual toxic effects from prior treatment in these patients. Immunohistologic and imaging examination of the bone marrow performed with the intended treatment antibody allowed assessment of extent of marrow malignancy and prediction of degree of myelotoxicity from subsequent treatment. Treatment programs (and protocols) for radioimmunotherapy should incorporate these methods into the decision process. Larger amounts of 131I-Lym-1 can be used in patients selected to have relatively normal peripheral blood cell counts and normocellular bone marrows uninvolved by the malignancy. These observations appear to be relevant to the maximum tolerated dose in radioimmunotherapy for other malignancies as well.","['DeNardo, G L', 'DeNardo, S J', 'Macey, D J', 'Shen, S', 'Kroger, L A']","['DeNardo GL', 'DeNardo SJ', 'Macey DJ', 'Shen S', 'Kroger LA']","['University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento 95816.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3+<1038::aid-cncr2820731343>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Feb 1;73(3 Suppl):1038-48. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3+<1038::aid-cncr2820731343>3.0.co;2-8.,,['CA 47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, major differences may exist among different radiolabeled MoAb that bind to the same antigen and between switch variants of the same antibody. This study evaluates and compares a series of radiolabeled MoAb of different specificities, subclasses, and isotypes applicable in treatment of patients with B cell malignancies. METHODS: MoAb were iodinated with iodogen. Immunoreactivity was determined in cell binding assays. Scatchard analyses were performed to determine association constants of radiolabeled MoAb and to measure antigen density on malignant B cells in various differentiation stages. The fate of the MoAb after antigen binding in vitro was studied by modulation and internalization experiments. RESULTS: All MoAb tested could be iodinated efficiently and displayed association constants of 0.9 x 10(9)M-1 or higher. Immunoreactivity of radiolabeled MoAb ranged from 62-79%, except for the immunoglobulin (Ig)-M MoAb CLB-MD20.2, which had an immunoreactivity of 43%. The highest number of binding sites was detected for the CD20 MoAb (12 x 10(3) - 355 x 10(3), whereas the expression of antigens recognized by the CD22 MoAb was lowest on all cell types tested (4 x 10(3) - 26 x 10(3)). The MoAb CD19 and CD22 both induced modulation, whereas the CD20 MoAb did not. Modulation induced by the CD19 MoAb was caused by internalization. The rate of internalization was isotype-dependent and, for CD19-IgG1, partly mediated by Fc gamma ReceptorII. CONCLUSIONS: Radiolabeled B cell MoAb tested in this study are promising for use in radioimmunotherapy. For therapy with the radioisotope iodine-131, the IgG2a and IgG2b CD19 MoAb are more suitable than CD19-IgG1, because of their slower modulation and internalization rate.","['Vervoordeldonk, S F', 'Merle, P A', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'Slaper-Cortenbach, I C']","['Vervoordeldonk SF', 'Merle PA', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'von dem Borne AE', 'Slaper-Cortenbach IC']","['Central Laboratory of the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/therapeutic use', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3+<1006::aid-cncr2820731339>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Feb 1;73(3 Suppl):1006-11. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3+<1006::aid-cncr2820731339>3.0.co;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were labeled for 6 h with [32P]Pi in phosphate-free RPMI 1640. Tiazofurin (100 or 200 microM) was added to cells, and samples were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h of incubation. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-p21 antibody (Y13-259), then developed on thin layer chromatography. GTP and GDP bound to Ras were visualized by autoradiography. Tiazofurin treatment decreased Ras-GTP concentration in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. In the untreated K562 cells the Ras-GTP concentration was 26.3 +/- 1.4, and tiazofurin (200 microM) decreased it at 6 h to 16.6 +/- 2.9 and at 12 h to 10.6 +/- 2.1%.

Monitoring of cytochrome c reduction revealed that PAF stimulation induced the release of superoxide ions from c-WRT-LR. To further investigate the effect of superoxide ions in the autocrine or paracrine mechanism in cell differentiation, molecular species of the oxygen radicals under PAF stimulation were examined using the EPR spin trap, 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). PAF and/or phorbol myristate acetate caused the formation of EPR spectra, a combination of DMPO/.OOH and DMPO/.OH. Since both spectra were diminished in the presence of superoxide dismutase, it was concluded that DMPO/.OH was derived from superoxide ions. Mannitol and catalase suppressed cell differentiation induced by combined stimulation with PAF and oxygen radicals generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction.

We have isolated and sequenced a 2.3 kb cDNA from a chronic granulocytic leukemia cDNA library that encodes for human neutrophil type IV collagenase. With the exception of one amino-acid substitution at position 280 (Arg-->Gln), the deduced amino-acid sequences of neutrophil gelatinase are identical to the amino-acid sequences of the enzyme isolated from fibrosarcoma cells. Expression of the cDNA in E. coli yielded a 72 kDa protein having a gelatinolytic activity on zymogram gel. The recombinant enzyme was activated with APMA and trypsin. The activation was accompanied by a reduction in molecular weight of approximately 10 kDa; such a reduction is characteristic of matrix metalloproteinases.

These data suggest that native and recombinant 92 kDa type IV collagenase produced in E. coli have similar biochemical properties. The successful expression of the collagenase in a prokaryotic system will greatly facilitate the structure-function characterization of the enzyme and allow a more precise analysis of its physiological and pathological roles.","['Pourmotabbed, T', 'Solomon, T L', 'Hasty, K A', 'Mainardi, C L']","['Pourmotabbed T', 'Solomon TL', 'Hasty KA', 'Mainardi CL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee at Memphis 38163.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Collagenases/*chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/11 00:00,1994/01/11 00:01,['1994/01/11 00:00'],"['1994/01/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(94)90038-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(94)90038-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1994 Jan 11;1204(1):97-107. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(94)90038-8.,,['AR-39166/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in an additional cell pair sensitive or resistant to phorbol-induced differentiation.,387-96,"We previously reported (Zwelling et al., Cancer Res 50: 7116-7122, 1990) that etoposide-induced DNA cleavage and mRNA coding for topoisomerase II are reduced in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate by phorbol ester. Reduction of etoposide-induced cleavage and topoisomerase II message did not occur in the derived cell line 1E3 (which is resistant to phorbol-induced differentiation), implying that topoisomerase II activity may be related to the state of cell differentiation. We have extended these studies using a new phorbol sensitive/resistant cell pair, S (sensitive) and PET (phorbol ester tolerant). Phorbol ester exposure not only reduced etoposide-induced DNA cleavage and topoisomerase II mRNA in S cells but also decreased the amount of immunoreactive topoisomerase II enzyme in whole S cells. However, immunoreactive topoisomerase II extracted from the nuclei of phorbol-treated S cells was not reduced compared with that from the nuclei of untreated S cells. This suggests that topoisomerase II contained in nuclear extracts is not always representative of the total cellular enzyme. Dramatic decreases in the amount, activity, or gene expression of topoisomerase II were not observed after phorbol treatment of the resistant PET cells; this is consistent with the potential involvement of topoisomerase II in monocytoid differentiation. Levels of topoisomerase I enzyme and mRNA fell in both S and PET cells after phorbol treatment; therefore, the genes for topoisomerases I and II did not appear to be regulated coordinately.","['Ellis, A L', 'Altschuler, E', 'Bales, E', 'Hinds, M', 'Mayes, J', 'Soares, L', 'Zipf, T F', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Ellis AL', 'Altschuler E', 'Bales E', 'Hinds M', 'Mayes J', 'Soares L', 'Zipf TF', 'Zwelling LA']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Tissue Extracts/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/20 00:00,1994/01/20 00:01,['1994/01/20 00:00'],"['1994/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90030-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90030-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Jan 20;47(2):387-96. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90030-2.,,['R01CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that MdCyd 5'-diphosphate irreversibly inactivated ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli (Baker et al., J Med Chem 34: 1879-1884, 1991). In studies reported here, MdAdo/EHNA, MdGuo and MdCyd inhibited L1210 cell growth with IC50 values of 3.4, 10.6 and 1.4 microM, respectively. Since MdAdo is a substrate for adenosine deaminase, the presence of EHNA was required to give maximal growth inhibition. 8-Aminoguanosine was not required to maximize the cytotoxic effects of MdGuo. The 2'-deoxy-2'-methylene derivatives of tubercidin and uridine did not inhibit L1210 cell growth at concentrations as high as 50 microM (MdTu) or 100 microM (MdUrd). L1210 cell lines resistant to hydroxyurea (directed at the non-heme iron subunit of ribonucleotide reductase) or deoxyadenosine (directed at the effector binding subunit of ribonucleotide reductase) were not resistant to MdCyd. An L1210 cell line that was highly resistant to dGuo due to the loss of a relatively specific deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Cory et al., J Biol Chem 268: 405-409, 1993) had a 6.6-fold increase in the IC50 value toward MdCyd, but showed only a 2-fold increase in resistance to MdGuo. Another L1210 cell line that was markedly deficient in adenosine kinase activity was highly resistant to MdAdo. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that MdCyd showed the transit of the cells through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle resulting in the buildup of the G2/M population. MdAdo, MdGuo and MdCyd inhibited the incorporation of [14C]cytidine into DNA without an effect on RNA synthesis or total cellular uptake of [14C]cytidine. The conversion of [14C]cytidine to deoxycytidine nucleotides was partially inhibited by MdGuo, but not by MdAdo or MdCyd. These data show that the 2'-deoxy-2'-methylene derivatives of adenosine, guanosine and cytidine are activated via specific nucleoside kinases and that the modes of action of these compounds are not identical.","['Cory, A H', 'Samano, V', 'Robins, M J', 'Cory, J G']","['Cory AH', 'Samano V', 'Robins MJ', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University, School of Medicine, Greenville 27858.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""141320-64-1 (2'-deoxy-2'-methyleneguanosine)"", 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxyuridine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*pathology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tubercidin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/01/20 00:00,1994/01/20 00:01,['1994/01/20 00:00'],"['1994/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90028-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90028-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Jan 20;47(2):365-71. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90028-0.,,['NCI CA 55540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report on the development of two variant murine erythroleukemia cell lines that were used for direct comparison and biochemical characterization of the two murine folate binding proteins. Based on the results of northern analysis and the mobilities of affinity-labeled proteins on polyacrylamide gels, these cell lines exhibit specific up-regulated expression of FBP1 or FBP2. The affinities of the folate binding proteins for various (anti)folates were determined based upon the ability of the compounds to inhibiting of [3H]folic acid. The two proteins exhibited considerably different affinities and stereospecificities and, in general, FBP2 consistently bound each test compound with lesser affinity than FBP1. Both proteins displayed greatest affinity for folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and the antifolates CB3717 and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate (DDATHF). Conversely, the proteins exhibited poor affinity for the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors methotrexate and aminopterin. For 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, FBP1 had high affinity for the (6S) diastereoisomer, whereas FBP2 showed preference for the non-physiologic (6R) diasterceoisomer. The binding properties of FBP1 and FBP2 overexpressed in these cell lines closely paralleled those of their respective human homologs. These lines provide a model system in which to examine the biochemical characteristics of the individual folate binding proteins without the potential problems associated with expression of proteins in dissimilar cell lines.","['Brigle, K E', 'Spinella, M J', 'Westin, E H', 'Goldman, I D']","['Brigle KE', 'Spinella MJ', 'Westin EH', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.52 (Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/20 00:00,1994/01/20 00:01,['1994/01/20 00:00'],"['1994/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90025-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90025-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Jan 20;47(2):337-45. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90025-6.,,"['NCI CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In animal models, skin tumorigenesis has been shown to be prevented by retinoids, which in this organ function as antitumor promoters in the two-stage system using 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) as the initiator, and 12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as tumor promoter. Even though pharmacological doses applied topically appear to inhibit tumor formation, we found that papilloma and keratoacanthoma growth required physiological concentrations of retinoic acid and that vitamin A deficiency was even more effective than excess retinoid in inhibiting SENCAR mouse skin tumorigenesis. In human beings, oral administration of retinoic acid after tumor resection was effective in inhibiting the appearance of new tumors on the skin of four patients with Xeroderma Pigmentosum, and was effective in preventing new primary tumor formations in patients treated for head and neck cancer. The newly-discovered nuclear receptors for retinoic acid function as transcriptional activators for several genes. In patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia presenting with a reciprocal translocation of chromosome 17 to chromosome 15, the breakpoint has been identified in the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene, which forms a fusion gene with a new gene termed myl, on chromosome 15. Treatment of the patients with retinoic acid causes complete remission of the APL. It also appears to generate cells that do not bear the translocation. Therefore, retinoids may well function as modulators of carcinogenesis both at the promotion level as well as by causing differentiation of neoplastically transformed cells.","['De Luca, L M']",['De Luca LM'],"['National Cancer Center Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Basic Life Sci,Basic life sciences,0360077,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Retinoids)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retinoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/*prevention & control', 'Vitamin A/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum/complications']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-2984-2_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Life Sci. 1993;61:17-25. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-2984-2_2.,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a number of dipeptide analogues were active against isolated TS and L1210 cells in vitro, lack of in vivo stability was a problem. This was circumvented by the synthesis of modified dipeptides where either the alpha-carboxyl of the second amino acid was removed (alpha'-COOH) e.g. -L-glu-GABA or where the second amino acid was the unnatural D-enantiomer e.g.-L-glu-D-glu. Further studies were performed with the -L-glu-D-glu and its 7-CH3, 2'F modified analogue, demonstrating that they use the RFC for cell entry but are not active through polyglutamate formation.

Recent reports have documented that high affinity interleukin-2 receptors consist of two distinct IL-2 binding proteins, one being alpha chain (p55) and the other being IL-2 beta chain (p75). Expression of the alpha chain or the beta chain alone allows for low affinity or intermediate affinity IL-2 binding, respectively. Alpha receptor is present on activated cells, beta chain is present on resting cells. Decreased production of IL-2 and decreased expression of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) after stimulation was found in primary and secondary immune deficiencies. Leukemic cells in adult T cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia express markedly large numbers of IL-2 receptors.

Patients who are treated by bone marrow transplantation for these diseases have an improved outcome if treated early after diagnosis, before they have developed secondary complications. Recent advances in transplantation have allowed choices between several donor types. These alternative donor types are the subject of this analysis from the University of Minnesota. In these diseases, matched sibling donor bone marrow transplantation is the standard for comparison. In individuals with lethal immunodeficiencies (severe combined immune deficiency [SCID], Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [WAS], Chediak-Higashi syndrome [CHS]) who lack a sibling donor, unrelated transplantation has produced results that are almost equal to those of matched sibling transplants. Patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have received sibling or unrelated transplants have results that are superior to autologous donor transplants. In ALL, there is a need to use new therapies, eg, immunotoxins, to decrease the currently high relapse rate. In patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first complete remission, results are excellent and comparable using related and autologous donors. Results in non-first-remission AML are inferior and do not differ if related, unrelated, or autologous transplants are used. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), early survival results are superior using autologous and related transplants as compared with unrelated transplants.","['Kersey, J', 'Filipovich, A', 'McGlave, P', 'Woods, W', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Neglia, J', 'Dusenbery, K', 'Blazar, B', 'Nesbit, M', 'Ramsay, N']","['Kersey J', 'Filipovich A', 'McGlave P', 'Woods W', 'Weisdorf D', 'Neglia J', 'Dusenbery K', 'Blazar B', 'Nesbit M', 'Ramsay N']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/immunology/*therapy', '*Tissue Donors']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1993 Oct;30(4 Suppl 4):105-8; discussion 109.,13,"['CA49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examine whether or not phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) affect 5-lipoxygenase activity of a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-1). Among the synthesized phospholipids examined, 1-oleoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-oleoyl-2-DHA-PC) was found to be the most potent inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. The inhibition was dose-dependent and the ID50 value was 4.0 microM. When the fatty acid at the sn-2-position was replaced by other unsaturated fatty acids, the inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing numbers of both carbon atoms and double bonds in the fatty acids. Substitution at the 1-position of the DHA-containing PC also affected the inhibitory potency. If oleic acid was substituted with palmitic acid, the inhibition activity was completely abolished. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis showed that the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by 1-oleoyl-2-DHA-PC was non-competitive. The inhibition by this synthesized phospholipid was very specific to 5-lipoxygenase; that is, it did not extend to fatty acid cyclooxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase or 15-lipoxygenase. These results suggest that endogenously existing DHA-containing phospholipids may affect 5-lipoxygenase activity and thus control leukotriene biosynthesis in vivo.","['Matsumoto, K', 'Morita, I', 'Hibino, H', 'Murota, S']","['Matsumoto K', 'Morita I', 'Hibino H', 'Murota S']","['Section of Physiological Chemistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Scotland,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",8802730,"['0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '99296-82-9 (1-oleoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl phosphatidylcholine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0952-3278(93)90211-e [doi]'],ppublish,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 1993 Nov;49(5):861-6. doi: 10.1016/0952-3278(93)90211-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their genomes were partially sequenced together with isolates from Gabon in central Africa and from Ghana in West Africa. The phylogenetic tree was constructed from the sequence data obtained and those of previously reported HTLV-I isolates and simian T-lymphotropic virus type I (STLV-I) isolates. The heterogeneity of HTLV-I was recently recognized, and one major type, generally called the ""cosmopolitan"" type, contained Japanese, Caribbean, and West African isolates. The phylogenetic tree constructed in the present study has shown that this cosmopolitan type can be further grouped into three lineages (subtypes A, B, and C). Subtype A consists of some Caribbean, two South American, and some Japanese isolates, including that from the Ainu, in addition to an Indian isolate, and subtype B consists of other Japanese isolates in addition to another Indian isolate, suggesting that there might be at least two ancestral lineages of the Japanese HTLV-I. Subtype A implies a close connection of the Caribbean and South American natives with the Japanese and thereby a possible migration of the lineage to the American continent via Beringia in the Paleolithic era. Subtype C consists of the West African and other Caribbean isolates, indicating that not all but part of the Caribbean strains directly originated from West Africa probably during the period of slave trade. The tree also has shown that the HTLV-I isolate from Gabon in central Africa forms a cluster with STLV-I from a chimpanzee, suggesting a possible interspecies transmission between man and the chimpanzee in the past.

Biopsies from 28 normal marrow transplant donors and 10 normal spleens served as controls. Mast cells were distributed irregularly throughout normal and HCL marrows, but tended to be more concentrated about the hairy cells in cases focally involved by HCL. HCL marrows averaged 12.7 mast cells/HMF compared to 1.1 for controls. Although most normal marrows (86%) averaged < 2 mast cells/HMF, 88% of HCL cases averaged > or = 2 mast cells/HMF. Splenic mast cells averaged < 1/HMF for both HCL and control cases. By electron microscopy, marrow mast cells in HCL demonstrated normal substructure with numerous granules. The cell surfaces of mast cells showed filopodia that often came in contact with those of hairy cells. These results indicate most HCL marrows, but not spleens, are associated with varying degrees of mast cell hyperplasia. Furthermore, this study suggests a biologic interaction between mast cells and hairy cells.

This complexity has hampered understanding of the molecular basis of Tax1 action. In this study, we analysed the activation function of a Tax1 fused to the heterologous DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and dissected the domain required for the activation function by using derivatives of a Tax1 mutant with an insertion between amino acids (a.a.) 170 and 171. Analysis of the derivatives of the mutant fusion protein having various partial overlaps encompassing the interrupted site suggested that two contiguous stretches, AD-I (2-255 a.a.) and AD-II (227-337 a.a.), should be both intact for the activation function of Tax1 and that they form a functional activation domain.","['Tsuchiya, H', 'Fujii, M', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Tozawa, H', 'Seiki, M']","['Tsuchiya H', 'Fujii M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tozawa H', 'Seiki M']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Kanazawa University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Jan;9(1):337-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cocultivation with U937 and HuT78 cells constitutively and significantly transactivated the HTLV-2 promoter, while no effect was observed with the other lines. However, activation of other T-cell lines (CEM, Jurkat, Molt-3 and MT-4) with a combination of phorbolester and phytohemagglutinin also resulted in potent transactivation. Supernatant from HuT78 cells exhibited detectable transactivating activity, suggesting that the activation is mediated by a secreted factor(s). This factor also transactivates the HTLV-1 promoter. We used a panel of HTLV-1 LTR deletion mutants to map the responsive elements to this factor(s). Unlike the response element to the HTLV transactivator protein, Tax, which can be mapped to a small region in the enhancer, maximal transactivation by the cellular factor(s) required the complete U3 sequence.

This elevated kinase activity is essential for transformation, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. To investigate p210BCR-ABL function we constructed a model system in which the tyrosine kinase activity of p210BCR-ABL was inducible. Two amino acid substitutions, Arg to His at amino acid 457 and Tyr to His at amino acid 469 of c-abl, modeled on mutations known to render v-src temperature-sensitive for tyrosine kinase activity, were introduced into p210BCR-ABL.

Analysis of the NF-1 gene (NF1) suggests that the function of its product, neurofibromin, is reduced in affected persons and that NF1 belongs to the tumor-suppressor class of recessive cancer genes. This model is consistent with evidence that neurofibromin accelerates the intrinsic guanosine triphosphate-hydrolyzing activity of the Ras family of regulatory proteins. Loss of constitutional heterozygosity has not been reported in the benign tumors associated with NF-1, however, and has only been detected in a few malignant neural-crest tumors and in some tumor-derived cell lines. METHODS: We studied DNA extracted from the bone marrow of 11 children with NF-1 in whom malignant myeloid disorders developed and from parental leukocytes. We used a series of polymorphic markers within and near NF1 to determine whether leukemogenesis was associated with structural alterations of the gene. RESULTS: Bone marrow samples from five patients showed loss of heterozygosity. In each case, the NF1 allele was inherited from a parent with NF-1 and the normal allele was deleted. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence of NF1 may function as a tumor-suppressor allele in malignant myeloid diseases in children with NF-1 and that neurofibromin is a regulator of ras in early myelopoiesis.","['Shannon, K M', ""O'Connell, P"", 'Martin, G A', 'Paderanga, D', 'Olson, K', 'Dinndorf, P', 'McCormick, F']","['Shannon KM', ""O'Connell P"", 'Martin GA', 'Paderanga D', 'Olson K', 'Dinndorf P', 'McCormick F']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics']",1994/03/03 00:00,1994/03/03 00:01,['1994/03/03 00:00'],"['1994/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199403033300903 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1994 Mar 3;330(9):597-601. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199403033300903.,,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1994 Mar 3;330(9):637-9.

The primary target of TR1.3 infection are endothelial cells of capillaries and small vessels. Preliminary post-mortem histologic analysis revealed multifocal endothelial cell pathology associated with the presence of thrombi and extravasation of red blood cells into the brain parenchyma. The consequences of viral infection on endothelial cell integrity and its relevance to hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions are unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Neonatal BALB/c mice were infected with TR1.3 murine leukemia virus and were monitored daily for symptoms of tremor, seizure and paralysis. Diseased mice were killed and the brains prepared for histopathologic analysis and electron microscopy studies. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections revealed widespread areas of infarction throughout white and grey matter with numerous scattered thrombi. Endothelial cell pathology was widespread and pronounced. This included enlarged cytoplasm, intracytoplasmic clefts, separation of tight junctions, swollen mitochondria, changes to the basal lamina and in many instances the formation of syncytia. Ultrastructural studies identified numerous viral particles within the endothelial cell cytoplasm and budding from the abluminal and luminal cell surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that TR1.3 virus replicates within endothelial cells and provides the first direct evidence of retrovirus-induced endothelial cell pathology. These results suggest that hemorrhage may be a direct consequence of this endothelial cell pathology, and that endothelial cell damage initiates the formation of thrombi and vessel occlusion that results in multiple cerebral infarctions.","['Park, B H', 'Lavi, E', 'Stieber, A', 'Gaulton, G N']","['Park BH', 'Lavi E', 'Stieber A', 'Gaulton GN']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/*microbiology/pathology', 'Cerebral Infarction/*microbiology/pathology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/microbiology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Pregnancy', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications', 'Thrombosis/complications/pathology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1994 Jan;70(1):78-85.,,"['5-T32-GM-07170/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-NS05572/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-NS30606/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This antigen is present in blast cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and is implicated in differentiation of B lymphocytes. NEP cleaves a variety of peptides including bradykinin, substance P, bombesin, enkephalins, and atrial natriuretic peptide. We investigated its expression in several variants of rat hepatomas and a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Normal rat and human livers were used as controls. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of NEP (common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen) was determined with: (a) enzyme assays; (b) high performance liquid chromatography analysis of bradykinin metabolism; (c) immunoprecipitation; and (d) mRNA characterization. RESULTS: NEP activity increased by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in all rat hepatomas and in the human SK-HEP1 cell line, compared with normal tissues. Antiserum against rat NEP precipitated 93% of endopeptidase activity in rat hepatomas, whereas monoclonal antibody to common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen immunoprecipitated 99% of that in human hepatocarcinoma cells. Solubilized rat hepatoma membranes cleaved bradykinin to a hepta- and dipeptide; the reaction was inhibited by an NEP inhibitor. Activity of three other membrane peptidases did not increase in rat hepatomas. Northern hybridization revealed the presence of NEP mRNA in rat hepatoma, but not in normal liver. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that hepatomas have higher amounts of NEP mRNA than normal liver of the same strain. CONCLUSIONS: Rat hepatomas and a human hepatocarcinoma cell line express high amounts of NEP, in contrast to normal rat and human livers, which have very little. The increase in NEP activity could be due to increased transcription by tumor cells and may signal malignant transformation of liver cells.","['Dragovic, T', 'Deddish, P A', 'Tan, F', 'Weber, G', 'Erdos, E G']","['Dragovic T', 'Deddish PA', 'Tan F', 'Weber G', 'Erdos EG']","['Laboratory of Peptide Research/Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'S8TIM42R2W (Bradykinin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bradykinin/analysis/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/chemistry/*enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver/chemistry/enzymology', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemistry/*enzymology/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemistry/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neprilysin/*analysis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred ACI', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1994 Jan;70(1):107-13.,,"['HL36081/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36082/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36473/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary and relapsed acute leukemia is increasingly being treated by bone marrow transplantation. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of bone marrow transplantation, occurring in 50% to 70% of cases. 2. Ocular complications of bone marrow transplantation are divided in those involving either the anterior or posterior segment. Because of associated total body irradiation with different forms of chemotherapy, these patients should be routinely watched by an ophthalmologist. 3. There is a high incidence of dry eye syndrome, viral keratitis, and trophic disturbances of the cornea. The presence of GVHD increases ocular involvement and its severity. 4.

In the present study the effect of jacalin was tested on cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage that also express the CD4 molecule. We used CD4+ promyelomonocytic U937 cells differentiated towards the monocytic/macrophage lineage with either a mixture of two physiological agents, retinoic acid (RA) and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD), or the exogenous drug phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The cells resulting from these treatments differed in term of CD4 expression. We focused our attention on interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, which implies an activation of the cells differentiated along both pathways. In CD4+ RA/VD-treated cells, jacalin induced a 10-fold higher IL-6 secretion than did lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This jacalin-induced IL-6 production was inhibited by agents interacting with CD4 (anti-CD4 mAbs and HIV recombinant gp120) or by recombinant soluble CD4. In contrast, the CD4- PMA-differentiated U937 cells did not secrete any IL-6 upon jacalin treatment, while they demonstrated a response to LPS similar to that of the RA/VD-differentiated cells. Together with the fact that jacalin interacts with CD4, these results provide evidence of the involvement of a CD4 dependent pathway in IL-6 production.","['Taimi, M', 'Dornand, J', 'Nicolas, M', 'Marti, J', 'Favero, J']","['Taimi M', 'Dornand J', 'Nicolas M', 'Marti J', 'Favero J']","['INSERM U65, Universite Montpellier II, Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Interferon Inducers)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (jacalin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Biological Assay', 'CD4 Antigens/*physiology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Inducers/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', '*Plant Lectins', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.55.2.214 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Feb;55(2):214-20. doi: 10.1002/jlb.55.2.214.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The [57Co] radioactivity bound to haptocorrin and transcobalamin was determined after separating the proteins by adsorption to insolubilized antibodies to haptocorrin. The distribution of the radioactivity on the different forms of cobalamin and on haptocorrin isoproteins were determined. The fractional catabolic rate of hapatocorrin (0.102 to 0.158 d-1) and transcobalamin (3 to 29 d-1) was of the same magnitude as previously reported for a reference population. During the first 24 hours of the turnover, no change of the cyanocobalamin form was registered, indicating that conversion of cyanocobalamin to the coenzyme forms of cobalamin does not take place in the circulation. The haptocorrin isoprotein pattern changes in alkaline direction during the first 5 hours indicated that the glycoprotein was desialinated during circulation. From the calculated turnover parameter, the possible competition between transcobalamin and haptocorrin for the transport of cobalamins in CML is estimated to be of minor clinical significance. In conclusion, the increased plasma concentration of haptocorrin in CML is due to an increased liberation of haptocorrin and is not due to a decreased turnover of the protein.","['Gimsing, P', 'Nexo, E']","['Gimsing P', 'Nexo E']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Herlev Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biological Transport', '*Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transcobalamins/*metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12/*metabolism']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1994 Feb;123(2):264-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A T cell-dependent inflammatory response is first detected 3 days after infection and includes T cells, B cells, and macrophages. The cytokines produced locally by intrinsic cells of the brain in response to infection and by infiltrating mononuclear cells and their contributions to outcome of infection have not been identified. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of mRNAs for IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and TGF-beta in the brain during fatal and nonfatal SV encephalitis of immunocompetent BALB/cJ and immunodeficient scid/CB17 mice. IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNAs were detected in uninfected mice before infection and were up-regulated within 24 h. TGF-beta mRNA was also constitutively expressed in uninfected mice. LIF mRNA was occasionally detected in uninfected mice but increased in amounts only in BALB/cJ not scid mice after infection. TNF-alpha, IL-4, and IL-10 mRNAs were not found in uninfected mice but were induced within 24 h and continued to rise through 7 days after infection with substantially higher levels in BALB/cJ than scid mice. These data suggest that intrinsic brain cells produce IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, LIF, and TGF-beta mRNAs in response to viral infection. IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNAs were detected only in BALB/cJ mice and not until 3 days after infection with the initiation of inflammation. IL-4 and IL-10 mRNAs were more persistent and more easily detectable than IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNAs. These data suggest a predominant type 2 cytokine response in the brain during SV encephalitis. BALB/cJ mice infected with a neurovirulent strain of SV (NSV), had 100% mortality, whereas NSV-infected scid mice developed persistent nonfatal infection. Inflammation was more intense in NSV-infected mice, however, no substantial differences in cytokine mRNA levels were detected when compared with mice with nonfatal SV infection suggesting that the cytokines measured do not in and of themselves lead to fatal central nervous system disease.","['Wesselingh, S L', 'Levine, B', 'Fox, R J', 'Choi, S', 'Griffin, D E']","['Wesselingh SL', 'Levine B', 'Fox RJ', 'Choi S', 'Griffin DE']","['Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Alphavirus Infections/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Encephalitis, Arbovirus/*immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sindbis Virus/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Time Factors']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Feb 1;152(3):1289-97.,,"['NS07000/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS18596/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS29234/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also analyzed separately those cases seen in patients treated with bone marrow transplantation from those treated with standard chemotherapy regimens. We found that leukemia cutis was seen frequently as the cause of lesions in patients with CML and CLL. In contrast, a wide variety of lesions were seen in patients with AML, including a greater number of infectious lesions, drug reactions, vasculitis, and lesions secondary to a hemorrhagic diathesis. In the bone marrow transplantation patients, graft vs host disease was usually the cause of skin lesions in those transplanted for CML and ALL, but again those patients with an underlying diagnosis of AML showed a wide variety of lesions including drug reactions, fungal infections and leukemia cutis. Finally, 6% of cases from patients with AML showed intraepidermal blistering disorders of various types, an association that has not been previously reported.","['Desch, J K', 'Smoller, B R']","['Desch JK', 'Smoller BR']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0560.1993.tb00662.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 1993 Oct;20(5):407-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.1993.tb00662.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linkage between impaired responses to agonists and absence of protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2.,3117-24,"We compared the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity in undifferentiated and neutrophil-like HL60 cells. Although Ca(2+)-mobilizing P2-purinergic receptors are expressed in both cell types, arachidonic acid (AA) release stimulated by P2-purinergic agonists was 5-7-fold higher in the differentiated cells. Similarly, the stimulation of AA release by AlF4- in intact cells or by ATP and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) in electropermeabilized cells was significantly higher in the differentiated cells. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced A23187-stimulated AA release in intact HL60 granulocytes with minimal effects in the undifferentiated cells. Immunoblotting experiments showed similar levels of cPLA2 and of agonist-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in both cell types. Experiments measuring stimulation of AA release by either melittin, using endogenously labeled intact cells, or Ca2+, using homogenates and exogenous substrate, indicated that undifferentiated cells do not lack an activatable PLA2. The stimulatory effects of GTP gamma S and Ca2+ on AA release in homogenates from endogenously labeled cells suggested that undifferentiated cells display G protein-cPLA2 coupling. Basal and PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of cPLA2 was detected in differentiated, but not in undifferentiated cells. However, the two cell types displayed only subtle differences in the time courses of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase triggered by agonists and PMA. The observed defect in cPLA2 phosphorylation may represent the alteration preventing agonist-mediated stimulation of AA release in undifferentiated HL60 cells.","['Xing, M', 'Wilkins, P L', 'McConnell, B K', 'Mattera, R']","['Xing M', 'Wilkins PL', 'McConnell BK', 'Mattera R']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Aluminum Compounds)', '21340-02-3 (tetrafluoroaluminate)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Aluminum Compounds/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorides/pharmacology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*enzymology', 'Phospholipases A/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/28 00:00,1994/01/28 00:01,['1994/01/28 00:00'],"['1994/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42056-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jan 28;269(4):3117-24.,,['GM 46552-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N. (1993) Science 259, 519-522). This pathway is initiated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide by a neutral sphingomyelinase and stimulation of a ceramide-activated Ser/Thr protein kinase. Recent investigations demonstrated that kinase activity is proline-directed, recognizing substrates in which the phosphoacceptor site is followed by a proline residue. Until now, the kinase has been defined only as a membrane-bound activity capable of phosphorylating a peptide derived from the sequence surrounding Thr669 of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In the present studies, the kinase was quantitatively extracted from membrane with detergent and separated from protein kinase C by anion-exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. Ceramide-activated protein kinase was resolved as an exclusively membrane-bound, 97-kDa protein with a pI of 7.05. Kinase activity toward the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide co-purified with activity toward a generic proline-directed substrate, myelin basic protein. Kinase activity was reconstituted by a denaturation-renaturation procedure and demonstrated activity toward self (autophosphorylation) and exogenous substrate (myelin basic protein). Autophosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues. These activities were enhanced to 7-fold of control by ceramide and TNF alpha. These investigations provide additional evidence for a role for ceramide-activated protein kinase in signal transduction for TNF alpha.","['Liu, J', 'Mathias, S', 'Yang, Z', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Liu J', 'Mathias S', 'Yang Z', 'Kolesnick RN']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Denaturation', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1994/01/28 00:00,1994/01/28 00:01,['1994/01/28 00:00'],"['1994/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42045-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jan 28;269(4):3047-52.,,['CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, the kinase activity transferred gamma-phosphate from ATP to histone 3 to form an acid-labile and alkaline-stable linkage. Under the assay conditions 1.8 mol of phosphate are incorporated per mol of histone 3. Upon modification of arginine residues with phenylglyoxal prior to phosphorylation, a considerable decrease in the amount of phosphate transferred to histone 3 was observed. Amino acid analysis revealed that H3 was phosphorylated on arginine residues. To identify the phosphorylated peptide(s), histone 3 was cleaved with cyanogen bromide prior to phosphorylation. The phosphorylated mixture was then separated by gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography under denaturing conditions. Fragments I (N-terminal 10.3-kDa peptide) and III (C-terminal 1.7-kDa peptide) were both phosphorylated. Amino acid sequencing further revealed that the molar yields of 3 of the 4 arginines present in the phosphorylated cyanogen bromide fragment III were reduced by a factor of about 10 compared with the corresponding arginines from the unphosphorylated fragment. In the case of fragment I, 25 cycles of Edman degradation revealed that the recovery of only arginine 2 was reduced by a factor of 20. The putative phosphorylation sites are arginines 2, 128, 129, and 131. The sequence information offered an indirect evidence that these arginines were the sites of phosphorylation.

Characterization of product inactivation with purified enzyme and intact leukocytes.,2627-31,"We report that leukotriene A4, the electrophilic product of 5-lipoxygenase catalysis, irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. Leukotriene A4 inhibits 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid formation by human neutrophils and differentiated granulocytic HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values = 22.4 +/- 2.5 and 29.0 +/- 8.0 microM, respectively. Recovery of cellular enzymatic activity is negligible (< 6%) following inactivation. Leukotriene A4 inactivates cellular 5-lipoxygenase without inhibiting its translocation from the cytosol to the membrane, suggesting that it impairs catalysis without impairing formation of the complex between 5-lipoxygenase and its membrane-associated activating protein. Consistent with this, leukotriene A4 inactivates purified 5-lipoxygenase from human neutrophils, via saturable, pseudo first-order kinetics with a rate constant, ki = 0.14 min-1 and a dissociation constant, Ki = 2.1 +/- 0.7 microM. Purified 5-lipoxygenase incubated with [3H]arachidonic acid incorporated a radiolabeled species that was not removed by electrophoresis under reduced denaturing conditions. Preincubation with leukotriene A4 diminished the incorporation of radiolabeled material, consistent with irreversible modification of 5-lipoxygenase by its metastable product, leukotriene A4.

The HLA-A2 restricted mH antigen-specific HA-1, -2, -4, and -5 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones were used to type the family members for expression of these mH antigens. The patient and one HLA-identical sibling were compatible for these mH antigens. This sibling was selected as the bone marrow donor. The patient engrafted promptly but developed acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. To study the presence of other mH antigen disparities between recipient and donor, host-versus-graft CTL lines and clones were generated by stimulation of recipient peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with donor bone marrow cells, and graft-versus-host CTL lines were generated after BMT by stimulation of PBLs of donor origin with recipient bone marrow cells. These CTL lines were cytotoxic to cells from the bone marrow donor and from the recipient, respectively, and to cells from several other family members. T-cell lines, generated from the patient after BMT by stimulation of recipient-derived PBLs with donor bone marrow cells, exhibited no specific cytotoxicity to donor or recipient cells.

Over a 2-year period, we observed four patients with multiple blood cultures that were positive for the organism. The patients had acute leukemia as underlying disease, and presented with clinical and microbiologic features consistent with catheter-related bacteremia. In three of the patients the infection initially appeared to be unrelated to chemotherapy-associated profound neutropenia and occurred early after, or was the reason for, hospital admission. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates varied: unlike previously reported cases, resistance in some of our isolates included aminoglycosides, newer fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Despite in vitro susceptibility to imipenem in initial isolates, treatment of two patients with this agent obviously failed to eradicate the organism, and the patients either relapsed with bacteremia shortly after discontinuation of treatment or remained persistently febrile and bacteremic. O. anthropi appears to be increasingly recognized as a human opportunist pathogen associated with intravascular catheters and unpredictable multiple antibiotic resistance.","['Kern, W V', 'Oethinger, M', 'Kaufhold, A', 'Rozdzinski, E', 'Marre, R']","['Kern WV', 'Oethinger M', 'Kaufhold A', 'Rozdzinski E', 'Marre R']","['Abteilungen fur Infektionskrankheiten und Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinik und Poliklinik, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcaligenes/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01712451 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 1993 Sep-Oct;21(5):306-10. doi: 10.1007/BF01712451.,25,,,,,['Infection. 1994 Jul-Aug;22(4):291-2.

The secretory response as well as the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) formation to Fc epsilon RI and ionophore stimuli were similar in the RBL-2H3 cell line and its derived CD45-deficient subpopulation. However, pretreatment with the phorbol ester TPA, which directly activates protein kinase C (PKC), caused a marked increase in mediator release and InsP3 production in the CD45-deficient variant compared to the parental RBL-2H3 cells.

Cytolysis of K562 target cells was not affected by treatment of the target cells with the anti-class I HLA mAb W6/32. Further, the anti-target cell mAbs had no effect on antigen-specific lysis by the CTL. The mAb W6/32, however, inhibited the antigen-specific killing. Experiments at the single-cell level revealed that the anti-target cell mAbs inhibited the formation of conjugates between the effector cells and K562 tumor cells but had no effect on CTL binding to the antigen-specific target cells.

Western blots using a polyclonal antibody (Ab) to this protein identified two species, the trifunctional 110-kDa protein and a 50-kDa cytosolic protein with GARS, but not GART activity. We used Ab and, subsequently, oligodeoxyribonucleotide screens to isolate cDNAs corresponding to these two proteins from mouse T-cell cDNA expression libraries. The sequence of one class of these cDNAs and the partial sequence of a corresponding genomic clone defined an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 1010-amino-acid (aa) protein, individual domains of which showed high homology to each of the monofunctional bacterial GARS, AIRS and GART proteins, and to each domain of chicken and human trifunctional GARS-AIRS-GARTs. cDNAs corresponding to the smaller protein contained a 1.3-kb ORF with complete identity to the GARS domain of, but with a 3' untranslated region different from, the trifunctional cDNAs. Hence, both cDNAs appear to derive from the same gene due to either differential splicing or use of an intronic polyadenylation signal. The functional requirement for the expression of both trifunctional protein with GARS activity and monofunctional, catalytically active GARS is unknown.","['Kan, J L', 'Jannatipour, M', 'Taylor, S M', 'Moran, R G']","['Kan JL', 'Jannatipour M', 'Taylor SM', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.3.1 (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthase)', 'EC 6.3.4.13 (GART protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.4.13 (phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', '*Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases', 'Catalysis', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA', 'Exons', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Leukemia', 'Ligases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/31 00:00,1993/12/31 00:01,['1993/12/31 00:00'],"['1993/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['0378-1119(93)90006-O [pii]'],ppublish,Gene. 1993 Dec 31;137(2):195-202.,,['CA27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/L11590', 'GENBANK/L11591', 'GENBANK/L11592', 'GENBANK/L11593', 'GENBANK/L11594', 'GENBANK/L24529', 'GENBANK/U01023', 'GENBANK/U01024', 'GENBANK/Z15047', 'GENBANK/Z15048']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the functional role of ras genes in tumorigenesis, we introduced with a retroviral vector either a wild-type (Gly-12) or a mutant (Val-12) Kirsten ras cDNA into the cells of a factor-dependent myeloid cell line, FDC-P1. FDC-P1 cells are nontumorigenic and their proliferation is dependent on either interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The Ki-Val 12-infected FDC-P1 cell population is still strictly IL-3-dependent but has acquired the ability to survive up to 72 hours in the absence of growth factor and to form tumors in nude mice. These tumors are easily established into cell lines that are clonal and show a multiplicity of phenotypes with respect to their growth factor dependence. These results suggest that, in contrast with the overexpression of a normal Ki-ras, Ki-ras oncogene can efficiently promote the tumorigenic conversion of FDC-P1 cells. However, the clonality of the tumors as well as the distinct phenotypes indicates that other genetic events are required for tumorigenicity. Therefore, in FDC-P1 cells, an activated ras gene acts as a dominant oncogene through the induction of tumor progression. Finally, in this simple experimental system we observed a multiplicity of tumorigenic phenotypes which are reminiscent of those observed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Dumenil, D', 'Neel, H', 'Lacout, C', 'Dautry, F']","['Dumenil D', 'Neel H', 'Lacout C', 'Dautry F']","['Hematopoiese et Cellules Souches, U. 362 INSERM, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/analysis/genetics/*pharmacology', '*Kirsten murine sarcoma virus', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Feb;22(2):178-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of the MBL-2-tumor-bearing BDF1 mice with lentinan and IL-2 induced complete regression of tumor in 87.5% of mice treated. In contrast, treatments using either lentinan or IL-2 alone failed to induce complete regression of tumor, although temporal growth inhibition of tumor was observed about in half of the mice treated. Improvements of antitumor effects by the combination of lentinan and IL-2 were also observed in the MBL-2/B6 and S908.D2/B10.D2 systems. Expression of the antitumor effects of lentinan/IL-2 treatments required the intact T cell compartment, because the effects were not observed when nude mice were used. In the MBL-2/B6 system, the antitumor action of lentinan/IL-2 treatment was abolished in mice treated with antibody to CD8 antigen, whereas antibodies to CD4 or NK1.1 were ineffective. Furthermore, augmented tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity was observed in regional lymph node cells of the mice after lentinan and IL-2 administration. These data indicate that the antitumor effects of lentinan/IL-2 are mediated by CD8+ CTL but not by CD4+ T cells or NK1.1+ NK/LAK cells, and suggest that this combined therapy may be effective against even established tumors that are resistant to IL-2 therapy.","['Suzuki, M', 'Kikuchi, T', 'Takatsuki, F', 'Hamuro, J']","['Suzuki M', 'Kikuchi T', 'Takatsuki F', 'Hamuro J']","['Basic Research Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co.

This methodology eliminates the risk of metabolic cooperation and the trauma of trypsinization. In addition, a larger population of cells can be treated and cloned for mutant selection. In order to compare the effectiveness of the test systems, 10 chemicals were evaluated for the induction of forward mutations in the CHO and MLA. Several of these chemicals have been reported as clastogenic; therefore, abbreviated colony sizing was performed to gauge the extent of genetic damage to the MLA cells. Both test systems detected benzo[a]pyrene, mitomycin C, acridine orange, and proflavin, and, with the exception of proflavin, more large colonies were present than small colonies. The suspect clastogen, phenytoin, was not mutagenic in the MLA and produced inconclusive results in the CHO. Ethidium bromide, a clastogen and a bacterial mutagen, was not mutagenic in either the MLA or CHO. Four compounds (p-aminophenol, benzoin, methoxychlor, and pyrene) were positive in the MLA, generally inducing a large number of small colonies, while demonstrating no mutagenic activity in the CHO assay. They have also been shown to be generally nongenotoxic in other test systems. Overall, the modified CHO assay did not appear to be better than the MLA for the detection of mutagenic agents.

Of these, 1082 patients were transplanted in first chronic phase, 88 in subsequent chronic phase, 251 in accelerated phase and 59 during blast crisis. For these four disease stages leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 years is 39%, 22%, 22% and 0%, respectively. A more detailed analysis was performed for 947 patients receiving a first transplant in first chronic phase of their disease from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Survival at 8 years is 47%. At 5 years, relapse incidence (RI) is 33% and the transplant-related mortality rate (TRM) is 42%. The major prognostic factors are patient age (LFS, TRM), T cell depletion (LFS, RI), time from diagnosis to transplant (LFS, TRM), white blood cell count (RI) and donor-recipient sex combination (LFS, TRM). This first report on long-term results of a large cohort of transplanted CML patients confirms and extends previous findings. Stage of disease at time of transplant is the most important prognostic factor. Fifty per cent of all patients transplanted for CML in chronic phase can be expected to be alive at 8 years post-transplant, 40% alive and free of the disease. This number increases to > 60% for patients given cyclosporin and methotrexate without T cell depletion as GVHD prophylaxis.

We determined the dose of 95% CFU-GM growth-inhibition by mafo (ID95) in 23 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 7 patients with lymphoid malignancies in first or second complete remission (CR). Sixteen AML patients were studied in early first CR prior to intensive consolidation with high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) and had a median ID95 of 130 (range 90-190) micrograms mafo/ml; the median ID95 in 3 of 7 AML-CR1 and 4 of 7 AML-CR2 patients who previously had HDAC therapy was 75 (range 55-110) micrograms/ml whereas a control group of 7 patients with lymphoid malignancies in CR1 showed a median ID95 of 100 (range 80-160) micrograms/ml. In AML the difference between patients in CR1 prior to HDAC and patients in CR1 after HDAC late consolidation or in CR2 was highly significant (p = 0.0006). We conclude that accumulating chemotherapy pre-treatment, in particular HDAC intensive consolidation, increases mafo toxicity for non-leukemic bone marrow CFU-GM and conversely decreases the mafo concentration applicable for adjusted-dose purging to eliminate residual leukemic cells. Hence mafo purging appears to be more efficient when done in early CR1 compared with later stages of disease.","['Martin, H', 'Bruecher, J', 'Claude, R', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Martin H', 'Bruecher J', 'Claude R', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Hematology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Cryopreservation', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Nov;12(5):495-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy patients underwent pulmonary function testing 1 year after BMT.

The mechanism underlying this uncontrolled proliferation remains unclear. An in vitro clonogenic assay which detects the human counterpart of the murine colony forming unit (CFU) CFU-A/CFU-S day 12 was described in a report of our recent findings. CML bone marrow samples were found to proliferate in the CFU-A assay, producing colonies morphologically indistinguishable from normal controls. The bcr/abl transcripts were sought in the RNA from individual colonies using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the five CML samples tested to date, the majority of CFU-A colonies at diagnosis or in early chronic phase were found to be bcr/abl positive. For normal controls both macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) inhibited the proliferation of CFU-A colonies when directly added to the assay. In contrast, CML progenitors responded normally to TGF-beta 1, but showed no response to MIP-1 alpha. In suicide assays, for five normal bone marrow samples, CFU-A progenitors induced into S-phase returned to a quiescent state after treatment with MIP-1 alpha. CML progenitors demonstrated inherently high cycle status which showed no definite response to MIP-1 alpha. However, TGF-beta 1 resulted in quiescence of CML progenitor cycling.

We used synthetic peptides representing the fusion region of P210 to study MHC class I and class II pathways of antigen recognition in normal subjects and patients with CML. We found that most normal individuals have a low proliferative response to 18mer fusion peptides representing the two alternative splicing variants b2a2 and b3a2, and a T-lymphocyte precursor frequency (HTLPf) characteristic of unprimed responders. No increase in HTLPf was found in CML patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), suggesting that peptide recognition does not form part of the graft-versus-leukemia process. In contrast, untransplanted patients with CML had very high HTLPf, suggesting an autologous but immunologically ineffective recognition of leukemia-specific peptides through HLA class II. Preliminary studies using the T2 cell line (which expresses HLA class I only in the presence of peptides binding to HLA-A2) indicate that nonapeptides spanning the breakpoint of the b2a2 and b3a2 variants of P210 do not bind to this particular class I molecule and are therefore unlikely to initiate class I mediated lymphocyte responses.","['Barrett, J', 'Guimaraes, A', 'Cullis, J', 'Goldman, J M']","['Barrett J', 'Guimaraes A', 'Cullis J', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '119425-35-3 (A2-binding peptide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/chemistry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/chemistry/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Stem Cells/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/chemistry/pathology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110923 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 Oct;11 Suppl 3:104-8. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110923.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the progression of the lymphoproliferation is indolent, it is often associated with a monoclonal proliferation of T-cell-type large granular lymphocytes (LGL) that manifest multiple in vitro suppressor and cytotoxic activities. We considered the possibility that the granulocytopenia or anemia might represent an autoimmune disorder mediated by the monoclonal LGL via T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of an antigen involved in hematopoiesis. Therefore, in an effort to characterize the usage of the TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes in patients with T-gamma LPD, we cloned and sequenced TCR alpha- and beta-chain mRNAs derived from the T-cell type LGL of five patients. The five patients studied did not use a common V alpha nor a common J alpha segment. However, an unusual finding was observed in one of the patients where the occurrence of a single variable-diversity-junctional (VDJ) rearrangement of the beta chain confirmed the monoclonal origin of the LGL proliferation. In accord with this evidence for monoclonality, many of the cells studied used a common V alpha (V alpha 19.1). In contrast to this common V alpha usage, there was a marked diversity of the J alpha segments and N-region addition that were associated with the V alpha 19.1 segment. This pattern of common V alpha usage associated with different N and J alpha segments suggests an immune-mediated selection process affecting the TCR alpha chain occurring after the transformation event that established the clone. We suggest that the T-cell-type LGL malignant clone might have developed autoreactivity conferred by the selected TCR alpha chain and that this autoreactivity might be implicated in this patient's anemia.","['Kasten-Sportes, C', 'Zaknoen, S', 'Steis, R G', 'Chan, W C', 'Winton, E F', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Kasten-Sportes C', 'Zaknoen S', 'Steis RG', 'Chan WC', 'Winton EF', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75773-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 1;83(3):767-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since zinc is required to induce biological activity to thymulin (Zn-FTS), a biochemical defined thymic hormone, and marginal zinc deficiencies may prevent its peripheral biological activation, we investigated the plasma level of zinc and of both active thymulin (Zn-FTS) and total zinc saturable thymulin (Zn-FTS + FTS) in 91 young patients affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at various stages of the disease. It was discovered that the plasma zinc level was reduced at the onset and relapse, whereas in complete remission and in off-therapy it was in the normal range. Total zinc-saturable thymulin concentration did not change during the disease, whereas the active fraction was reduced at the onset and in relapse when compared with values observed in the other stages of the disease or in healthy controls. These data suggest that zinc plasma deficiency is present in ALL patients at the onset and during relapse, and that such a deficiency causes a decrease in the activity of thymulin despite a nearly normal production by the thymus. An impairment of peripheral immune efficiency in ALL patients is commonly found. The existence of positive correlations between zinc or active thymulin and peripheral immunological parameters (phytohemagglutinin [PHA] and concanavalin A [ConA]) at various stages of the disease suggests a link between derangement of peripheral immune function, thymic hormone activity, and zinc failure. These findings, considered together, suggest the possibility of a carefully controlled clinic trial with zinc in ALL patients at the onset and in relapse even in the light of in vitro ineffectiveness of physiological zinc or thymulin concentrations on the duplicative index of human lymphoblastoid cells.","['Mocchegiani, E', 'Paolucci, P', 'Granchi, D', 'Cavallazzi, L', 'Santarelli, L', 'Fabris, N']","['Mocchegiani E', 'Paolucci P', 'Granchi D', 'Cavallazzi L', 'Santarelli L', 'Fabris N']","['Gerontology Research Department, Italian National Research Centers on Aging (INRCA), Ancona.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['9H198D04WL (Thymic Factor, Circulating)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/immunology', 'Thymic Factor, Circulating/*analysis', 'Zinc/*blood/pharmacology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75771-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 1;83(3):749-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed and standardized a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), both of which bind to the amino-terminal 45-kD fragment of GC and inhibit platelet-von Willebrand interactions and the streptavidin-biotin system. First, the methodology was evaluated and standardized with special emphasis on the anticoagulant and the inhibitors (EDTA, prostaglandin E1 [PGE1], aprotinin, N-ethyl-maleimide), the mode of high-speed centrifugation (to avoid platelet microparticles), and the standards used (purified GPIb and GC). This assay was then used to analyze the GC levels of healthy subjects (2.04 +/- 0.46 micrograms/mL) and of patients with selected diseases. The results of patients with aplastic anemia and thrombocytosis confirmed that GC levels are clearly dependent on the platelet count, which was the basis for the introduction of the GC index, the standardization of GC for a platelet count of 250 x 10(9)/L. The GC index discriminates reliably patients with active immune thrombocytopenic purpura from those in remission. GC levels are elevated in patients on hemodialysis (3.62 +/- 0.75 micrograms/mL, P < .001). The high GC index (6.93 +/- 4.21, P < .001) in cirrhosis patients suggests an increased platelet turnover and/or abnormal proteolysis. In contrast to other groups, we have not found that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) treatment of patients with myocardial infarction increases GC levels. However, concentrations are elevated in leukemia and the highest levels found are approximately 40 micrograms/mL. These studies suggest that GC is a useful platelet marker in certain diseases, which directly reflects platelet damage and possibly platelet dysfunction.","['Beer, J H', 'Buchi, L', 'Steiner, B']","['Beer JH', 'Buchi L', 'Steiner B']","['University Hospital of Bern, Laboratory for Thrombosis Research, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (glycocalicin)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Platelets/*chemistry', 'Centrifugation', 'Child', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', '*Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood', 'Uremia/blood']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75764-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 1;83(3):691-702.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the effects of RA on normal hematopoiesis by using early hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) stringently purified from adult peripheral blood. In clonogenetic fetal calf serum-supplemented (FCS+) or -nonsupplemented (FCS-) culture treated with saturating levels of interleukin-3 (IL-3) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (Ep) (combined with c-kit ligand in FCS(-)-culture conditions), RA induces a dramatic dose-dependent shift from erythroid to granulomonocytic colony formation, the latter colonies being essentially represented by granulocytic clones. This shift is apparently not caused by a recruitment phenomenon, because in FCS+ culture, the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition. In FCS- liquid-suspension culture supplemented with saturating Ep level and low-dose IL-3/GM-CSF, adult HPC undergo unilineage erythropoietic differentiation: Here again, treatment with high-dose RA induces a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway. Studies on RA time-response or pulse treatment in semisolid or liquid culture show that early RA addition is most effective, thus indicating that early but not late HPC are sensitive to its action. We then analyzed the expression of the master GATA1 gene, which encodes a finger transcription factor required for normal erythroid development; addition of RA to HPC stimulated into unilineage erythropoietic differentiation in liquid culture caused a virtually complete inhibition of GATA1 mRNA induction.

The MLL gene, which is located at the 11q23 breakpoint in infant, childhood, and adult acute leukemias, has been cloned and has homology to the Drosophila trithorax gene. The breakpoints in MLL are restricted to an 8.3-kilobase pair (kb) region of the gene that is involved in translocations with as many as 29 other chromosomal regions in a number of phenotypically distinct acute leukemias. We have detected an identical, clonal, nonconstitutional rearrangement of the MLL gene in peripheral blood cells from a pair of female infants twins with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and a t(11;19)(q23;p13.3). The detection of nonidentical IGH rearrangements suggests that the MLL rearrangement took place in a B-cell precursor or hematopoietic stem cell in one twin which was transferred in utero to the other fetus resulting in ALL with an identical aneuploid karyotype in both infants. We speculate that the other MLL-related infant leukemias may also develop in utero, and that the rearrangements may occur consistently in stem cells or early precursor cells, accounting for the frequency of mixed-lineage leukemia in infants.","['Gill Super, H J', 'Rothberg, P G', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Freeman, A I', 'Diaz, M O', 'Rowley, J D']","['Gill Super HJ', 'Rothberg PG', 'Kobayashi H', 'Freeman AI', 'Diaz MO', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Diseases in Twins', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75756-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 1;83(3):641-4.,,"['CA38725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of defects in the IL-2R gamma chain in the etiology of X-linked SCID has suggested a heretofore unanticipated functional role of the gamma chain in immunologic development. While new and novel cytokines and cytokine receptors continue to be identified, it has become clear that our knowledge of IL-2, one of the best understood cytokine/receptor systems, is far from complete. Clarifying the molecular interactions between IL-2 and its receptor complex will improve the sophistication with which these interactions are manipulated in the clinic for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and allograft rejection, treatment of lymphoid malignancies, and cytokine-based therapies for immunotherapeutic treatment of nonlymphoid cancers. Recent gene therapy approaches to the treatment of children with the ADA-deficient form of SCID offers yet another exciting path for investigation. The use of retrovirally infected cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells in attempts to reconstitute the immune system of ADA-deficient SCID children with ADA-producing cells raises the possibility of similarly ""correcting"" the defect in X-linked SCID. Such approaches almost certainly loom on the near horizon for other diseases. However, in view of the complexity and potentially pleiomorphic nature of defects in the IL-2R gamma chain, both in terms of their identification and correction, gene therapy for treatment of X-linked SCID will require a thorough understanding of the molecular nature of the respective defects. Effective therapy will require precise knowledge of the defects, in terms of their influence on the ligand, receptor, and signaling apparatus, as well as their potential effects on cells of multiple lineages. However, these caveats aside, the potential for understanding and correcting a disease that robs infants at so early an age of the potential for a normal life will continue to make these exciting and extraordinarily rewarding pursuits.","['Voss, S D', 'Hong, R', 'Sondel, P M']","['Voss SD', 'Hong R', 'Sondel PM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison 53792.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*etiology/genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'X Chromosome']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75754-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 1;83(3):626-35.,107,"['CA-32685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-03186/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Blood. 1994 Jul 15;84(2):667-8.

Routinely prepared Romanowsky-Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears (approximately 23,000 cells) were scanned by a high-resolution color TV/microscope system and analyzed by color and texture algorithms. In addition to blast cells, lymphocytes and monocytes exhibited a leukemia-associated change in morphology. The calculated texture and color features were most significant for the subtyping performed by the statistical program. With multivariate statistical analysis, seven mathematical subtypes of lymphocytes and five of monocytes could be found over all the specimens. Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML, M1-M2), acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMOL, M4) and acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL, M5) could be differentiated by their distributions of monocyte subtypes.

METHODS: In 82 patients with predominantly early B-CLL observed for a median of 65 months (13-331), 309 trephine biopsies were carried out, a median of three (two to eight) per patient. The biopsies were classified into nodular, interstitial, mixed and diffuse patterns. Lymphocytic infiltration was subjectively graded into minimal (< 20%), intermediate (20-50%) and majority (> 50%) categories and all changes were compared. RESULTS: Intensity of infiltration increased through this histologic range, as did the relative risk of death. Survival of patients with > 50% involvement was significantly poorer than those with < 50%. Changes in both lymphocyte numbers and pattern occurred slowly in early disease but quickened as the leukaemia advanced. Under treatment, lymphocytes decreased but the histology did not alter significantly. Examining the marrow for disease progression should be part of regular follow-up. It may help identify the minority of patients with early disease which will run a more active course and in whom early therapy may yet be indicated. We recommend biopsy at two-yearly intervals in early disease, more frequently as the leukaemia advances.

METHODS: Post transplant outcome of patients with advanced leukaemia given HLA-identical unrelated donor marrow transplants was compared to that of patients transplanted concurrently from HLA-identical sibling donors, in terms of survival, leukaemia-free survival, incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), duration of neutropenia, incidence of infection and duration of transplant hospitalisation. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with advanced leukaemia and without a histocompatible family member donor received unrelated donor bone marrow transplants. Actuarial survival at two years post transplant was 30%. Actuarial survival of 23 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants with advanced leukaemia transplanted during the same time period was 17% (not significant). Actuarial disease free survival at two years was 30% and 13% respectively. Three of five long term survivors of the unrelated transplants had chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic transformation at the time of transplant; thus blastic transformation should not preclude consideration of unrelated marrow transplantation. Recipients of unrelated allografts had a higher incidence of acute GVHD which occurred earlier and with greater severity than in recipients of sibling allografts, a longer duration of post transplant neutropenia (24 days to reach 0.5 x 10(9)/L versus 19.5, p = 0.07), a higher frequency of infection in the first 100 days post transplant (p = 0.0004) and a longer duration of transplant hospitalisation (p = 0.04). Transplant-related complications were the commonest cause of death in the unrelated donor recipients, while leukaemic recurrence was the commonest single cause of death in the HLA-identical sibling recipients. Improvements are needed in prophylaxis of infection and in prevention and treatment of acute GVHD in recipients of unrelated donor transplants. Nevertheless, this modality provides curative treatment for patients with otherwise incurable haematological malignancies and should no longer be considered experimental.","['Atkinson, K', 'Dodds, A J', 'Concannon, A J', 'Milliken, S', 'Downs, K', 'Marshall, G', 'Wilson, F', 'Staniforth, D']","['Atkinson K', 'Dodds AJ', 'Concannon AJ', 'Milliken S', 'Downs K', 'Marshall G', 'Wilson F', 'Staniforth D']","[""School of Medicine, Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1993.tb01829.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1993 Oct;23(5):450-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1993.tb01829.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PME and PDE resonances may undergo significant alterations during tumor growth, at early stages of tumor response to treatment or following cell differentiation and maturation. The enzymatic mechanisms which regulate these alterations are scarcely understood. Recent studies on agonist-induced phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis by PC-specific phospholipase C (PC-plc) in cells stimulated by hormones or growth factors suggest the hypothesis that repeated transient activations of this enzyme may also contribute to the elevation of PCho levels in tumor NMR spectra. This paper reports the first direct evidence on neutral active PC-plc activity in a tumour cell system, Friend leukemia cells, either in the undifferentiated (FLC) or differentiated state (dFLC). Cell homogenates were incubated in the presence of mixed diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin unilamellar vesicles (SLUV), which were previously shown to represent a good substrate for bacterial plc. 31P NMR analyses allowed the simultaneous detection and quantification of phosphorylated metabolites produced in tumor cell homogenates by PC-plc activity, as well by enzymes active in the PC deacylation pathway. With respect to FLC, dFLC homogenates exhibited higher PC-plc activity and lower accumulation of a deacylation product, GroPCho, in agreement with the elevation in the [PCho]/[GroPCho] ratio, already reported in 31P NMR spectra of intact differentiated cells. The direct detection of PC-plc in this cell system opens novel biochemical interpretations on a series of oncological observations, such as a) transient increases in the levels of PCho and PC-derived diacylglycerols reported in immature or in transformed cells in response to agonist-receptor interactions and b) accumulation of mobile lipids in tumor cell membranes and tissues.","['Ferretti, A', 'Podo, F', 'Carpinelli, G', 'Chen, L', 'Borghi, P', 'Masella, R']","['Ferretti A', 'Podo F', 'Carpinelli G', 'Chen L', 'Borghi P', 'Masella R']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '3436-45-1 (1,2-heptanoylphosphatidylcholine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/pathology', 'Liposomes', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylcholines/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1993 Nov-Dec;13(6A):2309-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth inhibitory activities of the compounds were estimated by MTT assay after the incubation of cells under continuous exposure to the drug. The mean concentrations (microM) of DWA2114R, CBDCA and CDDP needed to inhibit the proliferation of cells by 50% (IC50) were 64.0, 55.1 and 6.8 against solid tumor lines and 8.5, 7.4 and 1.7 against hematopoietic malignant lines, respectively. Comparing the drug sensitivity of the solid tumor lines by type, ovarian cancer was found to be the most susceptible to all three compounds. The susceptibilities of other tumors were in the order prostate, breast and colon cancers for DWA2114R and CBDCA but colon, prostate and breast cancers for CDDP. The correlations of the mean IC50 values for all three combinations of the two compounds were statistically evaluated. A significant correlation was shown between DWA2114R and CBDCA, or CBDCA and CDDP, but not between DWA2114R and CDDP. These results suggest that DWA2114R is almost equivalent in effect to CBDCA which is several times less potent than CDDP, but also that the in vitro cell line subpanel specificity of DWA2114R is in certain respects different from CDDP, in contrast with CBDCA.","['Akamatsu, K', 'Saito, H', 'Tsunenari, T', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Morikawa, K', 'Koizumi, M', 'Mitsui, H', 'Koizumi, K']","['Akamatsu K', 'Saito H', 'Tsunenari T', 'Matsumoto T', 'Morikawa K', 'Koizumi M', 'Mitsui H', 'Koizumi K']","['Laboratory of Cancer and Hematological Disease, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '103775-75-3 (DWA 2114)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carboplatin/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1993 Nov-Dec;13(6A):2261-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc has been strongly variously implicated in the regulation of the apoptotic cascade. Since we recently found that a low dose of the protein synthesis inhibitor PM activated the apoptotic cascade in HL-60 leukaemic cells, the current study was undertaken to examine c-myc mRNA transcript levels in such cells, and to assess the relationship, if any, between PM-elicited c-myc mRNA superinduction and subsequent activation of the apoptotic cascade. PM was employed in vitro at doses of 0.9 microM and 2 microM. Dose-dependent c-myc mRNA superinduction was present at 1 hour of PM-exposure, and was associated with subsequent activation of the apoptotic cascade at 24 hours of exposure. Apoptosis was confirmed morphologically as evidenced by chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies, and by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis which showed the pattern of double-stranded DNA fragments that result from the activation of an endogenous endonuclease. [C14]Leucine incorporation studies at 1 hour demonstrated minimal protein synthesis inhibition at doses used, suggesting that c-myc mRNA superinduction in this context may have been the result of mechanisms which were independent of the inhibition of synthesis of new proteins, such as interruptions in signal transduction.","['Davidoff, A N', 'Mendelow, B V']","['Davidoff AN', 'Mendelow BV']","['Department of Haematology, School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Puromycin/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1993 Nov-Dec;13(6A):2257-60.,,,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism for antitumor activity is poorly understood. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxic activity in serum-containing medium is not predictive of in vivo antitumor activity for DSU. Since DSU are extensively bound to serum albumin (> 99%), we sought to determine the effect of albumin on tumor cytotoxicity. We adapted human CCRF-CEM leukemia and GC3 colon carcinoma cells for growth in UltraCHO serum- and albumin-free medium. In comparisons between normal growth medium (RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum) and UltraCHO medium, the unbound fraction of drug correlated better with cytotoxic activity than did the total drug. Tumor cytotoxicity by DSU required > 24 h and was markedly enhanced in UltraCHO medium. For example, LY181984 and Sulofenur had IC50 values of 7.4 and 12.1 micrograms/ml against CCRF-CEM in normal growth medium and 0.6 and 0.2 microgram/ml in UltraCHO. Moreover, DSU with the lowest IC-50s in albumin-free medium displayed the most potent in vivo antitumor activity in the 6C3HED lymphosarcoma. A Sulofenur-resistant CCRF-CEM cell line was developed by culturing the cells for > 20 passages in UltraCHO medium containing LY186641 at 2 micrograms/ml (10X IC-50). This line showed approximately 18-fold resistance to LY186641, but did not show cross-resistance to vinblastine, actinomycin D, or doxorubicin. The albumin-free conditions may be useful for further mechanistic studies on the antitumor action by DSU. Further studies are underway to determine whether DSU structural requirements for cytotoxicity an albumin binding are intrinsically linked.","['Schultz, R M', 'Andis, S L', 'Toth, J E', 'Boder, G B', 'Rinzel, S M', 'Grindey, G B']","['Schultz RM', 'Andis SL', 'Toth JE', 'Boder GB', 'Rinzel SM', 'Grindey GB']","['Division of Cancer Research, Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN 46285.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Sulfonylurea Compounds)', '3955-50-8 (LY 181984)', 'Z45N070N3S (sulofenur)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Molecular Structure', 'Serum Albumin/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1993 Nov-Dec;13(6A):1939-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is considered to occur in primary (idiopathic) or secondary forms. The secondary form is noticed in the setting of infections (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, infectious mononucleosis), or patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Affected patients show varying clinical presentation ranging from mild to serious hemolytic anemia, episodic hemoglobinuria, acrocyanosis, or other peripheral vaso-occlusive events which are all occasioned by cold exposure. In mild chronic cold agglutinin disease preventing cold exposure usually suffices to avoid disease exacerbation. However, treatment of severe disease is difficult. Splenectomy or glucocorticoids are generally disappointing, but exceptions have been reported. Treatment with alkylating agents, as for example chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, may be effective in some patients. However, late effects, and in particular their carcinogenic potential when used as long-term treatment, must be born in mind. We report on a 59-year-old woman with severe cold agglutinin disease who was at first treated successfully with chlorambucil and prednisone. Based on in vitro evidence, primary cold agglutinin disease can be considered as a low grade malignant lymphoproliferative disorder in which interferon-alpha has been shown to be an effective therapeutic agent, at least in forms such as hairy cell leukemia. We therefore switched therapy to interferon-alpha 2b (three million units/m2 body surface area subcutaneously three times weekly). 18 months after treatment initiation there was no remission, but improvement of clinical and laboratory signs of the disease was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Rordorf, R', 'Barth, A', 'Nydegger, U', 'Tobler, A']","['Rordorf R', 'Barth A', 'Nydegger U', 'Tobler A']","['Hamatologisches Zentrallabor der Universitat, Inselspital Bern.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/blood/*therapy', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reticulocytes']",1994/01/11 00:00,1994/01/11 00:01,['1994/01/11 00:00'],"['1994/01/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1994 Jan 11;124(1-2):56-61.,,,Behandlung einer schweren idiopathischen Kalteagglutinin-krankheit mit Interferon-alpha 2b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since an earlier analysis might be helpful in deciding on the subsequent treatment strategy, we explored whether an examination on day 8 might be equivalent, in particular in terms of quality of the specimen, as compared with that on day 17. In 10 AML patients undergoing the same induction treatment, bone marrow aspirates were examined prospectively at diagnosis (day 0), immediately after termination (day 8) and on day 17 of the first treatment course. We found that the number of cells not classifiable due to artifacts, as well as the otherwise non-evaluable cells, did not differ significantly in aspirates obtained on day 8 as compared with those on day 17. The number of leukemic cells decreased significantly from day 0 to day 8, whereas no change was noted between days 8 and 17. We conclude that a marrow examination on day 8 is not more prone to misinterpretation due to artifacts than our standard examination on day 17.

Recurring clonal cytogenetic abnormalities may be divided into those exclusively associated with myeloid disorders, those uniquely observed in lymphoid diseases, and those detected in both myeloid and lymphoid hemopathies. Several of the common defects are characteristic of specific FAB types or subtypes and are associated with specific clinico pathologic syndromes and clinical complications. Cytogenetic abnormalities have served to define relatively homogeneous subsets of malignant hemopathies which are not evident from morphological and other available markers. Cytogenetic findings have been demonstrated to be powerful indicators in predicting clinical course and outcome in patients and in guiding their management. Given the significant progress made in the treatment of malignant hemopathies, it is very important to identify parameters which may be used to predict whether patients will respond favorably to standard therapies or if they are unlikely to do so and require alternative strategies, such as bone marrow transplantation. Cytogenetic studies have also provided important insights into the understanding of malignant transformation processes. In a number of recurring chromosome translocations characteristic of leukemias and lymphomas the genes that are located at the breakpoints have been identified. Molecular analysis has revealed that alteration in expression of these genes or in the properties of the encoded proteins resulting from the rearrangements plays an integral part in malignant transformation. Studies of clonality have suggested that several chromosome abnormalities may arise in pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells, whereas others may originate in cells of more restricted lineage. The author focuses first on the implications of the karyotype in the diagnosis and the prognosis of myeloproliferative syndromes, acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, then on the interest of describing new clinical-cytogenetic associations. Finally, some of the recent results obtained in a cytogenetic study of myelodysplastic syndromes are discussed.","['Bellomo, M J']",['Bellomo MJ'],"['Division autonome de genetique medicale, CHUV, Lausanne.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Prognosis']",1994/01/11 00:00,1994/01/11 00:01,['1994/01/11 00:00'],"['1994/01/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1994 Jan 11;124(1-2):26-36.,,,Importance clinique du caryotype en hematologie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombining the active membrane fraction with cytosol resulted in no significant inhibition of its 12-lipoxygenase activity, but the addition of GSH to the membrane fraction inhibited 12-lipoxygenase activity in a dose-dependent manner.

General modes of treatment are identical for the two drugs, consisting of initial therapy at relatively high dose aimed at obtaining complete remission and maintenance therapy essential to conserve the improved clinical status. Both types of treatment must be adapted to suit the patient. Complete remission is achieved in 95 to 100% of cases with pipobroman and in 80 to 90% of cases with hydroxyurea. Incidents which may occur during initial therapy include cytopenia, more frequent and severe under treatment with hydroxyurea, rare transitory digestive troubles and cutaneous and mucous eruptions. Subject to control of the blood cell count every three to four months, maintenance therapy may be continued for many years and while the time lapse is as yet insufficient for hydroxyurea, resistance to pipobroman does not appear to develop even after more than 20 years of treatment.

Serum LD isoenzyme patterns are often quite different from those in the affected tissues. Such differences result from differences in the biological half lives of the individual isoenzyme. In order to reveal such phenomena, we applied the one-compartment model to simulate the time dependent changes in the serum LD isoenzyme patterns as a most simple model. When we simulated leukemic cells as an affected origin, LD isoenzyme patterns obtained at a stage of clinical deterioration or active stage, were characterized by a high proportion of LD-2, LD-3 and LD-4, and resembled those of the original leukemic cells. In general, strong similarities in alterations of LD isoenzyme patterns were obtained between the clinical observed time course and simulated time course. These changes in LD isoenzyme patterns are practically observed in the cases of leukemia, lymphoma, and so on. If the original organs are identical, then it is change of disease stage that is responsible for modification of variable LD isoenzyme patterns. Such phenomena must therefore be noted--in doing so, we shall be able to estimate the origin of enzyme release, disease stage, and prognosis.","['Maekawa, M', 'Tani, S', 'Kanno, T']","['Maekawa M', 'Tani S', 'Kanno T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

The role of intrinsic factor (IF) in B12 absorption is widely known, but, in fact there exists a much more intricate and complex mechanism for the effective assimilation of this important trace element in humans. B12 binding proteins play important roles in all stages of vitamin B12 metabolism. They are involved not only in its absorption, but also in its transport in serum, uptake to cells, storage in organs, enterohepatic circulation, and elimination of its analogues. Besides IF, well-known as a vitamin B12 binding protein found in gastric juice, there are other kinds of binding proteins found in human serum which are composed to transcobalamin (TC) I, II and III. Elevation of the vitamin B12 level in chronic myelogenous leukemia was first reported in the 1950s. Since then, B12 elevation has been found to occur in other kinds of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) as well and to be caused by an increase of serum TC. In CMPDs, either TCI or TCIII increases, but, the degree of elevation and the type of TC involved differs for each disorder. This article describes the changes in TC of CMPD patients.

To analyze the presented figures of a pathologic scatterplot (SP) on the visual display unit, the standard scale derived from 220 normal SP patterns which was composed of four kinds of cell SP scales (neutrophil: N, monocyte: Mo, eosinophil: Eo, lymphocyte: Ly) was applied. Leukemic SP figures were variable depending upon both the type of FAB classification and their therapeutic processes. SP forms of M0-blasts were semi-round and located in the central area surrounded by N-, Mo-, and Ly-SP scale. Blast SP of M1 and M2 was shown as a developing process to the SP field containing immature myeloid cells extending from the central area. It was reasonable that immature neutrophilic SP expression was obtained in M3 and Ph1 positive CML. However, the SP of M3v and Ph1 negative CML showed myelomonocytic features as CMMoL does. Typical myelomonocytic SP patterns were obtained in M4 patients. SP figures of MDS were characterized by deformability, dislocation and another abnormality, and these changes, especially in lymphocytes are very useful for diagnosis of MDS. Therefore, the FAB subtype of AML including MDS and CML could be distinguished from each other on the basis of SP pattern. In lymphoproliferative disorders, limited conductivity in ALL-SP was characteristic, while irregular and deformed SP was peculiar in leukemic malignant lymphoma.

Otherwise, the clinical manifestations and response to corticosteroid therapy were typical of Sweet's syndrome. The onset of the dermatosis coincided with the onset of neutrophilic differentiation induced by single-agent leukemia therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Subsequent exacerbation of the manifestations of Sweet's syndrome and the ultimate conversion of the histologic picture to the expected mature neutrophilic dermal infiltrate coincided with the completion of neutrophilic differentiation in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The ability of immature neutrophil precursors to induce cutaneous lesions of Sweet's syndrome may indicate an ATRA-induced functional maturation that slightly precedes its effect on morphologic maturation.

We identified SET as a 39-kDa protein by immunoprecipitation with rabbit antiserum against each of three synthetic peptides predicted from the open reading frame of the set gene. We confirmed this identification of SET by protein sequencing. We also observed that SET is expressed ubiquitously in various human cell lines. SET is phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in cultured cells and is localized predominantly in nuclei. Although the function(s) of SET and SET-CAN is not known, we propose that SET plays a key role in the mechanism of leukemogenesis in acute undifferentiated leukemia, perhaps by activating CAN in nuclei and stimulating the transformation potential of SET-CAN. This proposed role would therefore be similar to the roles observed for BCR and DEK of the chimeric oncoproteins BCR-ABL and DEK-CAN in acute myeloid leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, respectively.","['Adachi, Y', 'Pavlakis, G N', 'Copeland, T D']","['Adachi Y', 'Pavlakis GN', 'Copeland TD']","['Human Retrovirus Section, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/21 00:00,1994/01/21 00:01,['1994/01/21 00:00'],"['1994/01/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42162-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jan 21;269(3):2258-62.,,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a recent study we demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) associates with the Fyn SH3 domain. Here we show that p85, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, binds directly to the SH3 domains of Abl, Lck, Fyn, and p85 itself. An examination of p85 amino acid sequence revealed two proline-rich sequences in its N-terminal region similar to those present in 3BP1, 3BP2, and SOS. To test whether these sequences mediate the association of p85 with SH3 domains two peptides with amino acid composition corresponding to the p85 alpha proline-rich sequences were synthesized and used in competition assays. Both peptides worked equally well in inhibiting the binding of PI 3-kinase activity and p85 alpha to Fyn SH3 domain, whereas a control peptide had no effect. These results indicate that, as in 3BP1 and SOS, the proline-rich sequences in p85 mediate its interaction with SH3 domains.

Binding of IL-1 to the type I 80-kDa receptor results in generation of intracellular signals and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B.

In this paper, we show that NF-kappa B1 (p50) and RelA (p65) were specifically translocated to the nucleus following activation of intact type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). The C-terminal region of the type I IL-1R is required for this effect, and deletion of its cytoplasmic domain abrogates the activation of NF-kappa B by IL-1. These results provide evidence that IL-1 modulates the activity of NF-kappa B through the type I IL-1 receptor and identifies a domain required for signal transduction to this specific transcription factor.","['Leung, K', 'Betts, J C', 'Xu, L', 'Nabel, G J']","['Leung K', 'Betts JC', 'Xu L', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/21 00:00,1994/01/21 00:01,['1994/01/21 00:00'],"['1994/01/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42061-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jan 21;269(3):1579-82.,,['AI29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased urinary excretion of neopterin has been described in conditions of cell-mediated immune activation and in neoplastic diseases, including haemopoietic tumours. METHODS: We studied by radioimmunoassay serum neopterin levels of 91 patients with haematological malignancies differing in diagnosis, stage, treatment, and disease duration. RESULTS: Mean patient neopterin (13.5 nmol/L) was increased compared to 69 healthy controls (5.4 nmol/L, P < 0.001), and individual levels were related to patient survival (P = 0.006). No relevant differences were found among the various disorders, whilst advanced stages and active diseases had higher levels than initial stages and non-active diseases. Furthermore, off-therapy patients in stable remission did not differ from normals. Among subjects on therapy, patients on alpha-interferon had a higher percentage of (dose-related) neopterin elevation, in spite of a steady disease. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that serum neopterin dosage has prognostic value in staging and follow-up, and may provide a useful tool for monitoring the therapy (particularly with biological response modifiers) of haematological neoplasias.","['Caenazzo, A', 'Pietrogrande, F', 'Sgarabotto, D', 'Dazzi, F', 'Sartori, D', 'Vattamattathil, K P', 'Girolami, A']","['Caenazzo A', 'Pietrogrande F', 'Sgarabotto D', 'Dazzi F', 'Sartori D', 'Vattamattathil KP', 'Girolami A']","['Istituto di Semeiotica, Universita di Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neopterin', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1993 Jul-Aug;78(4):225-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we explored the in vitro behavior of CLL B-cells after exposure to the compounds included in the most frequently used combination therapy regimen (CEOP). METHODS: A 4-day MTT colorimetric assay was used in vitro to test the effect of CEOP regimen drugs, either alone or in combination, on CLL B-cells. All drugs but mafosfamide, tested in place of cyclophosphamide, were used at concentrations corresponding to the in vivo dosage employed in the CEOP regimen. Chlorambucil was also studied since it represents the standard treatment for this disease. RESULTS: Epirubicin, prednisone and vincristine displayed a cytotoxic effect in 15, 13 and 4 out of 30 samples, respectively. Combinations of the same drugs showed a synergistic effect in 6 out of 13 assays. A cytotoxic effect of chlorambucil was detected in 2 out of 5 responders to the combination of CEOP regimen drugs, and in 3 out of 7 non responders. Mafosfamide induced a reduction in cell survival in 60-80% of the samples, depending on its concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The MTT assay is suitable for evaluating the in vitro chemosensitivity of CLL B-cells to multidrug regimen compounds. In the present study 40% of samples were resistant to CEOP regimen components in vitro. The possible role of MTT in predicting the clinical response to the CEOP regimen should still be established by prospective in vitro and in vivo studies.","['Morabito, F', 'Messina, G', 'Oliva, B', 'Ramirez, F', 'Callea, V', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Nobile, F']","['Morabito F', 'Messina G', 'Oliva B', 'Ramirez F', 'Callea V', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Nobile F']","['Department of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti USSL 11, Reggio Calabria, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CEOP protocol 1']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Colorimetry', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1993 Jul-Aug;78(4):213-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, only a few studies have been performed to investigate whether rHuEpo can affect or modulate the growth of malignant cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the effects of rHuEpo (0.5 to 10 IU/mL) on clonogenic growth and cell kinetics in ten cell lines derived from both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Clonogenic assays were performed by plating 5 x 10(3) cells in agar, while the percentage of cells in S phase was assessed by DNA flow cytometry. RESULTS: rHuEpo did not affect either in vitro colony formation or S phase percentage in the human erythroid cell lines K-562 and HEL expressing erythropoietin receptors (< 40 receptors per cell). No effect of rHuEpo was observed in the remaining hematopoietic cell lines or in five solid tumor cell lines.

To better understand the roles of gCap39 and gelsolin, we have compared their relative amounts and intracellular distributions. We found that gCap39 is very abundant in macrophages (accounting for 0.6% of total macrophage proteins), and is present in 12-fold molar excess to gelsolin. Both proteins are highly induced during differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line into macrophages. gCap39 is less abundant in fibroblasts (0.04% total proteins) and is present in equal molar ratio to gelsolin. The two proteins are colocalized in the cytoplasm, but gCap39 is also found in the nucleus while gelsolin is not. Nuclear gCap39 redistributes throughout the cytoplasm during mitosis and is excluded from regions containing chromosomes.

The involvement of RAR alpha is particularly intriguing in view of the efficient therapeutic effect of retinoic acid (RA) in this disease. In this report, we show that PML is specifically localized within a discrete subnuclear compartment corresponding to nuclear bodies recognized by patient autoimmune sera. In APL cells, the PML-RAR alpha hybrid displays an abnormal localization and directs RXR and other nuclear antigens into aberrant structures that are tightly bound to chromatin. This suggests that the hybrid could exert a dominant negative effect by diverting a subset of proteins from their natural sites of action. Interestingly, treatment of APL cells with RA induces a complete relocalization of each of these proteins. We propose that the beneficial role of RA in promoting myeloid differentiation in APL might be related to its ability to restore a normal subnuclear organization.","['Weis, K', 'Rambaud, S', 'Lavau, C', 'Jansen, J', 'Carvalho, T', 'Carmo-Fonseca, M', 'Lamond, A', 'Dejean, A']","['Weis K', 'Rambaud S', 'Lavau C', 'Jansen J', 'Carvalho T', 'Carmo-Fonseca M', 'Lamond A', 'Dejean A']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1994/01/28 00:00,1994/01/28 00:01,['1994/01/28 00:00'],"['1994/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(94)90341-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(94)90341-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1994 Jan 28;76(2):345-56. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(94)90341-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In APL cells, the POD is disrupted into a microparticulate pattern as a consequence of the expression of the PML-RAR oncoprotein. RA treatment of APL cells triggers a reorganization of PML to generate normal-appearing PODs. We propose that PML-RAR is a dominant negative oncoprotein that exerts its putative leukomogenic effect by inhibiting assembly of the POD. According to this proposal, not only is the POD a novel structure, but it can be ascribed an imputed function such that its disruption leads to altered myeloid maturation; this may represent a novel oncogenic target.","['Dyck, J A', 'Maul, G G', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Chen, J D', 'Kakizuka, A', 'Evans, R M']","['Dyck JA', 'Maul GG', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Chen JD', 'Kakizuka A', 'Evans RM']","['Biomedical Sciences Graduate Progam University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1994/01/28 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/01/28 00:00'],"['1994/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(94)90340-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(94)90340-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1994 Jan 28;76(2):333-43. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(94)90340-9.,,['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a radioenzyme assay, the authors determined sTK in 146 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Morphologic subtypes were refractory anemia (RA) in 18 patients, RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS) in 24, RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) in 41, RAEB in transformation (RAEB/T) in 29, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in 34. RESULTS: Enzyme levels ranged from 1.1 to 829 U/microliters. One hundred fifteen (79%) patients had elevated sTK levels (more than 5 U/microliters) at the time of diagnosis. In advanced stages of MDS (RAEB, CMML, and RAEB/T) enzyme activities were higher than in early stages (RA and RARS) (P < 0.05). However, sTK levels were not correlated with the percentage of medullary blast cells. Among other parameters tested, the best correlation with sTK was found for serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (r = 0.29; P < 0.0005). As shown by life table analysis, sTK activity at diagnosis provided useful information regarding the prognosis of patients. For patients with sTK levels of less than 10 U/microliters, actuarial survival after 2 years was 65%, compared with 33% for those with enzyme values of 10 U/microliters or greater. The 5-year cumulative survival rates were 34% and 14%, respectively (P < 0.0005). However, sTK levels at diagnosis were not useful for predicting transformation to AML. Nine of 61 (15%) patients with sTK of less than 10 U/microliters had AML develop, whereas 15 of 57 (26%) patients with sTK of 10 U/microliters or greater had disease progress to acute leukemia (chi-square, 1.64; P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the lack of correlation with bone marrow blasts, the authors conclude that increased sTK levels in MDS are primarily attributable to intramedullary destruction of hematopoietic precursors and do not reflect the leukemic blast cell burden. This appears similar to the ineffective hematopoiesis of vitamin B12 deficiency, which is associated with elevated levels of sTK and LDH. The data suggest that sTK is a prognostic parameter that can be used to predict the survival of patients with MDS. However, multivariate analysis shows that the predictive value of sTK is not superior to that of LDH.","['Aul, C', 'Gattermann, N', 'Germing, U', 'Winkelmann, M', 'Heyll, A', 'Runde, V', 'Schneider, W']","['Aul C', 'Gattermann N', 'Germing U', 'Winkelmann M', 'Heyll A', 'Runde V', 'Schneider W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940115)73:2<322::aid-cncr2820730215>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jan 15;73(2):322-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940115)73:2<322::aid-cncr2820730215>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates and biopsy specimens were reviewed in a blinded fashion; dysplasia was assessed in as objective a manner as possible by numerically scoring nine specific findings: erythrocyte multinuclearity, nuclear fragmentation, megaloblastic characteristics, leukocyte granulation abnormalities and nuclear malformations, Pelger-Huet cells, and megakaryocytic dysplasia (mononuclear megakaryocytes, micromegakaryocytes, and megakaryocytes with multiple distinct nuclei). RESULTS: Dysplasia of the megakaryocytic line was seen in 34% of patients; 70% of the patients had erythrocyte dysplasia; and 68% had leukocyte dysplasia. Pelger-Huet cells were seen in bone marrow of 35% of the patients. Overall dysplasia score and specific dysplastic findings such as Pelger-Huet cells did not correlate with a known history of myelodysplasia (P = 0.47), cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.35), prior chemotherapy treatment with or without alkylating agents (P = 1.00), previous malignant disorders such as polycythemia vera (P = 1.00), remission rate (P = 0.93), or survival (P = 0.42).

Using manual solid-phase peptide synthesis modified for optimal efficiency, we directly synthesized 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.25 tandem repeats corresponding to 20, 40, 60, 80, 105 amino acids of the human mucin muc-1, the complete 60 amino acid proline-rich neutralization domain of feline leukemia virus, and 70 and 72 amino acids of two very hydrophobic engineered tandem repeat proteins.

A melting of structure could be demonstrated with increasing temperature as measured by decreasing molar ellipticity at 198 nm. The intensity of the molar ellipticity at 198 nm, as compared to the molar ellipticity of random coil, non-proline-containing peptides, led to the conclusion that the large, intense negative band at 198 nm is diagnostic of the poly-proline beta-turn helix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fontenot, J D', 'Finn, O J', 'Dales, N', 'Andrews, P C', 'Montelaro, R C']","['Fontenot JD', 'Finn OJ', 'Dales N', 'Andrews PC', 'Montelaro RC']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, PA 15261.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pept Res,Peptide research,8913494,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Mucins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '25191-13-3 (polyproline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mucin-1', 'Mucins/chemistry', 'Peptides/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/*chemistry']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pept Res. 1993 Nov-Dec;6(6):330-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Against i.v. inoculated P388 leukemia, the most significant combination effect was observed when cisplatin was administered 4 h after NVB injection (ILS(%) > 451) and three long-term survivors were observed. On this schedule, the combination of LD10 of each drug was achieved, indicating the lack of addition of toxicity. This was further proved by examination of body weight change, white blood cell count and platelet count. Interestingly, significant elevation of blood urea nitrogen concentration by cisplatin was prevented by the combination with NVB. The combination of maximum tolerated dose of NVB and cisplatin was also tolerable in nude mice, and their combination effect was observed against human lung large cell carcinoma Lu-65 and adenocarcinoma PC-12.

In contrast, the cationic surfactant, Catrimox-14, lyses cells and simultaneously precipitates RNA, thereby protecting it from RNases. We describe and compare four methods for extracting RNA from cultured cells that differ in the technique used to extract the RNA from the precipitate. The first uses a high-salt solution (guanidinium isothiocyanate). In the second, the RNA is extracted with a polar solvent (formamide). The third involves conversion of the RNA to the sodium salt by treatment of the precipitate in situ with sodium acetate in ethanol.

The IFN-gamma response was associated with the appearance of CTL specific for Cas and with age-dependent resistance to neurologic disease. While both immune responses were mediated by a CD8-enriched population of T cells, IFN-gamma did not play a role in the activation of the Cas-specific CTL response. However, when given exogenously, IFN-gamma delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of Cas-induced neurologic disease. These data suggest that the IFN-gamma response to Cas infection may be an important host defense mechanism whose effects on virus replication and neurologic disease expression are independent of its effect on Cas-specific CTL.","['Sarzotti, M', 'Gomes, M da P', 'Hoffman, P M']","['Sarzotti M', 'Gomes Mda P', 'Hoffman PM']","['Retrovirus Research Center, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, School of Medicine, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nervous System Diseases/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vim.1993.6.207 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 1993 Fall;6(3):207-17. doi: 10.1089/vim.1993.6.207.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparison of phenotypic expression and genotyping.,423-32,"T-cell receptor antibodies (TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta) were used for a flow cytometric study of 114 specimens of lymphoid neoplasms and normal controls in order to find out whether or not the expression of TCR proteins differs in between normal and neoplastic tissues. It was found that TCR alpha beta population was predominant in all categories except T gamma lymphoproliferative disorder (TGLD), T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and natural killer-like T-cell lymphoma (NKTL), in which three of 18, one of three, and two of two specimens, respectively, showed a predominant TCR gamma delta population. Natural killer cell lymphoma (NKL) showed essentially absence of either TCR alpha beta or TCR gamma delta protein. Therefore, TCR antibodies can be selectively used in cases of TGLD, T-ALL, and NKTL to substantiate their diagnoses. Furthermore, the absence of TCR protein is characteristic of NKL and helps to distinguish it from NKTL. Without the TCR antibodies, TCR gene analysis is sometimes needed to separate these two entities. When comparing with genotyping, 11 of 12 cases with TCR beta gene rearrangement and one of two cases with TCR alpha gene rearrangement expressed TCR alpha beta protein. One of four cases with TCR gamma gene rearrangement and both cases with TCR delta gene rearrangement expressed TCR gamma delta protein. Thus, TCR antibody phenotyping can reliably predict TCR genotypes under most circumstances.","['Sun, T', 'Henshall, J', 'Cuomo, J', 'Maher, K', 'Rapp, D', 'Goh, J']","['Sun T', 'Henshall J', 'Cuomo J', 'Maher K', 'Rapp D', 'Goh J']","['Department of Laboratories, North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, NY 11030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', '*Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1993 Nov-Dec;23(6):423-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of the New York Study.,278-86,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid to induce complete remission and to examine its effects on duration of remission and survival in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. DESIGN: Phase II evaluation and comparison with historical control patients. SETTING: Tertiary care cancer referral center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with morphologic diagnoses of acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated during a 2-year period with all-trans retinoic acid (daily oral dose, 45 mg/m2). Newly diagnosed patients discontinued the drug approximately 30 days after they achieved complete remission, at which time they received three courses of combination chemotherapy. Patients treated with previous cytotoxic chemotherapy who then relapsed were continued on all-trans retinoic acid as ""maintenance"" therapy until they relapsed again. RESULTS: 56 patients entered the study: 34 were newly diagnosed and 22 had relapsed from previous treatment. Fifty-one patients subsequently were found to have the PML/RAR-alpha gene rearrangement indicative of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and 44 of these patients achieved complete remission (86%; 95% Cl, 76% to 96%). A distinctive respiratory distress syndrome developed in 13 patients (23%) during treatment, and 5 patients (9%; Cl, 3% to 20%) died of this complication. The 5 patients who lacked PML/RAR-alpha rearrangements were withdrawn and given chemotherapy. The 13 patients given all-trans retinoic acid alone as maintenance therapy (10 of whom had relapsed from a chemotherapy-induced remission) had a median duration of remission of only 3.5 months (range, 1 to 23 months). Only 3 of 19 patients who relapsed from a remission induced by all-trans retinoic acid could be brought into remission again using this drug. The median survival time of all newly diagnosed patients has not been reached, but it now exceeds 31 months (range, 0.4 to 36+ months). No decrease in the early mortality rate was observed compared with a historical control group composed of 80 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients treated only with chemotherapy at this center; however, overall survival was superior. CONCLUSIONS: All-trans retinoic acid is an effective agent to induce remission in patients with a molecular diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, but remissions are short and resistance develops rapidly. Although the incidence of early death was not reduced, the use of all-trans retinoic acid to induce remission, followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy for ""consolidation,"" was associated with longer survival times when compared with historical controls treated only with chemotherapy. Additional studies to prevent or mitigate consequences of the ""retinoic acid syndrome"" and to identify specific patients who might benefit from earlier intervention with chemotherapy are needed to maximize the advantages of this approach.","['Frankel, S R', 'Eardley, A', 'Heller, G', 'Berman, E', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Frankel SR', 'Eardley A', 'Heller G', 'Berman E', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1994/02/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-120-4-199402150-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1994 Feb 15;120(4):278-86. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-120-4-199402150-00004.,,"['CA-55449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000764/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A randomized controlled trial.,82-7,"We performed a prospective randomized, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of selective depletion of CD8+ bone marrow cells in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in 38 patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling donor bone marrow transplantation for leukemia. All patients received CsA for GVHD prophylaxis. Nineteen patients received marrow depleted of CD8+ cells by ex vivo treatment with anti-leu2, an anti-CD8 mAb and complement; four patients had moderate (grade 1 or 2 acute GVHD) and the only patient who experienced grade 3 manifestations was a technical failure. The control group consisted of 19 patients who received unmodified bone marrow; one patient had grade 1, 4 patients had grade 2, and 10 had grade 3 or 4 acute GVHD. The actuarial incidence of grade > or = 2 acute GVHD was 20 +/- 20% in the CD8-depleted group compared with 80 +/- 18% in the controls (P = 0.004). Death in 5 of the control patients and the single patient in whom CD8 depletion was a technical failure was related to acute GVHD. Graft failure occurred in 2 patients in the CD8-depleted group and in none of the controls. Leukemic relapse occurred in 2 patients receiving CD8-depleted bone marrow and 2 patients in the control group. Seven patients receiving marrow depleted of CD8+ cells are alive and free of leukemia and 9 patients in the control group are alive, 7 of whom remain leukemia-free (P = 0.88). The 3-year actuarial leukemia-free survival is 37 +/- 22% of the CD8-depleted group and 36 +/- 22% for the control group. These results indicate that selective depletion of CD8+ cells from the bone marrow significantly reduces the incidence and severity of acute GVHD.","['Nimer, S D', 'Giorgi, J', 'Gajewski, J L', 'Ku, N', 'Schiller, G J', 'Lee, K', 'Territo, M', 'Ho, W', 'Feig, S', 'Selch, M']","['Nimer SD', 'Giorgi J', 'Gajewski JL', 'Ku N', 'Schiller GJ', 'Lee K', 'Territo M', 'Ho W', 'Feig S', 'Selch M', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (CD8 Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199401000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1994 Jan;57(1):82-7. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199401000-00015.,,['CA23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A further 146 patients who did not receive the anthracycline-intensified conditioning served as (historic) controls. All patients received cyclophosphamide (total dose, 120 mg/kg) on days -6 and -5 and total body irradiation on days -2 and -1 prior to BMT. The 99 patients who received the anthracycline-intensified preparative regimen were given either idarubicin (total dose, 42 mg/m2; n = 88) or daunorubicin (total dose, 156 mg/m2; n = 11) by continuous intravenous infusion between days -7 and -1 prior to BMT in 59 cases (cohort 1), on days -8 and -7 in 17 cases (cohort 2), and on days -12 and -11 in 23 cases (cohort 3). The occurrence of severe oral mucositis and delayed bone marrow recovery was schedule dependent, being substantially lower with earlier administration of the anthracycline-intensified regimen on days -12 and -11 before BMT (cohort 3), in comparison with later administration (cohorts 1 and 2). Plasma drug and metabolite concentrations were measured in 11 patients who received idarubicin. At the time of allogeneic bone marrow infusion (day 0), patients in cohorts 1 and 2 had plasma concentrations of idarubicin and idarubicinol (its active metabolite) in the range of in vitro cytotoxicity. However, in cohort 3, plasma concentrations on day 0 were much lower, which correlated with the lower maximum intensity and shorter duration of mucositis in these patients. In terms of overall survival, relapse rate, and disease-free survival in standard-risk patients, the anthracycline-intensified regimen proved to be very effective. Transplant-related mortality was 25% in the anthracycline group compared with 32% in the controls. The probability of relapse also was significantly less in the anthracycline group in comparison with controls (17% v 46%; P < .001), and the probabilities of long-term overall and disease-free survival were significantly greater (71% v 37% [P < .01] and 63% v 32% [P < .01], respectively). Only three patients in the idarubicin group experienced cardiotoxicity (one in each cohort); the causative relationship with anthracyclines was considered likely in one, possible in one, and doubtful in the third.","['Muus, P', 'Donnelly, P', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Linssen, P', 'Minderman, H', 'Dompeling, E', 'de Witte, T']","['Muus P', 'Donnelly P', 'Schattenberg A', 'Linssen P', 'Minderman H', 'Dompeling E', 'de Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods/mortality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Premedication', 'Stomatitis/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Dec;20(6 Suppl 8):47-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial treatment consisted of an 8-day induction phase with cytarabine together with idarubicin on days 3 to 5 and etoposide on days 6 to 8. A multidrug consolidation phase was subsequently administered and, after a treatment-free interval of 2 to 4 weeks, two 5-day intensification courses with high-dose cytarabine and etoposide were delivered with a 4-week interval between each course. Continuation therapy was started 2 to 4 weeks after the second course, with 6-thioguanine daily and cytarabine daily for 4 days every 4 weeks. Treatment was stopped after 18 months in children in continuous complete remission. A preliminary evaluation of this ongoing study included 36 patients with a mean age of 7.5 years (age range, 5 months to 16 years). The majority of patients had a French-American-British classification of M2 (n = 13) or M4 (n = 8). Complete remission was achieved by 91.7% of patients, while one died from sepsis in bone marrow hypoplasia and two were regarded as treatment failures. At a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 2 to 23 months) there were 12 adverse events: six bone marrow relapses, one bone marrow/skin relapse, and five deaths in complete remission (all deaths occurred during the consolidation phase). During the induction phase most of the patients experienced prolonged myelosuppression, and grade 3 to 4 toxicity (according to the Children's Cancer Group criteria) was frequently seen. Alopecia was universal. However, toxicity was manageable. We conclude that idarubicin in combination with cytarabine and etoposide is a highly effective regimen for induction in children with acute myeloblastic leukemia.","['Sackmann-Muriel, F', 'Fernandez-Barbieri, M A', 'Santarelli, M T', 'Matus-Ridley, M', 'Rosso, A', 'Negri-Aranguren, P', 'Cerutti, I', 'Gomel, M', 'Kvicala, R']","['Sackmann-Muriel F', 'Fernandez-Barbieri MA', 'Santarelli MT', 'Matus-Ridley M', 'Rosso A', 'Negri-Aranguren P', 'Cerutti I', 'Gomel M', 'Kvicala R']","['Pediatric Section, Argentine Group for Treatment of Acute Leukemia (Grupo Argentino de Tratamiento de la Leucemia Aguda), Buenos Aires.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Dec;20(6 Suppl 8):34-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As late intensification, patients received either high-dose cytarabine or, in 10 cases, autologous bone marrow transplantation. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 48 patients (84.2%), 41 after one induction course and seven after two courses. Median length of disease-free survival (DFS) was 26 months. Univariate analysis did not identify any of the investigated variables as having prognostic significance in predicting DFS. On the other hand, patients achieving CR after one induction course had a better DFS than those requiring two courses. Furthermore, the analysis of DFS slightly favors autologous bone marrow transplantation. In conclusion, the antileukemic activity of the present IDA protocol is testified by the high CR rate and by the possibility of minimizing the role of prognostic factors.

Their median age was 43 years (range, 15 to 60 years) with a distribution according to French-American-British morphologic subtypes as follows: six M1, 14 M2, four M3, 19 M4, nine M5, two M6, and two M7. The induction regimen (IDAC) consisted of idarubicin (12 mg/m2/d intravenously [IV] days 1 to 3) in combination with cytarabine (100 mg/m2/d continuous IV days 1 to 7). Patients achieving complete remission (CR) or partial remission received another cycle of IDAC followed by NOVE (mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2/d IV days 1 to 5 and etoposide 100 mg/m2/d IV days 1 to 5). Fifty-four patients are evaluable for response: after two cycles of IDAC, 42 patients had attained CR (78%), while 76% of these had already reached CR after the first cycle. Of the initial 11 nonresponders to IDAC, four obtained CR after NOVE. Thus, 46 of 54 patients (85%) achieved CR after sequential treatment with IDAC and NOVE. In the last 17 patients who entered CR or partial remission after the first cycle of IDAC, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF; 3 micrograms/kg/d) was administered for 6 days starting 3 days prior to the second cycle of IDAC. For consolidation with NOVE, rhGM-CSF was given according to the same dosage schedule. After 72 hours of rhGM-CSF treatment, the white blood cell count showed a median 3.9-fold increase, without appearance of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood. During sequential chemotherapy, no significant complications (in particular, no major cardiac toxicity) were observed. Postremission, patients were either given bone marrow transplants, received late consolidation with high-dose cytarabine/mitoxantrone, or were followed up without any further treatment. Of the 46 patients evaluable for disease-free survival, 21 patients (45%) remain in CR with a 34% probability of disease-free survival at 37 months. The response-adapted treatment with IDAC/NOVE is effective and very well tolerated. To define the therapeutic impact of rhGM-CSF, a randomized trial will be required.","['Haas, R', 'Ho, A D', 'Del Valle, F', 'Fischer, J T', 'Ehrhardt, R', 'Dohner, H', 'Witt, B', 'Huberts, H', 'Kaplan, E', 'Hunstein, W']","['Haas R', 'Ho AD', 'Del Valle F', 'Fischer JT', 'Ehrhardt R', 'Dohner H', 'Witt B', 'Huberts H', 'Kaplan E', 'Hunstein W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Dec;20(6 Suppl 8):20-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the therapy of periodontal diseases, the application of antiseptic solutions is indicated to inhibit or reduce plaque accumulation. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solution will reduce inflammation and the progression of periodontal disease. The application of antiseptics in the oral mucous membrane is also indicated to prevent wound infections following surgical intervention in patients with leukaemia, AIDS, immunosuppressant therapy and patients undergoing anti-neoplastic radiation or chemotherapy. Some trials on the antibacterial efficacy of PVP-I in vivo showed reduction factors of log 2-3. PVP-I may therefore be recommended as an oral antiseptic.

The reader is cautioned to refer to discussions of the individual infections for exceptions to these generalizations. For the most part, the mycoses are organisms of low pathogenicity emerging as opportunistic organisms thriving in a compromised host. The isolated fungal infections of the larynx reported are exceptions to the rule. Involvement of the larynx and other body sites outside the lung generally indicates a widely disseminated form of the disease. Fungal infections most commonly occur in the immunocompromised patient, including those afflicted with AIDS, cancer, leukemia, and other lymphoreticular neoplasms, patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy, patients with chronic systemic diseases, including diabetes mellitus and severe pulmonary disease, and patients who have undergone successful organ transplantation, which depends on immunologic suppression. Although specific fungi are characteristically found in designated endemic areas, the diseases may surface in remote areas in persons who have recently traveled through the endemic sites. The pathologic picture can be confusing, and pseudoepitheliomatous changes at times resemble malignancy. When atypical features occur in a patient with a suspicious history, special stains and cultures as well as skin tests and serologic studies may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. For the most part, amphotericin B has been the mainstay of therapy, although the introduction of the newer azole drugs (ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole) may present a breakthrough in the future therapy of these lesions. Ketoconazole has been proven efficacious in certain fungal infections. Itraconazole has recently been released for clinical use. Because of its lower incidence of toxic side effects, it may replace ketoconazole in the therapy of these diseases. Finally, fluconazole, taken orally, effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier; appropriate clinical trials may prove it to be an acceptable agent for those fungi commonly affecting the central nervous system.","['Vrabec, D P']",['Vrabec DP'],"['Department of Otolaryngology, Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Otolaryngol Clin North Am,Otolaryngologic clinics of North America,0144042,,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Laryngitis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*microbiology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Otolaryngol Clin North Am. 1993 Dec;26(6):1091-114.,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, studies of tissues in which only a fraction of cells contains a ras mutation risk false negative results. To minimize this risk, we have developed a highly sensitive, non-radioactive assay for ras mutations. Ras genes were PCR-amplified using mismatched primers, to introduce restriction sites into products derived from normal alleles. Repeated restriction digestion and PCR enriched for mutant alleles, visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Serially diluted DNA samples containing ras mutations demonstrated detection of 1 mutant/10(6) normal alleles (four orders of magnitude more sensitive than PCR/ASO hybridization). This assay was applied to DNA from four patients with relapsed acute leukemia in whom ras mutations present at diagnosis were not detectable by PCR/ASO hybridization at relapse. In one case, the mutation present at diagnosis was demonstrated at relapse. In the others, loss of the mutation was confirmed, at a greatly increased sensitivity. This method is widely applicable to detection of mutant ras alleles admixed with larger numbers of normal alleles.","['Jacobson, D R', 'Mills, N E']","['Jacobson DR', 'Mills NE']","['Department of Medicine, New York University Medical Center, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Exons', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Recurrence']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Feb;9(2):553-63.,,['T32HL07151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML was recently identified as a potential transcription factor. In non hematopoietic cells, the transfected PML-RAR alpha product binds all trans retinoic acid and exhibits altered transactivating properties when compared with RAR alpha. A major question raised by these observations is whether PML-RAR alpha contributes to the inhibition of myeloid differentiation. We find that in myeloid cell lines responsive to retinoic acid, PML-RAR alpha blocks retinoic acid mediated transactivation and totally abrogates the retinoic acid mediated granulocytic differentiation. These findings strongly suggest that PML-RAR alpha may, by blocking normal retinoic acid dependent myeloid differentiation, participate in the leukemogenesis of APL. The fact that high doses of all-trans retinoic acid relieve the inhibitory effect of PML-RAR alpha corroborates the therapeutic effect of all-trans retinoic acid in APL patients.","['Rousselot, P', 'Hardas, B', 'Patel, A', 'Guidez, F', 'Gaken, J', 'Castaigne, S', 'Dejean, A', 'de The, H', 'Degos, L', 'Farzaneh, F']","['Rousselot P', 'Hardas B', 'Patel A', 'Guidez F', 'Gaken J', 'Castaigne S', 'Dejean A', 'de The H', 'Degos L', 'Farzaneh F', 'et al.']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/ultrastructure', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Feb;9(2):545-51.,,,,,"['PML', 'RAR&agr;']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purine metabolism enzyme activities were compared and correlated with membrane immunophenotype. Analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood samples based on FAB criteria and immunologic phenotyping of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) provided useful--either confirmatory or contradictory-information on the distribution of M1-M6 patients demonstrating a predominance of M1+M2 and M4 groups (44% and 32.4%, respectively). In contrast, it was demonstrated that less frequent subtypes were M3 and M6 (5.9% and 2.9%, respectively). AML subtypes were correlated with expression of surface antigens detected by the following monoclonal antibodies: CD13, CD33, CDw65, CD11b, CD15, CD14, HLA-DR and CD34. On the basis of immunophenotyping we found the following characteristic markers: M1, M2-CD34, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CDw65; M3-CD13, CD33, HLA-DR (negative); M4, M5-CDw65, CD14, CD13, CD33 and HLA-DR. CD14 was confirmed to be a typical marker for discriminating myeloid from monocytoid FAB AML subtypes. Analysis of purine metabolism enzyme activities showed that there is a correlation between the values of adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase and various immunotypes of AML. High ADA/PNP ratio (> 1.0) was found in M1, M2, M3 subtypes. It was due to the increased level of ADA activity (> 100 pkat.10(-6) cells), though these activities overlapped to a certain extent. It was shown that PNP activity simultaneously decreased. With maturation of cells within AML lineage ADA activity decreased and PNP activity increased. This corresponded with ADA/PNP ratio that was < 1.0 in cells of more mature AML subtypes. We found that the enzymatic values were characteristic mainly in cells of M5 (monocytic) AML subtype and were characterized by decreased values of ADA activity with a simultaneous increase in PNP activity. It follows from our results that ADA/PNP ratio enables to discriminate between myeloid and monocytoid subtypes of AML.","['Mesarosova, A', 'Hrivnakova, A', 'Babusikova, O']","['Mesarosova A', 'Hrivnakova A', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Paper', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*biosynthesis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1993;40(6):341-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I encodes an essential 40-kDa protein termed Tax that not only transactivates the long terminal repeat of this retrovirus but also induces an array of cellular genes. Tax-mediated transformation of T cells likely involves the deregulated expression of various cellular genes that normally regulate lymphocyte growth produced by altered activity of various endogenous host transcription factors. In particular, Tax is capable of modulating the expression or activity of various host transcription factors, including members of the NF-kappa B/Rel and CREB/ATF families, as well as the cellular factors HEB-1 and p67SRF. An additional distinguishing characteristic of HTLV-I infection is the profound state of viral latency that is present in circulating primary leukemic T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that HTLV-I Tax can physically associate with p100, the product of the Rel-related NF-kappa B2 gene, both in transfected cells and in HTLV-I-infected leukemic T-cell lines. Furthermore, the physical interaction of Tax with p100 leads to the inhibition of Tax-induced activation of the HTLV-I and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeats, reflecting p100-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration of the normally nuclearly expressed Tax protein. In contrast, a mutant of Tax that selectively fails to activate nuclear NF-kappa B expression does not associate with p100. Together, these results suggest that the cytoplasmic interplay of Tax and p100 may play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of HTLV-1 latency observed in adult T-cell leukemia.","['Beraud, C', 'Sun, S C', 'Ganchi, P', 'Ballard, D W', 'Greene, W C']","['Beraud C', 'Sun SC', 'Ganchi P', 'Ballard DW', 'Greene WC']","['Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco 94141-9100.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Products, tax/analysis/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Mutagenesis', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.2.1374-1382.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Feb;14(2):1374-82. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.2.1374-1382.1994.,,,,PMC358492,['NF-KB2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TAL1 gene products contain the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, a protein dimerization and DNA-binding motif common to several known transcription factors. A binding-site selection procedure has now been used to evaluate the DNA recognition properties of TAL1. These studies demonstrate that TAL1 polypeptides do not have intrinsic DNA-binding activity, presumably because of their inability to form bHLH homodimers. However, TAL1 readily interacts with any of the known class A bHLH proteins (E12, E47, E2-2, and HEB) to form heterodimers that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The TAL1 heterodimers preferentially recognize a subset of E-box elements (CANNTG) that can be represented by the consensus sequence AACAGATGGT. This consensus is composed of half-sites for recognition by the participating class A bHLH polypeptide (AACAG) and the TAL1 polypeptide (ATGGT). TAL1 heterodimers with DNA-binding activity are readily detected in nuclear extracts of Jurkat, a leukemic cell line derived from a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hence, TAL1 is likely to bind and regulate the transcription of a unique subset of subordinate target genes, some of which may mediate the malignant function of TAL1 during T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Hsu, H L', 'Huang, L', 'Tsan, J T', 'Funk, W', 'Wright, W E', 'Hu, J S', 'Kingston, R E', 'Baer, R']","['Hsu HL', 'Huang L', 'Tsan JT', 'Funk W', 'Wright WE', 'Hu JS', 'Kingston RE', 'Baer R']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.2.1256-1265.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Feb;14(2):1256-65. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.2.1256-1265.1994.,,['CA46593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC358481,['TAL1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we have shown that factor binding to these two NF-kappa B elements mediates induction of transcription of the c-myc promoter upon interleukin-1 treatment of human dermal fibroblasts and human T-cell leukemia virus type I tax gene expression in T cells (D.

To begin to delineate the specific roles of the individual members of the NF-kappa B family, here we have tested their effects on activation of a c-myc promoter/exon 1-CAT construct in NIH 3T3 cells. Classical NF-kappa B (p65/p50) was a potent transcriptional activator of the c-myc promoter. Cotransfection with either p65 alone or p65 in combination with p50 mediated significant induction. In contrast, expression of either v-rel or chicken c-rel failed to transactivate, while murine c-rel induced c-myc promoter activity only slightly. Furthermore, induction by classical NF-kappa B was inhibited by coexpression of either v-rel or chicken c-rel. Thus, individual members of the rel family have differential effects of the c-myc promoter, which can modulate overall transcriptional activity and allow for precise regulation of this oncogene under diverse physiologic conditions.","['La Rosa, F A', 'Pierce, J W', 'Sonenshein, G E']","['La Rosa FA', 'Pierce JW', 'Sonenshein GE']","['Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118-2394.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-rel)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-rel', 'Oncogenes', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.2.1039-1044.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Feb;14(2):1039-44. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.2.1039-1044.1994.,,"['CA36355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM38925/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC358459,"['c-myc', 'c-rel', 'rel', 'v-rel']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we looked at the RB-structure and expression in cell lines and primary lymphoma samples from patients with high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Forty five primary high grade NHL, the B-lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 and the NHL cell line WSU-NHL were studied for RB structure by Southern blotting and for RB-expression by Northern blotting, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. In all experiments freshly cryopreserved material was used. Southern and Northern experiments were performed with the 0.9 kb and 3.8 kb RB-cDNA probe. For the detection of p105 two different anti-p105-monoclonal antibodies were used in immunocytochemistry and Western blotting experiments. No RB mRNA and no p105 could be found in IM-9 cells. Twenty six high grade NHL samples (58%) showed no p105 expression. In the subgroup of centroblastic lymphomas 16 out of 21 and in Burkitt's lymphomas five out of eight showed no p105-expression. P105 expression is absent in 58% of high grade NHL, particularly in centroblastic and Burkitt's lymphomas, suggesting that inactivation of RB may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of high grade NHL.","['Weide, R', 'Tiemann, M', 'Pfluger, K H', 'Koppler, H', 'Parvizl, B', 'Wacker, H H', 'Kreipe, H H', 'Havemann, K', 'Parwaresch, M R']","['Weide R', 'Tiemann M', 'Pfluger KH', 'Koppler H', 'Parvizl B', 'Wacker HH', 'Kreipe HH', 'Havemann K', 'Parwaresch MR']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, Philipps-University Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/physiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):97-101.,,,,,['RB'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, it is not clear that IL-2 is a consistent growth factor in vitro or in vivo for malignant B cells. What then is the potential significance of membrane IL-2R on the malignant B-cell membrane? Laboratory analysis indicates that the malignant cells are the source of elevated serum levels of soluble Tac protein (sIL-2r alpha) in both diseases. Indeed, these cells spontaneously secrete sIL-2R alpha into culture medium. We speculate that the presence of an expanding mass of malignant B cells possessing high and low affinity membrane IL-2R may contribute significantly to the associated immunodeficiency seen in B-CLL. In particular, it is the cell associated high affinity IL-2R that have the greatest potential for reducing the levels of free IL-2 available to normal immune cells.","['Burton, J', 'Kay, N E']","['Burton J', 'Kay NE']","['Metabolism Branch, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Down-Regulation/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/ultrastructure']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):92-6.,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-six patients were identified, four with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), 15 with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and seven with acute leukemia. The presence of del(20q) in four patients with MPD did not appear to adversely affect survival, with all patients alive 18 to 184 months post diagnosis.

Seven of these patients developed acute leukemia including three of four patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Of the seven patients with acute leukemia de novo and del(20q), six were treated with only two achieving complete remission. The median duration of survival for these seven patients was 5 months. These results, when compared with published survival data from the MIC Cooperative Group, indicated that del(20q) in MDS is associated with a high rate of transformation to acute leukemia and a poor prognosis. In de novo acute leukemia, del(20q) is associated with a poor response to treatment and reduced survival.","['Campbell, L J', 'Garson, O M']","['Campbell LJ', 'Garson OM']","[""Department of Cytogenetics, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):67-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the majority of cases (18/24) the structure of these genes was concordant, but in a significant minority of cases (6/24) the TCRG genes were in a different conformation at different clinical stages. In three of these patients (one null ALL, two T-ALL) the clonal TCRG rearrangements detected at presentation were absent at relapse possibly as a result of clonal regression. In one other patient (cALL), the TCRG locus at relapse was rearranged to V genes which are located downstream of the V genes found in the presentation rearrangement. This indicates that the relapse leukemic clone is probably the result of clonal evolution. In two patients (one cALL, one T-ALL) there were no clonally dominant rearrangements of the TCRG genes at presentation, but evidence for clonal rearrangements at relapse, possibly as a result of clonal progression. The structure of the IgH genes were determined in four of the six patients with clonal changes in the TCRG genes and were found to be concordant. The changes in TCRG gene structure were not restricted to ALL of any one particular age group, phenotype or duration of first remission. These data indicate that the assignment of clonal specific markers based upon the sequence of TCRG rearrangements at presentation may not always be useful in the detection of minimal residual disease in ALL.","['Taylor, J J', 'Rowe, D', 'Kylefjord, H', 'Chessells, J', 'Katz, F', 'Proctor, S J', 'Middleton, P G']","['Taylor JJ', 'Rowe D', 'Kylefjord H', 'Chessells J', 'Katz F', 'Proctor SJ', 'Middleton PG']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Laboratory, Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):60-6.,,,,,"['J<down>&ggr;</down>', 'TCRG', 'V<down>&ggr;</down>']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to examine the efficacy and the toxicity of mitoxantrone and etoposide in a patient population with bad prognosis because of refractoriness to two standardized induction courses. Twelve patients attained CR (32.4%). Responders were found only among the patients with documented susceptibility (i.e. partial remission) to the previous therapy. In responding patients the median remission duration and disease-free survival was 15+ months (range 3-52+). Toxicity was mainly hematologic and characterized by prolonged hypoplasia; one patient died in aplasia. Granulocytes and platelets recovered unexpectedly early in six of 22 non-responders. This study suggests that AML patients refractory to two standardized chemotherapy courses can still attain a durable CR after an additional course, here with mitoxantrone and etoposide, provided they show some responsiveness to the previously given cytostatic drugs.","['Daenen, S', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Sonneveld, P', 'van Putten, W L', 'Verhoef, G', 'Verdonck, L F', 'van Veldhoven, M', 'Huijgens, P C']","['Daenen S', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sonneveld P', 'van Putten WL', 'Verhoef G', 'Verdonck LF', 'van Veldhoven M', 'Huijgens PC']","['University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):6-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the other three samples, p53 gene mutations were not detected by the conventional PCR-SSCP method.

Two samples taken at the initial presentation of two patients, whose relapse samples were shown to contain p53 mutant clones, were also available for analysis. A small population of clonal cells, comprising less than 1% of the population, was shown to have p53 gene mutations in both of these initial samples.

We have combined, for the first time, an ALL blast colony assay (BCA) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to isolate residual leukemia cells in remission bone marrow aspirate specimens from eight patients with B-precursor ALL during early continuation therapy. We found colony-forming leukemia cells with in vitro self-renewal capability that survived chemotherapy for 15 months after diagnosis in all sequential specimens from these patients. To verify the leukemic nature of these cells their DNA was amplified by PCR and the product directly sequenced. In every case, the VHDJH sequence observed at diagnosis was found. None of the patients relapsed during this early phase of their treatment, consistent with the observation that patients with B-precursor ALL experience recurrence late in their course. Since it is possible that some of these persistent leukemia cells belong to the leukemia progenitor cell population that sustains the disease, the study of them could provide the means to determine the mechanisms of relapse.","['Estrov, Z', 'Ouspenskaia, M V', 'Felix, E A', 'McClain, K L', 'Lee, M S', 'Harris, D', 'Pinkel, D P', 'Zipf, T F']","['Estrov Z', 'Ouspenskaia MV', 'Felix EA', 'McClain KL', 'Lee MS', 'Harris D', 'Pinkel DP', 'Zipf TF']","['Division of Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):46-52.,,,,,"['IgH', 'V<down>H2</down>', 'V<down>H3</down>', 'V<down>H</down>DJ<down>H</down>']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biopsy specimens from 34 different endoscopies of 20 patients with a previous history, or tentative diagnosis of gastric lymphoma, and 12 control samples were analyzed for the presence of clonal Ig gene rearrangements. A clonal B-cell population was detected by Southern blot analysis in all patients with a definitive histologic diagnosis of lymphoma. In addition, in two patients the detection of clonal rearrangements in biopsy specimens preceded by several months the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma, and clonality was confirmed in three further patients where histology remained inconclusive. In some cases of low-grade MALT-lymphoma, discrete spreading of malignant cells within chronically inflamed mucosa was suggested by the presence of identical clonal rearrangements in all simultaneously obtained biopsies, with or without histologically detectable involvement by lymphoma.

This type of genomic rearrangement occurs very rarely in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML); it has been reported in only four cases. We describe here a fifth case of P190 CML in which the cytomorphological characteristics were intermediate between CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). This case, and the four reported previously, had a consistent and significant monocytosis with a low neutrophil/monocyte ratio in the peripheral blood, resembling CMML. On the other hand, they also had a high percentage of circulating immature granulocytes, basophilia and low neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score, which are more commonly found in classical CML. Thus, P190 CML may be a specific form of CML, in which the myeloproliferative process includes the monocytic, as well as the granulocytic lineage. Since the molecular defect in CML is thought to involve a pluripotent stem cell, the different effects of P210BCR-ABL and P190BCR-ABL in CML must reflect the somewhat wider spectrum of activity of the P190BCR-ABL. Other patients with atypical CML or CMML who lack a Ph chromosome may also have an m-bcr breakpoint which would not be detected on standard Southern blots, but which would be detectable by polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse transcribed RNA.","['Melo, J V', 'Myint, H', 'Galton, D A', 'Goldman, J M']","['Melo JV', 'Myint H', 'Galton DA', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):208-11.,,,,,['BCR-ABL'],['Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1795-6.

The blood smear showed 15% typical Sezary cells but also rare atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclei, evocative of characteristic adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) flower cells. However, the patient did not present any clinical or biological manifestations of ATL, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) serology was consistently negative. After being cultured for 4 months, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) produced typical type C retrovirus-like particles with budding forms strongly resembling HTLV-1 virions. The producer cells did not express HTLV-1-specific antigens detectable by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Southern blotting of uncultured PBMC DNA, submitted to digestion with the restriction enzymes PstI and SacI, and hybridized with a full genomic HTLV-1 probe, showed the presence of specific homologous sequences, absent in all of the healthy donor control PBMC DNAs. These HTLV-1-like sequences presented a restriction enzyme pattern distinct from that of the HTLV-1 prototype genome and of other HTLV-1 proviruses studied up to now. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with highly conserved HTLV-1 derived pol and env primers was consistently negative with the patient's DNA. All these results taken together suggest that our patient carries a retroviral agent partially homologous to, but probably different from HTLV-1. The possibility is discussed that this type of retroviral agent might be associated with a subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) represented by a typical Sezary syndrome with a very low percentage of ATL-like flower cells in the blood smear.","['Bazarbachi, A', 'Saal, F', 'Laroche, L', 'Lasneret, J', 'Gessain, A', 'Daniel, M T', 'Peries, J']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Saal F', 'Laroche L', 'Lasneret J', 'Gessain A', 'Daniel MT', 'Peries J']","['UPR A0043 CNRS Retrovirus et Retrotransposons des Vertebres, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sezary Syndrome/*blood/genetics/*microbiology', 'Virion/genetics']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):201-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GM-CSF caused proliferation of marrow myeloblasts in eight of 11 patients, while in three patients there was no change in proliferative indices. The expression of nucleoside transporters increased up to 4-fold in the myeloblasts from the patients showing a proliferative response to GM-CSF but there was no increase in transporters on the myeloblasts from the three non-responding patients. A close correlation was found between the fold increase in nucleoside transporter expression and the fold increase in labelling index of marrow myeloblasts (r = 0.86, n = 9, p < 0.01). In one patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, GM-CSF caused parallel increases in labelling index, Ki-67 positivity and numbers of nucleoside transporters on peripheral blood blast cells. Thus induction of proliferation by cytokine increases the expression of nucleoside transporters on leukaemic myeloblasts studied in serial samples from the same source (bone marrow or blood).

These cell lines are defective in intracellular peptide loading of class I molecules, resulting in markedly reduced cell surface class I expression: class I expression can be rescued by provision of peptides binding to the alleles expressed by the mutant cell. Eighteen peptides spanning the junctional sequences of the b2a2 and b3a2 proteins were tested for their ability to rescue expression of the class I alleles borne by these cells using flow cytometry. Allele-specific control peptides known to bind HLA-A2, HLA-B35, H-2Kb and H-2Db increased expression of these alleles 2- to 3-fold: 0/18 BCR/ABL peptides enhanced HLA-A2, HLA-B35 or H-2Kb expression, but three b2a2 peptides consistently increased H-2Db expression. These results suggest that BCR/ABL junctional peptides are unlikely to be presented to T-cells in association with HLA-A2, HLA-B35 or H-2Kb.

In the present study, we have used the well-characterized multidrug resistant human leukemic cell line K562/ADM to compare the effect in vitro of quinine and cinchonine on doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and vincristine uptake and cytotoxicity. In serum-free medium, quinine induced a dose-dependent increase of doxorubicin uptake reaching about 200% at 40 microM, while it had a slight and no effect on mitoxantrone and vincristine uptake respectively. In the same conditions, cinchonine induced a rapid and significant increase in the accumulation of the three drugs, reaching a plateau phase between 5 and 10 microM. Quinine and cinchonine induced both potentiation of doxorubicin, vincristine and mitoxantrone cytotoxicity in K562/ADM cells. However, quinine reached a plateau phase at 10 microM, while cinchonine had a maximal effect at 5 microM and was significantly more potent at low concentrations. When diluted in plasma, cinchonine was less bound to proteins than quinine. The free fraction of alkaloids was 37-55% for cinchonine and 20-30% for quinine. Cinchonine-induced enhancement of vincristine cellular accumulation was little modified by plasma proteins.

Complete remission was achieved in 15 cases (14%), 11 had a partial response (10%), and 16 a minor response (15%). Stable disease was reached in 35 cases (32%). There were 16 cases of toxic death (15%), progression occurred in 15 patients (14%). No differences existed between the two treatment arms with respect to response and duration of response. Prognostic factors for poor response included the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities and a history of previous blood transfusions. Major adverse events during treatment were hemorrhage (55%), infections (54%), and fever associated with GM-CSF administration (40%). The overall response rate ws 39%, median duration was 12.5 months from start of treatment which allowed responding patients to lead good quality life without further therapy. The question whether the combination is indeed superior to LD-Ara C alone is not settled but will be evaluated in an ongoing clinical trial.","['Gerhartz, H H', 'Marcus, R', 'Delmer, A', 'Zwierzina, H', 'Suciu, S', 'Dardenne, M', 'Solbu, G', 'de Witte, T', 'Jacobs, A', 'Visani, G']","['Gerhartz HH', 'Marcus R', 'Delmer A', 'Zwierzina H', 'Suciu S', 'Dardenne M', 'Solbu G', 'de Witte T', 'Jacobs A', 'Visani G', 'et al.']","['Medical Dept.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the NB4 cell line, the first ever isolated human APL line, with the typical t(15;17) chromosomal balance translocation, possess CP as well as the cells freshly isolated from APL patients. Secondly, since the NB4 line is maturation inducible by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), we wanted to verify whether CP, if present, was affected by ATRA treatment. The NB4 cells were able to shorten the recalcification assay of normal human plasma (total PCA). To distinguish CP in the assay for clotting activity, two criteria were used, the independence from factor VII to trigger blood coagulation and the sensitivity to cysteine proteinase inhibitors. Forty-seven per cent of total PCA of cell extracts was found to be FVII-independent PCA. A similar proportion of FVII-independent activity (42%) was detected in the cell serum-free supernatants. The activity was significantly decreased by cysteine proteinase inhibitors, including HgCl2, lodoacetic acid and Z-Ala-AlaCHN2. Additionally CP was directly identified and quantified by an immunocapture enzyme assay. The mean +/- SD concentration of CP detected by this assay in the NB4 cells, before any treatment, was 1.89 +/- 0.5 microgram/mg protein. Treatment of NB4 cells with 10(-6) M ATRA for 5 days significantly decreased the expression of CP, which became virtually undetectable by the clotting assay, and was 64% less than the untreated control by the immunocapture enzyme assay. This study provides the first evidence that the human promyelocytic cell line NB4 possess CP. The expression of this procoagulant is modulated by ATRA.","['Falanga, A', 'Consonni, R', 'Marchetti, M', 'Mielicki, W P', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Lanotte, M', 'Gordon, S G', 'Barbui, T']","['Falanga A', 'Consonni R', 'Marchetti M', 'Mielicki WP', 'Rambaldi A', 'Lanotte M', 'Gordon SG', 'Barbui T']","['Hematology Division, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.26 (cancer procoagulant)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):156-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum EPO concentration is variable among patients for a given haemoglobin concentration. We studied 19 non-transfusion-dependent patients with MDS, and 13 healthy elderly control subjects in an attempt to define the factors governing variability in serum EPO and to further characterise the anaemia of MDS. Serum EPO concentration was appropriate for the degree of anaemia in 15/19 MDS patients, and was positively related to mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), and percentage highly fluorescent reticulocytes (% HFR), but not to absolute or percentage reticulocyte count. Although the observed/predicted ratio for serum transferrin receptor (TfR) concentration was low in 12 of 19 MDS subjects, no relationship to haemoglobin concentration, reticulocytes or serum EPO was seen. Serum TfR was positively correlated with WBC and platelet counts. Serum TfR was higher in patients with sideroblastic anaemia than refractory anaemia. Standardized in vivo p50 was positively correlated to red cell 2,3 diphosphoglycerate concentration, although this was not the only factor influencing the oxygen dissociation curve. We conclude that effective erythroid output responsive to endogenous EPO drive in MDS is positively related to MCV, MCH and % HFR. Serum TfR may not represent effective output as precisely as % HFR, but may be proportional to total marrow erythropoietic activity.","['Bowen, D T', 'Culligan, D', 'Beguin, Y', 'Kendall, R', 'Willis, N']","['Bowen DT', 'Culligan D', 'Beguin Y', 'Kendall R', 'Willis N']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biological Transport', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood', 'Oxygen/blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/blood/therapeutic use', 'Reticulocyte Count', 'Reticulocytes/cytology/*physiology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):151-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the inhibition of the bcr-abl oncogene using fluorescein-labeled phosphorothioate oligonucleotides in the Philadelphia chromosome-positive cell line BV173. Oligonucleotide stability, uptake, bcr-abl mRNA degradation, inhibition of cell proliferation, and cell death were studied. The oligonucleotide uptake was directly dependent on the extracellular concentration and was constant over the first 18 h of incubation. After that the uptake rate decreased. We detected a decrease in bcr-abl mRNA after 3 days of treatment with antisense oligonucleotides, but much less in controls. The controls used in the experiments were the sense oligonucleotide, equimolar amounts of sense and antisense, and an untreated control. Antisense oligonucleotides completely inhibited cell growth of BV173 cells and did not inhibit growth of HL-60 cells, whereas control oligonucleotides had no such effect on either cell line. An oligonucleotide specific for the other CML breakpoint was also effective in reducing cell growth of BV173. By the use of a DNA double staining technique to discriminate between necrotic and apoptotic cells, we detected a large number of apoptotic cells in antisense treated BV173 cultures after 5 days of treatment as compared to controls.

Two observations, however, warrant caution in their therapeutic use: first, these agents can inhibit differentiation and second, perturbations in function render the enzyme error-prone. Illegitimate recombination events occurring at sites where topo II acts in differentiation could be particularly important in the development of secondary malignancies (relatively frequent after therapy with agents that target topo II). Topo II inhibitors are heterogeneous in mechanisms of action; in site-specificity of cleavable complex 'entrapment' (where present) and in the relative potency against the two topo II isoforms, all potentially influencing the site of maximum DNA damage. The object of this study was to examine the effect of topo II inhibitors on human haemopoietic precursor cells, to determine which have most impact on differentiation. We selected two which act via cleavable complex entrapment, but with different site preferences (m-AMSA and VP-16), and two acting via other mechanisms (merbarone and fostriecin). VP-16 and m-AMSA showed similar patterns with low dose stimulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony formation and high dose inhibition of all colony types. The stimulation was accompanied by an increase in colony size and blast content, consistent with a low dose inhibition of differentiation. Forstriecin, in contrast, stimulated predominantly mixed and erythroid colonies. Merbarone failed to increase colony formation. Neither produced substantial inhibition of colony formation. The effects on granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were confirmed using 7-day suspension cultures, using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and 3-4,5,dimethylthiazol 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays for differentiated cells and total cell mass, respectively. These results demonstrate that the effects of topo II inhibitors on haemopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation are agent-specific and can involve lineage-restricted partial inhibition of differentiation.","['Francis, G E', 'Tejedor, M C', 'Berney, J J', 'Chresta, C M', 'Delgado, C', 'Patel, P']","['Francis GE', 'Tejedor MC', 'Berney JJ', 'Chresta CM', 'Delgado C', 'Patel P']","['Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'YWB9IF596V (merbarone)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Polyenes', 'Pyrones', 'Thiobarbiturates/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):121-8.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCL protein was detected in erythroid, megakaryocyte, mast and early myeloid cell lines, as well as in several lymphoid leukemia cell lines which are known to harbor SCL gene rearrangements. In most cell lines, proteins of molecular weight 49 and 44 kDa were found, however two myeloid cell lines expressed only lower molecular weight species of 24 and 22 kDa. This size discrepancy appeared to be due to cell-specific translational regulation, since overexpression of a retrovirally transfected SCL gene yielded the higher molecular weight forms in most cell lines (GP+E-86, AT2.5, M1) but only the 22 kDa form in the myeloid cell line, WEHI-3B/D+.

Whether ras mutations occur as late or relatively early events in the multistep process of myeloid transformation, remains an open question. We previously described illegitimate T-cell receptor (TCR)-delta gene rearrangements in a subset of AML. These recombinations were detected in 9 out of 100 de novo AML cases. Southern blot analysis suggested the presence of these recombinations in the vast majority of AML cells and thus could be used as clonal markers. In order to more accurately define the role of ras proto-oncogene mutations in the multistep process of malignant transformation in myeloid leukemias, we performed single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assays, slot blot and direct sequencing analysis on these nine cases with illegitimate TCR delta gene rearrangements. Ras proto-oncogene mutations were found in three of nine cases. Interestingly, SSCP, slot blot and sequencing suggested the presence of the respective mutations in most of the leukemic cells. Thus, ras mutations presumably occurred early in the process of transformation in these three cases.","['Schmidt, C A', 'Przybylski, G', 'Vogel, D', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Oettle, H', 'Neubauer, A', 'Siegert, W']","['Schmidt CA', 'Przybylski G', 'Vogel D', 'Ludwig WD', 'Oettle H', 'Neubauer A', 'Siegert W']","['Abt.

Recently, overexpression of the Met/HGF receptor gene has been detected in fresh samples of carcinomas and in epithelial tumor cell lines but not in cell lines derived from human leukemia and lymphoma. Our analysis of 50 primary samples of human leukemia and lymphoma and 23 hematopoietic cell lines revealed expression of mRNA and protein of the met/HGF receptor in 6 out of the 73 hematopoietic tumor samples analyzed. Four of the six samples positive for expression of the Met/HGF receptor gene were derived from patients with Hodgkin's disease. In addition, in one Burkitt's lymphoma cell line and in one acute myeloid leukemia (AML), expression of the Met/HGF receptor gene was detected. In normal unstimulated lymphocytes, granulocytes or monocytes we did not find expression of the Met/HGF receptor gene. Upon stimulation with the phorbol ester TPA we detected a weak expression of Met/HGF receptor specific transcripts of 9.0 kb in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a healthy donor. Cytogenetic analyses of three of the four cell lines which express the Met/HGF receptor gene revealed structural or numerical abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 7, where the Met/HGFR gene is located, in each of the three cell lines analyzed. In one of these cell lines (L540) the Met/HGFR gene is translocated to a marker chromosome. Southern blot and pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments did not show any rearrangement in a region of 600 kb around the Met/HGF receptor gene excluding an activation of Met/HGFR by a TPR/Met oncogenic rearrangement as described for MNNG-HOS cells and for some gastric tumors. Our data indicate that the Met/HGFR gene is deregulated in a few cases of human leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease possibly by chromosomal rearrangements resulting in an overexpression of the normal Met/HGF receptor mRNA and protein without formation of a hybrid gene.","['Jucker, M', 'Gunther, A', 'Gradl, G', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Krueger, G', 'Diehl, V', 'Tesch, H']","['Jucker M', 'Gunther A', 'Gradl G', 'Fonatsch C', 'Krueger G', 'Diehl V', 'Tesch H']","['Medizinische Klinik I, Universitat Koln, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90003-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90003-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jan;18(1):7-16. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90003-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the amount of probe per cell reduces at each cell division, the fluorescence can be used to measure cell proliferation. Bone marrow derived ALL cells from seven newly diagnosed cases were stained with PKH 26 GL, and cultured for 14 days in control cultures without stimulus, or in cultures with preformed human bone marrow stromal cell layers. Viable leukaemic cells from these cultures were identified on the basis of forward light scatter, 90 degrees light scatter, propidium iodide exclusion, PKH 26 GL staining and CD10 expression by flow cytometry at the beginning of the culture period and on days 2, 6, 10 and 14.

Thus, the heterogeneity of AML cells determined by the combination of cell-surface antigen expressions and cell-size may be associated with clinically important biological behaviors.","['Kawada, H', 'Ichikawa, Y', 'Watanabe, S', 'Nagao, T', 'Arimori, S']","['Kawada H', 'Ichikawa Y', 'Watanabe S', 'Nagao T', 'Arimori S']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Cell Size', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90006-X [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90006-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jan;18(1):29-35. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90006-x.,,,,,,['Leuk Res. 1995 Aug;19(8):581-2.

The EMV clone AKR623 has been used to infect SC.Kb fibroblast cells, resulting in SC.Kb/623 targets that are lysed by bulk anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL with a profile that is similar to that for the EMV+ AKR.H-2b SL1 tumor target. Anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL are restricted by the class I Kb antigen and do not cross-react with Friend-Moloney-Rauscher virus-positive targets. The AKR623 genome was searched by computer for coding sequences that fit the motif XXXX(FY)XX(VIML) for peptides that bind Kb. Of 30 octameric peptides identified, 12 that were unique to AKR623 and different from published Friend-Moloney-Rauscher sequences were synthesized and bound to EMV-negative SC.Kb cells, which were then assayed as targets against anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL. One peptide, peptide 12 (KSPWFTTL) from the p15E transmembrane protein, sensitized SC.Kb target cells to lysis by anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL with a profile similar to those seen for AKR.H-2b SL1 tumor targets and SC.Kb/623 fibroblast targets. Low concentrations of peptide were sufficient, the half-maximal lysis occurring at 10 to 100 pg/ml. SC.Kb/peptide 12 targets were recognized by the H-2b-restricted bulk CTL in a conventional class I Kb-restricted fashion. Unlabeled SC.Kb/peptide 12-pulsed targets were effective in competing with radiolabeled SC.Kb/623 targets for lysis by anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL. This finding is consistent with the notion that peptide 12 represents the dominant endogenously processed epitope recognized by these antiviral CTL. In addition, peptide 12 is immunogenic in that it could stimulate the in vitro generation of an anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL response from tumor-primed C57BL/6 responder spleen cells. Finally, the physiological relevance of peptide 12 was suggested by its ability to fully restore the recognition and lysis of AKR.H-2b SL1 clone 18-5 tumor cells, a naturally occurring variant tumor clone that is insusceptible to lysis by anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL. These data indicate that a virus-encoded antigen, represented by peptide 12, and not a nonviral tumor antigen, is the immunodominant epitope responsible for the recognition of EMV+ tumor cells by C57BL/6-derived anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL.","['White, H D', 'Roeder, D A', 'Green, W R']","['White HD', 'Roeder DA', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756-0001.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Binding, Competitive', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.2.897-904.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Feb;68(2):897-904. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.2.897-904.1994.,,"['CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC236526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Virol 1994 May;68(5):3452'],,,,

H9 and HeLaCD4-LTR/beta-gal cells were infected either with HIV-1IIIB or a replication-defective virus, HIV-gpt(HXB-2). Both inhibitors were capable of blocking early steps of HIV-1 replication if added to cells prior to infection. Partial inhibition was also obtained by addition of inhibitor at the time of or as late as 15 min after infection. The inhibitors were ineffective if added 30 min postinfection. The inhibitory effects were studied by cDNA analysis with PCR followed by Southern blot hybridization and by infectivity assays allowing quantitation of HIV-1 in a single cycle of replication. When UK-88,947-treated H9 cells were coinfected with HIV-1 and human T-cell leukemia virus type I only the replication of HIV-1 was inhibited, demonstrating viral specificity. Pretreating the infectious virus stocks with the inhibitors also prevented replication, indicating that the inhibitors block the action of the viral protease and not a cellular protease. A panel of primer sets was used to analyze cDNA from cell lysates by PCR amplification at 4 and 18 h postinfection. Four hours after infection, viral specific cDNA was detected with all of the four primer pairs used: R/U5, nef/U3, 5' gag, and long terminal repeat (LTR)/gag. However, after 18 h, only the R/U5 and nef/U3 primer pairs and not the 5' gag or LTR/gag primer pair were able to allow amplification of cDNA. The results suggest a crucial role of HIV-1 protease in the early phase of viral replication. Although it is not clear what early steps are affected by the protease, it is likely that the target is the NC protein, as referred from our previous reports of the in situ cleavage of the nucleocapsid (NC) protein by the viral protease inside lentiviral capsids. The results suggest that it is not the inhibition of initiation and progression of reverse transcription but the stability of full-size unintegrated cDNA which is affected in the presence of protease inhibitors. Alternatively, the cleavage of the NC protein may be required for the proper formation of preintegration complex and/or for its transport to the nucleus.","['Nagy, K', 'Young, M', 'Baboonian, C', 'Merson, J', 'Whittle, P', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Nagy K', 'Young M', 'Baboonian C', 'Merson J', 'Whittle P', 'Oroszlan S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Quinolines)', '137015-76-0 (UK 88947)', 'L3JE09KZ2F (Saquinavir)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genome, Viral', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'Saquinavir', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.2.757-765.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Feb;68(2):757-65. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.2.757-765.1994.,,,,PMC236512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived vectors designed for gene transfer, the Psi + sequence of 600 nucleotides directs the packaging of recombinant RNAs into MLV virions produced by helper cells. By using in vitro RNA dimerization as a screening system, a sequence of rat VL30 RNA located next to the 5' end of the Harvey mouse sarcoma virus genome and as small as 67 nucleotides was found to form stable dimeric RNA. In addition, a purine-rich sequence located at the 5' end of this VL30 RNA seems to be critical for RNA dimerization. When this VL30 element was extended by 107 nucleotides at its 3' end and inserted into an MLV-derived vector lacking MLV Psi +, it directed the efficient encapsidation of recombinant RNAs into MLV virions. Because this VL30 packaging signal is smaller and more efficient in packaging recombinant RNAs than the MLV Psi + and does not contain gag or glyco-gag coding sequences, its use in MLV-derived vectors should render even more unlikely recombinations which could generate replication-competent viruses.

Substitution of isoleucine for valine at position 214 in the third extracellular region (the putative E-MuLV binding site) of the MDTF receptor molecule allows this molecule to function as a Mo-MuLV receptor (M.V. Eiden, K. Farrell, J. Warsowe, L. A. Mahan, and C. A. Wilson, J. Virol. 67:4056-4061, 1993). We have now determined that treating MDTF cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, also renders them susceptible to Mo-MuLV infection. Two potential N-linked glycosylation sites are present in the third extracellular regions of both the NIH 3T3 and MDTF ecotropic receptors. The glycosylation site at position 229 of the MDTF receptor cDNA was eliminated by substituting a threonine codon for the asparagine codon. Mo-MuLV-resistant human HOS cells, expressing this form of the receptor, are susceptible to Mo-MuLV infection. Thus, our studies suggest that without a glycan moiety at position 229, the valine residue at 214 is no longer restrictive for Mo-MuLV infection. BHK-21 and CHO K1 hamster cells also express glycosylation-inactivated forms of the ecotropic receptor. Sequence analysis of these receptors together with our analysis of MDTF receptor function suggests that a single asparagine-linked glycosylation site is responsible for glycosylation inactivation of these receptors.","['Eiden, M V', 'Farrell, K', 'Wilson, C A']","['Eiden MV', 'Farrell K', 'Wilson CA']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/classification/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/classification/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', '*Receptors, Virus', '*Retroviridae Infections', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Virulence']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.2.626-631.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Feb;68(2):626-31. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.2.626-631.1994.,,,,PMC236495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the combined use of antibodies against the envelope glycoprotein gp70 of RadLV, the transformation-associated cell surface marker 1C11, and the CD3-T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, we found that in the RadLV-infected thymus, the earliest expression of viral gp70 is in 1C11hi cells; a small but significant percentage of these cells also express CD3. A first wave of viral replication, manifested by the expression of high levels of gp70 in thymocytes (over 70% positive), reaches a peak at 2 weeks; during this period, no significant changes are observed in the expression of 1C11 or CD3. The population of gp70+ cells is drastically reduced at 3 to 4 weeks after infection. However, a second cohort of gp70+ cells appears after 4 weeks, and these cells express high levels of 1C11 and TCR determinants as well. RadLV-induced lymphomas differ from normal thymocytes in their CD4 CD8 phenotype, with domination by one or more subsets. Characterization of TCR gene rearrangements in RadLV-induced lymphomas shows that most of these tumors are clonal or oligoclonal with respect to the J beta 2 TCR gene, while the J beta 1 TCR gene is rearranged in a minority (4 of 11) of lymphomas. TCR V beta repertoire analysis of 12 tumors reveals that 6 (50%) express exclusively the V beta 6 gene product, 2 (17%) are V beta 5+, and 1 (8%) each are V beta 8+ and V beta 9+. In normal C57BL/Ka mice, V beta 6 is expressed on 12%, V beta 5 is expressed on 9%, V beta 8 is expressed on 22%, and V beta 9 is expressed on 4% of TCRhi thymocytes.

These agents include pyrrolo[1,2-a]benzimidazole (PBI), benzimidazole (BI), and tetrahydropyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole (TPBI) analogues. As a result of these studies, it is concluded that the pyrrolo ring is not necessary for cytotoxicity (PBI is only slightly more cytotoxic than BI) but that homologation of the pyrrolo ring by one carbon results in a system, TPBI, prone to decomposition. Another conclusion is that the 6-aziridinyl derivative of the PBI system is more potent than the 7-aziridinyl derivative. Comparative studies with known antitumor agents revealed that the benzimidazole-based DNA-cleaving agents possess a unique spectrum of activity. Noteworthy observations are the high level of cytotoxicity against melanoma cell lines and the complete absence of activity against leukemia cell lines. The reductive activation and DNA-cleavage properties of the most active analogue (BI-A) are also presented.

In addition, reduced BI-A reacts with DNA to form a stable adduct, which cleaves at G+A bases upon heating in basic gel-loading solution.","['Skibo, E B', 'Islam, I', 'Heileman, M J', 'Schulz, W G']","['Skibo EB', 'Islam I', 'Heileman MJ', 'Schulz WG']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Arizona State University, Tempe 85287-1604.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzimidazoles/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pyridines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/07 00:00,1994/01/07 00:01,['1994/01/07 00:00'],"['1994/01/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/07 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00027a010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1994 Jan 7;37(1):78-92. doi: 10.1021/jm00027a010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to mature T cells or the Jurkat cell line, PER-117 cells require interleukin-1 (IL-1) for optimal IL-2 secretion, in addition to calcium ionophore and phorbol 12-myristate 12-acetate (PMA). These requirements mirror the conditions reported to be optimal for normal immature T cell receptor (TCR) negative thymocytes. IL-1 did not substitute for either of the other signals required for IL-2 production, i.e., calcium ionophore or PMA, suggesting that IL-1 activates pathways different from those elicited by the two other stimuli. For optimal effect, IL-1 needed to be provided at the same time as the two other signals. Significantly, a signal provided by a low concentration of PMA (not leading to IL-2 induction by itself in the presence of calcium ionophore) was necessary. The studies reported here provide the first evidence that three signals are required for optimal IL-2 production in a human immature T cell line. PER-117 cells produce substantial levels of IL-2 and thus provide a model to study stage-specific signal transduction and transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene in IL-1 responsive immature thymocytes.","['Kees, U R', 'Peroni, S E', 'Ranford, P R', 'Ford, J']","['Kees UR', 'Peroni SE', 'Ranford PR', 'Ford J']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Western Australian Research Institute for Child Health, Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1994/01/12 00:00,1994/01/12 00:01,['1994/01/12 00:00'],"['1994/01/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/12 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(94)90202-X [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(94)90202-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1994 Jan 12;168(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(94)90202-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a total of 29 experiments with the cells of 17 different donors an IgE secretion was observed only twice. Even in those two cases the IgE was found to be not monoclonal. The additional stimulation of CLL cells by polyclonal B cell activators induced IgM but not IgE production. When CLL cells were cocultured with monocyte-enriched cell preparations (M phi) in the presence of IL-4 and HC, a substantial IgE secretion could be obtained, which again consisted of both IgE kappa and IgE lambda. Since the irradiation of the M phi but not of the CLL cells abolished the formation of IgE, it is likely that the IgE production resided in the contaminating B cell population of the M phi. When the M phi were replaced by T cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (non-T cells), irradiated as well as formaldehyde fixed CLL cells were able to stimulate non-T cells to secrete IgE in the presence of IL-4 or to potentiate IL-4- and HC-induced IgE formation. Furthermore, the coculture of irradiated pure CLL cells and purified B cells induced not only IgE but also IgG and IgM production and B cell proliferation in the presence of lymphokines.

Since PKC can act immediately upstream to the cytoplasmic Raf-1 serine/threonine protein kinase, we studied activation of Raf-1 during induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype. The results demonstrate that Raf-1 is activated during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. In contrast, there was little effect of TPA on this kinase in an HL-60 variant, designated HL-525, which is resistant to TPA-induced differentiation. Treatment of both HL-60 and HL-525 cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, was associated with Raf-1 activation and induction of the monocytic phenotype. Since Raf-1 can activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, we also studied the relationship between MAP kinase activation and monocytic differentiation. Treatment of HL-60, but not HL-525, cells with TPA was associated with increased MAP kinase activity as determined by phosphorylation of myelin basic protein and the c-Jun Y peptide. Okadaic acid-induced differentiation of both HL-60 and HL-525 cells was similarly accompanied by increases in MAP kinase activity. These findings indicated that activation of Raf-1/MAP kinase signaling is associated with induction of a differentiated monocytic phenotype and that okadaic acid bypasses a defect in this cascade in TPA-treated HL-525 cells. While recent studies have shown that HL-525 cells are deficient in PKC beta, the present results demonstrate that PKC beta expression is up-regulated in the HL-525 variant by treatment with retinoic acid. The results also demonstrate that retinoic acid-treated HL-525 cells respond to TPA with activation of Raf-1 and MAP kinase, as well as induction of monocytic differentiation. Taken together, the results indicate that activation of Raf-1/MAP kinase signaling is associated with monocytic differentiation and that stimulation of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation by TPA or okadaic acid is sufficient for reversal of the leukemic HL-60 phenotype.","['Kharbanda, S', 'Saleem, A', 'Emoto, Y', 'Stone, R', 'Rapp, U', 'Kufe, D']","['Kharbanda S', 'Saleem A', 'Emoto Y', 'Stone R', 'Rapp U', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/14 00:00,1994/01/14 00:01,['1994/01/14 00:00'],"['1994/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42193-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jan 14;269(2):872-8.,,['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structural analysis of the isolated clones revealed that the human HDC gene is composed of 12 exons spanning approximately 24 kb. Genomic DNA blot analysis suggested that HDC is encoded by a single copy gene. The structural analysis also demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the HDC mRNA is caused by an insertion of the seventh intron sequence and alternative use of the splicing acceptor site at the 12th exon. The transcription start site of the HDC gene and the nucleotide sequences of the promoter and first exon regions were determined. We found a TATA-like sequence, a GC box, four CACC boxes, four GATA consensus sequences, and six leader-binding protein-1 binding motifs in the promoter region of the HDC gene.","['Yatsunami, K', 'Ohtsu, H', 'Tsuchikawa, M', 'Higuchi, T', 'Ishibashi, K', 'Shida, A', 'Shima, Y', 'Nakagawa, S', 'Yamauchi, K', 'Yamamoto, M']","['Yatsunami K', 'Ohtsu H', 'Tsuchikawa M', 'Higuchi T', 'Ishibashi K', 'Shida A', 'Shima Y', 'Nakagawa S', 'Yamauchi K', 'Yamamoto M', 'et al.']","['Japan Tobacco Inc., Pharmaceutical Basic Research Laboratories, Yokohama.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 4.1.1.22 (Histidine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Histidine Decarboxylase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/14 00:00,1994/01/14 00:01,['1994/01/14 00:00'],"['1994/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42292-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jan 14;269(2):1554-9.,,,,,['HDC'],,,['GENBANK/D16583'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Postmortem examination revealed petechial hemorrhages throughout the internal organs. Bone marrow was pale tan, with no red marrow seen. Atypical leukocytes were diffusely distributed throughout the body, with penetration of the spinal cord and spinal roots, particularly in the lumbar region. Atypical leukocytes stained positively for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and chloracetate esterase, and stained with Sudan black B. Atypical leukocytes expressed class-1 and class-2 major histocompatability antigens, but did not express specific T-, B-, or null-cell surface antigens. The final diagnosis was myelomonocytic leukemia.

The protein is composed of two domains with the amino-terminal domain containing a highly conserved repetitive sequence and the carboxyl-terminal domain containing consensus sequences shared by other beta-galactoside-binding soluble lectins. The protein has wide tissue distribution, is found on cell surfaces and in extracellular milieu. By combined efforts from several research groups including ours a multifunctional nature of this lectin began to emerge. This review emphasizes the following characteristics of epsilon BP: (i) epsilon BP is secreted by cells such as macrophages; (ii) like many other lectins, epsilon BP functions at least bivalently; (iii) epsilon BP has specificity for distinct oligosaccharide structures that have a terminal galactose not masked by sialic acids; and (iv) in addition to binding IgE, epsilon BP binds to surfaces of various cell types via lectin-carbohydrate interaction. Importantly, epsilon BP binds to the IgE receptor on mast cells. We propose that epsilon BP can function as a modulatory protein on various cells by cross-linking critical cell surface glycoproteins. The proposed action of epsilon BP on mast cells is presented as a model.","['Liu, F T', 'Frigeri, L G', 'Gritzmacher, C A', 'Hsu, D K', 'Robertson, M W', 'Zuberi, R I']","['Liu FT', 'Frigeri LG', 'Gritzmacher CA', 'Hsu DK', 'Robertson MW', 'Zuberi RI']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Immunopharmacology,Immunopharmacology,7902474,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Galectin 3', 'Lectins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0162-3109(93)90034-N [pii]', '10.1016/0162-3109(93)90034-n [doi]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacology. 1993 Nov-Dec;26(3):187-95. doi: 10.1016/0162-3109(93)90034-n.,46,"['AI-19747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-20958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-32834/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequence similarity has suggested that SCG10 and stathmin have been derived from structurally and evolutionarily related genes. To explore the structural and evolutionary relationships between these genes, we have isolated a series of cosmid and phage clones that covers the entire region of the mouse stathmin gene and most of the mouse SCG10 gene. The SCG10 transcription unit spans at least 30 kb, while the stathmin gene is 6 kb in length. Both genes consist of five exons, and many of the intron/exon boundaries fall into the homologous regions of conserved domains of these two proteins. However, the promoter-proximal regions are distinct in the two genes, suggesting that they have evolved by fusion of the duplicated coding exons to unique promoters. Southern blot analysis indicates that SCG10 mRNA is encoded by a single gene in the mouse genome, while stathmin cDNA probes detect multiple genes. Chromosome mapping experiments reveal that the SCG10 gene is localized at the proximal region of mouse chromosome 3 and is linked to Il-7, while the stathmin gene loci are distributed to three chromosomes; the authentic stathmin gene lies on chromosome 4, whereas the loci on chromosomes 9 and 17 are likely to be pseudogenes. These data are consistent with the idea that the neuron-specific SCG10 gene evolved by duplication and modification of the more broadly expressed stathmin/Lap18 gene.","['Okazaki, T', 'Yoshida, B N', 'Avraham, K B', 'Wang, H', 'Wuenschell, C W', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Anderson, D J', 'Mori, N']","['Okazaki T', 'Yoshida BN', 'Avraham KB', 'Wang H', 'Wuenschell CW', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Anderson DJ', 'Mori N']","['Division of Neurogerontology, Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90089.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (STMN2 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Stmn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stmn2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stmn2 protein, rat)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cosmids', 'DNA', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Introns', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', '*Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Stathmin']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(83)71477-1 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1993.1477 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1993 Nov;18(2):360-73. doi: 10.1006/geno.1993.1477.,,"['AG07909/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['SCG10'],,,"['GENBANK/L20255', 'GENBANK/L20256', 'GENBANK/L20257', 'GENBANK/L20258', 'GENBANK/L20259', 'GENBANK/L20260', 'GENBANK/L20261', 'GENBANK/L20262', 'GENBANK/L20263']",,,,,,,,,,['Genomics 1994 May 1;21(1):298'],,,,

These progenitors differentiate spontaneously at low frequencies along the erythroid lineage, and following the introduction of kinase/ras-type oncogenes or treatment with TPA, they are induced to differentiate along the myelomonocytic and eosinophilic lineages. Here, we show that the ts1.1 mutant of E26 encodes an Ets DNA-binding domain that is both defective and thermolabile for binding of specific DNA sequences. Correlating with this, ts1.1 MEP colonies transformed at the permissive temperature exhibit elevated levels of erythroid cells and eosinophils, whereas at the nonpermissive temperature they are induced to differentiate along the erythroid and myelomonocytic lineages and, to a lesser extent, along the eosinophil lineage. Induction of the former two lineages cannot be separated by pulse shift experiments and is essentially completed 2.5 days after temperature shift. Our results indicate that the Ets portion of the Myb-Ets fusion protein inhibits the lineage commitment of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, probably via binding to regulatory DNA sequences of specific target genes.","['Kraut, N', 'Frampton, J', 'McNagny, K M', 'Graf, T']","['Kraut N', 'Frampton J', 'McNagny KM', 'Graf T']","['Differentiation Programme, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (oncogene proteins v-ets)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism/*physiology', 'Temperature', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.8.1.33 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1994 Jan;8(1):33-44. doi: 10.1101/gad.8.1.33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, relatively little is known about how cell differentiation is regulated. Considering that heat shock proteins (hsp) and specifically the small hsps have been increasingly linked to growth regulation, we sought to determine whether the mammalian small hsp (hsp28) is a growth-regulatory candidate during hematopoietic cell differentiation. Because of its effects on cell growth and differentiation and its increasing clinical use as a differentiating agent, we examined the effect of retinoic acid (RA) on hsp28 during differentiation of the human leukemic HL-60 cell line. Although hsp28 was constitutively expressed at low levels in untreated HL-60 cells, steady state hsp28 protein increased transiently, concomitant with the onset of G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, hsp28 phosphorylation transiently increased within one hour following treatment with RA. Interestingly, in contrast to other differentiating agents the induction of hsp28 by RA was post-transcriptionally mediated with hsp28 protein and mRNA being discordantly regulated. These observations underscore the complex regulation of hsp28 by RA during granulocytic differentiation of human leukemic cells and indicate hsp28 as an intermediary in the pathway through which retinoids exert their growth and differentiative effects.","['Spector, N L', 'Mehlen, P', 'Ryan, C', 'Hardy, L', 'Samson, W', 'Levine, H', 'Nadler, L M', 'Fabre, N', 'Arrigo, A P']","['Spector NL', 'Mehlen P', 'Ryan C', 'Hardy L', 'Samson W', 'Levine H', 'Nadler LM', 'Fabre N', 'Arrigo AP']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/10 00:00,1994/01/10 00:01,['1994/01/10 00:00'],"['1994/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-5793(94)80270-x [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1994 Jan 10;337(2):184-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(94)80270-x.,,"['CA-40216-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'IF32CA08954-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the course of disease, immune reactivity for synaptophysin (SYN) (to identify presynaptic elements) and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) (to identify postsynaptic elements) were quantified using confocal laser microscopy. Immunostaining of SYN in the cerebral cortex (an area not exhibiting spongiform lesions) was similar in viral infected and age-matched control mice. However, compared to age matched controls, SYN staining in the brainstem (an area exhibiting spongiform lesions) of viral infected mice progressively declined during the course of disease. Quantitative analysis showed greater reduction of MAP-2 immunostaining in viral-infected mice compared to age-matched controls. In infected mice, both regions with and without spongiform lesions showed diminished MAP-2 staining.

In order to correlate glycosylation and intracellular processing of this protein with viral pathogenicity, envelope gene products of pathogenic and apathogenic glycosylation mutants were expressed in Rat-1 cells and metabolically labelled with [6-3H]glucosamine. Following immunoprecipitation, primary and secondary gene products (gp55, gp65) were separated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligosaccharides were released from tryptic glycopeptides by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (gp55), peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F (gp65) or by reductive beta-elimination. Resulting glycans were characterized by co-chromatography with authentic oligosaccharide standards using different HPLC systems and digestion with exoglycosidases. The results revealed that the primary envelope gene products of pathogenic glycosylation mutants were, in part, further processed in Rat-1 cells similar to wild-type glycoprotein, resulting in polypeptides carrying complex-type N-glycans as well as partially sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast, corresponding glycoproteins encoded by apathogenic mutants were found to remain at the level of the primary translation product exclusively comprising high-mannose-type N-glycans. Hence, intracellular maturation of the envelope gene products in this model cell line seems to correlate with the in vivo pathogenicity of the glycosylation mutants studied.","['Freis, A', 'Rau, S', 'Friedrich, R W', 'Geyer, R']","['Freis A', 'Rau S', 'Friedrich RW', 'Geyer R']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Polysaccharides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, env', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polysaccharides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/glycob/3.5.465 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycobiology. 1993 Oct;3(5):465-73. doi: 10.1093/glycob/3.5.465.,,,,,['env'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiating effects of 1,25D3 have been studied extensively in a large number of in vitro systems but primarily using cultured leukemia cells, keratinocytes, and bone cells. In spite of this attention, the understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the diverse forms of cell differentiation by 1,25D3 is fragmentary. It seems likely, however, that the effects of 1,25D3 on calcium homeostasis and on cell differentiation are both signaled by direct effects on the cell membrane and by the transduction of the signal to the genome. The direct effect may be mediated by a hypothetical membrane recognition element, the G proteins, phosphoinositide metabolism, and protein kinase C (PKC). Signals to the nucleus may include PKC, the Ca2+ gradient, and protein phosphorylation cascades, but the protein receptor (VDR) plays a principal role in this form of signal transduction. The VDR interacts with the promoter elements of a number of nuclear genes, either as a homodimer or a heterodimer with a retinoid or orphan receptors. The key nuclear responses include the increased expression of phenotype-specifying proteins and the appearance of G1/S and G2+M cell cycle blocks, which result in cessation of cell proliferation. The attempts to improve control of neoplastic cell proliferation will depend on a selective exploitation of these properties of 1,25D3 to design novel analogs of 1,25D3 with low hypercalcemic but high differentiation-inducing properties. It is anticipated that a better understanding of the multiple pathways that transduce the signals from 1,25D3 to the nucleus and to the cell membrane, a consideration of the structure-function relationships of the derivatives of 1,25D3, and the use of synergistic combinations of 1,25D3 with other biological response modifiers or cytotoxic drugs will lead to improved therapy of several hyperproliferative and malignant diseases.","['Studzinski, G P', 'McLane, J A', 'Uskokovic, M R']","['Studzinski GP', 'McLane JA', 'Uskokovic MR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,9007261,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/chemistry/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Calcium/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 1993;3(4):279-312.,274,['R01 CA 44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletions in 6q, total or partial trisomies of 7q, and monosomy 13 or changes of 13q14 turned out to be significantly more frequent in high-grade than in low-grade lymphomas (P < .01, P < .01, and P < .05, respectively). In summary, the cytogenetic findings in our series of 104 PTL enabled us to distinguish not only between low-grade and high-grade lymphomas but also between various entities of PTL. Thus, the cytogenetic findings paralleled the histopathologic diagnoses made according to the updated Kiel classification.","['Schlegelberger, B', 'Himmler, A', 'Godde, E', 'Grote, W', 'Feller, A C', 'Lennert, K']","['Schlegelberger B', 'Himmler A', 'Godde E', 'Grote W', 'Feller AC', 'Lennert K']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*genetics/ultrastructure']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77678-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 15;83(2):505-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease has a number of distinctive characteristics, prominent among which is the fine reticulin fibrosis invariably present in the bone marrow. However, fibroblast infiltration has never been noted in the marrow and the origin of the fibrosis has not been established. The present studies show that the hairy cells (HCs) of HCL produce an insoluble matrix of fibronectin (FN) in vitro. FN synthesis was shown by the appearance of cellular FN on the surface of cells cultured in serum-free medium and by immunoprecipitation of the metabolically labeled protein from HC aggregates. Moreover, the HCs were shown to assemble FN into disulphide-bonded multimers. This assembly was blocked by a 70-kD amino-terminal fragment of the molecule that blocks FN multimer formation by fibroblasts. HCs expressed abundant VLA-5, an FN receptor not present on normal circulating B lymphocytes, but important in matrix formation. Furthermore, HCs were shown to adhere to an FN fragment containing the VLA-5 binding site. It is therefore suggested that the VLA-5 of HCs is implicated in their assembly of FN matrix. The in vivo relevance of the findings was established by the demonstration of FN in association with infiltrating HCs in bone marrow sections from patients with HCL. It is concluded that the HCs synthesise and assemble an FN matrix and that this is at least partly responsible for the bone marrow fibrosis so characteristic of the disease.","['Burthem, J', 'Cawley, J C']","['Burthem J', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)']",IM,"['Cell Aggregation', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*etiology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77677-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 15;83(2):497-504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An HL-60 variant cell line, termed HL-525, derived from long-term exposure to TPA (Homma et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 83: 7316, 1986) is resistant to TPA-induced differentiation and displays decreased PKC beta expression compared with the HL-60 parent line. However, this variant exhibits features of granulocytic differentiation, including nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, when exposed to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Whereas treatment of HL-525 cells with ATRA or TPA alone had no effect on features of monocytic differentiation, these agents in combination resulted in cellular adhesion, nonspecific esterase staining, and induction of the c-fms (monocyte growth factor receptor) gene. In order to measure PKC expression associated with the reversal of TPA resistance by ATRA, we exposed HL-525 cells to ATRA and analyzed PKC-mRNA and protein levels. Exposure of HL-525 cells to ATRA for 3 days resulted in induction of PKC beta transcripts, whereas there was little change in PKC alpha mRNA levels. ATRA treatment was also associated with an increase in PKC activity and an induction of cytosolic PKC beta protein levels. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ATRA reverses TPA resistance in HL-525 cells by enhancing the expression of PKC.","['Yang, K D', 'Mizobuchi, T', 'Kharbanda, S M', 'Datta, R', 'Huberman, E', 'Kufe, D W', 'Stone, R M']","['Yang KD', 'Mizobuchi T', 'Kharbanda SM', 'Datta R', 'Huberman E', 'Kufe DW', 'Stone RM']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77676-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 15;83(2):490-6.,,"['CA34283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8-CA-01352/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) have been implicated in supporting the growth of leukemic monocyte-macrophage colonies either by autocrine or paracrine pathways. In seven untreated JCML patients, we investigated the role of IL-1 in the spontaneous growth of these cells by specifically blocking IL-1 receptors. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra) was added to the clonogenic assays, and in each case significant (mean = 63%, range = 35% to 82%) inhibition of spontaneous proliferation was observed. Uncultured circulating cells from PB or BM of four out of five patients expressed IL-1 beta-specific mRNA and secreted the protein into the culture supernatants. Moreover, by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that most of the spontaneously growing leukemic colony-forming unit cells (CFU-C) obtained from BM cells of two patients were positive for the presence of the IL-1 beta-specific mRNA. Despite the presence of a measurable amount of GM-CSF in JCML cell culture supernatants, GM-CSF-specific mRNA in CFU-C cells of four cases was not detected by RT-PCR. These data further support a central role for IL-1 beta in the pathogenesis of JCML and suggest that the use of IL-1 Ra could represent a novel therapeutic strategy against this disorder.","['Schiro, R', 'Longoni, D', 'Rossi, V', 'Maglia, O', 'Doni, A', 'Arsura, M', 'Carrara, G', 'Masera, G', 'Vannier, E', 'Dinarello, C A']","['Schiro R', 'Longoni D', 'Rossi V', 'Maglia O', 'Doni A', 'Arsura M', 'Carrara G', 'Masera G', 'Vannier E', 'Dinarello CA', 'et al.']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-H.S.

Potential responsible mechanisms include the disease process itself, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (particularly L-Asparaginase [ASP]), or a combination of the disease and treatment. We studied thrombin regulation in 26 consecutive children with ALL and 14 healthy age-matched controls by: (1) plasma concentrations of prothrombin; (2) plasma inhibition of 125I-alpha-thrombin; and (3) four biochemical markers of in vivo thrombin activation (thrombin complexed to its inhibitor antithrombin III [ATIII; TAT], prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2), activated protein C complexed to the inhibitors alpha 1 antitrypsin [APCAT]), and protein C inhibitor (APC-PCI). Measurements were made at presentation before treatment, after treatment with ASP alone, and during combination chemotherapy with and without ASP. At presentation, the capacity to generate thrombin (reflected by plasma prothrombin concentrations) and the capacity to inhibit thrombin (125I-alpha-thrombin--inhibitor complex formation) were similar in children with ALL compared with that for healthy children. After ASP alone or as part of combination chemotherapy, prothrombin levels were preserved, whereas plasma inhibition of 125I-alpha-thrombin decreased significantly because of a decrease in plasma concentrations of inhibitors, most importantly ATIII. After combination chemotherapy without ASP, plasma concentrations of ATIII and the capacity to inhibit 125I-alpha-thrombin returned to normal values, whereas prothrombin levels increased above control values. Thrombin generation in vivo also differed from healthy controls. At presentation, plasma concentrations of three of four markers of in vivo thrombin activity (TAT, F1.2, APCAT, but not APC-PCI) were increased in children with ALL. Neither ASP alone nor combination chemotherapy with or without ASP significantly altered values of these three markers. In summary, although the in vitro capacity to generate thrombin was preserved, the in vitro capacity to inhibit 125I-alpha-thrombin decreased after ASP therapy. Evidence for increased endogenous thrombin generation was documented in children with ALL at presentation and throughout treatment. We speculate that poor regulation of this thrombin may contribute to thrombotic complications in children with ALL.","['Mitchell, L', 'Hoogendoorn, H', 'Giles, A R', 'Vegh, P', 'Andrew, M']","['Mitchell L', 'Hoogendoorn H', 'Giles AR', 'Vegh P', 'Andrew M']","['Department of Paediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein C)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antithrombin III Deficiency', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein C/analysis', 'Risk', 'Thrombin/*biosynthesis', 'Thrombosis/*etiology']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77663-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 15;83(2):386-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell growth continued until cultures were terminated at day 35 to 40. During the first 2 weeks of culture, most nonadherent cells were differentiated myeloid cells. By days 35 to 40, the adherent layer contained cells able to initiate secondary LTBMCs. These data indicate that hematopoietic precursors cells able to proliferate and differentiate in vitro are present in the BM of persons with Fanconi anemia and BM failure.

Using oligonucleotide primers derived from these genes, we established reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the detection of the fusion transcripts from both the der(11) and der(4) chromosomes. Using these assays we analyzed 23 pediatric cases of t(4;11) containing ALL. RT-PCR analysis for the der(11)-derived MLL/AF-4 fusion transcript resulted in its detection in every case at a sensitivity of greater than 1 leukemic cell in 10(5) cells. Sequence analysis of MLL/AF-4 PCR products demonstrated fusion mRNAs resulting from breaks in MLL introns 6, 7, or 8, with alternative splicing to one of three exons in the AF-4 gene. In contrast, analysis for the der(4)-derived transcript resulted in the detection of this chimeric mRNA in only 84% of the cases analyzed. These data suggest that the critical chimeric gene product involved in the establishment of the leukemic clone is derived from the der(11) chromosome.

After treatment in full medium with doses of drug in the range 1-10 microM, cells experienced a slow-down in S-phase transit followed by a G2 block. Cells either overcame the G2 block and continued to cycle or enlarged and eventually died. There was no evidence to suggest that cells dying from the G2 block underwent apoptosis.

The study was confounded by rapid population growth, demographic change and the relatively high socioeconomic status of the Dalgety Bay population. Health Board Primary Care Division records were used to calculate population estimates and Carstairs deprivation score was used to adjust for socioeconomic characteristics. In the period 1975-90, 211 residents were registered as having cancer compared with 214.21 expected from Scottish national rates. Of specific cancers possibly associated with radiation, the incidence of stomach, liver, lung, bone, prostate, bladder and kidney cancer and lymphoma were lower than expected while colon, rectum, pancreas, skin, breast and thyroid cancer and multiple myeloma and leukaemia were higher. There were three cases of childhood leukaemia compared with 1.22 expected. The only statistically significant differences observed were for pancreas (11 cases, O/E 2.28), lung (25 cases, O/E 0.65) and non-melanoma skin (36 cases, O/E 1.50). Stomach cancer was of borderline statistical significance (four cases, O/E 0.40). Adjustments for socioeconomic factors accounted for the apparently low incidence of stomach and lung cancer and, to a lesser extent, skin cancer, which remained of borderline statistical significance. Results in relation to pancreas cancer were unchanged. The observations of raised incidence of pancreas and skin cancer arose in the context of a survey of 17 cancer sites, from which the finding of two or more statistically significant results is not unusual (P = 0.21), and the numbers of cases involved were small. The epidemiological evidence for an association between radiation exposure and pancreas cancer risk is weak. Stronger evidence exists for an association with skin cancer.

After the 20-day treatment course, most animals were resistant to rechallenge with live virus. Adoptive transfer of T cells from such resistant but not from normal mice into naive recipients provided full protection against virus challenge. From these experiments, we concluded that post-exposure chemoprophylaxis restricted virus replication and allowed the animals to form protective, long-lasting cellular immune responses. Here, the role for cellular immunity during antiviral chemoprophylaxis was tested by comparing treatment success in normal BALB/c mice and in their nude, athymic counterparts. Both were inoculated with equal doses of RLV (10(4) plaque-forming units, pfu). Single-agent AZT or combination therapy with AZT + IFN-alpha, started before or after RLV inoculation, prevented viremia in all normal but not in most nude mice. A significant number of nude mice were completely protected by chemoprevention only when given a 10 times lower virus dose. When normal mice were injected with a 10 times higher virus dose (10(5) pfu), complete protection by chemoprevention was lost. These results demonstrate that the success of chemoprevention depends critically on the virus inoculum. The differential success of chemoprevention in normal and T-cell-deficient mice implies that effective cellular immunity plays an important role in protecting virus-exposed animals against viremia and disease.","['Ruprecht, R M', 'Bronson, R']","['Ruprecht RM', 'Bronson R']","['Laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', '*Rauscher Virus/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*prevention & control', 'Retroviridae Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*prevention & control', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1994.13.59 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1994 Jan;13(1):59-66. doi: 10.1089/dna.1994.13.59.,,"['1RO1-AI32330-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI72664/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 AI-24845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine years of incidence data.,177-85,"BACKGROUND: Dade County (Florida) is the largest county in the United States in which a majority of the population is Hispanic. To describe and compare cancer incidence among white and black Hispanic and non-Hispanic males in South Florida and to identify those sites showing important racial-ethnic differences between sub-groups, incidence rates were determined from 9 years of prospective population-based cancer surveillance data. METHODS: All incident cancer cases diagnosed among male residents of Dade County for the period January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1989, were obtained from the statewide tumor registry for Florida, the Florida Cancer Data System. Race- and ethnic-specific age-standardized incidence rates and standardized rate ratios to compare rates among racial-ethnic subgroups for each site are presented. RESULTS: Compared with white non-Hispanics, white Hispanic males had significantly higher rates of cancers of the liver, gallbladder, nasal cavity, penis, and thyroid; acute lymphocytic leukemia; and Kaposi's sarcoma. Significantly lower rates were found for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, testes, bladder, and kidney, and for mesothelioma, melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Black Hispanics had significantly lower rates only of cancers of the esophagus, lung, and prostate than did black non-Hispanics. CONCLUSION: Differences were found in incidence rates by race-ethnicity; while incidence rates for most sites among white Hispanic males were lower than among white non-Hispanics, higher rates for several sites are of particular concern and merit further investigation to determine differences in risk factors and exposures.","['Trapido, E J', 'Chen, F', 'Davis, K', 'Lewis, N', 'MacKinnon, J A']","['Trapido EJ', 'Chen F', 'Davis K', 'Lewis N', 'MacKinnon JA']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Miami, Florida.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,,IM,"['African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Florida/epidemiology', 'Hispanic or Latino/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",1994/01/24 00:00,1994/01/24 00:01,['1994/01/24 00:00'],"['1994/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1994 Jan 24;154(2):177-85.,,['NCI-3POCA 14395-19/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is frequently associated with a life-threatening hemorrhagic diathesis, often aggravated by induction cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients with APL have bone marrow infiltration by abnormal promyelocytes, usually with prominent cytoplasmic granulation. These patients have a unique cytogenetic abnormality, a balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17. The nuclear retinoic acid receptor alpha gene, on chromosome 17, is translocated to the PML gene region, on chromosome 15, resulting in the synthesis of two fusion messenger ribonucleic acids, PML/RAR-alpha and RAR-alpha/PML, easily detected by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. This assay is extremely useful in the diagnosis and detection of minimal residual disease in APL patients. All trans-retinoic acid (ATR) differentiates the malignant cell clone and corrects the coagulopathy associated with this disease. The most important adverse effect is a respiratory distress syndrome, treatable with steroids, if detected at its onset. ATR yields durable remissions in patients with APL, after consolidation with cytotoxic chemotherapy.","['de Lacerda, J F', 'do Carmo, J A', 'de Lacerda, J M']","['de Lacerda JF', 'do Carmo JA', 'de Lacerda JM']","['Unidade de Hematologia, Hospital de Santa Maria, Faculdade de Medicina de Lisboa.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Portugal,Acta Med Port,Acta medica portuguesa,7906803,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Port. 1993 Oct;6(10):473-80.,78,,Leucemia promielocitica aguda.

The cells were kept in liquid culture for up to 92 h in the presence of up to 10,000 U/ml of recombinant human TNF without adding colony-stimulating factors. Under these conditions the concentration of viable leukemic cells decreased by 14 to 53%, compared to control cultures. In acute myelogenous leukemia, all cases to some degree developed an enlargement of mitochondria; in 2 cases prominent cytoplasmic processes, and in 2 cases cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, an enlargement and deformation of all cell types was observed to varying degrees. In the normal bone marrow sample only minor cytoplasmic changes occurred. In all cultures apoptotic changes were rarely observed and--if present--were observed also in cultures without TNF. When the DNA of leukemic cells treated with TNF was separated on agarose, no fragments characteristic of apoptosis were visible. Our results demonstrate that TNF does not induce direct cytotoxicity or apoptosis in acute or chronic myeloid leukemias and are compatible with the notion that some leukemic cells may be activated or stimulated by TNF. The mitochondrion appears to be one of the primary targets of TNF.

The effects of irradiation were monitored in vitro using three strains of L5178Y (LY) mouse lymphoma cells that markedly differ in sensitivity to UV radiation. Comparisons were made for the effects of approximately equitoxic fluences that reduced cell survival to 1-15%. Depending on the cell strain, the fluences ranged from 830 to 1600 kJ/m2 for the UVASUN lamp, 75 to 390 J/m2 for the FS20 lamp and 3.8 to 17.2 J/m2 for the G15T8 lamp. At the exposure level used in this study, irradiation with the UVASUN, but not the FS20 or G15T8, lamp induced a variety of non-nuclear changes including damage to cytoplasmic organelles and increased plasma membrane permeability and cell lysis. Cell lysis and membrane permeabilization were induced by the UVA1 emission of the UVASUN lamp, but not by its visible+IR components (> 400 nm). The results show that the plasma membrane and other organelles of LY cells are highly sensitive to UVA1 but not to UVB or UVC radiation. Also UVA1, but not UVB or UVC radiation, causes rapid and extensive lysis of LY cells. In conclusion, non-nuclear damage contributes substantially to UVA cytotoxicity in all three strains of LY cells.","['Beer, J Z', 'Olvey, K M', 'Miller, S A', 'Thomas, D P', 'Godar, D E']","['Beer JZ', 'Olvey KM', 'Miller SA', 'Thomas DP', 'Godar DE']","['Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD 20857.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,['0 (Membrane Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Intracellular Membranes/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Membrane Proteins/radiation effects', 'Mice', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1993.tb04951.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1993 Nov;58(5):676-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1993.tb04951.x.,,['FDA223-88-6076/FD/FDA HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, HL60 cells differentiated into macrophages (HL60 phi) exhibited markedly increased photofrin uptake, which was further enhanced by their pretreatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide.

We studied the toxicity and efficacy of daily subcutaneous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with Fanconi anemia and pancytopenia. The toxicity of GM-CSF at the doses and schedule used was minimal. Six of seven patients entered had an increase in the neutrophil count of 7- to 25-fold, which was maintained during the course of study. Despite increases in the reticulocyte count, increases in hemoglobin concentration were rare. No improvement in platelet count was evident in any patient. No patient has evidence of leukemia after up to 19 months of continuous GM-CSF exposure, and all five surviving patients remain responsive to treatment. Although the optimal dose, schedule, and choice of cytokine for patients with marrow failure and Fanconi anemia are not established by this preliminary study, the data indicate that (1) GM-CSF may be able to palliate at least the neutropenia and potentially the neutropenic complications of the disease, (2) this effect can be sustained for more than 1 year, and (3) rapid evolution of acute leukemia is unlikely to be a frequent outcome of such treatment.

Monoblast-like U-937 cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine, followed by subcellular fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Brefeldin A inhibited proteolytic processing, intracellular transport, and secretion. The effects were reversible inasmuch as removal of brefeldin A resulted in a normal pattern of processing and transfer to high-density organelles, corresponding to lysosomes, and restitution of constitutive secretion of precursor forms. Both cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase acquired resistance to endoglycosidase-H, suggesting that conversion to complex oligosaccharide side chains also occurs in the presence of brefeldin A. Monensin and NH4Cl inhibited final proteolytic processing, indicating either that acidification is necessary for directing cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase to lysosomal-like organelles or that the protease(s) responsible for processing requires an acid pH. We conclude that pH-dependent proteolytic processing of cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase occurs in post-Golgi structures and that transfer to lysosomes or an immediately prelysosomal compartment is mandatory for complete processing.","['Lindmark, A', 'Gullberg, U', 'Olsson, I']","['Lindmark A', 'Gullberg U', 'Olsson I']","['Research Department, Lund Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/*metabolism', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Leukocyte Elastase', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Elastase/*metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.55.1.50 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Jan;55(1):50-7. doi: 10.1002/jlb.55.1.50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides cell activation, these receptors trigger other biologic responses, such as endocytosis of soluble ligands. Murine mast cells express two types of FcR that, when aggregated by antibodies and multivalent Ag, trigger the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. These are high affinity receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) and low affinity receptors for IgG (Fc gamma RIII). They comprise each an IgE- or IgG-binding alpha-subunit and two TAM-containing subunits that associate with both receptors: a beta-subunit and a homodimeric gamma-subunit that can associate also with the other subunits of the TCR. Herein, we focused on biologic activities triggered in mast cells via the TAM of the gamma-subunits. Using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells stably transfected with cDNA-encoding murine Fc gamma RIII alpha, we found that murine Fc gamma RIII trigger the phagocytosis of antibody-coated erythrocytes. Using RBL transfectants expressing Fc gamma RIII with a deletion of the intracytoplasmic domain of Fc gamma RIII alpha or chimeric receptors having the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Fc gamma RII and the intracytoplasmic domain of Fc gamma RIII alpha, we showed that intracytoplasmic sequences of Fc gamma RIII alpha are neither necessary nor sufficient for Fc gamma RIII to trigger phagocytosis. Using RBL transfectants expressing chimeric receptors having the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Fc gamma RII and the TAM-containing intracytoplasmic domain of murine Fc gamma RIII gamma, we demonstrated that intracytoplasmic sequences of Fc gamma RIII gamma are sufficient to trigger phagocytosis. Using RBL transfectants expressing the same Fc gamma RII-III gamma chimeras, in the TAM of which one, the other, or both tyrosine residues were mutated, we established that tyrosines in the TAM sequence are required for phagocytosis. Our results endow TAM gamma with previously unknown triggering capacities and Fc gamma RIII with new biologic properties.","['Daeron, M', 'Malbec, O', 'Bonnerot, C', 'Latour, S', 'Segal, D M', 'Fridman, W H']","['Daeron M', 'Malbec O', 'Bonnerot C', 'Latour S', 'Segal DM', 'Fridman WH']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Clinique, INSERM U255, Institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/physiology', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phagocytosis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG/chemistry/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jan 15;152(2):783-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported that this gene is expressed in B lymphocytes and that the specific mRNA was undetectable in T cells using Northern blotting. Further analyses of different sources of B and T lymphocytes confirmed this pattern. However, BTK transcripts were undetectable in four plasmacytoma lines. Moreover, as virtually normal amounts of BTK transcripts were found in PBMC from two patients carrying a point mutation in BTK, despite low B cell numbers, we anticipated that the gene would also be expressed in cells of other lineages. The erythroleukemia cell line K-562, the promyelocytic line HL-60 and the histiocytic lymphoma line U-937 were found to have BTK mRNA levels comparable to B cells. BTK mRNA was also detected in monocytes from healthy donors as well as in the human immature basophilic cell line KU812, in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1 and in the CD34 expressing myeloblast KG-1. A similar expression pattern was obtained when BTK protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis, a small amount (less than 1% of the level in B cells) of BTK mRNA was identified in T lymphocytes. Our findings are compatible with a general expression of the BTK gene in hematopoietic cells, except in T lymphocytes and plasma cells, in which the transcript level is selectively down-regulated.","['Smith, C I', 'Baskin, B', 'Humire-Greiff, P', 'Zhou, J N', 'Olsson, P G', 'Maniar, H S', 'Kjellen, P', 'Lambris, J D', 'Christensson, B', 'Hammarstrom, L']","['Smith CI', 'Baskin B', 'Humire-Greiff P', 'Zhou JN', 'Olsson PG', 'Maniar HS', 'Kjellen P', 'Lambris JD', 'Christensson B', 'Hammarstrom L', 'et al.']","['Center for BioTechnology, Karolinska Institute, NOVUM, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/*enzymology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Plasma Cells/*enzymology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'X Chromosome']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jan 15;152(2):557-65.,,,,,['BTK'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies by ourselves and others have demonstrated breakpoint clustering in acute leukemias bearing translocations involving 11q23, and a Drosophila trithorax gene homologue (called MLL, HRX, or ALL-1) has been shown to span the 11q23 breakpoints of these translocations. To determine if this gene is affected in infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we have analyzed 26 infant AML cases for molecular alterations of this 11q23 gene. 15 out of 26 cases studied (58%) showed rearrangement of the MLL gene at the molecular level, and these rearrangements were clustered within an approximately 11-kb region containing nine exons of this gene. Moreover, 14 of the 15 cases with 11q23 rearrangements (93%) had myelomonocytic or monocytic phenotypes (M4 or M5 FAB subtypes, respectively), both of which are associated with a poor prognosis in childhood AML. In contrast, only 1 of 11 nonrearranged cases had an M4 or M5 phenotype (P = 0.00002). Rearrangement also correlated significantly with hyperleukocytosis (P = 0.02), another clinical parameter associated with poor outcome in this disease. Our results demonstrate that molecular rearrangements of MLL are common in M4 or M5 infant AML, and suggest that alteration of this gene may result in abnormal control of proliferation and differentiation in monocytic progenitor cells.","['Sorensen, P H', 'Chen, C S', 'Smith, F O', 'Arthur, D C', 'Domer, P H', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Korsmeyer, S J', 'Hammond, G D', 'Kersey, J H']","['Sorensen PH', 'Chen CS', 'Smith FO', 'Arthur DC', 'Domer PH', 'Bernstein ID', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Hammond GD', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Exons', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1994 Jan;93(1):429-37. doi: 10.1172/JCI116978.,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC293805,"['ALL-1', 'HRX', 'MLL']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serial sections of more than 1700 human temporal bones still represent current otological problems--many of which are now rare but are still encountered--such as tuberculosis, lues or diphtheria of the ear. Complications following acute otitis--which were much more frequent and dangerous in the pre-antibiotic era--can be studied in detail.

Low serum values of antioxidant vitamins were associated with childhood neoplasm occurrence. Some site-specific effect was reported.

Recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) was added to three acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived pre B-cell lines: Reh, Km3 and Nalm-6. Our results show that rIL-4 significantly decreases continuous proliferation of Reh and Km3 cells while Nalm-6 cells have a limited response in this respect. This rIL-4 effect is dose-dependent and can be neutralized by anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Furthermore, rIL-4 down-regulated IL-3-induced proliferation of Reh cells. Phenotypic analysis of rIL-4-treated cells points to significant induction of surface marker maturation of leukemic cells by this cytokine. Together, these in vitro data suggest that IL-4: 1) inhibits the proliferation and 2) promotes the differentiation of certain human leukemic B-cell precursors.","['Ouaaz, F', 'Mentz, F', 'Mossalayi, M D', 'Schmitt, C', 'Michel, A', 'Debre, P', 'Guillosson, J J', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Arock, M']","['Ouaaz F', 'Mentz F', 'Mossalayi MD', 'Schmitt C', 'Michel A', 'Debre P', 'Guillosson JJ', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Arock M']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, CNRS URA625, Unite Claude Bernard C20, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', '*Cell Division', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb01608.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1993 Nov;51(5):276-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb01608.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point mutations in p53 have been found in some cases of blast crisis and CML blastic cell lines, but it is not clear whether complete inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor function, with or without the production of a mutant protein, can by itself trigger the process of blastic transformation. By using retroviral gene transfer, we showed that the introduction of a mutant human p53 cDNA into hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with CML in chronic phase, which already contain p210BCR/ABL, could promote their proliferation in vitro, and occasionally even lead to the growth of factor-independent colonies.

Stimulation of the murine bone marrow stromal cell line +/(+)-1.LDA 11 with IL-1 (500 U/ml) in combination with TNF-alpha (500 U/ml) (IL-1 plus TNF-alpha) induced expression of c-jun mRNA as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNA. We investigated the possibility that arachidonic acid metabolites, acting through protein kinase C (PKC) and perhaps also through the PKC-responsive transcription factor c-jun/AP-1, may be responsible for regulating GM-CSF transcription in these stromal cells. Expression of GM-CSF mRNA was preceded by IL-1 plus TNF-alpha induced arachidonate release (assayed using the 3H-derivative). Pretreatment of cells with the phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine (20 microM) inhibited accumulation of both c-jun and GM-CSF mRNA but had no influence on expression of other genes induced by IL-1 and TNF-alpha, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In addition, quinacrine partially blocked IL-1 plus TNF-alpha induced 3H-arachidonic acid release from prelabeled stromal cells. Furthermore, exogenous arachidonate (10 to 50 microM) induced expression of c-jun. To investigate the role of arachidonate in GM-CSF transcription, we used a reporter vector consisting of the murine GM-CSF promoter linked to firefly luciferase. Transfection efficiency was monitored by assessing expression of a constitutively active gene, RSV-beta galactosidase. In this system, quinacrine significantly inhibited IL-1 plus TNF-alpha induced GM-CSF transcription assayed with the reporter construct. Exogenous arachidonic acid alone (10 microM) increased activity of GM-CSF reporter vector 1.5-fold over control. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that arachidonate metabolites are involved in the signaling pathway that leads to IL-1 plus TNF-alpha induced GM-CSF gene expression. Thus, transcriptional activation of GM-CSF gene is mediated, in part, by the arachidonate cascade.","['Rizzo, M T', 'Boswell, H S']","['Rizzo MT', 'Boswell HS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Walter Oncology Center, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism/physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Jan;22(1):87-94.,,,,,['GM-CSF'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The internalization of GM-CSF was more profoundly inhibited than its surface binding. TPA at 1 and 10 nM inhibited GM-CSF binding. Inhibition of GM-CSF binding by a combination of ET-18-OCH3 (10 microM) and TPA (1 or 10 nM) was less than additive, and ET-18-OCH3 partially inhibited TPA-induced protein kinase C (PKC) depletion in the cytosol and translocation to the particulate fractions.

Thenoyltrifluoroacetone is an efficient inhibitor of the activity, whereas ouabain, monensin and tetraethylammonium show no effect. Cells are able to generate ascorbate from dehydroascorbic acid. This explains why both forms of vitamin C show practically the same affinity for the redox cycle but why it does not drive the redox cycle by itself because it is much slower and is not inhibited by thenoyltrifluoroacetone.

Early clinical experience in the 1960s and 1970s with the thymidine analogs 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) and 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) was disappointing because normal tissue toxicity eliminated any potential for therapeutic gain. Inadequate delivery systems for intravenous and intraarterial infusions also contributed to the decline of this strategy. More recently, laboratory investigations have revealed further information regarding the mechanism of IUdR/BUdR radiosensitization. This knowledge provided a rationale for the sequence and timing of drug and radiation exposure, which could be both effective and tolerable. Advancing technology also provided safer infusion devices, and a resurgence in clinical trials combining IUdR or BUdR and radiation resulted. Current laboratory studies are now providing data on tumor cell kinetics, which is being applied to ongoing clinical trials. Fluoropyrimidines, principally 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), were also used in early clinical trials and unlike IUdR/BUdR were found to have significant activity as single agents against a variety of tumor types. The clinical integration of 5-FU and radiation occurred more slowly, but recent trials have demonstrated a therapeutic gain. Improved rates of local control and survival with combined 5-FU and radiation versus radiation alone have now been demonstrated in patients with rectal, esophageal, and anal carcinomas. However, the mechanism of interaction between the fluoropyrimidines and radiation remains uncertain and continues to be investigated with the hope of improved clinical outcome. As the cellular pathways influenced by the halogenated pyrimidines have been defined, the potential for biochemical modulation of these agents has been recognized. Leucovorin, the most commonly applied modulator, has been shown to enhance the activity of 5-FU in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. These studies serve as an example for current trials that use biochemical modulators of IUdR, BUdR, and 5-FU as radiosensitizers. Hydroxyurea, currently used in the treatment of chronic leukemia, has also been considered a radiosensitizer. As with IUdR/BUdR, the clinical trials have often been inconclusive and interest in this radiosensitizer has waned. A poor understanding of the mechanism of action and tumor cell/normal tissue kinetics may be responsible for the lack of overall success with this strategy. Current investigations of cell kinetics in humans and potential mechanisms of hydroxyurea action could provide information critical to future trials of hydroxyurea radiosensitization.","['McGinn, C J', 'Kinsella, T J']","['McGinn CJ', 'Kinsella TJ']","['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,"['0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Floxuridine', 'Fluorouracil', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea', 'Idoxuridine', 'Leucovorin', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', '*Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', '*S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0147-0272(93)90012-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0147-0272(93)90012-q [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1993 Sep-Oct;17(5):273-321. doi: 10.1016/0147-0272(93)90012-q.,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maximal non-cytotoxic concentrations of each modulator were tested and sensitization induces (SIs) were derived by comparing the drug concentration required to inhibit growth by 50% in their presence or absence. Like verapamil (10 microM) itself, three of the other modulators tested, namely, S9788 (4 microM), flunarizine (20 microM) and quinidine (30 microM), resulted in 2- to 3-fold sensitization of vinblastine against the parental CEM cells, and comparable effects were noted in the CEM/VM-1 cells, which were not cross-resistant to vinblastine. In contrast, cyclosporin A (0.5 microM) and B859-35 (2 microM) did not enhance vinblastine growth inhibition in these lines. However, the greatest sensitization with all the modulators was noted in the classic MDR VBL1000 cells, with SIs ranging from 40- to 350-fold, except for cyclosporin A, which proved ineffective at the concentration tested (SI, 2.6). The greatest extent of differential sensitization of these VBL1000 tumor cells occurred with quinidine or B859-35, which proved significantly more effective than verapamil alone. Combinations of modulators resulted in additive effects, with B859-35 plus cyclosporin A proving superior to B859-35 plus verapamil. In contrast, none of these compounds proved effective as a sensitizer to teniposide. The growth-inhibitory effects of this drug were not modified significantly in either the 92-fold teniposide-resistant VM-1 cells or in the parental cells. Addition of verapamil itself also failed to modulate teniposide growth inhibition in the VBL1000 cells, which express significant cross-resistance to this drug (36-fold). However, SI values of 3- to 5-fold were obtained using quinidine or B859-35. These results serve (a) to emphasise the need to monitor the effects of modulators not only on drug-resistant cells but also on their drug-sensitive counterparts so as to ensure differential sensitization such that normal sensitive tissues are not likely to be adversely influenced and (b) to highlight the observation that the extent of modulation differs depending not only on the antitumor drug used but also on the mechanism of drug resistance expressed. This in vitro model system appears to provide a useful screening system for resistance modulators and certainly could be used in attempts to identify alternative agents that may influence teniposide sensitivity in these drug-resistant sublines.","['Hill, B T', 'Hosking, L K']","['Hill BT', 'Hosking LK']","['Cellular Chemotherapy Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Triazines)', '140945-01-3 (S 9788)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'R7PLA2DM0J (Flunarizine)', 'Z81N45O25Z (niguldipine)']",IM,"['Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Dihydropyridines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flunarizine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Triazines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685907 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;33(4):317-24. doi: 10.1007/BF00685907.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tumor is a teratoma originating in the ovary with pathogenesis and metastatic properties similar to those of human ovarian cancer. Drug was given to the mice once every 5 days for 4 doses beginning 1 day after i.p. implantation of 10(7) or 5 x 10(7) OVCAR-3 tumor cells. For P388 leukemia, drug was given i.p. once or on days 1 and 5 after tumor inoculation. Despite the use of low doses of MLV-VM, the antitumor activity of the combination [increase in life span (%T/C), 289%-294%] represents a 4-log cell kill over the additive effect of the two drugs, indicating a synergistic interaction between MLV-VM and cDDP. Likewise, low doses of the drug combination produced a synergistic interaction on human ovarian OVCAR-3 tumors, and tumor-free, long-term survivors were obtained. Combined therapy of liposome-incorporated valinomycin and cisplatin was well tolerated and produced no overlapping nephrotoxicity, although a decrease in liver enzyme markers (alkaline phosphatase and/or alkaline aminotransferase) with MLV-VM was observed. These results appear to suggest that MLV-VM with cDDP may have considerable potential for the treatment of ovarian cancer disseminated within the peritoneal cavity, although the frequency and sequence of drug administration may need to be improved.","['Daoud, S S']",['Daoud SS'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-6510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Valinomycin/administration & dosage']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685905 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;33(4):307-12. doi: 10.1007/BF00685905.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the in vivo half-life is short, and repeated administrations are required for optimal efficacy. Methotrexate was encapsulated into a lipid-based drug-delivery system to create an extended-release formulation (Depo/methotrexate) for subcutaneous administration. Pharmacokinetics and efficacy studies were done in BDF1 mice. Depo/methotrexate increased the methotrexate plasma half-life by a factor of 190, from 0.53 to 100 h. Plasma peak levels of the encapsulated drug were 120-fold lower than those of unencapsulated methotrexate, whereas the AUCs (areas under the concentration-time curve) were similar. As a consequence of the extended drug release, the single-dose potency of methotrexate against the L1210 leukemia model was increased by a factor of about 130 without producing significant changes in the therapeutic index. In conclusion, Depo/methotrexate appears to have potential usefulness as an extended-release formulation of methotrexate.","['Bonetti, A', 'Chatelut, E', 'Kim, S']","['Bonetti A', 'Chatelut E', 'Kim S']","['UCSD Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0812.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Female', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685904 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;33(4):303-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00685904.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide (25 mg/kg) and C18PCA (5 mg/kg) were given orally on days 1-5 after tumor inoculation. The median life span of the mice treated with etoposide or C18PCA alone was 19.5 and 18 days, respectively. The combination of both drugs significantly extended the median life span to 33 days. To clarify this enhancement of the increase in median life span, we examined intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools, cell-cycle distribution, DNA fragmentation, and the time course of the plasma drug concentration. Etoposide had no effect on intracellular dNTP pools in this experimental system, whereas treatment of cells with C18PCA or with the combination of both drugs resulted in a significant increase in dTTP pools to values ranging from 1.8- to 2.0-fold higher than the control levels. There was a significant increase in cells in the S + G2/M phase when cells had been treated with both etoposide and C18PCA. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of the extracted DNA revealed that C18PCA enhanced the fragmentation of DNA, with a length of about 180 bp being induced by etoposide. The plasma peak levels of etoposide (1000 nM) and ara-C (50 nM) were observed at 20 and 30 min after the simultaneous administration of both drugs, respectively. The plasma etoposide level gradually decreased to 10% of the peak level at 240 min after administration. On the other hand, the plasma concentration of ara-C was maintained at above 20 nM at 240 min. These observations suggest that C18PCA and etoposide act on P388 murine leukemic cells by accumulating cells in the S + G2/M phase. Even if the plasma concentration of ara-C is low, the repair of DNA damage by etoposide may be hindered in the presence of ara-C following an increase in DNA fragmentation.","['Higashigawa, M', 'Cao, D C', 'Matsui, K', 'Yamada, S', 'Kakitou, H', 'Kagawa, Y', 'Inamochi, H', 'Ido, M', 'Sakurai, M']","['Higashigawa M', 'Cao DC', 'Matsui K', 'Yamada S', 'Kakitou H', 'Kagawa Y', 'Inamochi H', 'Ido M', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', ""3I7U8R8NWC (1-arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-stearylphosphate)"", '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleotides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685900 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;33(4):281-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00685900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
