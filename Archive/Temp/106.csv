Some of these aberrations imply chromosome breaks as a result of unrepaired double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA. The ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) protein is the principal integrator of cellular responses to DSBs. ATM deletion is also an adverse prognostic factor in CLL. Taking this into account, we evaluated if genetic and/or epigenetic variation in the ATM gene may modulate the individual susceptibility to develop CLL. Our case-control association study was performed in a large Spanish population of 1,503 individuals, including 742 patients with CLL and 761 controls. We identified one haplotype within the ATM gene that confers an increased risk of CLL development (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.10-1.60). Two polymorphisms of this ATM haplotype eliminated one CpG site each in Introns 15 and 61, causing changes in DNA methylation pattern. These data provide the first evidence for the existence of a putative ""hepitype"" in the ATM gene associated with CLL risk.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Enjuanes, Anna', 'Richter, Julia', 'Ammerpohl, Ole', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Ardanaz, Maite', 'Marco, Fernando', 'Salas, Antonio', 'Campo, Elias', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa']","['Martin-Guerrero I', 'Enjuanes A', 'Richter J', 'Ammerpohl O', 'Colomer D', 'Ardanaz M', 'Marco F', 'Salas A', 'Campo E', 'Siebert R', 'Garcia-Orad A']","['Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110824,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/09/13 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20912 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Nov;50(11):887-95. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20912.

Differentially expressed genes, the main targets of most gene selection methods, can be classified as single- and multiple-class specific signature genes. Here, we present a novel gene selection algorithm based on a Group Marker Index (GMI), which is intuitive, of low-computational complexity, and efficient in identification of both types of genes. Most gene selection methods identify only single-class specific signature genes and cannot identify multiple-class specific signature genes easily. Our algorithm can detect de novo certain conditions of multiple-class specificity of a gene and makes use of a novel non-parametric indicator to assess the discrimination ability between classes. Our method is effective even when the sample size is small as well as when the class sizes are significantly different. To compare the effectiveness and robustness we formulate an intuitive template-based method and use four well-known datasets. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the template-based method in difficult cases with unbalanced distribution. Moreover, the multiple-class specific genes are good biomarkers and play important roles in biological pathways. Our literature survey supports that the proposed method identifies unique multiple-class specific marker genes (not reported earlier to be related to cancer) in the Central Nervous System data. It also discovers unique biomarkers indicating the intrinsic difference between subtypes of lung cancer. We also associate the pathway information with the multiple-class specific signature genes and cross-reference to published studies. We find that the identified genes participate in the pathways directly involved in cancer development in leukemia data. Our method gives a promising way to find genes that can involve in pathways of multiple diseases and hence opens up the possibility of using an existing drug on other diseases as well as designing a single drug for multiple diseases.",,"['Tsai, Yu-Shuen', 'Aguan, Kripamoy', 'Pal, Nikhil R', 'Chung, I-Fang']","['Tsai YS', 'Aguan K', 'Pal NR', 'Chung IF']","['Institute of Biomedical Informatics, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110901,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2011/09/13 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024259 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-05064 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24259. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024259.

We have previously demonstrated that Tax(HTLV-1) interferes with ss-selection, an important checkpoint of early thymopoiesis, indicating that human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection has the potential to perturb thymic human alphabeta T-cell development. To verify that inference and to clarify the impact of HTLV-1 infection on human T-cell development, we investigated the in vivo effects of HTLV-1 infection in a ""Human Immune System"" (HIS) Rag2(-)/(-)gamma(c)(-)/(-) mouse model. These mice were infected with HTLV-1, at a time when the three main subpopulations of human thymocytes have been detected. In all but two inoculated mice, the HTLV-1 provirus was found integrated in thymocytes; the proviral load increased with the length of the infection period. In the HTLV-1-infected mice we observed alterations in human T-cell development, the extent of which correlated with the proviral load. Thus, in the thymus of HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2(-)/(-)gammac(-)/(-) mice, mature single-positive (SP) CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were most numerous, at the expense of immature and double-positive (DP) thymocytes. These SP cells also accumulated in the spleen. Human lymphocytes from thymus and spleen were activated, as shown by the expression of CD25: this activation was correlated with the presence of tax mRNA and with increased expression of NF-kB dependent genes such as bfl-1, an anti-apoptotic gene, in thymocytes. Finally, hepato-splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and lymphoma/thymoma, in which Tax was detected, were observed in HTLV-1-infected mice, several months after HTLV-1 infection.

FcmuR is expressed on human CD19(+) B cells, CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells, and CD56(+)/CD3(-) NK cells and has been shown to be overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. CLL is a malignancy of mature IgM(+) B lymphocytes that display features of polyreactive, partially anergized B cells related to memory B cells. In this article, we report that FcmuR is O-glycosylated in its extracellular domain and identify the major sites of O-glycosylation. By using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we found that FcmuR localized to the cell membrane but also found that large pools of FcmuR accumulate in the trans-Golgi network. Aggregation of FcmuR on CLL cells by IgM prompted rapid internalization of both IgM and FcmuR, reaching half-maximal internalization of cell-bound IgM within 1 min. Upon internalization, FcmuR transported IgM through the endocytic pathway to the lysosome, where it was degraded. Using a series of FcmuR deletion mutants, we identified a proline-rich domain essential for cell surface expression of FcmuR and a second domain, containing a YXXPhi motif, that controls internalization. Although it has been reported that BCR activation increases FcmuR expression, we found that activation of TLRs strongly downregulated FcmuR at both the mRNA and protein levels. Through internalization of IgM bound immune complexes, FcmuR may play a role in immune surveillance and contribute to B cell activation.

The viral proteins E6 and E7 are essential to transform noncancerous epithelial cells into cancerous carcinomas by targeting key tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins, respectively, but the cellular factors involved in E6 and E7 transcription themselves are incompletely understood. In this study, we defined a novel isoform of the mixed lineage leukemia 5 gene (MLL5beta) as a specific and critical regulator of E6 and E7 transcription in cervical carcinoma cells. MLL5beta is present in HPV16/18-positive cells including human primary cervical carcinoma specimens. Interaction of MLL5beta with the AP-1-binding site at the distal region of the HPV18 long control region led to activation of E6/E7 transcription. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of MLL5beta downregulated both E6 and E7 expression. MLL5beta downregulation was sufficient to restore p53 protein levels and reduce Rb phosphorylation, thereby reactivating apoptosis and cell-cycle checkpoints.

Loss of the FLT3 wild-type (WT) allele is associated with even worse prognosis. We have previously reported that heterozygous FLT3(wt/ITD) ""knockin"" mice develop a slowly fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). To study the roles of the WT FLT3 and ITD alleles in the development of MPNs, we generated FLT3/ITD homozygous (FLT3(ITD/ITD)) and hemizygous (FLT3(-/ITD)) mice. FLT3(-/ITD) mice, with the loss of WT allele, display a more severe MPN, as evidenced by even larger spleen, higher white blood cell counts, and shorter survival, compared with FLT3(wt/ITD) mice. Reintroduction of the WT FLT3 allele into FLT3(-/ITD) BM slowed the progression of MPN in recipient mice. FLT3(ITD/ITD) mice had an even severe MPN compared with the FLT3(-/ITD) and FLT3(wt/ITD) mice. Spontaneous leukemia developed in a small fraction of the FLT3(ITD/ITD) mice but was never observed in the FLT3(-/ITD) and FLT3(wt/ITD) mice. Our results suggest that loss of the WT allele contributes to the development of a more severe phenotype. Thus, the WT FLT3 allele seemingly functions as a tumor suppressor, attenuating the function of the FLT3/ITD allele in leukemia harboring FLT3/ITD mutations.",,"['Li, Li', 'Bailey, Emily', 'Greenblatt, Sarah', 'Huso, David', 'Small, Donald']","['Li L', 'Bailey E', 'Greenblatt S', 'Huso D', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110908,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics/physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism/physiology']",2011/09/13 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57514-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-328096 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 3;118(18):4935-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-328096.

The additional approved ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) nilotinib and dasatinib, along with investigational TKIs such as ponatinib (AP24534) and DCC-2036, support the possibility that mutation-mediated resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia can be fully controlled; however, the molecular events underlying resistance in patients lacking BCR-ABL point mutations are largely unknown. We previously reported on an insertion/truncation mutant, BCR-ABL(35INS), in which structural integrity of the kinase domain is compromised and all ABL sequence beyond the kinase domain is eliminated. Although we speculated that BCR-ABL(35INS) is kinase-inactive, recent reports propose this mutant contributes to ABL TKI resistance. We present cell-based and biochemical evidence establishing that BCR-ABL(35INS) is kinase-inactive and does not contribute to TKI resistance, and we find that detection of BCR-ABL(35INS) does not consistently track with or explain resistance in clinical samples from chronic myeloid leukemia patients.",,"[""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Zabriskie, Matthew S', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Adrian, Lauren T', 'You, Huihong', 'Corbin, Amie S', 'Yang, Fei', 'Press, Richard D', 'Rivera, Victor M', 'Toplin, Julie', 'Wong, Stephane', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Druker, Brian J']","[""O'Hare T"", 'Zabriskie MS', 'Eide CA', 'Agarwal A', 'Adrian LT', 'You H', 'Corbin AS', 'Yang F', 'Press RD', 'Rivera VM', 'Toplin J', 'Wong S', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, USA.

We examined the expression of the recently identified FcmuR by B and T cells in CLL patients using receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies. CLL B cells (CD5(+)/CD19(+)) expressed much higher levels of FcmuR on their cell surface than B cells from healthy donors. Such enhanced expression was more evident in immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV)-mutated, CD38(-) or early Rai-stage CLL than in IGHV-unmutated, CD38(+), or advanced Rai-stage CLL. Intriguingly, surface FcmuR levels also were significantly elevated in the non-CLL B cells (CD5(-)/CD19(+)) and T cells (CD5(+)/CD19(-)), especially in IGHV-mutated CLL. CLL patients also had high serum titers of FcmuR compared with healthy donors, and serum FcmuR levels correlated significantly with circulating lymphocyte numbers but not with the IGHV mutation status or Rai stage. The serum FcmuR was resolved as an approximately 40-kDa protein, distinct from the cell surface FcmuR of approximately 60 kDa, and it was produced by both CLL B and non-CLL B cells. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the serum FcmuR is a soluble form of the receptor encoded by an alternatively spliced FcmuR transcript.

Eradication of virus infection at the primary breeder level is the principal method for controlling ALV infection in chickens. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) method that utilized the prokaryotically expressed and affinity-purified viral capsid protein antigen p27 was developed for the detection of ALV-specific antibodies in chicken sera. The protocol of iELISA was validated and resulted in a higher agreement value than fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and was shown to be more sensitive and specific compared to the commercial ALV antibody test kit when FAT was used as a reference test. The main advantage of this method is the use of a single immunogenic protein to detect antibodies against all ALV exogenous subgroups. The results show that the developed iELISA is an inexpensive alternative and can potentially be used as a confirmatory test for the presence of anti-ALV antibodies on a large scale.,,"['Qiu, Yu', 'Qian, Kun', 'Shen, Haiyu', 'Jin, Wenjie', 'Qin, Aijian']","['Qiu Y', 'Qian K', 'Shen H', 'Jin W', 'Qin A']","['Key Lab of Jiangsu Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, No. 12 East, Wenhui Road, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",9011490,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Avian Leukosis/blood/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Capsid Proteins/*immunology', '*Chickens', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/veterinary', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/09/13 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['23/5/991 [pii]', '10.1177/1040638711416966 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Diagn Invest. 2011 Sep;23(5):991-3. doi: 10.1177/1040638711416966.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and fifty-nine neotropic felids and 51 exotic felids from 28 captive settings in Brazil were tested. While antibodies against Feline parvovirus and Feline coronavirus (FCoV), Feline calicivirus and Bartonella spp. were frequently detected by serologic tests, antibodies against Felid herpesvirus 1 or infection with hemotropic mycoplasmas were less prevalent. Serologic evidence of exposure to Ehrlichia spp., Feline immunodeficiency virus, and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was detected rarely, and infections with FeLV, Ehrlichia spp., and Cytauxzoon spp. were found infrequently. The detected Bartonella sequence was molecularly similar to B. koehlerae and B. henselae; for Cytauxzoon, the sequence resembled those from domestic cats. No Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Theileria spp. infections were detected. The positive test results varied significantly among different facilities and species.

It is unclear whether these differences exist exclusively in the older adult population or whether they begin to emerge in children and young adults. METHODS: Subjects (n=3534) diagnosed with cancer under 30 years of age in Yorkshire between 1990 and 2005 were analysed. Differences in survival rates for diagnostic subgroups were estimated by ethnic group (south Asian or not) using Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox regression. RESULTS: When compared to non-south Asians (all other ethnic groups excluding south Asians) a significant increased risk of death was seen for south Asians with leukaemia (hazard ratio (HR)=1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.11-2.76) and lymphoma (HR=2.05; 95% CI=1.09-3.87), whereas south Asians with solid tumours other than central nervous system tumours had a significantly reduced risk of death(HR=0.50; 95% CI=0.28-0.89). This was independent of socioeconomic deprivation. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of poorer survival outcomes for south Asians compared to non-south Asian children and young adults with leukaemia and lymphoma, but better outcomes for south Asian children and young adults with other solid tumours.

An initial kidney biopsy showed findings concordant with the cellular variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. A repeated biopsy 3 months later showed collapsing glomerulopathy, likely representing a morphologic evolution from a cellular variant into the collapsing glomerulopathy variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Collapsing glomerulopathy has been described in connection with a number of disparate disorders in which podocyte injury seems to be the common denominator. The close temporal association between clinical presentation and the development of nephropathy provides support for a direct pathogenic link between the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder and the glomerular lesions. We hypothesize that dysregulated cytokine production by the neoplastic cells led to podocyte alterations and eventually to the development of collapsing glomerulopathy.","['Copyright (c) 2011 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Using custom tiling oligonucleotide arrays and gene-specific linear amplification primers, translocation CGH (tCGH) maps balanced rearrangements to approximately 100-base resolution and facilitates the rapid cloning and sequencing of novel rearrangement breakpoints. As proof of principle, we used tCGH to characterize nine of the most common gene fusions in mature B-cell neoplasms and myeloid leukemias. Because tCGH can be performed in any CGH-capable laboratory and can screen for multiple recurrent translocations and genome-wide imbalances, it should be of broad utility in the diagnosis and classification of various types of lymphomas, leukemias, and solid tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Mcl-1 physically interacts with different BH3-only proteins; particularly, Noxa is involved in the modulation of Mcl-1 expression. In this study, we demonstrated that Noxa triggers the degradation of Mcl-1 at the mitochondria according to the exclusive location of Noxa at this compartment. The Noxa-induced degradation of Mcl-1 required the E3 ligase Mule, which is responsible for the polyubiquitination of Mcl-1. Because the USP9X deubiquitinase was recently demonstrated to be involved in Mcl-1 protein turnover by preventing its degradation through the removal of conjugated ubiquitin, we investigated whether Noxa affected the deubiquitination process. Interestingly, Noxa over-expression caused a decrease in the USP9X/Mcl-1 interaction associated with an increase in the Mcl-1 polyubiquitinated forms. Additionally, Noxa over-expression triggered an increase in the Mule/Mcl-1 interaction in parallel with the decrease in Mule/USP9X complex formation. Taken together, these modifications result in the degradation of Mcl-1 by the proteasome machinery. The implication of Noxa in the regulation of Mcl-1 proteasomal degradation adds complexity to this process, which is governed by multiple interactions.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We demonstrate exclusive and significant CLIP expression in all cases of typical and variant APL, as compared to other HLA-DR-negative non-APL-type AML.

The study investigated pain prevalence in this population compared with sibling controls and examined pain-related risk factors. Three self-reported pain outcomes including pain conditions, prescription analgesics used, and pain attributed to cancer and treatment were assessed among 10,397 cancer survivors and 3034 sibling controls from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Pain conditions (pain/abnormal sensation, migraines, and other headaches) were reported by 12.3%, 15.5%, and 20.5% of survivors, respectively; 16.7% of survivors reported use of prescription analgesics, and 21% attributed pain to cancer and treatment. Risks of reporting pain conditions and using prescription analgesics were higher among survivors than siblings, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Younger age at diagnosis and a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumor, or neuroblastoma (compared to leukemia) were associated with greater risk of reporting pain conditions. A history of bone cancer or soft tissue sarcoma (compared to leukemia) was associated with greater risks of using prescription analgesics and cancer-related pain attribution. Non-brain-directed scatter irradiation was associated with elevated risk for migraines and cancer-related pain attribution. Female gender and lower educational attainment were associated with increased reports of all 3 pain outcomes; minority status, unemployment, and being single were associated with greater risks for reporting pain conditions. These findings contribute to the understanding of pain and associated risk factors among adult survivors of childhood cancer and suggest areas of focus for pain intervention.","['Copyright (c) 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing leukocyte-filtered platelet with standard platelet concentrates transfusion (up to December 31, 2009) were searched and identified from Medline, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and CBM. A meta-analysis was conducted with Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5. 0. RESULTS: The search identified 558 citations in total, in which 7 articles in English were finally included in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed that compared with standard platelet concentrates transfusion, leukocyte-filtered platelet transfusion significantly decreased PTR [ RR = 0. 59, 95% CI (0. 42, 0. 82) , P = 0. 002 ] and HLA-alloimmunization [ RR = 0. 49,95% CI (0. 33, 0. 74) , P =0. 0006]. Subgroup analysis showed that HLA-alloimmunization was significantly reduced by leukocyte-filtered platelet transfusion among the patients with acute myelocytic leukemia [ RR =0.42, 95% CI (0.32, 0.56), P <0. 00001], while no significant difference was detected in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia because of the limited sample size [ RR = 0. 50, 95% CI (0. 10, 2.41) , P =0. 39]. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence shows that leukocyte-filtered platelet transfusion can prevent PTR and HLA-alloimmunization more effectively than standard platelet transfusion.

METHODS: Human THP-1 monocytes were challenged with PLM in vitro. The mRNA expressions of TLR2, TLR4, proinflammatory cytokine [interleukin(IL)-6], and chemokine (IL-8) were assayed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The secretions of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of TLR2 was analyzed with Western blot. RESULTS: PLM increased the mRNA expressions and secretions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) in THP-1 cells (all P=0.0000). PLM up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of TLR2 (P=0.0000), whereas the mRNA level of TLR4 was not altered. PLM hydrolyzed with beta-D-mannoside manno hydrolase failed to induce gene and protein expressions of TLR2, IL-6, and IL-8.

Not least within oncology, where many patients fail to be cured, and others are treated to or beyond the limit of acceptable toxicity, an individualized therapeutic approach is indicated. The mapping of the human genome and technological developments in DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling, and proteomics have raised the expectations for implementing genotype-phenotype data into the clinical decision process, but also multiplied the complex interaction of genetic and other laboratory parameters that can be used for therapy adjustments. Thus, with the advances in the laboratory techniques, post laboratory issues have become major obstacles for treatment individualization. Many of these challenges have been illustrated by studies involving childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where each patient may receive up to 13 different anticancer agents over a period of 2-3 years. The challenges include i) addressing important, but low-frequency outcomes, ii) difficulties in interpreting the impact of single drug or single gene response data that often vary across treatment protocols, iii) combining disease and host genomics with outcome variations, and iv) physicians' reluctance in implementing potentially useful genotype and phenotype data into clinical practice, since unjustified downward or upward dose adjustments could increase the of risk of relapse or life-threatening complications.

However, the chemotherapy portion of this regimen may be unsuitable for elderly patients or those with significant comorbidities. We investigated the safety and tolerability of single-agent rituximab in 23 consecutive patients presenting with CLL at a single institution. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients received eight cycles of weekly rituximab (375 mg/m(2) initially). Patients progressing on rituximab treatment could receive up to five further courses of single-agent rituximab in escalating doses up to 3 gm/m(2) per dose. Previously untreated and previously treated patients, including those refractory to fludarabine, were eligible for the study. RESULTS: Single-agent rituximab was efficacious, even in patients with treatment-refractory or poor-prognosis CLL. The overall response rate was 90.9% with a CR rate of 63.6%. The median PFS was 28.5 months, and median duration of response was 26 months. Responses were seen regardless of prior treatment including in patients refractory to fludarabine. Especially encouraging results were seen in patients receiving rituximab maintenance therapy who had a median duration of response substantially longer than those who did not receive maintenance (35 months vs. 14 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab was well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events even at the highest dose.

We further demonstrated that HeLa-SFCs expressed a higher level (6.9-fold) of the human papillomavirus oncogene E6, compared with that of parental HeLa cells. Gene silencing of E6 with a lentiviral-short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) profoundly inhibited HeLa-SFC sphere formation and cell growth. The inhibition of cell growth was even greater than that for sphere formation after E6 silence, suggesting that the loss of self-renewing ability may be more important. We then measured the expression of self-renewal genes, transformation growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), in shRNA-transduced HeLa-SFCs and found that expression of all three TGF-beta isoforms was significantly downregulated while LIF remained unchanged. Expression of the Ras gene (a downstream component of TGF-beta) was also markedly decreased, suggesting that the growth-inhibitory effect could be via the TGF-beta pathway. The above data indicate RNA interference-based therapy may offer a new approach for CSC-targeted cancer therapy.",,"['Gu, W', 'Yeo, E', 'McMillan, N', 'Yu, C']","['Gu W', 'Yeo E', 'McMillan N', 'Yu C']","['Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Functional Nanomaterials and Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. w.gu@uq.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110909,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (E7 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Spheroids, Cellular/*virology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*therapy']",2011/09/10 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/09/10 06:00'],"['2011/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt201158 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2011.58 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2011 Dec;18(12):897-905. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2011.58.

Besides cytotoxic T cells, natural killer (NK) cells may have a role in immune control of CML. Here, we explored the functionality of NK cells in CML patients and in a transgenic inducible BCR-ABL mouse model. Compared with controls, NK-cell proportions among lymphocytes were decreased at diagnosis of CML and did not recover during imatinib-induced remission for 10-34 months. Functional experiments revealed limited in vitro expansion of NK cells from CML patients and a reduced degranulation response to K562 target cells both at diagnosis and during imatinib therapy. Consistent with the results in human CML, relative numbers of NK1.1+ NK cells were reduced following induction of BCR-ABL expression in mice, and the defects persisted after BCR-ABL reversion. Moreover, target-induced degranulation by expanded BCR-ABL+ NK cells was compromised. We conclude that CML is associated with quantitative and functional defects within the NK-cell compartment, which is reproduced by induced BCR-ABL expression in mice.

MRx102 is a triptolide derivative, currently in preclinical development. Here we show that MRx102 potently promoted apoptosis in AML cell lines, with EC(50) values of 14.5+/-0.6 nM and 37.0+/-0.9 nM at 48 h for OCI-AML3 and MV4-11 cells, respectively. MRx102, at low nanomolar concentrations, also induced apoptosis in bulk, CD34(+) progenitor, and more importantly, CD34(+)CD38(-) stem/progenitor cells from AML patients, even when they were protected by coculture with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells. MRx102 decreased XIAP and Mcl-1 protein levels and inhibited RNA synthesis in OCI-AML3 cells. In vivo, MRx102 greatly decreased leukemia burden and increased survival time in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice harboring Ba/F3-ITD cells.

ATO acts by targeting multiple pathways in APL leading to apoptosis and myeloid differentiation. It induces complete remission without myelosuppression and causes only few adverse effects. In relapsed APL, ATO-based salvage therapy has been able to induce long-lasting remissions and possible cure in 50-81% of patients. In newly diagnosed APL, two main strategies are currently pursued. ATO is either included into induction therapy with the aim to minimize or eliminate chemotherapy, or it is incorporated as an additive into established first-line concepts with all-trans-retinoic acid and chemotherapy to reinforce their anti-leukemic efficacy. Recent results suggest a high efficacy of ATO in both concepts. In conclusion, experimental research and clinical studies have made contributions toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms induced by ATO in APL cells and have established this historic substance as an important candidate for the further improvement of APL therapy.",,"['Lengfelder, E', 'Hofmann, W-K', 'Nowak, D']","['Lengfelder E', 'Hofmann WK', 'Nowak D']","['III.

In this article, we use mathematical models of BCR-ABL levels to make inferences on the dynamics of LSCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with at least 1 BCR-ABL transcript measurement on imatinib were included (N = 477). Maximum likelihood methods were used to test 3 potential hypotheses of the dynamics of BCR-ABL transcripts on imatinib therapy: (i) monoexponential, in which there is little, if any, decline in BCR-ABL transcripts; (ii) biexponential, in which patients have a rapid initial decrease in BCR-ABL transcripts followed by a more gradual response; and (iii) triexponential, in which patients first exhibit a biphasic decline but then have a third phase when BCR-ABL transcripts increase rapidly. RESULTS: We found that most patients treated with imatinib exhibit a biphasic decrease in BCR-ABL transcript levels, with a rapid decrease during the first few months of treatment, followed by a more gradual decrease that often continues over many years. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the only hypothesis consistent with current data on progenitor cell turnover and with the long-term, gradual decrease in the BCR-ABL levels seen in most patients is that these patients exhibit a continual, gradual reduction of the LSCs.

Mutational DNA damage is generally attributed to cause disease, but irradiation also affects multicellular interactions as a result of poorly understood bystander effects that may influence carcinogenic susceptibility. In this study, we show that the bone marrow of irradiated mice will retain the ability to kill hemopoietic clonogenic stem cells and to induce chromosomal instability for up to 3 months after irradiation. Chromosomal instability was induced in bone marrow cells derived from CBA/Ca mice, a strain that is susceptible to radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (r-AML), but not in C57BL6 mice that are resistant to r-AML. Similarly, clonogenic cell lethality was exhibited in C57BL/6 mice but not CBA/Ca mice. Mechanistic investigations revealed that these genotype-dependent effects involved cytokine-mediated signaling and were mediated by a cyclooxygenase-2-dependent mechanism. Thus, our results suggested that inflammatory processes were responsible for mediating and sustaining the durable effects of ionizing radiation observed on bone marrow cells.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this action remain poorly understood. In this study, we used two erythroid models, murine erythroid leukemia cells and erythroid burst-forming unit-derived erythroblasts, to show that 5-aza-CdR induced erythroid differentiation and increased the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferrochelatase (Fech), thereby increasing iron uptake and heme biosynthesis. We have identified new regulatory E-boxes that lie outside of CpG islands in the TfR1 and Fech promoters, and the methylation status of these sites can be altered by 5-aza-CdR treatment. This in turn altered the binding of the transcription factor c-Myc to these promoter elements. Furthermore, 5-aza-CdR promoted the nuclear translocation of c-Myc and its binding to Max to form functional complexes. The coordinated actions of 5-aza-CdR on the methylation status of the target genes and in stimulating the nuclear translocation of c-Myc provide new molecular insights into the regulation of E-boxes and explain, at least in part, the increased erythroid response to 5-aza-CdR treatment.",,"['Ning, Bo', 'Liu, Gang', 'Liu, Yuanyuan', 'Su, Xiufen', 'Anderson, Gregory J', 'Zheng, Xin', 'Chang, Yanzhong', 'Guo, Mingzhou', 'Liu, Yuanfang', 'Zhao, Yuliang', 'Nie, Guangjun']","['Ning B', 'Liu G', 'Liu Y', 'Su X', 'Anderson GJ', 'Zheng X', 'Chang Y', 'Guo M', 'Liu Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Nie G']","['Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biological Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, 11 Zhongguancun Beiyitiao, Beijing 100190, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110907,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Tfrc protein, mouse)', '137468-70-3 (Max protein, mouse)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/physiology', 'Animals', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'CpG Islands/physiology', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid Cells', 'Ferrochelatase/*metabolism', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/*physiology']",2011/09/10 06:00,2011/12/16 06:00,['2011/09/10 06:00'],"['2011/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50746-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.258129 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Oct 28;286(43):37196-206. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.258129.

Previous work has shown that the majority of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases express a wild type p53 gene, although the functionality of the p53 pathway has rarely been validated. In the present study, the integrity of the p53 pathway was investigated in a panel of ALL cell lines and xenografts established from direct patient explants in immune-deficient mice. A focused real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR array of known p53-regulated genes identified p21(WAF1) (CDKN1A) as the highest ranked gene to be differentially expressed between B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and T-ALL xenografts following exposure to the DNA-damaging drug etoposide. Lack of p21(WAF1) induction was observed in six of seven T-ALL xenograft lines, as well as primary T-ALL cells following irradiation exposure, despite an otherwise functional p53 response. Repression of p21(WAF1) in T-ALL cells was associated with decreased acetylated H3K9 localized at its promoter compared with BCP-ALL cells, together with increased CpG methylation within the first exon and intron. Although the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat failed to induce p21(WAF1) in T-ALL samples, the combination of vorinostat and the demethylating agent decitabine reactivated expression of the silenced p21(WAF1) gene in the Molt-4 T-ALL cell line. Considering the known anti-apoptotic function of p21(WAF1), our findings have significant implications for the responses of T- versus BCP-ALL cells to chemotherapeutic drugs that induce p21(WAF1).",,"['Davies, Carwyn', 'Hogarth, Linda A', 'Dietrich, Philipp A', 'Bachmann, Petra S', 'Mackenzie, Karen L', 'Hall, Andrew G', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Davies C', 'Hogarth LA', 'Dietrich PA', 'Bachmann PS', 'Mackenzie KL', 'Hall AG', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales 2052, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110907,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vorinostat']",2011/09/10 06:00,2011/12/16 06:00,['2011/09/10 06:00'],"['2011/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50787-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.272336 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Oct 28;286(43):37639-50. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.272336.

In freshly diagnosed patients, the anti-leukemic activity of nilotinib exceeds the efficacy of imatinib, and although long-term data for nilotinib are not available yet, the drug has recently been approved for firstline treatment of chronic phase CML in various countries. Still however, several questions concerning the optimal dose, follow-up parameters, long-term safety, and patient selection remain open. Likewise, it remains uncertain whether both Sokal low-risk and high-risk patients should receive nilotinib as frontline therapy in the future. Another question is whether nilotinib can completely eradicate CML in a subset of patients. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether and what comorbidity must be regarded as relative or absolute contra-indication for this TKI. To discuss these issues, the Austrian CML Working Group organized a series of meetings in 2010. In the current article, the outcomes from these discussions are summarized and presented together with recommendations for frontline use of TKIs in various groups of patients with CML.

It is suggested that the heat shock instigated by infections, particularly in infancy, stimulates Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines and an apoptosis-inhibitory environment. This infective stress also increases the number of cooperating oncogenic mutations in pre-leukemic cells, especially if the primary adaptive immune response is delayed. The glucocorticoid release that follows leads to acute thymic involution, a decline in antitumor immunity, and maturation arrest of B-lymphocytes. The infective lymphoid recovery hypothesis addresses an apparent contradiction-that a non-hygienic environment primes the adaptive immune response and is protective against childhood ALL, while multiple infections occurring later increase the risk of childhood ALL. In affluent (compared to less-affluent) societies, the characteristic ALL incidence peak in early childhood, and the shortened time to diagnosis, arise from surviving recurrent infections and the accumulated loss and recovery of lymphoid tissue. Evidence supporting the hypothesis, such as the role of lymphoid tissue reconstitution cytokines that stimulate proliferation stress on B-cell progenitors, comes from the study of children with congenital syndromes that are susceptible to leukemia.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2011.

Our goal was to examine the effect of miR-424 over-expression on defeating the maturation blockage in monoblastic cell line U937. The permanent over-expression of miR-424 was established using a retroviral vector construct containing the precursor of miR-424 sequence. Induction of differentiation process was monitored by assaying changes in cell morphology, and expression of cell surface markers using light microscopy, quantitative RT-PCR, and flow cytometry for monocyte markers such as CD11b and CD14. The cells showed monocytic characteristics 14 days after transduction, and CD11b and CD14 expression were significantly increased, confirmed by flow cytometry QRT-PCR and RT-PCR results.

In acute leukemias, a significant difference was noted between patients with long-term disease-free survival in those tested at diagnosis (P=0.001) or in those tested at the time of relapse (P=0.05). Similarly in patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemias, there was a correlation between molecular response and levels of 25(OH)D (P=0.01). Previously identified factors, such as age, season, gender, or nutritional index, were not related to circulating 25(OH)D levels.

Targeting CD19 with MEDI-551 was also effective in several severe combined immunodeficiency lymphoma models. Furthermore, the combination of MEDI-551 with rituximab resulted in prolonged suppression of tumour growth, demonstrating that therapeutic mAbs with overlapping effector function can be combined for greater tumour growth inhibition. Together, the data demonstrate that MEDI-551 has potent antitumour activity in preclinical models of B cell malignancies.

However, impairment of its regulation may promote formation and progression of malignancy. An important part of the apoptotic machinery are the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, regulating caspase activity, cell division or cell survival pathways through binding to their baculovirus AIP repeat (BIR) domains and/or by their ubiquitin-ligase RING zinc finger (RZF) activity. The following IAPs have been described so far: NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein; BIRC1), cIAP1 and cIAP2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2; BIRC2 and BIRC3, respectively), XIAP (X-chromosome binding IAP; BIRC4), survivin (BIRC5), BRUCE (Apollon; BIRC6), livin (BIRC7) and Ts-IAP (testis-specific IAP; BIRC8). Several studies suggested a potential contribution of IAPs to oncogenesis and resistance to anti-tumor treatment. Increased IAP expression was found in variety of human cancers, including hematological malignancies, such as leukemias and B-cell lymphomas. A correlation between the progression of those diseases and high levels of survivin or XIAP has been reported. Overexpression of XIAP in acute myeloid leukemia or survivin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma have been indicated as an unfavorable prognostic factors. Elevated cellular levels of cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP and survivin correlated with a progressive course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, targeting IAPs with small-molecule inhibitors by their antisense approaches or natural IAP antagonist mimetics, may be an attractive strategy of anti-cancer treatment. Such agents can either directly induce apoptosis of tumor cells or sensitize them to other cytotoxic agents, hence overcoming drug-resistance. This review demonstrates the current knowledge on IAP molecular biology, as well as the mechanisms of action and the development of IAP-targeting agents for treatment of hematological malignancies.",,"['Smolewski, P', 'Robak, T']","['Smolewski P', 'Robak T']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Models, Biological']",2011/09/10 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2011/09/10 06:00'],"['2011/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CMM/E- Pub/00130 [pii]', '10.2174/156652411797536723 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2011 Nov;11(8):633-49. doi: 10.2174/156652411797536723.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although various forms of chromosomal abnormalities have been detected in approximately 50-60% of patients with de novo MDS and in up to 80% of patients with therapy-related MDS, their molecular significance for pathogenesis and disease progression is not yet fully understood. Recent technical advances in molecular biology have disclosed more accurately details of pathological chromosomal and molecular aberrations in MDS. Such details could not be identified with conventional cytogenetical techniques, including G-banding. In particular, with recent technical advances in comparative genome hybridization or single nucleotide polymorphism array technology, several candidate genes for the pathogenesis of MDS have been identified, which are located in minimally deleted or uniparental disomy segments. Moreover, epigenetic deregulation of gene expression is also likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. Accordingly, in addition to classical oncogenic abnormalities, such as p53 abnormalities, or NRAS mutation, various molecular abnormalities, such as TET2, RPS14, or c-CBL, have been identified and/or proposed as the novel candidates for molecular basis of the development and progression of MDS. A better understanding of the causative molecular events underlying MDS pathogenesis is essential for the development and establishment of a more effective treatment resulting in a complete cure for MDS.

Dasatinib is approximately 325-fold more active than imatinib in inhibiting wild-type ABL kinase in vitro and is active against a wide variety of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants, except for T315I. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of dasatinib in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL, as well as summarizing its pharmacological properties. In clinical trials, oral dasatinib was effective in achieving major or complete cytogenetic responses in both newly diagnosed and imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic-phase CML. Dasatinib was likewise effective in achieving major or overall haematological responses in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant, accelerated- or blast-phase CML, or Ph+ ALL. Responses were rapidly achieved within 1-3 months and were durable over 1-5 years of follow-up. The majority of adverse events with dasatinib were of mild to moderate severity. Fluid retention (including pleural effusion) was the most common adverse event. Haematological abnormalities were common and cytopenias were the most common grade 3/4 adverse events. Dasatinib 100 mg administered once daily was as effective as dasatinib 70 mg administered twice daily, and was better tolerated, being associated with lower incidences of pleural effusion and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, in particular. Dasatinib was more effective than high-dose imatinib in the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant chronic-phase CML and was more effective than standard dosages of imatinib, as well as being associated with less frequent fluid retention, in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML. Dasatinib was generally equally effective in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations at baseline. Therefore, oral dasatinib is a highly effective once-daily therapy for the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase CML, as well as for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic- and advanced-phase CML or Ph+ ALL.",,"['McCormack, Paul L', 'Keam, Susan J']","['McCormack PL', 'Keam SJ']","['Adis, a Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']",2011/09/10 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/09/10 06:00'],"['2011/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['9 [pii]', '10.2165/11207580-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2011 Sep 10;71(13):1771-95. doi: 10.2165/11207580-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,['BioDrugs. 2012 Feb 1;26(1):61-4.

Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are frequently administered during and after chemotherapy to reduce complications. However, their safety with regard to disease-related outcomes and survival in AML is unclear. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of CSFs on patient outcomes, including survival. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety/efficacy of CSFs with regard to disease-related outcomes and survival in patients with AML. SEARCH STRATEGY: We conducted a comprehensive search strategy. We identified relevant randomized clinical trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2010), LILACS (up to December 2009), databases of ongoing trials and relevant conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials that compared the addition of CSFs during and following chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in patients with AML. We excluded trials evaluating the role of CSFs administered for the purpose of stem cell collection and/or priming (e.g. before and/or only for the duration of chemotherapy). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors appraised the quality of trials and extracted data. For each trial, we expressed results as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We analyzed time-to-event outcomes as hazard ratios (HRs). MAIN RESULTS: The search yielded 19 trials including 5256 patients. The addition of CSFs to chemotherapy yielded no difference in all-cause mortality at 30 days and at the end of follow up (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.18 and RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.05, respectively) or in overall survival(HR 1.00; 95% 0.93 to 1.08). There was no difference in complete remission rates(RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07), relapse rates(RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.05) and disease-free survival(HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13). CSFs did not decrease the occurrence of bacteremias(RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12), nor the occurrence of invasive fungal infections(RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.19). CSFs marginally increased adverse events requiring discontinuation of CSFs as compared to the control arm(RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.56).

Although several medical interventions in adults with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction due to other causes are beneficial, it is not known if the same treatments are effective for childhood cancer patients and survivors with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of medical interventions on anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer patients or survivors with the effect of placebo, other medical interventions or no treatment. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2011, issue 1), MEDLINE/PubMed (1949 to May 2011) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to May 2011) for potentially relevant articles. We additionally searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing the effectiveness of medical interventions to treat anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity with either placebo, other medical interventions or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the study selection. One review author performed the data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments which were checked by another review author. MAIN RESULTS: We identified two RCTs. One trial (135 patients) compared enalapril with placebo in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic anthracycline induced cardiac dysfunction. The other trial (68 patients) compared a two-week treatment of phosphocreatine with a control treatment (vitamin C, ATP, vitamin E, oral coenzyme Q10) in leukaemia patients with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Both studies had methodological limitations.The RCT on enalapril showed no (statistically) significant differences in overall survival, mortality due to heart failure, development of clinical heart failure and quality of life between treatment and control group. A post-hoc analysis showed a decrease (i.e. improvement) in one measure of cardiac function (left ventricular end systolic wall stress (LVESWS): -8.62% change) compared with placebo (+1.66% change) in the first year of treatment (P = 0.036), but not afterwards. Patients treated with enalapril had a higher risk of dizziness or hypotension (RR 7.17, 95% CI 1.71 to 30.17) and fatigue (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.013).The RCT on phosphocreatine found no differences in overall survival, mortality due to heart failure, echocardiographic cardiac function and adverse events between treatment and control group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the effect of enalapril in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction, only one RCT is available. Although there is some evidence that enalapril temporarily improves one parameter of cardiac function (LVESWS), it is unclear whether it improves clinical outcomes. Enalapril was associated with a higher risk of dizziness or hypotension and fatigue. Clinicians should weigh the possible benefits with the known side-effects of enalapril in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.For the effect of phosphocreatine in childhood cancer patients with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, only one RCT is available. Limited data with a high risk of bias showed no significant difference between phosphocreatine and control treatment on echocardiographic function and clinical outcomes.We did not identify any RCTs or CCTs studying other medical interventions for symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer patients or survivors.High-quality studies should be performed.",,"['Sieswerda, Elske', 'van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Postma, Aleida', 'Cheuk, Daniel Kl', 'Caron, Huib N', 'Kremer, Leontien Cm']","['Sieswerda E', 'van Dalen EC', 'Postma A', 'Cheuk DK', 'Caron HN', 'Kremer LC']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital / Academic Medical Center, PO Box 22660 (room A3-246), Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1100 DD.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20110907,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '020IUV4N33 (Phosphocreatine)', '69PN84IO1A (Enalapril)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Enalapril/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Phosphocreatine/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survivors']",2011/09/09 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/09/09 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008011.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011 Sep 7;(9):CD008011. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008011.pub2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016;8:CD008011.

Likely due to aging of the US population, the median age of AML patients at diagnosis has increased from 68 to 72 years. AML is a heterogeneous disease, particularly in older patients, making therapeutic decisions challenging. Older patients who are 'fit' for intensive chemotherapy and would have a reasonable chance to benefit based on host and disease characteristics should receive standard induction chemotherapy with 7 days of continuous infusion of cytarabine and at least 60 mg/m(2) daunorubicin daily for 3 days. Therapeutic options for patients who are not candidates for or are not likely to respond to intensive therapy include clofarabine, low intensity chemotherapy such as low dose cytarabine, hypomethylating agents, or investigational agents. For older AML patients in complete remission, post-remission or consolidation chemotherapy with repeat induction or modified high dose cytarabine may offer a small chance for long term disease-free survival. Selected older patients who achieve remission by any means should be considered for reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation which may offer improved chances of cure and survival compared with standard post-remission chemotherapy.",,"['Motyckova, Gabriela', 'Stone, Richard M']","['Motyckova G', 'Stone RM']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA. gmotyckova@partners.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/09/09 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/09/09 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11864-011-0162-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2011 Dec;12(4):341-53. doi: 10.1007/s11864-011-0162-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, develop specifically target p65 inhibitors will be substantial interest. Until now, although several p65 inhibitors are currently in preclinical and clinical development, none of them are targeting. In this study, siRNA targeting p65 was introduced into the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and THP-1 xenograft tumors in nude mice, and then, we measured p65 mRNA and protein levels by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, and levels of related protein cyclin D1, Bc1-2, and SMRT by Western blotting. We also investigated the cell cycle and apoptosis via FCM, and cell proliferation by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. We found that p65 siRNA could effectively reduce the p65 mRNA and protein expression, arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, inhibit the proliferation and increase the apoptosis of THP-1 cells, and intratumoral injection of p65 siRNA could suppress tumor growth in nude mice. We also found that when down regulation of p65, the expression of cyclin D1 and Bc1-2 decreased, and the expression of SMRT increased in vitro and vivo.

Of the 65 patients, 35 (54%) developed dasatinib-induced pleural effusion (a median onset time, 20 months; range 0.2-54).

Recent studies revealed high ratios of loss of the IKZF1 gene which encodes IKAROS in BCR-ABL1+ ALL and lymphoblastic crisis (LBC) of CML. However, little is known about the cooperativity between the aberrant IKAROS and BCR-ABL1 in primary human hematopoietic cells. We investigated the effects of expression of BCR-ABL1 and/or IK6, a natural dominant negative isoform of IKAROS, on proliferation and differentiation of human CD34+ cord blood cells with or without human bone marrow-derived stromal cells which support early B cell differentiation. Cell proliferation was remarkably enhanced by co-expression of BCR-ABL1 and IK6, with reduced expression of glycophorin A and increased expression of CD41, especially on stromal cells, compared with expression of BCR-ABL1 alone that resulted in expansion of erythroid progenitors.

However, its downstream molecules have not been well explored. In this study, we have established that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) and tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are crucial downstream molecules of anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI-induced TLR4 signaling pathway in THP-1 cells and explored the potential mechanisms of their self-regulation. Treatment of THP-1 cells with anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI complex induced IRAKs and TRAFs expression and activation. Anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI complex firstly induced expression of IRAK4 and IRAK1, then IRAK1 phosphorylation and last IRAK3 upregulation. In addition, anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI complex simultaneously and acutely enhanced mRNA levels of TRAF6, TRAF4 and zinc finger protein A20 (A20), while chronically increased A20 protein level. Moreover, anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI complex-induced IRAKs and TRAFs expression and activation were attenuated by knockdown of ANX2 by infection with ANX2-specific RNA interference lentiviruses (LV-RNAi-ANX2) or by treatment with paclitaxel, which inhibits TLR4 as an antagonist of myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) ligand. Furthermore, both IRAK1/4 inhibitor and a specific proteasome inhibitor MG-132 could attenuate TRAFs expression as well as TF expression induced by anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI complex. In conclusion, our results indicate that IRAKs and TRAFs play important roles in anti-beta(2)GPI/beta(2)GPI-stimulated TLR4/TF signaling pathway in THP-1 cells and contribute to the pathological processes of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).",,"['Xu, Guoying', 'Wen, Haiping', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Guo, Donglin', 'Zhou, Fang', 'Chen, Dongdong', 'Xie, Hongxiang', 'Wang, Ting', 'Wang, Haibo']","['Xu G', 'Wen H', 'Zhou H', 'Guo D', 'Zhou F', 'Chen D', 'Xie H', 'Wang T', 'Wang H']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory and Hematology, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110908,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (ANXA2 protein, human)', '0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 4)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Glycoprotein I)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Annexin A2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antibodies/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*metabolism', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta 2-Glycoprotein I/immunology']",2011/09/09 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/09/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['11-04-0229 [pii]', '10.1160/TH11-04-0229 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2011 Dec;106(6):1158-69. doi: 10.1160/TH11-04-0229.

Here, we show that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), c-Myc directly controls the expression of EZH2, a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, and miR-26a. miR-26a is downregulated in primary blasts from AML patients and, during myeloid differentiation of AML cells, is induced together with a decrease in c-Myc and Ezh2 levels. Previously, EZH2 was shown to be regulated by miR-26a at the translational levels in lymphomas. However, we demonstrate that in AML, the variation of EZH2 mainly depends on c-Myc transcriptional control. We also show that enforced expression of miR-26a in AML cells is able to inhibit cell cycle progression by downregulating cyclin E2 expression. In addition, increased levels of miR-26a potentiate the antiproliferative effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VitD) and stimulate myeloid differentiation.

Chemical inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 block mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1)-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and prevent apoptosis. Mechanistically, proapoptotic tumor suppressor WOX1 (also named WWOX or FOR) physically interacts with MEK1, in part, in the lysosomes in Jurkat cells. PMA induces the dissociation, which leads to relocation of MEK1 to lipid rafts and WOX1 to the mitochondria for causing apoptosis. U0126 inhibits PMA-induced dissociation of WOX1/MEK1 complex and supports survival of Jurkat cells. In contrast, less differentiated Molt-4 T cells are resistant to PMA-induced dissociation of the WOX1/MEK1 complex and thereby are refractory to apoptosis.

However, evidence of the relevance of PML NB modification for viral pathogenesis is limited and little is known about viral gene functions required for PML NB disruption in infected cells in vivo. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human alphaherpesvirus that causes cutaneous lesions during primary and recurrent infection. Here we show that VZV disrupts PML NBs in infected cells in human skin xenografts in SCID mice and that the disruption is achieved by open reading frame 61 (ORF61) protein via its SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). Three conserved SIMs mediated ORF61 binding to SUMO1 and were required for ORF61 association with and disruption of PML NBs. Mutation of the ORF61 SIMs in the VZV genome showed that these motifs were necessary for PML NB dispersal in VZV-infected cells in vitro. In vivo, PML NBs were highly abundant, especially in basal layer cells of uninfected skin, whereas their frequency was significantly decreased in VZV-infected cells. In contrast, mutation of the ORF61 SIMs reduced ORF61 association with PML NBs, most PML NBs remained intact and importantly, viral replication in skin was severely impaired. The ORF61 SIM mutant virus failed to cause the typical VZV lesions that penetrate across the basement membrane into the dermis and viral spread in the epidermis was limited. These experiments indicate that VZV pathogenesis in skin depends upon the ORF61-mediated disruption of PML NBs and that the ORF61 SUMO-binding function is necessary for this effect. More broadly, our study elucidates the importance of PML NBs for the innate control of a viral pathogen during infection of differentiated cells within their tissue microenvironment in vivo and the requirement for a viral protein with SUMO-binding capacity to counteract this intrinsic barrier.",,"['Wang, Li', 'Oliver, Stefan L', 'Sommer, Marvin', 'Rajamani, Jaya', 'Reichelt, Mike', 'Arvin, Ann M']","['Wang L', 'Oliver SL', 'Sommer M', 'Rajamani J', 'Reichelt M', 'Arvin AM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America. vlwang00@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110825,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '106121-63-5 (protein 61, Varicella-zoster virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/virology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Animal', 'Mutagenesis', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Skin/*virology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2011/09/09 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002157 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-11-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Aug;7(8):e1002157. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002157.

Retroviral vectors containing four different long terminal repeats (LTRs) (each from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), murine stem cell virus (MSCV), myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) and spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV)) were compared using the well-known CE vector having the EF1alpha internal promoter as a control. The MS vector containing MSCV LTR produced a higher viral titer and a higher level of gene expression than other vectors including CE. The MS vector drove the gene expression in cultured neural stem cells for 3 weeks. Furthermore, the MS vector could efficiently deliver the gene to the mouse central nervous system, as transgene expression was found in various regions of the brains and spinal cords as well as in all major neural cell types.

Infection with this virus often leads to fatal outcomes and, so far, no cure is available for this disease. Synthetic peptides with structures mimicking the transmembrane protein of the viral surface proteins hold the potential to effectively interfere with viral entry by hampering the fusion of viral and host cell membranes and constitute a novel approach for the treatment of infections with retroviruses. We identified and synthetically produced 11 FeLV peptides and evaluated their potential to block FeLV infection in vitro. METHODS: Cell cultures were exposed to FeLV subgroup A prior to the addition of the peptides. The inhibitory effect of the peptides was assessed by measuring FeLV gag protein in the supernatant of peptide versus mock-treated cell cultures using an ELISA. RESULTS: A peptide (EPK364) of 37 amino acids in length, with sequence homology to the HIV fusion inhibitor T-20, significantly suppressed viral replication by 88%, whereas no effects were found for shorter peptides. Two structurally modified variants of EPK364 also inhibited viral replication by up to 58% (EPK397) and 27% (EPK398). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the identification of synthetic FeLV peptides that have the potential for a curative short-term therapy of viraemic cats. In addition, these peptides might become an important tool in xenotransplantation, where endogenous gammaretroviruses of the donor species might be able to infect the host.",['(c) 2011 International Medical Press'],"['Boenzli, Eva', 'Robert-Tissot, Celine', 'Sabatino, Giuseppina', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Meli, Marina Luisa', 'Gutte, Bernd', 'Rovero, Paolo', 'Flynn, Norman', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Boenzli E', 'Robert-Tissot C', 'Sabatino G', 'Cattori V', 'Meli ML', 'Gutte B', 'Rovero P', 'Flynn N', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Lutz H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. eboenzli@vetclinics.uzh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Antivir Ther,Antiviral therapy,9815705,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cats', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Solubility', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2011/09/09 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2011/09/09 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3851/IMP1850 [doi]'],ppublish,Antivir Ther. 2011;16(6):905-13. doi: 10.3851/IMP1850.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the findings of a plasma metabolomic investigation of HCC patients by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS), random forests machine learning algorithm, and multivariate data analysis. Control subjects included healthy individuals as well as patients with liver cirrhosis or acute myeloid leukemia. We found that HCC was associated with increased plasma levels of glycodeoxycholate, deoxycholate 3-sulfate, and bilirubin. Accurate mass measurement also indicated upregulation of biliverdin and the fetal bile acids 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochol-4-en-24-oic acid and 3-oxochol-4,6-dien-24-oic acid in HCC patients. A quantitative lipid profiling of patient plasma was also conducted by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-TQMS). By this method, we found that HCC was also associated with reduced levels of lysophosphocholines and in 4 of 20 patients with increased levels of lysophosphatidic acid [LPA(16:0)], where it correlated with plasma alpha-fetoprotein levels. Interestingly, when fatty acids were quantitatively profiled by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we found that lignoceric acid (24:0) and nervonic acid (24:1) were virtually absent from HCC plasma.

This article addresses the long-term benefits and risks associated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy in both settings. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials recently reported long-term outcomes regarding the risk of second malignancies and overall survival. Based on these studies, the risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with known carcinogenic agents, such as chemotherapy, could not be distinguished from any risk associated with growth factor support. However, the enhanced delivery of chemotherapy dose intensity enabled by the use of G-CSF in these studies was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. Although some reduction in treatment-related mortality with G-CSF support may occur, the observed improvement in long-term survival likely relates to better disease control with more-intense G-CSF-supported chemotherapy. Myeloid growth factors have also been shown to benefit patients with severe chronic neutropenia. Almost all patients with cyclic, congenital, or idiopathic neutropenia experience response to G-CSFs. Treatment is titrated to determine a dose that provides a safe elevation in neutrophil counts. Reports have shown that patients can be maintained for years at the same dose after adjusting for growth and development.

Elevated levels of MEIS1 accelerate development of HOX- and MLL-induced leukemias, and this pro-tumorigenic property has been associated with transcriptional activity of MEIS1. In contrast, reduction of PKNOX1 levels has been linked with cancer development despite the absence of an identifiable transactivating domain. In this report, we show that a chimeric protein generated by fusion of the MEIS1 C-terminal region encompassing the transactivating domain with the full-length PKNOX1 (PKNOX1-MC) acquired the ability to accelerate the onset of Hoxa9-induced leukemia in the mouse bone marrow transduction/transplantation model. Gene expression profiling of primary bone marrow cells transduced with Hoxa9 plus Meis1, or Hoxa9 plus Pknox1-MC revealed perturbations in overlapping functional gene subsets implicated in DNA packaging, chromosome organization, and in cell cycle regulation. Together, results presented in this report suggest that the C-terminal domain of MEIS1 confers to PKNOX1 an ectopic transactivating function that promotes leukemogenesis by regulating expression of genes involved in chromatin accessibility and cell cycle progression.",,"['Bisaillon, Richard', 'Wilhelm, Brian T', 'Krosl, Jana', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Bisaillon R', 'Wilhelm BT', 'Krosl J', 'Sauvageau G']","['University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110907,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2011/09/09 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/09/09 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40983-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-354076 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Oct 27;118(17):4682-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-354076.

Transformation results in the generation of a persistent (> 14 years) preleukemic clone, which postnatally converts to ALL after the acquisition of necessary secondary genetic alterations. Many cancer cells show some expression of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) gene, although the ""functionality"" of any EPOR complexes and their relevant signaling pathways in nonerythroid cells has not been validated. EPOR mRNA is selectively and ectopically expressed in ETV6-RUNX1(+) ALL, but the presence of a functional EPOR on the cell surface and its role in leukemogenesis driven by ETV6-RUNX1 remains to be identified. Here, we show that ETV6-RUNX1 directly binds the EPOR promoter and that expression of ETV6-RUNX1 alone in normal pre-B cells is sufficient to activate EPOR transcription. We further reveal that murine and human ETV6-RUNX1(+) cells expressing EPOR mRNA have EPO ligand binding activity that correlates with an increased cell survival through activation of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway and up-regulation of antiapoptotic BCL-XL. These data support the contention that ETV6-RUNX1 directly activates ectopic expression of a functional EPOR and provides cell survival signals that may contribute critically to persistence of covert premalignant clones in children.",,"['Torrano, Veronica', 'Procter, Julia', 'Cardus, Penny', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Ford, Anthony M']","['Torrano V', 'Procter J', 'Cardus P', 'Greaves M', 'Ford AM']","['Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110907,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2011/09/09 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/09/09 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)57511-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-354266 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 3;118(18):4910-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-354266.

TL is known to interact with CD8alphaalpha-expressing cells, which are abundant in the intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment. In this report, we provide evidence indicating that expression of TL by IEC modulates the cytokine profile of CD4(+) T cells favoring IL-17 production. We show in an adoptive transfer model of colitis that donor-derived cells become more pathogenic when TL is expressed on IEC in recipient animals. Moreover, TL(+)IEC promote development of IL-17-mediated responses capable of protecting mice from Citrobacter rodentium infection.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization with a panel of probes coupled with long distance inverse-PCR was used to identify chromosomal rearrangements involving the MLL gene. Between 1995 and 2010, 27 patients with an acute leukemia were found to have a fusion gene involving MLL. All seven ALL patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were characterized by the MLL/AFF1 fusion gene resulting from a translocation (5 patients) or an insertion (2 patients). In the 19 AML patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, 31.6% of all characterized MLL fusion genes were MLL/MLLT3, 21.1% MLL/ELL, 10.5% MLL/MLLT6 and 10.5% MLL/EPS15. Two patients had rare or undescribed fusion genes, MLL/KIAA0284 and MLL/FLNA. Seven patients (26%) had a complex chromosomal rearrangement (three-way translocations, insertions, deletions) involving the MLL gene. Splicing fusion genes were found in three patients, leading to a MLL/EPS15 fusion in two and a MLL/ELL fusion in a third patient. This study showed that fusion involving the MLL gene can be generated through various chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, insertions and deletions, some being complex or cryptic. A systematic approach should be used in all cases of acute leukemia starting with FISH analyses using a commercially available MLL split signal probe. Then, the analysis has to be completed, if necessary, by further molecular cytogenetic and genomic PCR methods.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

High IGFBP2 was associated with a high incidence of primary resistant disease (IGFBP2 high 65%, IGFBP2 low 32%; P=0.02) and was independently predictive for therapy resistance [OR 3.6 (95% CI 1.2-11); P=0.02] in multivariate analyses. Gene-expression profiling revealed an up-regulation of genes implicated in leukemogenesis (MYB, MEIS1, HOXB3, HOXA9) and genes associated with adverse outcome (ERG, WT1) in patients with high IGFBP2 expression.

Whether or not some of these signals are also involved in tumor maintenance by counteracting constitutive death signals is much less understood. To address this, we investigated what role anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, key regulators of cancer cell survival, might play in the viability of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. METHODS: We used cell lines as an in vitro model of HER2-overexpressing cells in order to evaluate how anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, and pro-apoptotic Puma and Bim impact on their survival, and to investigate how the constitutive expression of these proteins is regulated. Expression of the proteins of interest was confirmed using lysates from HER2-overexpressing tumors and through analysis of publicly available RNA expression data. RESULTS: We show that the depletion of Mcl-1 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. This Mcl-1 dependence is due to Bim expression and it directly results from oncogenic signaling, as depletion of the oncoprotein c-Myc, which occupies regions of the Bim promoter as evaluated in ChIP assays, decreases Bim levels and mitigates Mcl-1 dependence. Consistently, a reduction of c-Myc expression by inhibition of mTORC1 activity abrogates occupancy of the Bim promoter by c-Myc, decreases Bim expression and promotes tolerance to Mcl-1 depletion.

Activation of Notch signaling has been implicated in several types of cancer, particularly T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Consequently, several transgenic mouse strains have been made to study the role of Notch1 in T-ALL. However, the existing Notch1 transgenic lines mimic a translocation event found in only approximately 1% of T-ALL cases. Here we describe three novel NOTCH1 transgenic mouse strains that have Cre-inducible expression of the entire human NOTCH1 locus, each possessing a common mutation found in T-ALL. Unlike existing Notch1 transgenic strains, these NOTCH1 transgenic strains express full-length receptors from an endogenous human promoter that should be susceptible to a number of Notch antagonists that have recently been developed. These strains will allow researchers to modulate Notch signaling to study both normal development and cancer biology.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Berquam-Vrieze, Katherine E', 'Swing, Deborah A', 'Tessarollo, Lino', 'Dupuy, Adam J']","['Berquam-Vrieze KE', 'Swing DA', 'Tessarollo L', 'Dupuy AJ']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120106,United States,Genesis,"Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)",100931242,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/09/08 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvg.20798 [doi]'],ppublish,Genesis. 2012 Feb;50(2):112-8. doi: 10.1002/dvg.20798.

However, a broad picture of CTA expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is missing. CTA expression was analyzed in normal bone marrow (BM) as well as in AML cell lines before and after treatment with demethylating agents and/or histone acetylase inhibitors. Presence of selected CTA with a strictly tumor-restricted expression was then determined in samples of patients with AML before and after demethylating therapy. Screening AML cell lines for the expression of 20 CTA, we identified six genes (MAGE-A3, PRAME, ROPN1, SCP-1, SLLP1, and SPO11) with an AML-restricted expression. Analyzing the expression of these CTA in blast-containing samples from AML patients (N = 64), we found all samples to be negative for MAGE-A3 and SPO11 while a minority of patients expressed ROPN1 (1.6%), SCP-1 (3.1%), or SLLP1 (9.4%). The only CTA expressed in substantial proportion of patients (53.1%) was PRAME. Following demethylating treatment with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, we observed an increased or de novo expression of CTA, in particular of SSX-2, in AML cell lines. In AML patients, we detected increased expression of PRAME and induction of SSX-2 after demethylating therapy with 5-azacytidine. With the exception of PRAME, CTA are mostly absent from AML blasts. However, demethylating treatment induces strong expression of CTA, particularly of SSX-2, in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that CTA-specific immunotherapy for AML should preferentially target PRAME and/or should be combined with the application of demethylating agents opening the perspective for alternative targets like CTA SSX-2.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Atanackovic, Djordje', 'Luetkens, Tim', 'Kloth, Benjamin', 'Fuchs, Gregor', 'Cao, Yanran', 'Hildebrandt, York', 'Meyer, Sabrina', 'Bartels, Katrin', 'Reinhard, Henrike', 'Lajmi, Nesrine', 'Hegewisch-Becker, Susanna', 'Schilling, Georgia', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Schroeder, Thomas', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Atanackovic D', 'Luetkens T', 'Kloth B', 'Fuchs G', 'Cao Y', 'Hildebrandt Y', 'Meyer S', 'Bartels K', 'Reinhard H', 'Lajmi N', 'Hegewisch-Becker S', 'Schilling G', 'Platzbecker U', 'Kobbe G', 'Schroeder T', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Kroger N']","['Center of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine II, Oncology/Hematology/Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Germany.

Although chemotherapeutic treatment produced high rates of complete response in approximately 70%-80% of newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, the onset of resistance and clinical relapse is rapid. Therefore, the efficacy of treatment in Ph+ ALL is still to be determined. In this study, we aimed to assess the antileukemic activity of rapamycin (RAPA) (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, MO, USA), a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, alone and in combination with daunorubicin (DNR) (Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Germany) in a Ph+ acute lymphoblastic cell line SUP-B15 and a primary Ph+ ALL sample in vitro. Here, we demonstrated that 50 nmol/L of RAPA significantly intensified the inhibition induced by DNR on both Ph+ ALL cell line and a primary Ph+ ALL sample. Notably, we reported that the consequence of DNR treatment induced the over expression of the components of mammalian target of rapamycin signalling pathway, whereas RAPA effectively eliminated this deleterious side effect of DNR, which might enhance DNR's ability to kill drug-resistant cancer. The synergistic effect was also associated with the increase in autophagy, blockage of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. Altogether, our results suggest that DNR in combination with RAPA is more effective in the treatment of Ph+ ALL compared with DNR alone.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Yang, Xi', 'Lin, Juan', 'Gong, Yuping', 'Ma, Hongbing', 'Shuai, Xiao', 'Zhou, Ruiqing', 'Guo, Yong', 'Shan, Qingqing', 'He, Guangcui']","['Yang X', 'Lin J', 'Gong Y', 'Ma H', 'Shuai X', 'Zhou R', 'Guo Y', 'Shan Q', 'He G']","['Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110904,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/physiology', 'Phagosomes/ultrastructure', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/analysis/physiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2011/09/08 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.1013 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Sep;30(3):123-30. doi: 10.1002/hon.1013.

CCL2 blocked the constitutive apoptosis of normal neutrophils through CCR2. CCL2 also induced elevation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration but had no effect on normal neutrophil chemotaxis. Constitutive apoptosis, calcium influx, and cell migration of asthmatic neutrophils were not affected by CCL2 stimulation. Supernatant collected from CCL2-treated normal neutrophils inhibited the constitutive apoptosis of normal neutrophils. Anti-apoptotic signaling mediated by CCL2 was found to be associated with the PI3K/Akt/ERK/NF-kappaB cascade in normal neutrophils. Both the cleavage of procaspase 3 and procaspase 9 and the decrease of in Mcl-1 expression were delayed by CCL2 stimulation. Inhibition of NF-kappaB blocked constitutive apoptosis of neutrophils from asthmatic patients via inhibition of the cleavage of procaspase 3 and procaspase 9, in contrast to normal neutrophils. NF-kappaB was involved in CCL2-induced anti-apoptotic signaling in normal neutrophils, whereas NF-kappaB functioned as a basal pro-apoptotic factor in asthmatic neutrophils.

The direct target of this structurally and functionally unique agent is unknown and that of the parent natural product, gambogic acid (GA), presently in clinical trials, is not yet entirely clear. For the first time, using fluorescently labeled GA (GA-Bodipy), we determined that GA-Bodipy localized in mitochondria and was effectively displaced by cluvenone in competition experiments indicating that the direct target of cluvenone resided in mitochondria and was shared by GA. In agreement with these findings, treatment of HeLa cells with cluvenone or GA resulted in disruption of mitochondrial morphology within 4 h. Furthermore, experiments using the potential sensitive JC-1 dye demonstrated that cells treated with 1 muM cluvenone for 1 h had significant loss of MMP compared to control cells. Examination of Cyt c levels in leukemia cells treated with 1 muM cluvenone resulted in a 4-fold increase in levels of both cytosolic and mitochondrial Cyt c. In agreement with Cyt c release, caspase 9 activity was increased 2.6-fold after treatment of cells for 5 h with 1 muM cluvenone. Remarkably, the caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK, blocked cluvenone-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner with apoptosis being completely blocked by 10 muM of the inhibitor. In conclusion, cluvenone, an agent with potent cytotoxicity against multi-drug resistant tumor cells, has direct targets in mitochondria thus setting precedence for drug discovery efforts against these targets in the treatment of refractory cancers.",,"['Guizzunti, Gianni', 'Theodorakis, Emmanuel A', 'Yu, Alice L', 'Zurzolo, Chiara', 'Batova, Ayse']","['Guizzunti G', 'Theodorakis EA', 'Yu AL', 'Zurzolo C', 'Batova A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Infection, Membrane Traffic and Pathogenesis Unit, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110907,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Xanthones)', '0 (cluvenone)', '8N585K83U2 (gambogic acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology']",2011/09/08 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9745-y [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Oct;30(5):1841-8. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9745-y.

We recently showed that a predominant T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain was associated with vaccine-induced complete remission in an AML patient (patient 1). In this study, we address the question of whether this predominant clone or the accompanying Vbeta11 restriction could be found in other AML patients vaccinated with the same WT1 peptide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For assessment of Vbeta usage, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from four vaccinated patients were divided into specific and non-specific by epitope-specific enrichment. Vbeta families were quantified in both fractions using reverse transcribed quantitative PCR. Vbeta11-positive 'complementary determining region 3' (CDR3) sequences were amplified from these samples, from bone marrow samples of 17 other vaccination patients, and from peripheral blood of six healthy controls, cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: We observed a clear bias towards Vbeta11 usage of the WT1-specific CTL populations in all four patients. The predominant CDR3beta amino acid (AA) sequence of patient 1 was detected in two other patients. CDR3beta loops with closely related AA sequences were only found in patient 1. There were no CDR3beta AA sequences with side chains of identical chemical properties detected in any patient. CONCLUSION: We provide the first data addressing TCR Vbeta chain usage in WT1-specific T-cell populations after HLA A*0201-restricted single peptide vaccination. We demonstrate both shared Vbeta restriction and the sharing of a TCR beta transcript with proven clinical impact in one patient.",,"['Ochsenreither, Sebastian', 'Fusi, Alberto', 'Geikowski, Anne', 'Stather, David', 'Busse, Antonia', 'Stroux, Andrea', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Keilholz, Ulrich']","['Ochsenreither S', 'Fusi A', 'Geikowski A', 'Stather D', 'Busse A', 'Stroux A', 'Letsch A', 'Keilholz U']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110907,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Subunit/administration & dosage/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2011/09/08 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1099-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2012 Mar;61(3):313-22. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1099-y.

Stereotyped HCDR3 sequences were found in 357 cases (31.7%), 231 of which (64.7%) were unmutated. In addition to the previously described subsets, 31 new putative stereotypes subsets were identified. Significant associations between different stereotyped HCDR3 sequences and molecular prognostic factors, such as CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, IGHV mutational status and genomic abnormalities were found. In particular, deletion of 17p13 was significantly represented in stereotype subset #1. Notably, subset #1 was significantly correlated with a substantially reduced TTFT compared to other CLL groups showing unmutated IGHV, ZAP-70 or CD38 positivity and unfavorable cytogenetic lesions including del(17)(p13).

Using transgenic PU.1(-/-) myeloid progenitors we show that upon macrophage differentiation, the transcription factor PU.1 induces the secondary determinant Egr2 which, in turn, directly represses miR-17-92 expression by recruiting histone demethylase Jarid1b leading to histone H3 lysine K4 demethylation within the CpG island at the miR-17-92 promoter.

Furthermore, restoring EGR2 levels in primary acute myeloid leukaemia blasts expressing elevated levels of miR-17-92 and low levels of PU.1 and EGR2 leads to downregulation of miR-17-92 and restored expression of its targets p21CIP1 and BIM. We propose that upon macrophage differentiation PU.1 represses the miR-17-92 cluster promoter by an Egr-2/Jarid1b-mediated H3K4 demethylation mechanism whose deregulation may contribute to leukaemic states.",,"['Pospisil, Vit', 'Vargova, Karin', 'Kokavec, Juraj', 'Rybarova, Jana', 'Savvulidi, Filipp', 'Jonasova, Anna', 'Necas, Emanuel', 'Zavadil, Jiri', 'Laslo, Peter', 'Stopka, Tomas']","['Pospisil V', 'Vargova K', 'Kokavec J', 'Rybarova J', 'Savvulidi F', 'Jonasova A', 'Necas E', 'Zavadil J', 'Laslo P', 'Stopka T']","['Institute of Pathological Physiology and Center of Experimental Hematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110906,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (EGR2 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (MIR17HG, human)', '0 (MIRN17 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM5B protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/metabolism/physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/metabolism/physiology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2011/09/08 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2011317 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2011.317 [doi]']",epublish,EMBO J. 2011 Sep 6;30(21):4450-64. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2011.317.,PMC3230374,,"['P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients that recur will perish due to low treatment efficacy, toxicity, or frailty issues. This review summarizes recent developments in clinical research and therapeutic applications for prevention and treatment of this complication of transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Several groups have demonstrated that monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) after allo-HCT is feasible and is predictive of impending hematologic recurrence. The introduction of novel antileukemia agents in the preparative regimen, maintenance of remission treatment posttransplant, and early MRD-based therapeutic interventions all have the potential to improve outcomes.

Here we demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib, which has previously been shown to mediate antiproliferative/cytotoxic off-target effects in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML blasts, reduces SFK overactivation. Erlotinib induced an arrest in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle that, in cells with constitutive SFK activation, could be recapitulated by chemical inhibition of SFKs with 3-(4-chlorophenyl)1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-alpha]pyrimidin-4-amine (PP2). Moreover, erlotinib inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR targets like p70 (SK6) , stimulated the maturation of the autophagic marker LC3 and promoted the formation of autophagosomes. Notably, PP2 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin had a similar cell cycle-arresting activity to erlotinib, but neither of these compounds alone induced significant levels of cell death. Altogether, these results suggest that the therapeutic off-target effect of erlotinib may be linked to, yet cannot be entirely explained by, the inhibition of oncogenic signaling via SFKs and mTOR. Thus, combination therapies with erlotinib and rapamycin might be beneficial for MDS and AML patients.",,"['Boehrer, Simone', 'Galluzzi, Lorenzo', 'Lainey, Elodie', 'Bouteloup, Cyrielle', 'Tailler, Maximilien', 'Harper, Francis', 'Pierron, Gerard', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Sebert, Marie', 'Gardin, Claude', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Kroemer, Guido']","['Boehrer S', 'Galluzzi L', 'Lainey E', 'Bouteloup C', 'Tailler M', 'Harper F', 'Pierron G', 'Ades L', 'Thepot S', 'Sebert M', 'Gardin C', 'de Botton S', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM U848, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110915,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-4-amine)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Stilbenes)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/09/08 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['16599 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.18.16599 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Sep 15;10(18):3168-75. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.18.16599.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE and PubMed (both 1966-May 2011), as well as the American Society of Hematology abstracts (2000-May 2011), using the primary search terms ofatumumab and HuMax-CD20. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical studies and abstracts available in the English language, describing the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical activity, and safety of ofatumumab in CLL were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ofatumumab is a human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody that binds to B-lymphocytes expressing CD-20 cell surface antigens. Ofatumumab was granted accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2009 for the treatment of CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. A Phase 1/2 trial has established the safety and tolerability of single-agent ofatumumab at an initial dose of 300 mg intravenously on week 1, followed by 2000 mg once weekly for 7 doses (weeks 2-8), followed by 2000 mg once every 4 weeks for 4 doses (weeks 9-12), for a total of 12 doses. The final analysis of a pivotal international multicenter trial has shown promising activity in patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab, demonstrating overall response rates of 44-51%, with prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Ofatumumab activity has also been shown in a variety of other malignant and nonmalignant conditions, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. The most common adverse effect is grade 1 and 2 infusion reactions. Other adverse effects include infection, neutropenia, anemia, rash, fever, and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical evidence suggests that ofatumumab is an effective agent in patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. Data are awaited comparing ofatumumab to other salvage regimens. Until results of head-to-head trials are conducted comparing ofatumumab to existing regimens, it cannot be said whether ofatumumab is more efficacious or tolerable than currently available therapies.",,"['Nightingale, Ginah']",['Nightingale G'],"['Department of Pharmacy Practice, Jefferson School of Pharmacy, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. ginah.nightingale@jefferson.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110906,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD20/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy']",2011/09/08 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1P780 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1P780 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2011 Oct;45(10):1248-55. doi: 10.1345/aph.1P780.

The gene encoding p53 frequently undergoes inactivating mutations in many human cancers, but WT p53 is often expressed at high levels in melanoma, which, as judged from the malignant nature of the disease, fails to act as an effective tumor suppressor. Here we show that p53 directly up-regulates microRNA-149* (miR-149*) that in turn targets glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha, resulting in increased expression of Mcl-1 and resistance to apoptosis in melanoma cells. Although deficiency in miR-149* undermined survival of melanoma cells and inhibited melanoma growth in a mouse xenograft model, elevated expression of miR-149* was found in fresh human metastatic melanoma isolates, which was associated with decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha and increased Mcl-1. These results reveal a p53-dependent, miR-149*-mediated pathway that contributes to survival of melanoma cells, provides a rational explanation for the ineffectiveness of p53 to suppress melanoma, and identifies the expression of miR-149* as a mechanism involved in the increased expression of Mcl-1 in melanoma cells.",,"['Jin, Lei', 'Hu, Wang Lai', 'Jiang, Chen Chen', 'Wang, Jia Xu', 'Han, Chuan Chun', 'Chu, Ping', 'Zhang, Lin Jie', 'Thorne, Rick F', 'Wilmott, James', 'Scolyer, Richard A', 'Hersey, Peter', 'Zhang, Xu Dong', 'Wu, Mian']","['Jin L', 'Hu WL', 'Jiang CC', 'Wang JX', 'Han CC', 'Chu P', 'Zhang LJ', 'Thorne RF', 'Wilmott J', 'Scolyer RA', 'Hersey P', 'Zhang XD', 'Wu M']","[""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110906,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (MIRN149 microRNA, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/09/08 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1019312108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1019312108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Sep 20;108(38):15840-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1019312108.

Here we first identify natural complexes (purified through fusion partners AF9, AF4, and ELL) with overlapping components, different elongation activities, and different cofactor associations that suggest dynamic interactions. Then, through reconstitution of defined, functionally active minimal complexes, we identify stable subcomplexes that, through newly defined protein-protein interactions, form distinct higher order complexes. These definitive analyses show, for example, that (i) through direct interactions with AF9 and cyclinT1, family members AF4 and AFF4 independently mediate association of P-TEFb with AF9, (ii) P-TEFb, through direct interactions, provides the link for association of ELL and ELL-associated factors 1 and 2 (EAF1 and EAF2) with AF4, and (iii) in the absence of other factors, DOT1 forms a stable complex with AF9 and does not interact with AF9*AF4*P-TEFb complexes.

Although XMRV is thought to use XPR1 for cell entry, it infects A549 cells that do not express XPR1, suggesting usage of other receptors or co-receptors. METHODS: To study the usage of different receptors and co- receptors that could play a role in XMRV infection of lymphoid cells and GHOST (GFP- Human osteosarcoma) cells expressing CD4 along with different chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR2, etc., were infected with XMRV. Culture supernatants and cells were tested for XMRV replication using real time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Infection and replication of XMRV was seen in a variety of GHOST cells, LNCaP, DU145, A549 and Caski cell lines. The levels of XMRV replication varied in different cell lines showing differential replication in different cell lines. However, replication in A549 which lacks XPR1 expression was relatively higher than DU145 but lower than, LNCaP.

Robust engraftment of human hematological malignancy (HHM) lines and patient cells into the naturally immunodeficient turkey embryo has recently been demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and histology. We demonstrate here that fluorescence imaging is a rapid and simple technique for detecting engraftment and homing of cells derived from HHM in turkey embryos. Raji lymphoma cells expressing a far-red fluorescent protein were injected intravascularly into turkey embryos and fluorescence was detected 8 days later in their limbs and skulls. Much stronger signals were obtained after removal of the bones from the limbs. Unlabeled Raji cells did not give a fluorescent signal. Treatment with doxorubicin dramatically reduced the fluorescent signal. Intravenously injected HL-60 leukemia cells labeled with infrared-fluorescing dye were detected in the bone marrow after 16 h. Homing was active, although some non-specific fluorescence was present. Use of fluorescence imaging of HHM in turkey embryos is therefore feasible and reduces the time, effort and expense for detecting engraftment.

The development of effective small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 has been the focus of an intensive international research effort in recent years. AREAS COVERED: The published results of the first decade of clinical trials of FLT3-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors are critically reviewed. Over this period, a first generation of compounds has followed an orderly progression from monotherapy studies through combination with chemotherapy and into advanced stage international trials in both relapsed and newly-diagnosed AML. Correlative laboratory studies performed alongside several of these studies have been highly illuminating, demonstrating close correlations between clinical activity and effective inhibition of FLT3, and highlighting potential drug resistance mechanisms. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical responses to several of the early multi-targeted agents were hindered by unfavorable pharmacokinetics and lack of potency. Newer, more potent FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib and AC220 possess the ability to achieve more sustained in vivo inhibition of FLT3 and have shown highly promising activity in early clinical studies. As these agents enter advanced stage trials, they carry the potential to make a major clinical impact in this disease. In future, FLT3 inhibitors may be effectively used in combination with other molecularly targeted agents.",,"['Knapper, Steven']",['Knapper S'],"['Cardiff University, University Hospital of Wales, Department of Haematology, Heath Park, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, UK. knappers@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110906,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/09/08 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.611802 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Oct;20(10):1377-95. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.611802.

For these purposes the cancer cells exploit normal tissue responses associated with inflammation and tissue repair. In the immediate tumor microenvironment one of the early stromal markers is cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In this study we evaluated the effect of leukemia cell lines on nemosis-induced COX-2 expression in stromal fibroblasts. We found that THP-1 cells were the most potent leukemic cells (IC50=746) to suppress COX-2 expression. The U-937 cell line exhibited similar suppressive potency (IC50=921), whereas the KG-1 cell line (IC50=3519) was the least potent to affect COX-2 expression in the stromal cells. Our study shows that human leukemic cells can actively participate in modulation of stromal inflammation via inhibition of COX-2 expression. In a co-culture model of leukemia cell lines and stromal fibroblasts, our data suggest that the tumor-stromal interactions are complexly regulated, and the straightforward association of COX-2 expression with tumor progression may require re-evaluation since some tumor cells, e.g. from hematologic malignancies, may differentially modulate inflammation and COX-2 expression.",,"['Egyudova, K', 'Siltanen, A', 'Kankuri, E', 'Bizik, J']","['Egyudova K', 'Siltanen A', 'Kankuri E', 'Bizik J']","['Cancer Reearch Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,['EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)'],IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Dermis/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Stromal Cells/enzymology/*pathology', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",2011/09/08 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2011_06_525 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2011;58(6):525-31. doi: 10.4149/neo_2011_06_525.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the larger heterochromatin condensation in central nuclear regions occasionally persisted in small mature lymphocytes of all studied patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Flow cytoflowmetry estimated expression of Bcl-2, Bax, p53 and ACE in the cells CD34+ of BM and PB from 10 AL (4 AML and 6 ALL) patients. PB and BM samples were studied before polychemotherapy (PCT) and in the course of induction treatment: on day +8, +21 (blood only), +36 - 38. Control group consisted of 4 BM donors.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 257 patients: 205 with acute leukemia - AL, 40 with lymphoproliferative diseases, 4 - with CML and 8 - others; 8 healthy bone marrow donors. The patients were admitted to Russian Hematological Research Center in 2004-2006 Follow-up median was 253 days. A total of 7800 biological samples were studied, among them about 4000 tests for HBV DNA and HCV RNA. RESULTS: Positive tests for specific markers of HBV and HCV were absent only in 78 (29.4%) patients. Positive markers of coinfection were detected in 57 (32.8%) of 174 patients with HBV infection and in 81.4% of 70 patients with HCV infection.

The association of IL-17 with tumor growth or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has become a subject of controversy. We hypothesized that serum IL-17 (sIL-17) levels during the peri-transplant period may affect alloreactive responses after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). sIL-17 levels of 95 patients with leukemia who had undergone myeloablative allogeneic SCT were measured using ELISA before conditioning and on day 0, +7, and +14 after transplantation.

Ten patients relapsed within 180 days (early relapse, 10.5%) post-transplant. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD over grade II and chronic GVHD was 55.8% and 69.0%, respectively. Analyses using repeated measures of ANOVA and mean values of sIL-17 revealed that patients relapsed within 180 days had higher sIL-17 levels, whereas no association existed between sIL-17 levels and other clinical outcomes, including acute GVHD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses also revealed that sIL-17 levels were available for the prediction of early relapse and that patients with higher sIL-17 levels at each time point had a significantly higher early relapse. Multivariate analyses and subgroup analyses with only standard disease status suggest the association of sIL-17 levels with subsequent early relapse independent of disease status at transplantation.

Each group also manages a data center where high quality databases store the study specific individual patient data. Sharing this data between study groups is not straightforward.

We propose a metadata based patient register and describe a first prototype.

The prognosis is variable, and the indications for an aggressive treatment such as polychemotherapy are currently unclear. We report a case of spontaneously remitting aleukaemic leukaemia in a newborn child and compare it with other cases in the literature. CASE REPORT: A male newborn presented diffuse, violaceous skin nodules reminiscent of the so-called ""blueberry muffin syndrome"" present since birth. Blood and marrow examinations did not show any blasts and karyotype was normal. Biopsy of a nodule established the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia type 5. The course was spontaneously favourable despite the absence of specific therapy and the boy was asymptomatic after one year of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Of the eight reported infants (including ours), three died, including two through acute transformation of the leukaemia. The prognosis seems to be highly dependent on cytogenetic features with the 11q23 rearrangement being at higher risk of acute transformation, prompting recourse to aggressive chemotherapy. Our case further illustrates the favourable prognostic value of a normal karyotype, a situation in which therapeutic abstention seems possible, and is even recommended.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In a previous study, we reported that miR-193b represses cell proliferation and regulates cyclin D1 in melanoma cells, suggesting that miR-193b could act as a tumor suppressor. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-193b also down-regulates myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in melanoma cells. MicroRNA microarray profiling revealed that miR-193b is expressed at a significantly lower level in malignant melanoma than in benign nevi. Consistent with this, Mcl-1 is detected at a higher level in malignant melanoma than in benign nevi. In a survey of melanoma samples, the level of Mcl-1 is inversely correlated with the level of miR-193b. Overexpression of miR-193b in melanoma cells represses Mcl-1 expression. Previous studies showed that Mcl-1 knockdown cells are hypersensitive to ABT-737, a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Bcl-w. Similarly, overexpression of miR-193b restores ABT-737 sensitivity to ABT-737-resistant cells. Furthermore, the effect of miR-193b on the expression of Mcl-1 seems to be mediated by direct interaction between miR-193b and seed and seedless pairing sequences in the 3' untranslated region of Mcl-1 mRNA. Thus, this study provides evidence that miR-193b directly regulates Mcl-1 and that down-regulation of miR-193b in vivo could be an early event in melanoma progression.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Suppressor of activator protein-1, regulated by interferon (SARI), is a recently identified tumor suppressor gene whose expression has been reported to be suppressed in several malignant neoplasms. However, the expression of SARI in leukemia and the underlying regulatory mechanism remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that SARI mRNA expression was low in CML patients. In vitro, BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate or siRNA specific to BCR-ABL upregulated SARI mRNA expression in human leukemia cells. In addition, JAK/STAT signaling inhibitor AG490 and RAS/MAPK signaling inhibitor PD98059 upregulated SARI mRNA expression, but PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 had no such effect. Functionally, silencing of SARI in CML-derived cell line K562 partially decreased imatinib mesylate-induced apoptosis.

Fewer than 10% of CML patients are younger than 20 years. CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome or the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. The objective of this paper is to present the monitoring of imatinib therapy in two children with CML by the BCR-ABL fusion gene expression assessment from peripheral blood with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 18 and six months follow-up of the patients included clinical examination, routine laboratory tests, bone marrow aspirate investigation including cytogenetic tests and the major BCR-ABL fusion gene expression measurement with qRT-PCR method from the peripheral blood. RESULTS: Patient No. 1 diagnosed with chronic phase CML showed excellent adherence to daily 400 mg imatinib treatment and achieved complete hematologic (CHR) and cytogenetic response (CCR) by three months and major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months, with lack of side effects due to imatinib. Patient No. 2 experienced severe hematologic toxicity, which necessitated temporary withdrawal of the drug. Transient non-compliance together with imatinib dose reduction has driven to treatment failure. In this case, mutational analysis is warranted.

Peptides are a new-generation of drug-delivery vector to increase efficacy of this therapy and avoid the resulting damage. The cytotoxic somatostatin (SST) conjugate JF-10-81 was developed by coupling camptothecin (CPT) to the N-terminus of a SST analog (JF-07-69) using an activated carbamate linker. This conjugate selectively targets somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) and also retains high binding affinity and rapid internalization as well as anti-proliferative activity towards various tumor cells. JF-10-81 was tested for its inhibitory activity against the growth of human tumors which included neuroblastoma (IMR32), pancreatic cancer (CFPAC-1), leukemia (MOLT-4), pancreatic carcinoid (BON) and prostate cancer (PC-3). Both SSTR2 mRNAs and proteins were detected in all these tumor cell lines. The conjugate displayed potent in vivo inhibitory activity, although some of the potency measured in in vitro experiments was lost. JF-10-81 was found to significantly inhibit growth of these SSTR-positive tumors, resulting in 87% tumor reduction in neuroblastoma IMR32 and 97% in leukemia MOLT-4 bearing animals, even inducing regression of CFPAC-1 tumors. SSTR-overexpressing BON tumors were unfortunately relatively CPT-insensitive in vitro, however, JF-10-81 again exhibited in vivo potency presumably by specifically increasing CPT concentrations inside the tumor cells so that the inhibition rate for JF-10-81 was 85%. Also, JF-10-81 was used to treat highly invasive PC-3 tumors where s.c. injections inhibited both tumor growth (almost 60% reduction) and tumor metastasis (over 70%). This conjugate demonstrated its broad and excellent anti-tumor activity by targeting SSTR2-specific tumor tissues, supporting that short peptides and their analogs may be applied as ideal drug-delivery carriers to improve the traditional chemotherapy.",,"['Sun, Li-Chun', 'Mackey, L Vienna', 'Luo, Jing', 'Fuselier, Joseph A', 'Coy, David H']","['Sun LC', 'Mackey LV', 'Luo J', 'Fuselier JA', 'Coy DH']","['Department of Medicine, Peptide Research Laboratories, Tulane Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112-2699, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080819,New Zealand,Clin Med Oncol,Clinical medicine.

In most cases, these IL7R mutations introduce an unpaired cysteine in the extracellular juxtamembrane-transmembrane region and promote de novo formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between mutant IL-7Ralpha subunits, thereby driving constitutive signaling via JAK1 and independently of IL-7, gammac or JAK3. IL7R mutations induce a gene expression profile partially resembling that provoked by IL-7 and are enriched in the T-ALL subgroup comprising TLX3 rearranged and HOXA deregulated cases.

However, treatment toxicity of the intensive chemo-immunotherapy often limits its use in the mostly elderly population of patients. Further, the disease eventually relapses and additional therapy options are required. Of particular interest are molecular targeted therapies that interfere with critical signal transduction pathways controlling cell growth and survival. This review will provide an update on the most recent preclinical and clinical development of signal transduction targeted therapy in CLL. RECENT FINDINGS: Small molecular kinase inhibitors have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor signaling pathway (e.g. spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors) or the downstream phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. These agents showed unique in-vitro activities by inducing apoptosis and blocking interaction of CLL cells and the protective microenvironment. They have also shown promising clinical activity in early-phase clinical studies and appear to alter lymphocyte trafficking. Inhibitors of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of antiapoptotic proteins and Cdk inhibitors are in active clinical development. Strategies modulating the CLL interaction with the microenvironment niche are emerging. Further understanding of novel signaling pathways helps to identify additional potential therapeutic targets.

Existing approaches have drawbacks, however, and there is a clinical need to develop alternatives offering improved target cell selectivity. DNA substitution by 4-thiothymidine (S(4)TdR) sensitizes cells to killing by ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. Here, we demonstrate that UVA photoactivation of DNA S(4)TdR does not generate reactive oxygen or cause direct DNA breakage and is only minimally mutagenic. In an organotypic human skin model, UVA penetration is sufficiently robust to kill S(4)TdR-photosensitized epidermal cells. We have investigated the DNA lesions responsible for toxicity. Although thymidine is the predominant UVA photoproduct of S(4)TdR in dilute solution, more complex lesions are formed when S(4)TdR-containing oligonucleotides are irradiated. One of these, a thietane/S(5)-(6-4)T:T, is structurally related to the (6-4) pyrimidine:pyrimidone [(6-4) Py:Py] photoproducts induced by UVB/C radiation. These lesions are detectable in DNA from S(4)TdR/UVA-treated cells and are excised from DNA more efficiently by keratinocytes than by leukaemia cells. UVA irradiation also induces DNA interstrand crosslinking of S(4)TdR-containing duplex oligonucleotides. Cells defective in repairing (6-4) Py:Py DNA adducts or processing DNA crosslinks are extremely sensitive to S(4)TdR/UVA indicating that these lesions contribute significantly to S(4)TdR/UVA cytotoxicity.",['(c) The Author(s) 2011.

Proviral latency, which results from transcriptional repression in vivo, represents a viral strategy to escape the host immune system and likely allows for tumor progression. Here, we discriminated two types of latency: an easily reactivable latent state of the YR2 provirus and a 'locked' latent state of the L267 provirus. The defective YR2 provirus was characterized by the presence of nuclease hypersensitive sites at the U3/R junction and in the R/U5 region of the 5'-long terminal repeat (5'-LTR), whereas the L267 provirus displayed a closed chromatin configuration at the U3/R junction. Reactivation of viral expression in YR2 cells by the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin combination was accompanied by a rapid but transient chromatin remodeling in the 5'-LTR, leading to an increased PU.1 and USF-1/USF-2 recruitment in vivo sustained by PMA/ionomycin-mediated USF phosphorylation.

BCR-ABL transforming activity is mediated by critical downstream signaling pathways that are aberrantly activated by tyrosine kinases. However, the mechanisms of BCR-ABL anti-apoptotic effects and the signaling pathways by which BCR-ABL influences apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing cells are poorly defined. In this study, we found that treatment with ABL kinase inhibitors or depletion of BCR-ABL induced the expression of RAB45 messenger RNA and protein and induced apoptosis via reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and p38 activation in CML cell lines and BCR-ABL(+) progenitor cells from CML patients. Overexpressed RAB45 induced the activation of caspases-3 and -9 and reduced the expression of Survivin, XIAP, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 in CML cells. Moreover, in colony-forming cells derived from CML-aldehyde dehydrogenase(hi)/CD34(+) cells, treatment with ABL kinase inhibitors induced RAB45 expression and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in inhibited colony formation of Bcr-Abl(+) progenitor cells. The overexpression of RAB45 significantly decreased colony numbers and induced apoptosis through the activation of caspases-3 and -9. Furthermore, the overexpression of RAB45 increased the phosphorylation levels of p38, resulting in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of CML progenitor cells.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed data from SNP 6.0 arrays to define the anatomy of various 13q14 deletions in a cohort of 255 CLL patients and have correlated two subsets of 13q14 deletions (type I exclusive of RB1 and type II inclusive of RB1) with patient survival. Furthermore, we measured the expression of the 13q14-resident microRNAs by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) in 242 CLL patients and subsequently assessed their prognostic significance. We sequenced all coding exons of RB1 in patients with monoallelic RB1 deletion and have sequenced the 13q14-resident miR locus in all patients. RESULTS: Large 13q14 (type II) deletions were detected in approximately 20% of all CLL patients and were associated with shortened survival. A strong association between 13q14 type II deletions and elevated genomic complexity, as measured through CLL-FISH or SNP 6.0 array profiling, was identified, suggesting that these lesions may contribute to CLL disease evolution through genomic destabilization. Sequence and copy number analysis of the RB1 gene identified a small CLL subset that is RB1 null. Finally, neither the expression levels of the 13q14-resident microRNAs nor the degree of 13q14 deletion, as measured through SNP 6.0 array-based copy number analysis, had significant prognostic importance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the clinical course of CLL is accelerated in patients with large (type II) 13q14 deletions that span the RB1 gene, therefore justifying routine identification of 13q14 subtypes in CLL management.",['(c)2011 AACR'],"['Ouillette, Peter', 'Collins, Roxane', 'Shakhan, Sajid', 'Li, Jinghui', 'Li, Cheng', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Ouillette P', 'Collins R', 'Shakhan S', 'Li J', 'Li C', 'Shedden K', 'Malek SN']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110902,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Centromere/genetics', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Telomere/genetics']",2011/09/06 06:00,2012/01/21 06:00,['2011/09/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0785 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0785 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Nov 1;17(21):6778-90. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0785.

Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) has been extensively tested against solid cancers, but less so against B-cell cancers because these cells do not generally express the coxsackie and adenoviral receptor (CAR). To determine whether other adenoviruses might have better potency, we ""mined"" the adenovirus virome of 55 serotypes for viruses that could kill B-cell cancers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifteen adenoviruses selected to represent Ad species B, C, D, E, and F were tested in vitro against cell lines and primary patient B-cell cancers for their ability to infect, replicate in, and kill these cells. Select viruses were also tested against B-cell cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: Species D adenoviruses mediated most robust killing against a range of B-cell cancer cell lines, against primary patient marginal zone lymphoma cells, and against primary patient CD138+ myeloma cells in vitro. When injected into xenografts in vivo, single treatment with select species D viruses Ad26 and Ad45 delayed lymphoma growth. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively unstudied species D adenoviruses have a unique ability to infect and replicate in B-cell cancers as compared with other adenovirus species.

In T-cells, IRF-4 expression is induced by T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking or treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)/Ionomycin, and IRF-4 is thought to be a critical factor for various functions of T-cells. To elucidate the IRF-4 functions in human adult T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected T-cells, which constitutively express IRF-4, we isolated IRF-4-binding proteins from T-cells, using a tandem affinity purification (TAP)-mass spectrometry strategy. Fourteen proteins were identified in the IRF-4-binding complex, including endogenous IRF-4 and the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family member, c-Rel. The specific association of IRF-4 with c-Rel was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, and IRF-4 was shown to enhance the c-Rel-dependent binding and activation of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) promoter region. We also demonstrated that IL-2 production was also enhanced by exogenously-expressed IRF-4 and c-Rel in the presence of P/I, in T-cells, and that the optimal IL-2 and IL-4 productions in vivo was IRF-4-dependent using IRF-4-/- mice.

Following exposure to a range of test agents, flat, single-cell preparations were produced from exponentially growing cultures by cytocentrifugation. Following staining with 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), cells were scanned by use of the MicroNuc module of Metafer 4 v 3.4.102, after modifying the classifier developed for selecting micronuclei in binucleate cells to increase its sensitivity. The image gallery of all cells was then sorted to bring aberrant cells to the top of the gallery to assess visually the numbers of cells with micronuclei, as distinct from other debris. Slide quality was shown to be paramount in obtaining accurate results from an automated scan and the data obtained compared very well with the incidence of micronuclei scored conventionally by microscopy. Compared with manual scoring the time saving is considerable, as more than 2000 images are captured in approximately 2min, with subsequent visual assessment of aberrant cells in the image gallery taking about 1-2min/slide. By scanning all aberrant cells, the system also captures additional information on necrotic, apoptotic and fragmented cells.

ATO may cause DNA damage by generating reactive oxygen intermediates. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, modulates gene and protein expression via histone-dependent or -independent pathways that may result in chromatin decondensation, cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. We investigated whether ATO and SAHA act synergistically to enhance the death of cancer cells. Our current findings showed that combined treatment with ATO and SAHA resulted in enhanced suppression of non-small-cell lung carcinoma in vitro in H1299 cells and in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. Flow cytometric analysis of annexin V+ cells showed that apoptotic cell death was significantly enhanced after combined treatment with ATO and SAHA. At the doses used, ATO did not interfere with cell cycle progression, but SAHA induced p21 expression and led to G1 arrest. A Comet assay demonstrated that ATO, but not SAHA, induced DNA strand breaks in H1299 cells; however, co-treatment with SAHA significantly increased ATO-induced DNA damage. Moreover, SAHA enhanced acetylation of histone H3 and sensitized genomic DNA to DNase I digestion. Our results suggest that SAHA may cause chromatin relaxation and increase cellular susceptibility to ATO-induced DNA damage. Combined administration of SAHA and ATO may be an effective approach to the treatment of lung cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Reactive oxygen species generation and defensive protein kinase (MEK/ERK, Akt/mTOR) modulation.",1619-29,10.1016/j.bcp.2011.08.017 [doi],"Lonidamine is a safe, clinically useful anti-tumor drug, but its efficacy is generally low when used in monotherapy. We here demonstrate that lonidamine efficaciously cooperates with the anti-leukemic agent arsenic trioxide (ATO, Trisenox) to induce apoptosis in HL-60 and other human leukemia cell lines, with low toxicity in non-tumor peripheral blood lymphocytes. Apoptosis induction by lonidamine/ATO involves mitochondrial dysfunction, as indicated by early mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and late mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation, as well as activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as indicated by Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 down-regulation, Bax translocation to mitochondria, cytochrome c and Omi/HtrA2 release to the cytosol, XIAP down-regulation, and caspase-9 and -3 cleavage/activation, with secondary (Bcl-2-inhibitable) activation of the caspase-8/Bid axis. Lonidamine stimulates reactive oxygen species production, and lonidamine/ATO toxicity is attenuated by antioxidants. Lonidamine/ATO stimulates JNK phosphorylation/activation, and apoptosis is attenuated by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. In addition, lonidamine elicits ERK and Akt/mTOR pathway activation, as indicated by increased ERK, Akt, p70S6K and rpS6 phosphorylation, and these effects are reduced by co-treatment with ATO. Importantly, co-treatment with MEK/ERK inhibitor (U0126) and PI3K/Akt (LY294002) or mTOR (rapamycin) inhibitors, instead of ATO, also potentiates lonidamine-provoked apoptosis. These results indicate that: (i) lonidamine efficacy is restrained by drug-provoked activation of MEK/ERK and Akt/mTOR defensive pathways, which therefore represent potential therapeutic targets. (ii) Co-treatment with ATO efficaciously potentiates lonidamine toxicity via defensive pathway inhibition and JNK activation. And (iii) conversely, the pro-oxidant action of lonidamine potentiates the apoptotic efficacy of ATO as an anti-leukemic agent.",['Copyright A(c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We identified 20 signature genes including CTGF, BMP-2, CXCR4 and IL7R, documented to regulate interactions in the bone marrow. We recorded remarkably similar levels of expression in three independent patient cohorts, and found distinct patterns in cytogenetically defined subgroups of pre-B ALL. The canonical pathways that were affected are involved in inter- and intra-cellular communication, regulating signaling within the microenvironment. We tested experimentally whether interaction with stromal cells conferred protection to four drugs used in current ALL therapy, and demonstrated that bone marrow stromal cells significantly influenced resistance to vincristine and cytosine arabinoside.

Feline thiamine transport protein 1 (fTHTR1) has been identified as the receptor for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) A. The goal of the present study was to develop a quantitative, TaqMan real-time PCR assay to investigate fTHTR1 mRNA expression in tissues of uninfected and FeLV-infected cats, cats of different ages, in tumor tissues and leukocyte subsets. Moreover, the receptor was molecularly characterized in different feline species. fTHTR1 mRNA expression was detected in all 30 feline tissues investigated, oral mucosa scrapings and blood. Importantly, identification of significant differences in fTHTR1 expression relied on normalization with an appropriate reference gene. The lowest levels were found in the blood, whereas high levels were measured in the oral mucosa, salivary glands and the musculature. In the blood, T lymphocytes showed significantly higher fTHTR1 mRNA expression levels than neutrophil granulocytes. In vitro activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with concanavalin A alone or followed by interleukin-2 led to a transient increase of fTHTR1 mRNA expression. In the blood, but not in the examined tissues, FeLV-infected cats tended to have lower fTHTR1 mRNA levels than uninfected cats. The fTHTR1 mRNA levels were not significantly different between tissues with lymphomas and the corresponding non-neoplastic tissues. fTHTR1 was highly conserved among different feline species (Iberian lynx, Asiatic and Indian lion, European wildcat, jaguarundi, domestic cat). In conclusion, while ubiquitous fTHTR1 mRNA expression corresponded to the broad target tissue range of FeLV, particularly high fTHTR1 levels were found at sites of virus entry and shedding. The differential susceptibility of different species to FeLV could not be attributed to variations in the fTHTR1 sequence.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Current Sanger sequencing assays to detect IDH mutations are labor intensive and not cost effective for clinical testing of low-frequency mutations. Therefore, we developed clinical assays using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis to screen for all four variants listed above, followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation. The sensitivities of the assays were 7.3% and 7.9% for the detection of IDH2 and IDH1 variants, respectively, against the background of wild-type transcripts.

Postvalidation clinical implementation of upfront HRM screening (N = 106), using a more conservative algorithm to avoid false-negative results, reduced the number of Sanger sequencing tests by 73% (IDH1) and 78% (IDH2). Of the variant calls made by HRM in postvalidation clinical samples, Sanger confirmed the presence of a variant in 62% (IDH1) and 44% (IDH2) of the samples.

Black patients were diagnosed at younger age compared to white patients (mean age at diagnosis for white versus black patients for CLL/SLL, 70 versus 67 years, P < .001; for PLL, 71 versus 61 years, P < .001). Greater proportion of black patients with SLL presented with B symptoms, extranodal primary site, and advanced disease compared to white patients (P = .003, P = .012, and P = .009 respectively). White patients with CLL/SLL had better survival rates than black patients (5-year relative survival rate 77.1% versus 63.9%, P < .01). In univariate Cox regression models, black race, male gender, age at diagnosis > 65 years, advanced stage, and B-symptoms were predictors of worse survival (P < .01) among CLL/SLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients with CLL/SLL and PLL present at younger age and black patients with CLL/SLL have worse survival than white patients. Epidemiological studies examining the biological variants of these diseases in concert with race are needed to elucidate the etiology of these disparities.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

False discovery rate (FDR) is often used to assess the confidence of peptide identifications. However, a widely accepted FDR of 1% sacrifices the sensitivity of peptide identification while improving the accuracy. This article details a machine learning approach combining retention time based support vector regressor (RT-SVR) with q value based statistical analysis to improve peptide and protein identifications with high sensitivity and accuracy. The use of confident peptide identifications as training examples and careful feature selection ensures high R values (>0.900) for all models. The application of RT-SVR model on Mascot results (p=0.10) increases the sensitivity of peptide identifications. q Value, as a function of deviation between predicted and experimental RTs (DeltaRT), is used to assess the significance of peptide identifications. We demonstrate that the peptide and protein identifications increase by up to 89.4% and 83.5%, respectively, for a specified q value of 0.01 when applying the method to proteomic analysis of the natural killer leukemia cell line (NKL).

Usually it is indicated as consolidation of salvage regimens following relpase. Here we report our experience with stem cell transplantation in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2011, we performed 40 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission or relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Median age of patients was 23.5 years. Patients received 11 autologous and 29 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from their HLA fully-matched sibling donors. Different conditioning regimens were applied. A total of 24 patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who were in first complete remission and the remainder with a second or more complete remission. RESULTS: Hematopoietic stem cell engraftment was observed in all cases. There were no deaths prior to 100 days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Acute graft versus host disease was mild to moderate in the majority of patients, whereas it was grade III in 4 patients. Chronic graft versus host disease was extensive in 2 cases. With a 4-year median follow up, the relapse rate was 25%. A total of 26 patients are alive. Five year overall survival was 65.5% and 46.8% for allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, respectively. CONCLUSION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an acceptable treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Although there is a statistical difference for overall survival between allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the choice between autologous or allogeneic transplantation needs to have reliable methods for the detection of molecular remission before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well as close, reliable follow up of patients with clinical and molecular parameters.",,"['Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Jahani, Mohammad', 'Jalali, Arash', 'Jorjani, Hoda', 'Iravani, Massoud', 'Hamidieh, Amir Ali', 'Mousavi, Asadolah', 'Bahar, Babak', 'Behfar, Maryam', 'Derakhshandeh, Roshanak', 'Rostami, Shahrbanoo']","['Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Jahani M', 'Jalali A', 'Jorjani H', 'Iravani M', 'Hamidieh AA', 'Mousavi A', 'Bahar B', 'Behfar M', 'Derakhshandeh R', 'Rostami S']","['Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. alimgh@ams.ac.ir']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*physiopathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Patient Selection', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/09/06 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['0011145/AIM.008 [pii]', '008 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2011 Sep;14(5):332-4. doi: 008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this challenge, we developed a novel electrochemical platform for ultrasensitive and selective detection of apoptotic cells in response to therapy. In order to construct the platform, a novel three-dimensional (3-D) architecture was initially fabricated after combining nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles via a layer-by-layer method. The formed architecture provided an effective matrix for annexin V with high stability and bioactivity to enhance sensitivity. On the basis of the specific recognition between annexin V and phosphatidylserine on the apoptotic cell membrane, the annexin V/3-D architecture interface showed a predominant capability for apoptotic cell capture. Moreover, a lectin-based nanoprobe was designed by noncovalent assembly of concanavalin A on CdTe quantum dots (QDs)-labeled silica nanospheres with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) as a linker. This nanoprobe incorporated both the specific carbohydrate recognition and the multilabeled QDs-based signal amplification. By coupling with the QDs-based nanoprobe and electrochemical stripping analysis, the proposed sandwich-type cytosensor showed an excellent analytical performance for the ultrasensitive detection of apoptotic cells (as low as 48 cells), revealing great potential toward the early evaluation of therapeutic effects.",['(c) 2011 American Chemical Society'],"['Zhang, Jing-Jing', 'Zheng, Ting-Ting', 'Cheng, Fang-Fang', 'Zhang, Jian-Rong', 'Zhu, Jun-Jie']","['Zhang JJ', 'Zheng TT', 'Cheng FF', 'Zhang JR', 'Zhu JJ']","[""State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Cadmium Compounds)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '30551-89-4 (polyallylamine)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'NQA0O090ZJ (Tellurium)', 'STG188WO13 (cadmium telluride)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cadmium Compounds/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Concanavalin A/chemistry', '*Electrochemical Techniques', 'Electrodes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Polyamines/chemistry', 'Quantum Dots', 'Silicon Dioxide/chemistry', 'Tellurium/chemistry']",2011/09/06 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/09/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac201804b [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2011 Oct 15;83(20):7902-9. doi: 10.1021/ac201804b.

METHODS: A total of 24 TKI resistant CML patients were screened for ABL KD mutation by semi-nested reverse transcription PCR and sequencing. The expression of BCR-ABL transcripts was quantified by Real Time Taqman assay. RESULTS: Sixteen different point mutations were detected in 14 (58.3%) of 24 TKI resistant patients. Five out of the 16 mutations were located at the four hot spots of ABL kinase domain: one at the P-loop (Q252H), one at the imatinib binding site (T315I), two at the catalytic domain (M351, Y353F) and one at the active A loop (H396P). The three mutations, viz. M244V, T315I and A380V, were the most frequent mutations and accounted for 40.9% of all resistance associated mutations. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the presence of ABL KD mutations was found to be a major cause of drug resistance.

A common insertional polymorphism in promoter of MCL1, a member of BCL2 family gene with the dual regulatory functions, has been shown to be functional in leukemia, but its association with cancer predisposition and prognosis has not been well established. We hypothesized that MCL1 promoter variants may modify risk of solid cancer. METHODS: We genotyped -190 insertional polymorphism and 3 linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-627A>C, -298G>C, and -235C>A) in 320 lung cancer patients and 362 controls, and analyzed their functional significance. RESULTS: We confirmed that these regulatory variants correlated with enhanced promoter activity and elevated expression of both mRNA and protein in solid cancer cells and tissues. We further demonstrated that heightened expression of MCL1 resulted in decreased proliferation ability of lung cancer cells. We found a reduced cancer risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25-0.88) associated with -190 insertional genotype. Stratification analysis further showed pronounced associations in nonsmokers (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.70), in females (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.07-0.74), and in the histological type of adenocarcinoma (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.62). Likewise, homologous diplotype of these polymorhpisms that positively affected gene expression was associated with reduced risk in nonsmokers (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.58). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that common variants in MCL1 promoter correlated with increased transactivation in solid cancer cells and were associated with reduced risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers, suggesting a dominant antiproliferative function of MCL1 against its antiapoptosis effect in development of solid cancer in nonsmokers.",['Copyright (c) 2011 American Cancer Society.'],"['Jiang, Yan', 'Wang, Wenjing', 'Wang, Jiucun', 'Lu, Ye', 'Chen, Yanmei', 'Jin, Li', 'Lin, Dongxin', 'He, Fuchu', 'Wang, Haijian']","['Jiang Y', 'Wang W', 'Wang J', 'Lu Y', 'Chen Y', 'Jin L', 'Lin D', 'He F', 'Wang H']","[""State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110901,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2011/09/03 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2011/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26502 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Apr 15;118(8):2085-95. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26502.

METHODS: In total, 1041 women who were diagnosed between ages 18 and 40 years responded to a retrospective survey and reported whether they received infertility counseling before cancer treatment and whether they took action to preserve fertility. Five cancer types were included: leukemia, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer. Validated QOL scales were used: the Decision Regret Score, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the brief World Health Organization QOL questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 560 women (61%) who received treatment that potentially could affect fertility were counseled by the oncology team, 45 (5%) were counseled by fertility specialists, and 36 (4%) took action to preserve fertility. Pretreatment infertility counseling by a fertility specialist and an oncologist resulted in lower regret than counseling by an oncologist alone (8.4 vs 11.0; P < .0001). The addition of fertility preservation (6.6 vs 11.0; P < .0001) also was associated with even lower regret scores than counseling by an oncologist alone. Further improvements also were observed in SWLS scores with the addition of fertility specialist counseling (23.0 vs 19.8; P = .09) or preserving fertility (24.0 vs 19.0; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Receiving specialized counseling about reproductive loss and pursuing fertility preservation is associated with less regret and greater QOL for survivors, yet few patients are exposed to this potential benefit. Women of reproductive age should have expert counseling and should be given the opportunity to make active decisions about preserving fertility.",['Copyright (c) 2011 American Cancer Society.'],"['Letourneau, Joseph M', 'Ebbel, Erin E', 'Katz, Patricia P', 'Katz, Audra', 'Ai, Wei Z', 'Chien, A Jo', 'Melisko, Michelle E', 'Cedars, Marcelle I', 'Rosen, Mitchell P']","['Letourneau JM', 'Ebbel EE', 'Katz PP', 'Katz A', 'Ai WZ', 'Chien AJ', 'Melisko ME', 'Cedars MI', 'Rosen MP']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110901,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Counseling', 'Female', '*Fertility', '*Fertility Preservation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology/*psychology', 'Patient Satisfaction', '*Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies']",2011/09/03 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/09/03 06:00'],"['2011/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26459 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Mar 15;118(6):1710-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26459.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Aplidin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in the adult. Although there have been considerable advances in the treatment of CLL over the last decade, drug resistance and immunosuppression limit the use of current therapy and warrant the development of novel agents. Here we report that Aplidin induced a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CLL patients. Interestingly, Aplidin effect was markedly higher on monocytes compared to T lymphocytes, NK cells or the malignant B-cell clone. Hence, we next evaluated Aplidin activity on nurse-like cells (NLC) which represent a cell subset differentiated from monocytes that favors leukemic cell progression through pro-survival signals. NLC were highly sensitive to Aplidin and, more importantly, their death indirectly decreased neoplasic clone viability. The mechanisms of Aplidin-induced cell death in monocytic cells involved activation of caspase-3 and subsequent PARP fragmentation, indicative of death via apoptosis. Aplidin also showed synergistic activity when combined with fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. Taken together, our results show that Aplidin affects the viability of leukemic cells in two different ways: inducing a direct effect on the malignant B-CLL clone; and indirectly, by modifying the microenvironment that allows tumor growth.",,"['Morande, Pablo E', 'Zanetti, Samanta R', 'Borge, Mercedes', 'Nannini, Paula', 'Jancic, Carolina', 'Bezares, Raimundo F', 'Bitsmans, Alicia', 'Gonzalez, Miguel', 'Rodriguez, Andrea L', 'Galmarini, Carlos M', 'Gamberale, Romina', 'Giordano, Mirta']","['Morande PE', 'Zanetti SR', 'Borge M', 'Nannini P', 'Jancic C', 'Bezares RF', 'Bitsmans A', 'Gonzalez M', 'Rodriguez AL', 'Galmarini CM', 'Gamberale R', 'Giordano M']","['Laboratory of Immunology, IIHEMA, National Academy of Medicine, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110902,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Y76ID234HW (plitidepsin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Depsipeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Peptides, Cyclic', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2011/09/03 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2011/09/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9740-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Oct;30(5):1830-40. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9740-3.

METHOD: CML cells were incubated with various concentration of Icaritin for 48 hours, the cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT and the apoptosis was assessed with Annexin V and Hoechst 33258 staining. Cell hemoglobinization was determined. Western blotting was used to evaluate the expressions of MAPK/ERK/JNK signal pathway and Jak-2/Phorpho-Stat3/Phorsph-Akt network-related protein. NOD-SCID nude mice were applied to demonstrate the anti-leukemia effect of Icaritin in vivo. RESULTS: Icaritin potently inhibited proliferation of K562 cells (IC50 was 8 microM) and primary CML cells (IC50 was 13.4 microM for CML-CP and 18 microM for CML-BC), induced CML cells apoptosis and promoted the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells with time-dependent manner. Furthermore, Icaritin was able to suppress the growth of primary CD34+ leukemia cells (CML) and Imatinib-resistant cells, and to induce apoptosis. In mouse leukemia model, Icaritin could prolong lifespan of NOD-SCID nude mice inoculated with K562 cells as effective as Imatinib without suppression of bone marrow. Icaritin could up-regulate phospho-JNK or phospho-C-Jun and down-regulate phospho-ERK, phospho-P-38, Jak-2, phospho-Stat3 and phospho-Akt expression with dose- or time-dependent manner. Icaritin had no influence both on c-Abl and phospho-c-Abl protein expression and mRNA levels of Bcr/Abl. CONCLUSION: Icaritin from Chinese herb medicine may be a potential anti-CML agent with low adverse effect. The mechanism of anti-leukemia for Icaritin is involved in the regulation of Bcr/Abl downstream signaling.

Beyond red blood cells transfusions, dysregulation of hepcidin, the key iron hormone, may play a role, but studies until now have been hampered by technical problems. Using a recently validated assay, we measured serum hepcidin in 113 patients with different MDS subtypes. Mean hepcidin levels were consistently heterogeneous across different MDS subtypes, with the lowest levels in refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, 1.43 nM) and the highest in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB, 11.3 nM) or in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML, 10.04 nM) (P = 0.003 by ANOVA). MDS subtypes remained significant predictors of hepcidin in multivariate analyses adjusted for ferritin and transfusion history.

In the present work, we carried out a preliminary screening of six natural compounds, xanthone V(1) (1); 2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone (2); physcion (3); bisvismiaquinone (4); vismiaquinone (5); 1,8-dihydroxy-3-geranyloxy-6-methylanthraquinone (6) against MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic and CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and their multidrug-resistant subline, CEM/ADR5000. Compounds 1 and 2 were then tested in several other cancer cells and their possible mode of action were investigated. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: The tested compounds were previously isolated from the Cameroonian medicinal plants Vismia laurentii (1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and Newbouldia laevis (2). The preliminary cytotoxicity results allowed the selection of xanthone V(1) and 2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone, which were then tested on a panel of cancer cell lines. The study was also extended to the analysis of cell cycle distribution, apoptosis induction, caspase 3/7 activation and the anti-angiogenic properties of xanthone V(1) and 2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone. IC(50) values around or below 4 microg/ml were obtained on 64.29% and 78.57% of the tested cancer cell lines for xanthone V(1) and 2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone, respectively. The most sensitive cell lines (IC(50)<1 microg/ml) were breast MCF-7 (to xanthone V(1)), cervix HeLa and Caski (to xanthone V(1) and 2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone), leukemia PF-382 and melanoma colo-38 (to 2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone). The two compounds showed respectively, 65.8% and 59.6% inhibition of the growth of blood capillaries on the chorioallantoic membrane of quail eggs in the anti-angiogenic assay. Upon treatment with two fold IC(50) and after 72 h, the two compounds induced cell cycle arrest in S-phase, and also significant apoptosis in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. Caspase 3/7 was activated by xanthone V(1). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The overall results of the present study provided evidence for the cytotoxicity of compounds xanthone V(1) and 2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone, and bring supportive data for future investigations that will lead to their use in cancer therapy.",,"['Kuete, Victor', 'Wabo, Hippolyte K', 'Eyong, Kenneth O', 'Feussi, Michel T', 'Wiench, Benjamin', 'Krusche, Benjamin', 'Tane, Pierre', 'Folefoc, Gabriel N', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Wabo HK', 'Eyong KO', 'Feussi MT', 'Wiench B', 'Krusche B', 'Tane P', 'Folefoc GN', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110819,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Products/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cameroon', 'Capillaries/drug effects/growth & development', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Quail']",2011/09/03 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/09/03 06:00'],"['2011/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0021762 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-05322 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e21762. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021762.

She was initially admitted with sepsis without an obvious cause but with a differential diagnosis of a haematological malignancy. Her admission blood tests showed a mildly reduced white cell count and low platelets. Her symptoms progressed and she developed right upper quadrant pain. Her blood counts deteriorated showing a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) picture and mildly deranged liver function tests. Blood films were non-diagnostic. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed splenomegaly and also hepatomegaly and ascites, not seen in her initial ultrasound scan. Multiple cultures of blood/urine/ascites and infective serology were unremarkable.She was transferred to a larger tertiary centre under the care of the surgeons with presumed abdominal sepsis and underwent an open laparotomy, which showed a big firm liver and spleen but no obvious cause for sepsis. The infectious disease team were unable to find a cause, and haematology became involved to investigate the possibility of a haematological malignancy. The patient underwent two bone marrow biopsies, a percutaneous liver biopsy and had flow cytometry of her ascitic fluid, which revealed the diagnosis of a natural killer cell leukaemia. After some slight improvement on steroids, the patient was given cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, rituximab (CHOP-R) chemotherapy. The patient had an initial response to chemotherapy, with reduction in ascitic volume and hepatosplenomegaly, and normalisation of her coagulation. This was accompanied by an overall improvement in her physical condition. She had a second cycle of CHOP-R, but unfortunately approximately 2 weeks after that, she deteriorated rapidly. She was too weak for salvage chemotherapy, so she was put on comfort care.

Although the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis has an unquestionably important role in the retention of HSPCs in bone marrow (BM), new evidence shows that, in addition to SDF-1, the migration of HSPCs is directed by gradients of the bioactive lipids sphingosine-1 phosphate and ceramide-1 phosphate. Furthermore, the SDF-1 gradient may be positively primed/modulated by cationic peptides (C3a anaphylatoxin and cathelicidin) and, as previously demonstrated, HSPCs respond robustly even to very low SDF-1 gradients in the presence of priming factors. In this review, we discuss the role of bioactive lipids in stem cell trafficking and the consequences of HSPC priming by cationic peptides.

However, here we report that in longer term experiments, both drugs paradoxically increase the cytotoxicity of all three currently licensed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. This effect is due to release of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with changes in mitochondrial calcium and alterations in mitochondrial membrane permeability, resulting in caspase-mediated apoptosis. The effect is confined to BCR-ABL-positive cells, and is greater in primary cells than in cell lines. Furthermore, in primary cells at original diagnosis, the effect is only seen in samples from patients destined to become complete cytogenetic responders to imatinib. These results indicate that calcium release from the ER, here induced by amantadine or prazosin, may prime BCR-ABL-positive cells to TKI-induced apoptosis.

At a median of 169 days after HSCT, 20/59 prospectively screened patients experienced a decrease of CD34(+) donor chimerism to <80% and received four azacitidine cycles (75 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days) while in complete hematologic remission. A total of 16 patients (80%) responded with either increasing CD34(+) donor chimerism to >/=80% (n=10; 50%) or stabilization (n=6; 30%) in the absence of relapse. Stabilized patients and those with a later drop of CD34(+) donor chimerism to <80% after initial response were eligible for subsequent azacitidine cycles. A total of 11 patients (55%) received a median of 4 (range, 1-11) additional cycles. Eventually, hematologic relapse occurred in 13 patients (65%), but was delayed until a median of 231 days (range, 56-558) after initial decrease of CD34(+) donor chimerism to <80%.

HSC self-renewal is regulated by both intrinsic mechanisms and extrinsic signals mediated via specialized microenvironments or 'niches' wherein HSCs reside. HSCs have been shown to reside in close association with bone marrow (BM) osteoblasts in the endosteal niche and also in proximity to BM sinusoidal vessels. An unresolved question surrounds whether the endosteal and vascular niches provide synchronous or redundant regulation of HSC fate or whether these niches provide wholly unique regulatory functions. Furthermore, while some aspects of the mechanisms through which osteoblasts regulate HSC fate have been defined, the mechanisms through which the vascular niche regulates HSC fate remain obscure. Here, we summarize the anatomic and functional basis supporting the concept of an HSC vascular niche as well as the precise function of endothelial cells, perivascular cells and stromal cells within the niche in regulating HSC fate.

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients visiting a Veterans Affairs Medical Center over the last 10 years with a diagnosis of leukocytosis or myeloproliferative disorder. Of this group, fifty-seven patients from 1999 to 2008 were identified with CIN. Clinical and laboratory parameters were examined to identify CIN and establish its course. Eighty-one patients who presented from 2005 to 2010 with myeloproliferative disorders were also studied at time of diagnosis to determine any possible confusion with CIN. RESULTS: The patients with CIN were followed for a mean of >/= 7.3 years without progression to other serious disorders. Compared to non-CIN patients evaluated for neutrophilia, in multiple logistic regression analyses, smoking (P = .001) and increased BMI (P = .004) were significantly associated with CIN. No CIN patient developed a clinically apparent myeloproliferative disorder other than chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Of the patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms reviewed at the time of their initial diagnosis, only CML occasionally presented with a picture consistent with CIN. For nonsmokers, the BMI of CIN patients was significantly higher than the average VA population (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking and obesity are confirmed as factors associated with CIN and may be causative. CIN is unlikely to develop into a clinically recognizable myeloproliferative neoplasm other than CML.

However, only high doses of I3C were shown to inhibit cell proliferation (IC(50) = 200-300 mumol/L). Our goal here was to develop a more potent antitumor agent by modifying the structure of I3C. We created I3C derivatives and found that (3-chloroacetyl)-indole (3CAI) more strongly inhibited colon cancer cell growth than I3C. In addition, by screening 85 kinases in a competitive kinase assay, we found that 3CAI was a specific AKT inhibitor. AKT is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in promoting transformation and chemoresistance by inducing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, AKT is regarded as a critical target for cancer therapy. 3ICA, a derivative of I3C, is a potent and specific AKT inhibitor. This compound showed significant inhibition of AKT in an in vitro kinase assay and suppressed expression of AKT direct downstream targets such as mTOR and GSK3beta as well as induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 8 consecutive anti-HCV/HCV RNA-positive patients with onco-haematological diseases (5 with B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and 3 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) were observed during chemotherapy and after its discontinuation. All were naive to chemotherapy. HCV RNA was sought by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction in Light Cycler 1.5 in plasma and PBMC samples collected before, during and after chemotherapy. RESULTS: An increase in HCV RNA of at least 1.5 log IU/mL in plasma and 1.1 log IU/ml in PBMC was observed in all 7 patients undergoing Rituximab-based chemotherapy; these patients showed a hepatic flare after discontinuation, life-threatening in one with cirrhosis. Also the 8th patient had cirrhosis, but was treated with Rituximab-sparing chemotherapy and did not show any increase in HCV RNA or a hepatic flare. CONCLUSION: Rituximab-based chemotherapy favours an increase in HCV RNA in onco-haematological patients; this is followed by a hepatic flare, possibly immune-mediated and life threatening in cirrhotic patients.",['Copyright (c) 2011.

We show a converse role for AKT/FOXOs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Rather than decreased FOXO activity, we observed that FOXOs are active in approximately 40% of AML patient samples regardless of genetic subtype. We also observe this activity in human MLL-AF9 leukemia allele-induced AML in mice, where either activation of Akt or compound deletion of FoxO1/3/4 reduced leukemic cell growth, with the latter markedly diminishing leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) function in vivo and improving animal survival. FOXO inhibition resulted in myeloid maturation and subsequent AML cell death. FOXO activation inversely correlated with JNK/c-JUN signaling, and leukemic cells resistant to FOXO inhibition responded to JNK inhibition.

Moreover, direct interactions between B7-H1 and B7.1 molecules are also likely to participate in the immunoevasion mechanism. In this study, we used a mouse model of tumor dormancy, DA1-3b leukemia cells. We previously showed that a minor population of DA1-3b cells persists in equilibrium with the immune system for long periods of time, and that the levels of surface expression of B7-H1 and B7.1 molecules correlates with the dormancy time. We found that leukemia cells DA1-3b/d365 cells, which derived from long-term dormant tumors and overexpressed B7-H1 and B7.1 molecules, were highly permissive to Ad5FB4, a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector pseudotyped with chimeric human-bovine fibers. Both B7-H1 and B7.1 were required for Ad5FB4-cell binding and entry, since (i) siRNA silencing of one or the other B7 gene transcript resulted in a net decrease in the cell binding and Ad5FB4-mediated transduction of DA1-3b/d365; and (ii) plasmid-directed expression of B7.1 and B7-H1 proteins conferred to Ad5FB4-refractory human cells a full permissiveness to this vector. Binding data and flow cytometry analysis suggested that B7.1 and B7-H1 molecules played different roles in Ad5FB4-mediated transduction of DA1-3b/d365, with B7.1 involved in cell attachment of Ad5FB4, and B7-H1 in Ad5FB4 internalization. BRET analysis showed that B7.1 and B7-H1 formed heterodimeric complexes at the cell surface, and that Ad5FB4 penton, the viral capsomere carrying the fiber projection, could negatively interfere with the formation of B7.1/B7-H1 heterodimers, or modify their conformation. As interactors of B7-H1/B7.1 molecules, Ad5FB4 particles and/or their penton capsomeres represent potential therapeutic agents targeting cancer cells that had developed immunoevasion mechanisms.",,"['Grellier, Elodie', 'Lecolle, Katia', 'Rogee, Sophie', 'Couturier, Cyril', ""D'Halluin, Jean-Claude"", 'Hong, Saw-See', 'Fender, Pascal', 'Boulanger, Pierre', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Colin, Morvane']","['Grellier E', 'Lecolle K', 'Rogee S', 'Couturier C', ""D'Halluin JC"", 'Hong SS', 'Fender P', 'Boulanger P', 'Quesnel B', 'Colin M']","['INSERM UMR 837, 1, rue Polonovski, 59045 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110831,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Tail Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', '*Tumor Escape', 'Viral Tail Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Attachment', 'Virus Internalization']",2011/09/03 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/09/03 06:00'],"['2011/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-105 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-105 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Aug 31;10:105. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-105.,PMC3180432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This discovery has led to the 'cancer stem cell hierarchy' concept, which holds that tumors are organized as a hierarchy of malignant tissues sustained by such TIC. However, this concept remains controversial. In this review, we examine recent advances in cancer stem cell research that have been generated from studies of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive leukemia. The abnormal Ph chromosome, which arises from a translocation creating the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, is most commonly associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Examination of the pathophysiology of these diseases has provided interesting insights into not only the hierarchy of leukemia stem cells but also their clonal evolution. Both shared and unique regulatory mechanisms affecting normal and CML stem cell behavior have been identified. On the other hand, genetic diversity in specific clones of Ph(+) B-ALL that drive clonal evolution has recently come to light. Our expanding knowledge of the biology of TIC contributes to the progress of cancer research, and may open the door to new concepts in cancer therapy.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

They most commonly involve the skin and soft tissues, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract and are particularly challenging to diagnose in patients without an antecedent history of acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: We conducted a search of the English language medical literature for recent studies of interest to individuals involved in the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. RESULTS: The differential diagnosis includes non-Hodgkin lymphoma, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, histiocytic sarcoma, melanoma, carcinoma, and (in children) small round blue cell tumors. The sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemical markers must be considered when evaluating a suspected case of myeloid sarcoma. A high percentage of tested cases have cytogenetic abnormalities. CONCLUSION: A minimal panel of immunohistochemical markers should include anti-CD43 or anti-lysozyme as a lack of immunoreactivity for either of these sensitive markers would be inconsistent with a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Use of more specific markers of myeloid disease, such as CD33, myeloperoxidase, CD34 and CD117 is necessary to establish the diagnosis. Other antibodies may be added depending on the differential diagnosis. Identification of acute myeloid leukemia-associated genetic lesions may be helpful in arriving at the correct diagnosis.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Klco, J M', 'Welch, J S', 'Nguyen, T T', 'Hurley, M Y', 'Kreisel, F H', 'Hassan, A', 'Lind, A C', 'Frater, J L']","['Klco JM', 'Welch JS', 'Nguyen TT', 'Hurley MY', 'Kreisel FH', 'Hassan A', 'Lind AC', 'Frater JL']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University, School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110824,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2011/09/03 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/09/03 06:00'],"['2011/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01361.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Dec;33(6):555-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01361.x.

Patients with CLL recalled being given little information about the condition and wanted to know more about how it might affect them in the future. The invisibility of CLL meant that some chose not to disclose the diagnosis to others. Check-ups sometimes felt cursory, causing dissatisfaction. As symptoms increased, lifestyle adaptations became essential, well before treatment was warranted.

Every 6 days, follicular survival, growth and antrum formation were evaluated. At the end of the culture period, the oocytes underwent in vitro maturation (IVM), and their viability and chromatin configuration were assessed. Follicles of the control group and those cultured in 10 ng/ml LIF maintained the structural integrity (particularly the preservation of the basement membrane) when compared to the oocytes cultured in 50 ng/ml LIF, regardless the presence of FSH. In the absence of FSH, the percentage of antrum formation after 18 days of culture in the 50 ng/ml LIF group was significantly lower than in either the control group or the 10 ng/ml LIF group. However, this effect was not observed in the presence of FSH. The rate of resumption of meiosis was significantly higher in the 50 ng/ml LIF group in the absence of FSH in comparison with the control and 10 ng/ml LIF groups. Metaphase II was observed only when follicles were cultured in a combination of FSH and 50 ng/ml LIF.

METHODS: The study was conducted as a retrospective, single-centre chart review in patients with AML hospitalised for chemotherapy, neutropenia and infections after myelosuppressive chemotherapy from January 2004 to December 2006 in Germany. The following resource utilisation data were collected: inpatient stay, mechanical ventilation, parenteral feeding, diagnostics, systemic antifungal medication and cost-intensive concomitant medication. Direct medical costs were calculated from hospital provider perspective. RESULTS: A total of 471 episodes in 212 patients were included in the analysis. Occurrence of IFI decreased from 5.9% in 2004 to 1.9% in 2006. Mean (+/- standard deviation) hospital stay decreased from 28.7 +/- 17.9 d in 2004 to 22.4 +/- 11.8 d in 2006. From 2004 to 2006, the use of a single antifungal drug increased from 30.4% to 46.9%, whereas the use of multiple antifungal drugs decreased from 24.4% to 13.1%. The use of liposomal amphotericin B declined between 2004 and 2006 (21.4% vs. 3.8%) and caspofungin between 2005 and 2006 (19.3% vs. 8.1%). Total costs per episode declined from euro19051 +/- 19024 in 2004 to euro13531 +/- 9260 in 2006; major reductions were observed in the use of antimycotics and blood products as well as length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Analysis of real-life data from one single centre in Germany demonstrated a change in antifungal management of patients with AML between 2004/2005 and 2006, accompanied by a decline in total costs.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Bohme, Angelika', 'Atta, Johannes', 'Mousset, Sabine', 'Ehlken, Birgit', 'Shlaen, Margarita', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Bohme A', 'Atta J', 'Mousset S', 'Ehlken B', 'Shlaen M', 'Bug G', 'Serve H', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. angelika.boehme@onkologikum.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111013,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/economics', '*Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/economics', 'Caspofungin', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', '*Echinocandins/administration & dosage/economics', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Lipopeptides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parenteral Nutrition/economics', 'Respiration, Artificial/economics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2011/09/03 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/09/03 06:00'],"['2011/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01704.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Jan;88(1):68-77. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01704.x.

The molecular mechanisms of MC-induced susceptibility to carcinogenesis are largely unknown. In this study, we performed for the first time a comprehensive analysis of changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) and proteins expression in livers of mice treated with MC-LR. Utilizing microarray and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis, we identified 37 miRNAs and 42 proteins significantly altered. Many aberrantly expressed miRNAs were related to various cancers (e.g., miR-125b, hepatocellular carcinoma; miR-21, leukemia; miR-16, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; miR-192, pituitary adenomas; miR-199a-3p, ovarian cancer; miR-34a, pancreatic cancer). Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. MC-LR also altered the expression of a number of miRNAs and proteins involved in several pathways related to tumorigenesis, such as glutathione metabolism, VEGF signaling, and MAPK signaling pathway. Integration of post-transcriptomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics reveals that the networks miRNAs and their potential target genes and proteins involved in had a close association with carcinogenesis.

In most routine clinical diagnostic laboratories conventional karyotyping, in conjunction with targeted screens using e.g., fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is currently considered as the gold standard to detect such aberrations. Conventional karyotyping, however, is limited in its resolution and yield, thus hampering the genetic diagnosis of ALL. We explored whether microarray-based genomic profiling would be feasible as an alternative strategy in a routine clinical diagnostic setting. To this end, we compared conventional karyotypes with microarray-deduced copy number aberration (CNA) karyotypes in 60 ALL cases. Microarray-based genomic profiling resulted in a CNA detection rate of 90%, whereas for conventional karyotyping this was 61%. In addition, many small (< 5 Mb) genetic lesions were encountered, frequently harboring clinically relevant ALL-related genes such as CDKN2A/B, ETV6, PAX5, and IKZF1. From our data we conclude that microarray-based genomic profiling serves as a robust tool in the genetic diagnosis of ALL, outreaching conventional karyotyping in CNA detection both in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We also propose a practical workflow for a comprehensive and objective interpretation of CNAs obtained through microarray-based genomic profiling, thereby facilitating its application in a routine clinical diagnostic setting.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Simons, Annet', 'Stevens-Kroef, Marian', 'El Idrissi-Zaynoun, Najat', 'van Gessel, Sabine', 'Weghuis, Daniel Olde', 'van den Berg, Eva', 'Waanders, Esme', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter', 'Kuiper, Roland', 'van Kessel, Ad Geurts']","['Simons A', 'Stevens-Kroef M', 'El Idrissi-Zaynoun N', 'van Gessel S', 'Weghuis DO', 'van den Berg E', 'Waanders E', 'Hoogerbrugge P', 'Kuiper R', 'van Kessel AG']","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Radboud University Centre for Oncology, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. a.simons@antrg.umcn.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110831,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20919 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Dec;50(12):969-81. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20919.

With a median follow-up of 41 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 36.0 months and median overall survival (OS) has not been reached. The strong correlations of lower CR rate with advanced Binet stage, unmutated IGHV, cytogenetic abnormalities of del(17p13) or del(11q23), and p53 mutations were observed by univariable analyses. Stepwise logistic regression identified that unmutated IGHV and p53 abnormality (p53 deletion or mutation) were associated with a decreased odds of achieving CR. The less cycles of treatment, not achieving CR, advanced Binet stage, and p53 abnormality significantly correlated with a shortened PFS. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, p53 abnormality and advanced Binet stage were identified as being significant risk factors for early relapse. Not achieving CR, advanced Binet stage, ZAP-70-positive, and p53 abnormality were the adverse factors in determining OS.

OBJECTIVE: To describe these altered FDG uptake patterns and their relationship to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five FDG PET or PET/CT scans obtained in 11 children with lymphoblastic lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed. FDG uptake patterns were recorded. SUV measurements were performed in liver and facial soft tissues. Results were correlated with induction chemotherapy regimens. RESULTS: Six of the children had transiently altered FDG uptake with increased uptake in the superficial soft tissues, most notably involving the face. Altered uptake was noted approximately 1 month after initiation of chemotherapy and subsequently resolved. Hepatic uptake was transiently reduced on the 1-month scan in all six children with increased facial uptake. No significant FDG uptake in lymphoma was seen on five of six scans with altered uptake; however, two of these five affected children had FDG uptake in lymphoma on the next follow-up examination. Blood glucose levels in the affected children were in the normal range. All six children with altered FDG uptake received the same induction chemotherapy regimen, which included very high doses of corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Children with lymphoblastic lymphoma on induction chemotherapy protocols including very high doses of corticosteroids transiently demonstrated altered FDG uptake patterns, including increased superficial facial uptake and reduced hepatic uptake. The facial uptake is probably the FDG PET equivalent of Cushingoid facies. Caution in interpreting scans with this altered FDG uptake pattern is suggested, as uptake at sites of lymphomatous involvement may potentially be affected.",,"['Sharp, Susan E', 'Gelfand, Michael J', 'Absalon, Michael J']","['Sharp SE', 'Gelfand MJ', 'Absalon MJ']","[""Department of Radiology, MLC 5031, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45229-3039, USA. susan.sharp@cchmc.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110901,Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Artifacts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cushing Syndrome/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution/drug effects']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00247-011-2228-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2012 Mar;42(3):331-6. doi: 10.1007/s00247-011-2228-7.

These drugs interfere with the assembly of microtubules of alpha/beta tubulin heterodimers without altering their expression level. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of thymoquinone (TQ), a natural product present in black cumin seed oil known to exhibit putative anti-cancer activities, on alpha/beta tubulin expression in human astrocytoma cells (cell line U87, solid tumor model) and in Jurkat cells (T lymphoblastic leukaemia cells). TQ induced a concentration- and time-dependent degradation of alpha/beta tubulin in both cancer cell types. This degradation was associated with the up-regulation of the tumor suppressor p73 with subsequent induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, TQ had no effect on alpha/beta tubulin protein expression in normal human fibroblast cells, which were used as a non-cancerous cell model. These data indicate that TQ exerts a selective effect towards alpha/beta tubulin in cancer cells. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that TQ is a novel anti-microtubule drug which targets the level of alpha/beta tubulin proteins in cancer cells. Furthermore, they highlight the interest of developing anti-cancer therapies that target directly tubulin rather than microtubules dynamics.",,"['Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Ibrahim, Abdulkhaleg', 'Boukhari, Abdelaziz', 'Sharif, Tanveer', 'Gies, Jean-Pierre', 'Auger, Cyril', 'Schini-Kerth, Valerie B']","['Alhosin M', 'Ibrahim A', 'Boukhari A', 'Sharif T', 'Gies JP', 'Auger C', 'Schini-Kerth VB']","['CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74 route du Rhin, 67401, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110901,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Astrocytoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2011/09/02 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9734-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Oct;30(5):1813-9. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9734-1.

For these, conferring a worse prognosis and decreased overall survival, several FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently being tested in clinical trials. However, when using these drugs as monotherapy, the problem of short duration of remissions and high incidence of TKI resistance has emerged. Here, we investigated two members of a novel class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3,4-diarylmaleimides, for their efficacy on mutated FLT3 kinase. These compounds inhibit FLT3 kinase in an ATP-competitive manner and effectively inhibit phosphorylation of downstream targets. 3,4-Diarylmaleimides (DHF125 and 150) induce apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-dependent cells lines and patient blasts at low micromolar concentrations. They are retained in the cytoplasm of exposed cells for more than 24 h and synergize with chemotherapy and midostaurin. Both 3,4-diarylmaleimides show inhbition of FLT3-ITD-related kinase autophosphorylation at distinct tyrosine residues when compared to midostaurin. In conclusion, this novel group of compounds shows differential inhibition patterns with regard to FLT3 kinase and displays a promising profile for further clinical development.

Pivotal studies demonstrating the positive effects of hypomethylating agents on clinical outcome have brought an 'epigenomics revolution' to this disease, emphasising the importance of epigenetic mechanisms to the underlying pathogenesis of MDS. One of the most important future challenges in the MDS field will be to determine whether epigenetic therapies can be made more 'targeted' through identification of biomarkers which define subsets of patients most likely to benefit from treatment.

Cell populations can be analysed more comprehensively and efficiently, and abnormal populations can be distinguished more readily when normal counterparts are present. Polychromatic flow cytometry is particularly useful in the evaluation of plasma cells, and the role of flow cytometry in the assessment of plasma cell disorders is reviewed in depth. There is improved sensitivity in the assessment of small populations, which is critical in the evaluation of minimal residual disease. Flow cytometry can also play a role in assessment of circulating tumour cells in carcinoma. Introduction of polychromatic flow cytometry is a complex process with many challenges including design of antibody panels and instrument compensation. Developments in data analysis are required to realise the full benefits of the other technical advances. Standardisation of protocols may reduce inter-laboratory variation. While the complexity of polychromatic flow cytometry creates challenges, it has substantial potential to improve clinical analysis.",,"['Sewell, William A', 'Smith, Sandy A B C']","['Sewell WA', 'Smith SA']","[""Immunology Department, SydPath, St Vincent's Pathology, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. w.sewell@garvan.org.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Automation', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', '*Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Color', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Laboratories', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAT.0b013e32834a69ae [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 2011 Oct;43(6):580-91. doi: 10.1097/PAT.0b013e32834a69ae.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This allowed response monitoring and the detection of minimal residual disease, which proved to have important correlations with outcome in certain malignancies. The technology is indispensable for physicians and pathologists caring for oncology patients. In this article we will review the applications of molecular technology in the diagnosis and management of malignancies. Using chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) as an example, technical aspects and clinical correlations will be discussed, with emphasis on the importance of quality assurance and standardisation to allow for comparability of results across laboratories. We will also examine emerging technologies that allow for high throughput and rapid turnaround of specimens and speculate how these would affect outcomes in future health care.

We examined whether delta-elemene could inhibit cell growth and cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. The results demonstrated that delta-elemene induces significant apoptosis of HL-60 cells, as shown by MTT assay, annexin V (AnV) binding of externalized phosphatidylserine (PS), and the mitochondrial probe JC-1 using flow cytometry. HL-60 cells treated with delta-elemene showed high percentages in the early apoptotic and late apoptoctic/necrotic stages, as well as caspase-3 activation of HL-60 cells. By monitoring the changes in cell cycle profiles, we confirmed that delta-elemene could interfere with the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a time-dependent manner. Caspase-3 plays a direct role in proteolytic cleavage of the cellular proteins responsible for progression to apoptosis. Therefore we examined apoptosis in HL-60 cells after exposure to delta-elemene and measured caspase-3 activities with or without Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor) pretreatment using flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that delta-elemene could induce caspase-3 activation as detected by the decrease in delta-elemene-induced caspase-3 activities after treatment with z-VAD-fmk. In the present study, delta-elemene activated typical caspase-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells, as demonstrated by an inhibitory effect of z-VAD-fmk on this cell death. During delta-elemene-induced apoptosis, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor were released into the cytosol and BAX was translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria. However, these were not prevented by z-VAD-fmk. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that delta-elemene could induce G2/M cell cycle transition and trigger apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent pathway.",,"['Ying, Jun', 'Yang, Wei', 'Xie, Chun-Ying', 'Ni, Qin-Chun', 'Pan, Xue-Diao', 'Dong, Jin-Hua', 'Liu, Zhi-Min', 'Wang, Xi-Sha']","['Ying J', 'Yang W', 'Xie CY', 'Ni QC', 'Pan XD', 'Dong JH', 'Liu ZM', 'Wang XS']","['Center for Drug Non-Clinical Research and Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Industrial Research Institute in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '11029-06-4 (elemene)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcuma/chemistry', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/yakushi/131.1383 [pii]', '10.1248/yakushi.131.1383 [doi]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2011;131(9):1383-94. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.131.1383.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that CD38, a leukaemia cell marker, plays an important role in the hypothalamus in the process of OXT release in adult mice. Disruption of Cd38 (Cd38(-/-)) produced impairment of maternal behavior and male social recognition in mice, similar to the behavior observed in Oxt and OXT receptor (Oxtr) gene knockout (Oxt(-/-) and Oxtr(-/-), respectively) mice. Locomotor activity induced by separation from the dam was higher and the number of ultrasonic vocalization (USV) calls was lower in Cd38(-/-) than Cd38(+/+) pups. These phenotypes seemed to be caused by the high plasma OXT levels during development from neonates to 3-week-old juvenile mice. ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was markedly lower in the knockout mice from birth, suggesting that weaning for mice is a critical time window of differentiating plasma OXT. Contribution by breastfeeding was an important exogenous source for regulating plasma OXT before weaning by the presence of OXT in milk and the dam's mammary glands. The dissimilarity of Cd38(-/-) infant behaviour to Oxt(-/-) or Oxtr(-/-) mice can be explained partly by this exogenous source of OXT. These results suggest that secretion of OXT into the brain in a CD38-dependent manner may play an important role in the development of social behavior, and mice with OXT signalling deficiency, including Cd38(-/-), Oxt(-/-) and Oxtr(-/-) mice are good animal models for developmental disorders, such as autism.",,"['Higashida, Haruhiro', 'Yokoyama, Shigeru', 'Munesue, Toshio', 'Kikuchi, Mitsuru', 'Minabe, Yoshio', 'Lopatina, Olga']","['Higashida H', 'Yokoyama S', 'Munesue T', 'Kikuchi M', 'Minabe Y', 'Lopatina O']","['Department of Biophysical Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.

Studies have shown that the frequencies of marrow and blood Tregs are greater in patients with AML than in control patients. Although increased Tregs have been associated with a decreased risk of GVHD after allogeneic HCT and hence may impede the graft-versus-tumor effect, recent findings indicate that that this may not be the case. Because there is a need to improve outcomes of standard treatment (chemotherapy with or without allogeneic HCT) in AML, targeting Tregs present an outstanding opportunity in AML because discoveries may apply throughout its treatment. Here, we review data on the roles of Tregs in mediating immune system-AML interactions. We focused on in vitro, animal, and observational human studies of Tregs in AML biology, development, prognosis, and therapy in different settings (eg, vaccination and HCT).

To gain new insights into the biology of the EAF2 and ELL family proteins, we used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to explore the in vivo roles of their worm orthologs. Through the use of transgenic worms, RNAi, and an eaf-1 mutant, we found that both genes are expressed in multiple cell types throughout the worm life cycle and that they play important roles in fertility, survival, and body size regulation. ELL-1 and EAF-1 likely contribute to these activities in part through modulating cuticle synthesis, given that we observed a disrupted cuticle structure in ell-1 RNAi-treated or eaf-1 mutant worms. Consistent with disruption of cuticle structure, loss of either ELL-1 or EAF-1 suppressed the rol phenotype of specific collagen mutants, possibly through the control of dpy-3, dpy-13, and sqt-3 collagen gene expression. Furthermore, we also noted the regulation of collagen expression by ELL overexpression in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.

It mediates multiple signal transduction pathways to modulate cellular proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration. However, the mechanisms for the regulation of its expression remain greatly elusive. We reported previously that galectin-1 is a direct target of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a key heterodimeric transcriptional factor for the cellular response to hypoxia. Here we show that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a critical transcriptional factor for hematopoietic cell differentiation, can directly activate galectin-1 through binding to the -48 to -42 bp region of its promoter. Based on the physical interaction of C/EBPalpha and HIF-1alpha, the synergistic transcriptional activity of C/EBPalpha and HIF-1alpha on the promoter of the galectin-1 gene is also found by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), ChIP followed by ChIP (ChIP-reChIP), and luciferase assay. Moreover, knockdown or chemical inhibition of galectin-1 partially blocks the differentiation induced by HIF-1alpha or C/EBPalpha, which can be rescued by recombinant galectin-1. These discoveries would shed new insights on the mechanisms for galectin-1 expression regulation and HIF-1alpha- and C/EBPalpha-induced leukemic cell differentiation.",,"['Zhao, Xu-Yun', 'Zhao, Ke-Wen', 'Jiang, Yi', 'Zhao, Meng', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Zhao XY', 'Zhao KW', 'Jiang Y', 'Zhao M', 'Chen GQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Ministry of Education of China and the Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110831,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Galectin 1)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (LGALS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Galectin 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2011/09/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50877-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.247262 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Oct 21;286(42):36808-19. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.247262.

Pentraxin 3 and C-reactive protein were measured at fever onset and then daily to day 3. Bacteremia was observed in 19 patients and septic shock in 5 patients (three deaths). In comparison to C-reactive protein, pentraxin 3 achieved its maximum more rapidly. Pentraxin 3 correlated not only with the same day C-reactive protein but also with the next day C-reactive protein. High pentraxin 3 on day 0 was associated with the development of septic shock (P=0.009) and bacteremia (P=0.046). The non-survivors had constantly high pentraxin 3 levels. To conclude, pentraxin 3 is an early predictor of complications in hematologic patients with neutropenic fever.

The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of PHF6 gene alterations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the incidence and prognostic value of PHF6 mutations in 96 Chinese patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PHF6 deletions were screened by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Patients were also investigated for NOTCH1, FBXW7, WT1, and JAK1 mutations together with CALM-AF10, SET-NUP214, and SIL-TAL1 gene rearrangements. RESULTS: PHF6 mutations were identified in 11/59 (18.6%) adult and 2/37 (5.4%) pediatric cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, these incidences being significantly lower than those recently reported. Although PHF6 is X-linked and mutations have been reported to occur almost exclusively in male patients, we found no sex difference in the incidences of PHF6 mutations in Chinese patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PHF6 deletions were detected in 2/79 (2.5%) patients analyzed. NOTCH1 mutations, FBXW7 mutations, WT1 mutations, JAK1 mutations, SIL-TAL1 fusions, SET-NUP214 fusions and CALM-AF10 fusions were present in 44/96 (45.8%), 9/96 (9.4%), 4/96 (4.1%), 3/49 (6.1%), 9/48 (18.8%), 3/48 (6.3%) and 0/48 (0%) of patients, respectively. The molecular genetic markers most frequently associated with PHF6 mutations were NOTCH1 mutations (P=0.003), SET-NUP214 rearrangements (P=0.002), and JAK1 mutations (P=0.005). No differences in disease-free survival and overall survival between T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with and without PHF6 mutations were observed in a short-term follow-up.

Those studies typically did not explore the prognostic impact of peripheral blood involvement and lacked samples from very early time points of induction. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we employed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis to examine minimal residual disease in 398 pairs of blood and bone marrow follow-up samples taken from 95 children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with the ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocol. RESULTS: We confirmed the previously published poor correlation between minimal residual disease in blood and marrow at early treatment time points, with levels in bone marrow being higher than in blood in most samples (median 7.9-fold, range 0.04-8,293-fold). A greater involvement of peripheral blood at diagnosis was associated with a higher white blood cell count at diagnosis (P=0.003) and with enlargement of the spleen (P=0.0004) and liver (P=0.05). At day 15, a level of minimal residual disease in blood lower than 10(-4) was associated with an excellent 5-year relapse-free survival in 78 investigated patients (100% versus 69 +/- 7%; P=0.0003). Subgroups defined by the level of minimal residual disease in blood at day 15 (high-risk: >/= 10(-2), intermediate-risk: <10(-2) and >/= 10(-4), standard-risk: <10(-4)) partially correlated with bone marrow-based stratification described previously, but the risk groups did not match completely. No other time point analyses were predictive of outcome in peripheral blood, except for a weak association at day 8. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal residual disease in peripheral blood at day 15 identified a large group of patients with an excellent prognosis and added prognostic information to the risk stratification based on minimal residual disease at day 33 and week 12.",,"['Volejnikova, Jana', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Valova, Tatana', 'Reznickova, Leona', 'Hodonska, Ladislava', 'Mihal, Vladimir', 'Sterba, Jaroslav', 'Jabali, Yahia', 'Prochazkova, Daniela', 'Blazek, Bohumir', 'Hak, Jiri', 'Cerna, Zdenka', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan', 'Fronkova, Eva']","['Volejnikova J', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Valova T', 'Reznickova L', 'Hodonska L', 'Mihal V', 'Sterba J', 'Jabali Y', 'Prochazkova D', 'Blazek B', 'Hak J', 'Cerna Z', 'Hrusak O', 'Stary J', 'Trka J', 'Fronkova E']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110831,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/04/05 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.042937 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.042937 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Dec;96(12):1815-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.042937.

Deregulated microRNA expression has been shown for acute myeloid leukemia, a disease also characterized by altered gene expression associated with distinct genomic aberrations such as nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations. To shed further light on the role of deregulated microRNA and gene expression in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia with NPM1 mutation we performed an integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression data sets. DESIGN AND METHODS: Both microRNA and gene expression profiles were investigated in samples from a cohort of adult cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients (n=43; median age 46 years, range 23-60 years) with known NPM1 mutation status (n=23 mutated, n=20 wild-type) and the data were integratively analyzed. Putative microRNA-mRNA interactions were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and luciferase reporter assays. For selected microRNAs, sensitivity of microRNA-overexpressing cells to cytarabine treatment was tested by FACS viability and cell proliferation assays. RESULTS: Our integrative approach of analyzing both microRNA- and gene expression profiles in parallel resulted in a refined list of putative target genes affected by NPM1 mutation-associated microRNA deregulation. Of 177 putative microRNA - target mRNA interactions we identified and validated 77 novel candidates with known or potential involvement in leukemogenesis, such as IRF2-miR-20a, KIT-miR-20a and MN1-miR-15a. Furthermore, our data showed that deregulated expression of tumor suppressor microRNAs, such as miR-29a and miR-30c, might contribute to sensitivity to cytarabine, which is observed in NPM1 mutated acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our observations highlight that integrative data analysis approaches can improve insights into leukemia biology, and lead to the identification of novel microRNA - target gene interactions of potential relevance for acute myeloid leukemia treatment.",,"['Russ, Annika C', 'Sander, Sandrine', 'Luck, Sonja C', 'Lang, Katharina M', 'Bauer, Marion', 'Rucker, Frank G', 'Kestler, Hans A', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Holzmann, Karlheinz', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Bullinger, Lars']","['Russ AC', 'Sander S', 'Luck SC', 'Lang KM', 'Bauer M', 'Rucker FG', 'Kestler HA', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner H', 'Holzmann K', 'Dohner K', 'Bullinger L']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110831,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/04/05 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.046888 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.046888 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Dec;96(12):1783-91. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.046888.

The objective of this study was to assess the risk of osteoporosis associated with the prevalence of low bone mass (according to the guidelines of the Pediatric Official Positions of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry 2007) in survivors of childhood ALL. The cross-sectional study was conducted in a cohort of 69 Caucasian children and adolescents (46 boys and 23 girls) aged 12.15 +/- 0.5yr diagnosed with ALL and screened up to 5 yr after cessation of the treatment. Total body bone mineral content (TB BMC, g), total body bone mineral density (TB BMD, g/cm(2)), and lumbar spine BMD (LS BMD, g/cm(2)) were determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Time interval from the completion of the treatment to the beginning of this study (subgroup I<2 yr or subgroup II>2 yr after treatment), methotrexate (MTX) doses (subgroup I-MTX ranging from 0.5 to 1.0g/m(2); subgroup II-MTX>2.0 g/m(2)), cranial irradiation (subgroup I-without radiotherapy (RTX) and subgroup II receiving RTX of 12-18 Gy), cumulative steroid dose, and impaired endocrine function were considered as potential factors affecting bone metabolism and included in the analysis. No differences were found in bone traits (BMC, TB BMD, LS BMD) in relation to examined risk factors. In multiple regression model that included therapeutical factors, a risk group and central nervous system irradiation were of an important influence on bone mass, and risk group predicted TB BMD in small degree. Risk group and irradiation status lost their significance after the inclusion of anthropometric, age-connected, and time-connected factors. This study suggests that ALL survivors are not at increased risk for low bone mass. However, from the clinical perspective all patients after childhood ALL should be screened for clinical signs, fracture history, and lifestyle risk factors for low bone mass and osteoporosis. They should be referred to bone density evaluation only as often as may be necessary from the clinical evaluation.","['Copyright (c) 2012 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry.

The precise gene pathways that exert critical control over the determination of cell lineage fate during the development of pediatric APL remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed miR-125b expression in 169 pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples including 76 APL samples before therapy and 38 APL samples after therapy. The effects of enforced expression of miR-125b were evaluated in leukemic cell and drug-resistant cell lines. RESULTS: miR-125b is highly expressed in pediatric APL compared with other subtypes of AML and is correlated with treatment response, as well as relapse of pediatric APL. Our results further demonstrated that miR-125b could promote leukemic cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of tumor suppressor BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (Bak1). Remarkably, miR-125b was also found to be up-regulated in leukemic drug-resistant cells, and transfection of a miR-125b duplex into AML cells can increase their resistance to therapeutic drugs, CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly indicate that miR-125b plays an important role in the development of pediatric APL at least partially mediated by repressing BAK1 protein expression and could be a potential therapeutic target for treating pediatric APL failure.",,"['Zhang, Hua', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Feng, Dan-Dan', 'Zhang, Xing-Ju', 'Wu, Jun', 'Zheng, Yu-Sheng', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Xu, Ling', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Zhang H', 'Luo XQ', 'Feng DD', 'Zhang XJ', 'Wu J', 'Zheng YS', 'Chen X', 'Xu L', 'Chen YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory, for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110901,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', 'EC 1.13.12.5 (Luciferases, Renilla)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Luciferases, Renilla/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-108 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-108 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Sep 1;10:108. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-108.,PMC3189170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent success of intratumorally-injected adeno-encoded, chemo/radiation-inducible-promoter driven hTNF-alpha, (TNFerade) + gemcitabine in pre-clinical models of PC have renewed interest in use of TNF-alpha as a therapeutic component. To help find additional factors which might affect the therapy, we examined the resistance of MSLN-overexpressing pancreatic cancer cell lines to TNF-alpha-induced growth inhibition/apoptosis. METHODS: Stable MSLN overexpressing MIA PaCa-2 cells (MIA-MSLN), stable MSLN-silenced AsPC-1 cells (AsPC-shMSLN) and other pancreatic cells (MIA-PaCa2, Panc 28, Capan-1, BxPC3, PL 45, Hs 766T, AsPC-1, Capan-2, Panc 48) were used. NF-kappaB activation was examined by western blots and luciferase reporter assay. TNF-alpha induced growth inhibition/apoptosis was measured by MTT, TUNEL assay and caspase activation. IL-6 was measured using luminex based assay. RESULTS: Compared to low endogenous MSLN-expressing MIA PaCa-2 and Panc 28 cells, high endogenous MSLN-expressing Capan-1, BxPC3, PL 45, Hs 766T, AsPC-1, Capan-2, Panc 48 cells were resistant to TNF-alpha induced growth inhibition. Stable MSLN overexpressing MIA-PaCa2 cells (MIA-MSLN) were resistant to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis while stable MSLN-silenced AsPC1 cells (AsPC-shMSLN) were sensitive. Interestingly, TNF-alpha-treated MIA-MSLN cells showed increased cell cycle progression and cyclin A induction, both of which were reversed by caspase inhibition. We further found that MIA-MSLN cells showed increased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and Mcl-1; deactivated (p-Ser75) BAD, and activated (p-Ser70) Bcl-2. Constitutively activated NF-kappaB and Akt were evident in MIA-MSLN cells that could be suppressed by MSLN siRNA with a resultant increase in sensitivity of TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. Blocking NF-kappaB using IKK inhibitor wedelolactone also increased sensitivity to TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity with concomitant decrease in Mcl-1. Blocking Akt using PI3K inhibitor also had a likewise effect presumably affecting cell cycle. MIA-MSLN cells produced increased IL-6 and were increased furthermore by TNF-alpha treatment. SiRNA-silencing of IL-6 increased TNF-alpha sensitivity of MIA-MSLN cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study delineates a MSLN-Akt-NF-kappaB-IL-6-Mcl-1 survival axis that may be operative in PC cells, and might help cancer cells' survival in the highly inflammatory milieu evident in PC. Further, for the success of TNFerade + gemcitabine to be successful, we feel the simultaneous inhibition of components of this axis is also essential.",,"['Bharadwaj, Uddalak', 'Marin-Muller, Christian', 'Li, Min', 'Chen, Changyi', 'Yao, Qizhi']","['Bharadwaj U', 'Marin-Muller C', 'Li M', 'Chen C', 'Yao Q']","['Michael E, DeBakey Department of Surgery, Molecular Surgeon Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110831,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MSLN protein, human)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0K6L725GNS (wedelolactone)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 1.13.12.5 (Luciferases, Renilla)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Coumarins/pharmacology', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases, Renilla/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mesothelin', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2011/09/02 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/09/02 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-106 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-106 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Aug 31;10:106. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-106.,PMC3175472,,['CA140828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to review all reported primary cutaneous (PC)-LBLs and to examine three new cases to better characterize this neoplasm. Two of our patients showed a pre-B phenotype (PC-B-LBL) and one a never-reported pre-T phenotype (PC-T-LBL). The patient with PC-T-LBL showed an aggressive course, while those with PC-B-LBL showed a complete remission (CR) after polychemotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis and gene expression profiling (GEP) were performed on one case of PC-B-LBL and on that of PC-T-LBL. A specimen of PC-B-LBL and two specimens (early and late stage) of PC-T-LBL were investigated by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). All specimens revealed trisomy of chromosome 4. PC-T-LBL showed a gain of 1p36.33-p22.1 in the early stage and multiple chromosome gains/losses in the late stage. Our data suggest that trisomy 4 could be detected early in LBL and gain of 1p36.33-p22.1 could be an interesting marker in PC-T-LBL. LBL is an aggressive disease but, only in B-LBL, the cutaneous presentation seems to be a favorable prognostic factor and polychemotherapy is the best therapeutic approach.

Fifty-two heavily pretreated patients, 69% with bulky disease and 48% with high-risk genomic abnormalities, initiated lenalidomide at 2.5 mg/day, with dose escalation until the MTDEL or the maximum assigned dose was attained. Lenalidomide was safely titrated to 20 mg/day; the MTDEL was not reached. Most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; TLS was mild and rare. The low starting dose and conservative dose escalation strategy resulted in six partial responders and 30 patients obtaining stable disease.

METHOD: MEK inhibitor PD0325901 was encapsulated in lipid layers of N',N''-dioleylglutamide-based cationic liposomes (DGL). Mcl1-specific siRNA (siMcl1) was complexed to DGL or PD0325901-loaded liposomes (PDGL). Efficiency of cellular siRNA delivery was tested using fluorescent double-stranded RNA. Silencing of target proteins was evaluated using Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions. In vivo anticancer activity was tested using xenografted mice. RESULTS: Size and zeta potential of PDGL were similar to DGL. PDGL could deliver double-stranded RNA into cells with efficiencies comparable to DGL. Cellular co-delivery of siMcl1 and PD0325901 reduced expression of Mcl1 and pERK1/2 proteins and more effectively reduced tumor cell survival than other treatments. In mice, siMcl1 and PD0325901 co-delivered by PDGL inhibited growth of tumors 79%. Substantial apoptosis of tumor cells was observed following PDGL-mediated co-delivery of siMcl1, but not in other groups.

However, the clinical implication of angiogenic factor expression in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, we sought to investigate the prognostic impact of the expression of genes encoding angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Ang-2, the receptor Tie2, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and VEGF-C in the bone marrow (BM) in 208 patients with newly diagnosed primary MDS. RESULTS: BM Ang-1 expression was significantly higher in MDS patients, especially those with higher-risk subtypes, than in normal controls. With a median follow-up time of 32.9 months, the disease transformed to acute leukaemia more frequently in the patients bearing higher Ang-1 expression than in those with lower expression (31.5% vs 18.6%, P=0.023). The MDS patients with higher Ang-1 expression had shorter overall survival than those with lower expression (median 20.8+/-4.5 months vs 63.3+/-17.8 months, P<0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that higher Ang-1 expression was an independent unfavourable prognostic factor for overall survival. There was no impact of the expression of other angiogenic factors on survival.

In addition to direct antitumor activity, rapalogs reverse multiple tumor-intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms. These should facilitate tumor-specific T cell activity, but since rapa directly inhibits effector T cells, this potential immune enhancement is lost. We hypothesized that if T cells were rendered resistant to rapa they could capitalize on its downregulation of tumor immune evasion. We therefore modified T cells with a rapa-resistant mutant of mTor, mTorRR, and directed them to B lymphomas by coexpressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for CD19 (CAR.CD19-28zeta). T cells expressing transgenic mTorRR from a piggyBac transposon maintain mTor signaling, proliferate in the presence of rapa and retain their cytotoxic function and ability to secrete interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) after stimulation, effector functions that were inhibited by rapa in control T cells. In combination, rapa and rapa-resistant-CAR.CD19-28zeta-expressing T cells produced greater antitumor activity against Burkitt's lymphoma and pre-B ALL cell lines in vitro than CAR.CD19-28zeta T cells or rapa alone.

In previous studies, murine myeloid leukemias induced by transducing wild-type bone marrow progenitors with a SRY sex determining region Y-box 4 (Sox4)-expressing retrovirus frequently carried proviral insertions at Sfpi1, decreasing its mRNA levels, suggesting that reduced Sfpi1 expression cooperates with Sox4 in myeloid leukemia induction. In support of this hypothesis, we show here that mice receiving Sox4 virus-infected Sfpi1(ko/+) bone marrow progenitors developed myeloid leukemia with increased penetrance and shortened latency. Interestingly, Sox4 expression further decreased Sfpi1 transcription. Ectopic SOX4 expression reduced endogenous PU.1 mRNA levels in HL60 promyelocytes, and decreased Sfpi1 mRNA levels were also observed in the spleens of leukemic and preleukemic mice receiving Sox4 virus-infected wild-type bone marrow cells. In addition, Sox4 protein bound to a critical upstream regulatory element of Sfpi1 in ChIP assays. Such cooperation probably occurs in de novo human acute myeloid leukemias, as an analysis of 285 acute myeloid leukemia patient samples found a significant negative correlation between SOX4 and PU.1 expression.

However, the mechanisms underlying the repopulation of tumor cells after radiation have remained unclear. In this study, we show that cellular signaling from Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (Abl) to protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) is crucial for fractionated-radiation-induced expansion of glioma-initiating cell populations and acquisition of resistance to anticancer treatments. Treatment of human glioma cells with fractionated radiation increased Abl and PKCdelta activity, expanded the CD133-positive (CD133(+)) cell population that possesses tumor-initiating potential and induced expression of glioma stem cell markers and self-renewal-related proteins. Moreover, cells treated with fractionated radiation were resistant to anticancer treatments. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of PKCdelta expression blocked fractionated-radiation-induced CD133(+) cell expansion and suppressed expression of glioma stem cell markers and self-renewal-related proteins. It also suppressed resistance of glioma cells to anticancer treatments. Similarly, knockdown of Abl led to a decrease in CD133(+) cell populations and restored chemotherapeutic sensitivity. It also attenuated fractionated-radiation-induced PKCdelta activation, suggesting that Abl acts upstream of PKCdelta. Collectively, these data indicate that fractionated radiation induces an increase in the glioma-initiating cell population, decreases cellular sensitivity to cancer treatment and implicates activation of Abl-PKCdelta signaling in both events.

These are likely to result from an increased dosage of one or more of the approximately 310 genes present on Hsa21. The identification of these dosage-sensitive genes has become a major focus in DS research because it is essential for a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathology, and might eventually lead to more effective therapy. The search for these dosage-sensitive genes is being carried out using both human and mouse genetics. Studies of humans with partial trisomy of Hsa21 have identified regions of this chromosome that contribute to different phenotypes. In addition, novel engineered mouse models are being used to map the location of dosage-sensitive genes, which, in a few cases, has led to the identification of individual genes that are causative for certain phenotypes. These studies have revealed a complex genetic interplay, showing that the diverse DS phenotypes are likely to be caused by increased copies of many genes, with individual genes contributing in different proportions to the variance in different aspects of the pathology.",,"['Lana-Elola, Eva', 'Watson-Scales, Sheona D', 'Fisher, Elizabeth M C', 'Tybulewicz, Victor L J']","['Lana-Elola E', 'Watson-Scales SD', 'Fisher EM', 'Tybulewicz VL']","['MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, NW7 1AA, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,,IM,"['Brain/growth & development/physiopathology', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Memory/physiology', 'Motor Activity/physiology']",2011/09/01 06:00,2011/12/31 06:00,['2011/09/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['4/5/586 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.008078 [doi]']",ppublish,Dis Model Mech. 2011 Sep;4(5):586-95. doi: 10.1242/dmm.008078.,PMC3180222,,"['G0601056/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the pathogenesis of the disease, both gene mutations and cytogenetic changes play an important role. The latter have been integrated into prognostic scoring systems including the IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) and WPSS (World Health Organization [WHO] classification-based Prognostic Scoring System). In these systems and in multivariate analyses comparing clinical and genetic data, complex karyotypes are associated with a particularly poor prognosis. del(5q) plays a distinct role by classifying the only genetically defined WHO subtype. Also, due to advancement in technology such as whole genome sequencing, the number of known mutations occurring in MDS is steadily increasing. Important recent discoveries include mutations in EZH2, DNMT3A, ASXL1 and IDH1/2. Like TET2, the most commonly mutated gene in MDS, all are involved in epigenetic regulation. Mutations such as ASXL1, RUNX1, EZH2, ETV6/TEL and TP53 have an adverse impact on patient overall survival. Early evidence suggests that some mutations might influence treatment response, necessitating reassessment of the prognostic effect of genetic alterations in the light of every new treatment.

We have used an array-based proteomic approach with the prokaryotically expressed human protein array (hEx1) and the eukaryotically expressed human protein array (Protoarray) to identify novel calcium-regulated interaction networks of secretagogin. Screening of these arrays with fluorophore-labelled secretagogin in the presence of Ca(2+) ions led to the identification of 12 (hEx1) and 6 (Protoarray) putative targets. A number of targets were identified in both array screens. The putative targets from the hEx1 array were expressed, purified, and subjected to binding analysis using surface plasmon resonance. This identified binding affinities for nine novel secretagogin targets with equilibrium dissociation constants in the 100 pM to 10 nM range. Six of the novel target proteins have important roles in vesicle trafficking; SNAP-23, ARFGAP2, and DOC2alpha are involved in regulating fusion of vesicles to membranes, kinesin 5B and tubulin are essential for transport of vesicles in the cell, and rootletin builds up the rootlet, which is believed to function as scaffold for vesicles.

We used CLL samples with discordant VLA-4/CD38 risk to address their individual roles in human bone marrow infiltration (BM), CLL cell homing to murine BM, and in supportive CLL cell-stromal cell interactions. METHODS: VLA-4, CD38, and Ki-67 expression was measured in CLL cells from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirates. CLL BM infiltration rates, routinely determined by Pathology, were correlated to VLA-4 and CD38 expression. Short-term homing capacity of CLL cells was evaluated by adoptive transfer experiments. CLL cell viability and adhesion in stromal cell co-culture was determined. RESULTS: About 20% of CLL samples in our cohort displayed discordant VLA-4 and CD38 risk, with either high VLA-4 and low CD38 risk or vice versa. Using particularly such samples, we observed that VLA-4, and not CD38, was responsible for recirculation of CLL cells to murine BM. Human BM infiltration was also significantly higher in patients with high VLA-4 risk but not high CD38 risk. However, both molecules acted as independent prognostic markers. While both VLA-4 and CD38 expression were increased in BM-derived CLL cells, and VLA-4+ and CD38+ subpopulations showed enriched Ki-67 expression, VLA-4 did not contribute to CLL cell protection by stromal cells in vitro.

The cardinal members of this signalling molecule group are sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) which are, at least in part, homologous to each other. Bioactive lipids usually act via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), but can also function as direct intracellular messengers. Recently, it became evident that bioactive lipids play a role during cellular differentiation development. SPC induces mesodermal differentiation of mouse ES cells and differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia cells, by a mechanism being critically dependent on MEK-ERK signalling. LPA stimulates the clonal expansion of neurospheres from neural stem/progenitor cells and induces c-fos via activation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) in ES cells. S1P acts on hematopoietic progenitor cells as a chemotactic factor and has also been found to be critical for cardiac and skeletal muscle regeneration. Furthermore, S1P promotes cardiogenesis and similarly activates Erk signalling in mouse ES cells. Interestingly, S1P may also act to maintain human stem cell pluripotency. Both LPA and S1P positively regulate the proliferative capacity of murine ES cells.

Overexpression of ZAP rendered cells resistant to HIV-1 infection in a ZAP expression level-dependent manner, whereas depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced HIV-1 infection. Both human and rat ZAP inhibited the propagation of replication-competent HIV-1. ZAP specifically targeted the multiply spliced but not unspliced or singly spliced HIV-1 mRNAs for degradation. We provide evidence indicating that ZAP selectively recruits cellular poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) to shorten the poly(A) tail of target viral mRNA and recruits the RNA exosome to degrade the RNA body from the 3' end. In addition, ZAP recruits cellular decapping complex through its cofactor RNA helicase p72 to initiate degradation of the target viral mRNA from the 5' end. Depletion of each of these mRNA degradation enzymes reduced ZAP's activity.

DESIGN: Retrospective exploratory analysis using data from a multi-institutional prospective study comparing objective sleep measures by actigraphy over 10 days with retrospective genotyping of IL-6 (-174GC) and TNF (-308GA). SETTING: Pediatric oncology centers in the southeastern and southwestern United States and in Canada. SAMPLE: 88 children or adolescents with ALL. METHODS: Secondary analysis of 88 patients (ages 5-18) with sleep quality measured by actigraphy over 10 days in their home environment and retrospective DNA genotyping. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Sleep variables and genotype. FINDINGS: IL-6 promoter (-174G>C) C allele was associated with fewer total daily sleep minutes (p = 0.028) and fewer daily nap minutes (p < 0.01). Patients with the TNF genotype AA had 28.2 more minutes of wake after sleep onset (p = 0.015), 3.4 more nocturnal wake episodes (p = 0.026), and a 5% lower sleep efficiency rate (p = 0.03) than their GA genotype counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the TNF (-308G>A) or IL-6 (-174G>C) polymorphisms demonstrated disturbed sleep. This study is the first to find a relationship between these two cytokines and disturbed sleep in children and adolescents with cancer.

Vascular endothelial cells are targeted by pro-inflammatory cytokines modulating many gene proteins responsible for cell adhesion, thrombosis and inflammatory responses. This study examined the potential of compound K to inhibit the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha induction of monocyte adhesion onto TNF-alpha-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC were cultured with 10ng/ml TNF-alpha with individual ginsenosides of Rb1, Rc, Re, Rh1 and compound K (CK). Ginsenosides at doses of 50muM did not show any cytotoxicity. TNF-alpha induced THP-1 monocyte adhesion to HUVEC, and such induction was attenuated by Rh1 and CK. Consistently, CK suppressed TNF-alpha-induced expression of HUVEC adhesion molecules of VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin, and also Rh1 showed a substantial inhibition. Rh1 and CK dampened induction of counter-receptors, alpha4/beta1 integrin VLA-4 and alphaL/beta2 integrin LFA-1 in TNF-alpha-treated THP-1 cells. Additionally, CK diminished THP-1 secretion of MMP-9 required during transmigration, inhibiting transendothelial migration of THP-1 cells. CK blunted TNF-alpha-promoted IL-8 secretion of HUVEC and CXCR1 expression of THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, TNF-alpha-activated endothelial IkappaB phosphorylation and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation were disturbed by CK, and TNF-alpha induction of alpha4/beta1 integrin was abrogated by the NF-kappaB inhibitor SN50. These results demonstrate that CK exerts anti-atherogenic activity with blocking leukocyte endothelial interaction and transmigration through negatively mediating NF-kappaB signaling.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

One goal of the study was to determine if TCD could be performed uniformly among study sites. TCD was achieved using the CliniMACS((R)) CD34 Reagent System for CD34 enrichment. Processed grafts needed to contain >/= 2.0 x 10(6) CD34(+)cells/kg with a target of 5.0 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg and <10(5) CD3(+) T cells/kg. Up to 3 collections were allowed to achieve the minimum CD34(+) cell dose. In total, 86 products were processed for 44 patients. Differences in the starting cell products between centers were seen in regard to total nucleated cells, CD34(+) cells, and CD3(+) T cells, which could in part be ascribed to a higher dose of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor used for mobilization early in the trial. Differences between centers in processing outcomes were minimal and could be ascribed to starting cell parameters or to differences in graft analysis methods. Multivariate analysis showed that CD34(+) cell recovery (66.1% +/- 20.3%) was inversely associated with the starting number of CD34(+) cells (P = .02). Median purity of the CD34 enriched fraction was 96.7% (61.5%-99.8%) with monocytes and B cells the most common impurity. All patients received the minimum CD34(+) cell dose, and 39 patients (89%) came within 10% or exceeded the target CD34(+) cell dose without exceeding the maximum T cell dose. All patients proceeded to transplantation and all achieved initial engraftment. Products processed at multiple centers using the CliniMACS System for CD34 enrichment were comparably and uniformly highly enriched for CD34(+) cells, with good CD34(+) cell recovery and very low CD3(+) T cell content.","['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, DUCB transplantation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality because of slow recovery of immunity and a high risk of infection. To define the differences in immune reconstitution between DUCB transplantation and HLA matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation, we performed a detailed, prospective analysis of immune reconstitution in 42 DUCB recipients and 102 filgrastim-mobilized unrelated peripheral blood stem cell recipients. Reconstitution of CD3 T cells was significantly delayed in the DUCB cohort compared with the MUD cohort for 1 to 6 months posttransplantation (P < .001), including naive (CD45RO-) and memory (CD45RO+) CD4 T cells, regulatory (CD4CD25) T cells, and CD8 T cells. In contrast, CD19 B cells recovered more rapidly in the DUCB cohort and numbers remained significantly greater from 3 to 24 months after transplantation (P = .001). CD56CD16 natural killer (NK) cells also recovered more rapidly in DUCB recipients and remained significantly greater from 1 to 24 months after transplantation. B cell activating factor (BAFF) levels were higher in the DUCB cohort at 1 month (P < .001), were similar in both cohorts at 3 and 6 months, and were lower in the DUCB cohort at 12 months (P = .002). BAFF/CD19 B cell ratios were lower in the DUCB cohort at 3 (P = .045), 6 (P = .02), and 12 months (P = .002) after transplantation. DUCB recipients had more infections within the first 100 days after transplantation (P < .001), and there was less chronic graft-versus-host disease (P < .001), but there were no differences in cumulative incidence of relapse, nonrelapse death, progression-free survival, or overall survival between the 2 groups. These results suggest that increased risk of infections is specifically associated with delayed reconstitution of all major T cell subsets, but the increased risk is limited to the first 3 months after DUCB transplantation. There is no increased risk of relapse, suggesting that graft-versus-leukemia activity is maintained. Early reconstitution of B cells and NK cells may, in part, account for these findings.","['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The NB4 cells were treated with TA at different concentrations for 48 h in culture. Growth inhibition rates were measured by CCK-8 method. Flow cytometry was used to explore the cell apoptosis and the activity of NF-kappaB and Akt during apoptosis. RESULTS: TA at different concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800 mg/L) inhibited proliferation of NB4 cells in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05), and the inhibitory rates of TA on NB4 cells were (14.54 +/- 3.20)%, (24.79 +/- 3.98)%, (57.28 +/- 4.71)% and (88.28 +/- 4.65)%, respectively. In terms of the induction of apoptosis, there was a significant difference between the TA group and blank control [(1.80 +/- 1.24)%, P < 0.05]. At TA doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/L, the apoptotic rates of NB4 cells were (10.03 +/- 3.31)%, (14.87 +/- 3.65)%, (23.45 +/- 1.90)%, respectively. Besides, TA induced apoptosis of NB4 cells in a dose-dependent manner in the groups of 200 mg/L, 400 mg/L, 600 mg/L (P < 0.05). But there was no significant difference in apoptotic rates between the groups of 800 mg/L and 600 mg/L [(23.45 +/- 1.90)%, P > 0.05]. In the group of 800 mg/L, the necrotic cells increased highly and the necrotic rate reached (45.65 +/- 3.16)%. After TA treatment of NB4 cells at different concentrations (200, 400, 600 mg/L), the expression of NF-kappaB protein was significantly decreased compared with that of the blank control (9.79 +/- 0.95, P < 0.05), while Akt protein was not significantly decreased (P > 0.05).

Blood smear reflex examination is dependent of the expertise of a cytologist, time-consuming and not always informative. Therefore, rapid and easy orientation parameters are clearly needed to discriminate malignant from RL. METHODS: The differential performed by the Beckman-Coulter analyzers is based on the determination of three parameters (volume, conductivity and scatter of the cell subpopulations) called cellular population data (CPD). This study evaluated CPD in 332 patients with a typical B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 90 patients with other B-lymphoproliferative diseases (OLPD) and 55 patients with a proven RL, and established a discriminating protocol to identify these pathologies. Secondly, this approach was evaluated in a prospective study including 102 patients with lymphocyte counts above 3.5 x 10(9)/L and in each case the diagnosis suggested by CPD was compared with conventional flow cytometry (FC) analysis and that obtained using CytoDiff reagent, a combination of six antibodies/five colors which performs a rapid WBC differential by FC. RESULTS: Lymphocyte anisocytosis was observed for malignant and RL. A low lymphocyte volume identifies monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and classical B-CLL. CytoDiff analysis is helpful when lymphocyte volume is in the normal range. A ratio B-Ly/total Ly count >0.32 is suggestive of a B-malignancy, whereas a non-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte count above 2.43 x 10(9)/L suggests RL. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of CPD in combination with CytoDiff analysis shows promise for the rapid and accurate identification of lymphocyte pathologies in routine practice.",,"['Jean, Arnaud', 'Boutet, Catherine', 'Lenormand, Bernard', 'Callat, Marie-Paule', 'Buchonnet, Gerard', 'Leclerc, Carole', 'Vasse, Marc']","['Jean A', 'Boutet C', 'Lenormand B', 'Callat MP', 'Buchonnet G', 'Leclerc C', 'Vasse M']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Biologique and IHU, CHU Charles Nicolle, Rouen, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110830,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies/analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Electric Conductivity', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count/*methods', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*pathology']",2011/08/31 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/08/31 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/CCLM.2011.680 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2011 Nov;49(11):1861-8. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2011.680.

The introduction of arsenic trioxide, or ATO, in 1994 has provided the opportunity to minimize and even eliminate standard cytotoxic chemotherapy from initial treatment regimens without compromising the excellent outcomes achieved by anthracycline-containing protocols. APL is a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia that is curable with targeted therapies and potentially without exposure to conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapy.

We have searched for potential oncogenes by screening cDNA libraries derived from gastric cancer cell lines, pancreatic cancer cell lines and glioma cell lines, using retrovirus-mediated expression cloning. Two types of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell lines, Ba/F3 and HF6, were transduced with the cDNA libraries and several genes that render these cells factor-independent were identified including PIM-1, PIM-2, PIM-3, GADD45B and reproductive homeobox genes on the X chromosome gene F2 (RHOXF2). Although no mutation in these genes was found, these molecules were highly expressed in cancer cell lines and they may play important roles in cell transformation. Among them, we focused on a transcriptional repressor RHOXF2. Transduction of RHOXF2 rendered HF6 cells factor-independent, while knockdown of RHOXF2 inhibited growth of the HGC27 gastric cancer cell line which highly expresses RHOXF2. In addition, RHOXF2-transduced HF6 cells quickly induced leukemia when transplanted into sublethally irradiated mice.

The introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib into clinical practice has far exceeded expectations and resurrected hope that the fundamental insights from the ""war on cancer"" can lead to significant therapeutic advances. Nevertheless, the current perception among clinicians is that imatinib and its newer more potent cousins offer superb long-term disease control for most patients, but that cure without transplantation has remained elusive. However, several important laboratory-based observations over the last few years have changed those perceptions. Several of those developments are discussed here, including direct manipulation of the apoptosis pathway in cancer cells and prevention of disease progression with the use of antioxidants. Intriguing results from a French study indicate that, if disease progression is halted, a small but significant group of patients may be able to stop imatinib therapy without disease recurrence. And for patients whose disease, because of resistant stem cells, needs a more direct attack than tyrosine kinase inhibitors alone, several approaches investigated in laboratory and animal models seem promising, and some are ripe for clinical testing, including inhibitors of Smoothened and 5-lipoxygenase, and suppression of autophagy.

We compared the outcomes of 135 consecutively treated AML and myelodysplastic syndrome patients who underwent allogeneic HPCT at our institution with BUCY2 using oral (n=93) or i.v. (n=42) BU, without dose adjustment. The i.v. BU patients had a lower incidence of any severity of oral mucositis (3 versus 55%, P=0.002) and severe mucositis (3 versus 24%, P=0.005). Other post transplant outcomes were comparable between the groups. In all 26 i.v. BU and 33 oral BU patients are alive; however, the median follow-up was significantly longer for the oral BU group. One- and two-year non-relapse mortality for the i.v. BU patients was 21% for both, and for the oral BU group was 23% and 29%, respectively. One- and two-year relapse mortality for the i.v.

Here we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) follows a CSC model on the basis of sorting multiple populations from each of 16 primary human AML samples and identifying which contain leukemia stem cells (LSCs) using a sensitive xenograft assay. Analysis of gene expression from all functionally validated populations yielded an LSC-specific signature. Similarly, a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene signature was established. Bioinformatic analysis identified a core transcriptional program shared by LSCs and HSCs, revealing the molecular machinery underlying 'stemness' properties. Both stem cell programs were highly significant independent predictors of patient survival and were found in existing prognostic signatures.

Using Medicaid enrollment as a proxy for poverty, we aimed to assess potential disparities in survival after a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in a nonelderly population. METHODS: We used records from the New York (NY) and California (CA) state cancer registries linked to Medicaid enrollment records for these states to identify Medicaid enrolled and nonenrolled patients aged 21-64 years with incident diagnoses of AML or HL in 2002-2006. We compared overall survival for the two groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: For HL, the adjusted risk for death for Medicaid enrolled compared with nonenrolled patients was 1.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-2.68) in NY and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.43-2.49) in CA. In contrast, for AML, Medicaid enrollment had no effect on survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84-1.19 in NY and hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89-1.16 in CA). These results persisted despite adjusting for race/ethnicity and other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Poverty does not affect survival for AML patients but does appear to be associated with survival for HL patients, who, in contrast to AML patients, require complex outpatient treatment. Challenges for the poor in adhering to treatment regimens for HL could explain this disparity and merit further study.",,"['Yung, Rachel L', 'Chen, Kun', 'Abel, Gregory A', 'Gesten, Foster C', 'Roohan, Patrick J', 'Boscoe, Francis P', 'Sinclair, Amber H', 'Schymura, Maria J', 'Schrag, Deborah']","['Yung RL', 'Chen K', 'Abel GA', 'Gesten FC', 'Roohan PJ', 'Boscoe FP', 'Sinclair AH', 'Schymura MJ', 'Schrag D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Center for Outcomes and Policy Research, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Adult', 'California', 'Female', 'Health Status Disparities', '*Healthcare Disparities', '*Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Insurance', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', '*Medicaid', 'Middle Aged', 'New York', 'Poverty', 'Registries', 'United States/epidemiology']",2011/08/30 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/08/30 06:00'],"['2011/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['16/8/1082 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0126 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2011;16(8):1082-91. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0126.,PMC3228153,,"['R01 CA131847/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA131847-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical associations, and prognostic significance of SNP rs11554137 in unselected pediatric and adult AML patients. Diagnostic marrow specimens from 527 AML patients treated on the pediatric trial Children's Oncology Group-AAML03P1 (N = 253) or adult SWOG trials (N = 274) were analyzed for the presence of the SNP. SNP rs11554137 was present in 11% of all patients. SNP status had no prognostic impact on survival in pediatric patients. In adult AML, overall survival for SNP-positive patients was 10% versus 18% for SNP-negative patients (P = .44). Among the 142 adults who achieved complete remission, 5-year relapse-free survival was significantly worse for SNP-positive patients (0% vs 25%, P = .0014). However, among adults with normal cytogenetics, FLT3/ITD was present in 90% of SNP-positive patients versus 59% of SNP-negative patients (P = .0053). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for the effects of age, cytogenetics, and FLT3/ITD, the independent prognostic effect of SNP positivity was not statistically significant (hazard ratio = 1.72, P = .18). The clinical profile of SNP-positive patients suggests that SNP rs11554137 may have biologic effects that bear further investigation.

In the absence of Tat and MLL, however, it is unclear how SEC is targeted to RNA polymerase (Pol) II to stimulate elongation in general. Furthermore, although ENL and AF9 can bind the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1L, it is unclear whether these bindings are required for SEC-mediated transcription. Here, we show that the homologous ENL and AF9 exist in separate SECs with similar but nonidentical functions. ENL/AF9 contacts the scaffolding protein AFF4 that uses separate domains to recruit different subunits into SEC. ENL/AF9 also exists outside SEC when bound to Dot1L, which is found to inhibit SEC function. The YEATS domain of ENL/AF9 targets SEC to Pol II on chromatin through contacting the human Polymerase-Associated Factor complex (PAFc) complex.

Somatic loss-of-function mutations of TET2 are frequently observed in patients with diverse myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. By analyzing mice with targeted disruption of the Tet2 catalytic domain, we show here that Tet2 is a critical regulator of self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Tet2 deficiency led to decreased genomic levels of 5hmC and augmented the size of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pool in a cell-autonomous manner. In competitive transplantation assays, Tet2-deficient HSCs were capable of multilineage reconstitution and possessed a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in enhanced hematopoiesis into both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. In vitro, Tet2 deficiency delayed HSC differentiation and skewed development toward the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Our data indicate that Tet2 has a critical role in regulating the expansion and function of HSCs, presumably by controlling 5hmC levels at genes important for the self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of HSCs.",,"['Ko, Myunggon', 'Bandukwala, Hozefa S', 'An, Jungeun', 'Lamperti, Edward D', 'Thompson, Elizabeth C', 'Hastie, Ryan', 'Tsangaratou, Angeliki', 'Rajewsky, Klaus', 'Koralov, Sergei B', 'Rao, Anjana']","['Ko M', 'Bandukwala HS', 'An J', 'Lamperti ED', 'Thompson EC', 'Hastie R', 'Tsangaratou A', 'Rajewsky K', 'Koralov SB', 'Rao A']","['Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110822,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Dioxygenases', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Homeostasis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",2011/08/30 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/08/30 06:00'],"['2011/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1112317108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1112317108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Aug 30;108(35):14566-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1112317108.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HB-EGF is a therapeutic target for T-ALL, and to further elucidate the antitumor effects of a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197). We elucidated the expression of HB-EGF in T-ALL cell lines, and evaluated the effect of CRM197 on these cells alone or in combination with anticancer agent. The expression of EGFR and EGFR ligands was determined by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. Induction of apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. HB-EGF was strongly expressed by T-ALL cell lines, and the expression of both HB-EGF and EGFR was enhanced by doxorubicin.

The associated risks and mortality are known to significantly increase on exposure to alcohol (chronic or acute). The underlying mechanisms of the association of acute ethanol ingestion and poor prognosis of sepsis are largely unknown. The study described here was designed to determine in detail the role of ethanol and TLR4 in the pathogenesis of the sepsis syndrome. The effects of acute ethanol exposure and TLR4 on bacterial clearance, spleen cell numbers, peritoneal macrophage numbers, and cytokine production were evaluated using wild-type and TLR4 hyporesponsive mice treated with ethanol and then challenged with a nonpathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. Ethanol-treated mice exhibited a decreased clearance of bacteria and produced lesser amounts of most pro-inflammatory cytokines in both strains of mice at 2h after challenge. Neither ethanol treatment nor a hyporesponsive TLR4 had significant effects on the cell numbers in the peritoneal cavity and spleen 2h postinfection. The suppressive effect of acute ethanol exposure on cytokine and chemokine production was more pronounced in the wild-type mice, but the untreated hyporesponsive mice produced less of most cytokines than untreated wild-type mice. The major conclusion of this study is that acute ethanol exposure suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production and that a hyporesponsive TLR4 (in C3H/HeJ mice) decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, but the cytokines and other mediators induced through other receptors are sufficient to ultimately clear the infection but not enough to induce lethal septic shock. In addition, results reported here demonstrate previously unknown effects of acute ethanol exposure on leukemia inhibitory factor and eotaxin, and provide the first evidence that interleukin (IL)-9 is induced through TLR4 in vivo.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A large set of antigens, covering viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites may be needed. Recombinant proteins have a prime role in serological tests. Suspension arrays offer high throughput for simultaneous measurement of many different antibodies. We here describe a rational process for preparation, purification and coupling to beads of recombinant proteins prepared in Escherichia coli derivate Origami B, to be used in a serological Luminex suspension array. All six Gag and Env proteins (p10, p12, p15, p30, gp70 and p15E), from the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), were prepared, allowing the creation of a multiepitope XMRV antibody assay. The procedure is generic and allows production of protein antigens ready for serological testing in a few working days. Instability and aggregation problems were circumvented by expression of viral proteins fused to a carrier protein (thioredoxin A; TrxA), purification via inclusion body formation, urea solubilization, His tag affinity chromatography and direct covalent coupling to microspheres without removal of the elution buffer. The yield of one preparation (2-10mg fusion protein per 100ml culture) was enough for 20-100 coupling reactions, sufficing for tests of many tens of thousands of sera. False serological positivity due to antibodies binding to TrxA and to traces of E. coli proteins remaining in the preparation could be reduced by preabsorption of sera with free TrxA and E. coli extract. The recombinant antigens were evaluated using anti-XMRV antibodies. Although hybrid proteins expressed in E. coli in this way will not have the entire tertiary structure and posttranslational modifications of the native proteins, they contain a large subset of the epitopes associated with them. The described strategy is simple, quick, efficient and cheap. It should be applicable for suspension array serology in general.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The Q223R polymorphism of the leptin receptor gene is associated with the increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Body exhausting treatment administered to children suffering from ALL, combined with potentially disadvantageous polymorphism, may lead to developing obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure, all of which constitute the metabolic syndrome factors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the hetero- and homozygote frequencies for the Q223R polymorphism of the leptin receptor gene in the examined group of Caucasian children and adolescents suffering from ALL, compared to the control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 95 children underwent genetic testing (52 children in the examined group, with 43 children in the control group), all of them being treated in Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Medical University of Bialystok. The examined group consisted of 31 boys and 21 girls, with 30 and 13 subjects in the control group, respectively. The division into heterozygotes and homozygotes of the leptin receptor gene polymorphism was established by the RFLPmethod (restrictedfragmentlength polymorphism), using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Products obtained from that reaction were splitted by means of 4% agarose gel electrophoresis. To determine the importance of differencies between the frequency of alleles and the frequency of genotypes for the set groups, a software--DE-FINETTI DIAGRAM and Hardy-Weinberg test was used, p < 0.05 is concluded to be a statistically significant result. RESULTS: In the examined group there were observed slightly higher frequencies of heterozygous individuals with the AG genotype (50%), compared to GG genotype (28.8%) and AA genotype (21.2%). In the control group the genotype distribution was as follows: AG genotype --48.8%, GG genotype--39.5% and AA individuals--11.6%. No significant differences were observed between the set groups in question.

This disorder arises as a direct consequence of mutational events induced by the primary treatment. The outcomes for these patients have been historically poor compared to people who develop AML de novo. Currently comprising 10-20% of all cases of AML, t-MN is relatively resistant to conventional leukemia therapies, and is associated with s ort survival times. Median life expectancy from diagnosis is about 8-10 months in most series. Although the spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities in t-AML is similar to AML de novo, the frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics, such as a complex karyotype or deletion or loss of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, is considerably higher in t-MN. Two distinct groups of patients with t-MN have been described. The more common subtype, seen in about 75% of patients, typically occurs 5-7 years after first exposure to alkylating agents or radiation, is often preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and is frequently accompanied by clonal cytogenetic abnormalities such as the loss of all or part of chromosomes 5 or 7. Mutations of the P53 tumor suppressor gene are also common. The risk is related to total cumulative exposure over time to alkylating agents. In contrast, among individuals who develop t-AML after treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors, the latency period to the development of t-AML is often only 1-3 years, antecedent MDS is rare, and gene rearrangements involving MLL at 11q23 or RUNX1/AML1 at 21q22 are common. It is now well recognized that APL and other subtypes of AML with balanced translocations sometimes occur as therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) in patients who have previously received cytotoxic therapy or ionizing radiation therapy (RT). The most of this review will focus on these ""good risk"" leukemias, i.e. those with APL or inv(16)/t(16;16) or t(8;21).",,"['Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M']","['Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM']","['Department of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Chicago, Chicago IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110708,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2011/08/27 06:00,2011/08/27 06:01,['2011/08/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.032 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011032 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011032. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.032.

It is essential that after a histologic diagnosis is obtained, the tissue is validated to have an immunoglobulin light chain composition so patients are spared unnecessary chemotherapy. The disease prognosis and patient monitoring are linked to serialized measurement of cardiac biomarkers and immunoglobulin-free light chains. Most patients require cytotoxic chemotherapy. For some patients, this therapy involves stem cell collection and myeloablative chemotherapy; for others, chemotherapy includes an alkylator and a corticosteroid; and for some, it involves addition of a novel agent in the form of an immunomodulatory drug or a proteasome inhibitor.

These cancers include lymphomas, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, kidney and cervical cancers, Kaposi sarcoma and neuroblastoma. There are no reports of an increased acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in settings of immune suppression. This is curious because some data suggest the immune suppression may be important in increasing AML risk in experimental settings, and that immune stimulation may be useful in treating AML. To see whether immune suppression is correlated with an increased risk of developing AML, we analyzed data from 248224 recipients of kidney (N=217219) and heart (N=31005) transplants. Among the kidney transplant recipients, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for developing AML was 1.90 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.4; P<0.001). Among the heart transplant recipients, the SIR was 5.1 (3.4-7.1; P<0.001).

CMC-544 induced dose-dependent cell kill in the majority of BCP-ALL cells, although IC(50) values varied substantially (median 4.8 ng/ml, range 0.1-1000 ng/ml at 48 h). The efficacy of CMC-544 was highly dependent on calicheamicin sensitivity and CD22/CMC-544 internalization capacity of BCP-ALL cells, but hardly on basal and renewed CD22 expression. Although CD22 expression was essential for uptake of CMC-544, a repetitive loop of CD22 saturation, CD22/CMC-544 internalization and renewed CD22 expression was not required to achieve intracellular threshold levels of calicheamicin sufficient for efficient CMC-544-induced apoptosis in BCP-ALL cells. This is in contrast to studies with the comparable CD33 immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, in which complete and prolonged CD33 saturation was required for apoptosis induction. These data suggest that CMC-544 treatment may result in higher response rates in ALL compared with response rates obtained in AML with Mylotarg, and that therefore clinical studies in ALL, preferably with multiple low CMC-544 dosages, are warranted.",,"['de Vries, J F', 'Zwaan, C M', 'De Bie, M', 'Voerman, J S A', 'den Boer, M L', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'van der Velden, V H J']","['de Vries JF', 'Zwaan CM', 'De Bie M', 'Voerman JS', 'den Boer ML', 'van Dongen JJ', 'van der Velden VH']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110826,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology']",2011/08/27 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/08/27 06:00'],"['2011/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011206 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.206 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Feb;26(2):255-64. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.206.

Therefore, resistance of tumour cells to therapy can be caused by a failure in the ability to initiate apoptosis. Defects in apoptosis signalling pathways are also one of the main features of cancer, and particularly acute leukaemia. Malignant cells constantly resist the effects of cellular stress (e.g. DNA damage, oncogene activation), which would cause death of normal cells through apoptosis. Dysregulation of apoptosis has therefore give rise to tumour growth, disease progression and resistance of malignant cells to chemotherapy. Structural analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins playing a key role in regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis together with studies of their biochemical functions have outlines strategies for generation of drugs, resulting in numerous novel chemical entities with potential to reverse resistance of malignant cells to apoptosis.

Immunization with leukemia-associated antigens, such as Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) peptides, induces a T-cell population that is tumor antigen specific. We determined whether allogeneic BMT combined with immunotherapy using WT1 peptide vaccination of donors induced more potent antitumor activity than either therapy alone. WT1 peptide vaccinations of healthy donor mice induced CD8(+) T cells that were specifically reactive to WT1-expressing FBL3 leukemia cells. We found that peptide immunization was effective as a prophylactic vaccination before tumor challenge, yet was ineffective as a therapeutic vaccination in tumor-bearing mice. BMT from vaccinated healthy MHC-matched donors, but not syngeneic donors, into recipient tumor-bearing mice was effective as a therapeutic maneuver and resulted in eradication of FBL3 leukemia. The transfer of total CD8(+) T cells from immunized donors was more effective than the transfer of WT1-tetramer(+)CD8(+) T cells and both required CD4(+) T-cell help for maximal antitumor activity. These findings show that WT1 peptide vaccination of donor mice can dramatically enhance GvT activity after MHC-matched allogeneic BMT.",,"['Kohrt, Holbrook E', 'Muller, Antonia', 'Baker, Jeanette', 'Goldstein, Matthew J', 'Newell, Evan', 'Dutt, Suparna', 'Czerwinski, Debra', 'Lowsky, Robert', 'Strober, Samuel']","['Kohrt HE', 'Muller A', 'Baker J', 'Goldstein MJ', 'Newell E', 'Dutt S', 'Czerwinski D', 'Lowsky R', 'Strober S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110825,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/*therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Vaccines, Subunit/administration & dosage/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2011/08/27 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/08/27 06:00'],"['2011/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40384-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-356238 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 10;118(19):5319-29. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-356238.

We previously showed that these proteins were inhibited by E7123, a new celecoxib derivative with antitumor activity, in acute myeloid leukemia. However, little is known about FAs in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This paper aimed to determine whether E7123 was effective against DLBCL and whether FAs were involved in its action. We evaluated the cytotoxicity and mechanism of action of E7123 and celecoxib in DLBCL cell lines. We also assessed the E7123 in vivo activity in a DLBCL xenograft model and studied FA signaling in primary DLBCL patient samples. We found that E7123 showed higher antitumor effect than celecoxib against DLBCL cells. Its mechanism of action involved deregulation of FA, AKT, and Mcl-1 proteins, a pathway that is activated in some patient samples, apoptosis-inducing factor release and induction of caspase-independent cell death. Moreover, E7123 showed suppression of in vivo tumor growth. These findings indicate that E7123 is effective against DLBCL in vitro and in vivo, with a mechanism of action that differs from that of most current therapies for this malignancy.

The interactions between proapoptotic and pro-survival proteins of the Bcl-2 family are critical for this process. In this report, we show that expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Puma was selectively up-regulated on in vitro activation with antigens or mitogens of both human and mouse B cells. Puma expression coincided in vivo, with the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 within the germinal centers and its expression correlates with the germinal center like phenotype of Burkitt lymphoma. Experiments performed in Puma-deficient mice revealed that Puma is essential for apoptosis of mitogen-activated B cells in vitro and for the control of memory B-cell survival. In conclusion, using both human and murine models, our data show that Puma has a major role in the T cell- dependent B-cell immune response.

Clinical results with FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy have shown that bone marrow responses are commonly less pronounced than peripheral blood responses. We investigated the role of p53 in bone marrow stromal cells in stromal cell-mediated resistance to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 mutant AML. While the FLT3 inhibitor FI-700 induced apoptosis in FLT3 mutant AML cells, apoptosis induction was diminished under stromal coculture conditions. Protection appeared to be mediated, in part, by CXCL12 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 signaling. The protective effect of stromal cells was significantly reduced by pre-exposure to the HDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a. p53 activation by Nutlin-3a was not cytotoxic to stromal cells, but reduced CXCL12 mRNA levels and secretion of CXCL12 partially through p53-mediated HIF-1alpha down-regulation. Results show that p53 activation in stroma cells blunts stroma cell-mediated resistance to FLT3 inhibition, in part through down-regulation of CXCL12. This is the first report of Nutlin effect on the bone marrow environment.

Monitoring this active form could provide crucial information for optimizing treatment regimens based on Cl-F-ara-A. A simple, isocratic HPLC method was developed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples (500 mul) from leukemic cells were loaded onto an anion-exchange column and eluted with a phosphate-acetonitrile buffer (flow rate: 0.7 ml/min) at ambient temperature. The Cl-F-ara-ATP concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 254 nm. RESULTS: The standard curve was linear, with minimal within-day and inter-day variability. Recovery was excellent; low and high quantitation limits were 10 pmol and 5,000 pmol, respectively. Cl-F-ara-ATP eluted independently of ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP. Production of Cl-F-ara-ATP was successfully measured in cultured leukemia HL-60 cells treated in vitro with Cl-F-ara-A.

In this study, we investigate the apoptotic effects induced by GA in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, and clarify the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that GA reduced the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. GA led to G(0)/G(1) phase arrest in HL-60 cells through promoting p21 and p27 and inhibiting the levels of cyclin D and cyclin E. GA caused DNA damage and fragmentation in HL-60 cells as assayed using DAPI staining and Comet assay. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that GA increased Ca(2+) levels and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in HL-60 cells. Apoptotic protein expressions were determined by Western blotting. The results indicated that GA-mediated apoptosis of HL-60 cells mainly depended on mitochondrial pathway, by promoting the release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G) and by up-regulating the protein expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), caspase-4, caspase-9 and caspase-3. In addition, GA also activated the death receptor-dependent pathway by enhancing the protein expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS), FAS ligand (FASL), caspase-8 and BCL-2 interacting domain (BID). We determined the mRNA expression of the gene levels of these proteins by real-time PCR. The results showed that GA-mediated apoptosis of HL-60 cells mainly depended on up-regulation of the mRNA of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, AIF and Endo G.

DESIGN: Prospective investigation. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Fifty-one male long-term survivors and 56 age-matched controls (median age of survivors at ALL diagnosis was 5 years, range: 1 to 15 years, and at the study 29 years, range: 26 to 38 years). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Testicular size (mean value of both testicular volumes), serum hormone concentrations, semen quality, and number of children fathered correlated with ALL therapy. RESULT(S): Survivors treated with 0-10 g/m(2) of cyclophosphamide had sperm quality and fertility rates comparable with those of controls, but the serum free-testosterone in the survivors treated with cyclophosphamide was lower than in controls (median: 213 pmol/L, range: 189-260 vs. 296 pmol/L, range: 242-338, respectively). Cranial irradiation without cyclophosphamide did not affect semen quality, fertility, or testosterone levels. None of the survivors of a high cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide (>20 g/m(2)) and testicular irradiation (10-24 Gy) had fathered a child. Testicular size was shown to be better than serum inhibin B in predicting nonazoospermic semen samples or fertility. CONCLUSION(S): Treatment of childhood ALL with 0-10 g/m(2) of cyclophosphamide and cranial irradiation does not affect fertility or semen quality but may impair long-term Leydig cell function.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

The most common and best-characterized mechanism of secondary imatinib resistance in CML is the development of kinase domain mutations in the BCR-ABL gene. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib or nilotinib, overcome most of these mutations, but they are not effective against the T315I mutant. To determine whether these mutations contribute to clinical resistance, it is necessary to monitor the ratio of the mutant and wild-type forms. Here, we developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Invader assay for comparative quantitative analysis (qPI assay) of BCR-ABL transcripts with the T315I mutant clone. T315I ratios were calculated for the wild-type and mutant fold-over-zero (FOZ) values. In examination with 2 kinds of plasmids containing wild-type or T315I mutant PCR amplicons, mutant FOZ values were detected down to 1% of the total. The results of 12 serial samples from 2 patients (case A: Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and case B: CML) with the T315I mutant clone were compared with those of direct sequencing or 2 kinds of allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR. All samples showed the T315I mutation by qPI assay and ASO-PCR, and 10 samples showed it by direct sequencing. Significant correlation (correlation coefficient; r2 = 0.951) was noted between the qPI assay and quantitative ASO-PCR to analyze T315I mutant ratios. Thus, the qPI assay is a useful method for evaluating the T315I mutant clone in BCR-ABL transcripts.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Mosby, Inc.

Reactive retinal glial changes have been observed in glaucoma but the role of such glial changes in the pathogenesis of the condition remains unclear. In the present study we found that retinal ganglion cells in an experimental animal model of glaucoma have an increased axon regenerative potential. Regeneration of adult rat retinal ganglion cell axons after optic nerve crush was significantly increased in vivo when combined with intraocular pressure-induced experimental glaucoma. This enhanced axon regeneration response was correlated with a significant increase in activation of glial fibrillary acidic protein+retinal glia. Using a dissociated retinal ganglion cell culture model we showed that reducing the number of activated retinal glia with a glial specific toxin, alpha-Aminoadipic acid, significantly reduced the growth potential of retinal ganglion cells from glaucomatous rat eyes, suggesting that activated retinal glia mediate, at least in part, the growth promoting effect. This was shown to be mediated by both membrane-bound and soluble glial-derived factors. Neurotrophin and ciliary neurotrophic/leukemia inhibitory factor blockers did not affect the regenerative potential, excluding these growth factors as principal mediators of the enhanced growth response occurring in glaucomatous retinal cultures. These observations are the first to reveal that retinal ganglion cells from glaucomatous rat eyes have an enhanced regenerative capacity. Furthermore, our results suggest that activated retinal glia mediate at least part of this response.

We therefore evaluated IBMI safety in reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, we used unwashed cord blood to avoid stem cell loss. Ten patients (median age = 61 years old) were enrolled. Cord blood cells were thawed at the bedside and injected into 4 iliac bone sites (2 at each hemipelvis). The procedure was well tolerated with no injection-related complications. Nine patients achieved donor engraftment. The median time to neutrophil recovery (>0.5 x 10(9)/L) was 17 days, and platelet recovery was achieved in 8 patients. Early full donor chimerism was achieved (median of 15 and 20 days in T cells and myeloid cells, respectively). Three of 9 evaluable patients developed grade II to III GVHD, and 5 of 10 patients died of treatment-related toxicities. The probability of survival at 1 year was 46.7%.

The results showed that (1) the expression of WT1 gene in newly diagnosed AML children was higher than that of the normal controls and the patients with remission (p < 0.001); there were no significant difference of WT1 gene expression between AML patients with remission and normal controls (p > 0.05), which were same as in relapsed patients and newly diagnosed patients (p > 0.05); (2) WT1 gene in 20 newly diagnosed AML children highly expressed before the children were initially treated, decreased when they were complete remission, then expression increased again when their AML relapsed. The WT1 gene expression level began to rise in 5 cases before clinical relapse at 5 - 7 months; (3) the complete remission rate (CR) and 3 year overall survival (OS) did not show significant difference between the WT1-positive group and negative group when dynamically monitoring WT1 gene expression of 20 newly diagnosed children with AML. 3-year OS of WT1-positive group at the 22 - 30 days after initial treatment was significantly lower than that of the negative group (p < 0.05). It is concluded that SYBR Green Ireal-time RT-PCR is a rapid, efficient, sensitive and specific method. WT1 gene in AML childhood plays a role of cancer-promoting. The change of WT1 gene expression level contributes to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, detect the minimal residual diseases and analyze the prognosis.",,"['Zhang, Rong', 'Sun, Huai-Qiang', 'Li, Ge', 'Bai, Feng-Yan', 'Yang, Yang', 'Jing, Qing', 'Shi, Yu-Jun', 'Yang, Ji-Yun']","['Zhang R', 'Sun HQ', 'Li G', 'Bai FY', 'Yang Y', 'Jing Q', 'Shi YJ', 'Yang JY']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. zzrr0007@sohu.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2011/08/27 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2011/08/27 06:00'],"['2011/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)04-0959-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Aug;19(4):959-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTX plasma concentration was dynamically detected and evaluated so as to avoid or reduce the side effects of HD-MTX, and adjust the time and dosage of calcium folinate (CF) or carry out the plasma exchange as occasion requires. Totally 180 cases of ALL were enrolled in this study, and received 380 administration of HD-MTX-CF + VDT protocol, including 122 patients with induction therapy as well as 58 cases during maintenance therapy, among which 68 cases were defined as low risk, 80 cases as middle risk and 32 cases as high risk. 2.0 g/m(2) MTX, 3.0 g/m(2) MTX, and 5.0 g/m(2) MTX were individually used according to low risk, middle risk or T immunohistochemical expression. The results indicated that 36.3% cases showed the side-effects of HD-MTX including mucocutaneous lesions, gastrointestinal reaction, hepatic dysfunction, renal damage, fever, myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, infection and allergic response. All of these side effects were reversible through treatment. The elimination delay of MTX occurred in 110 cases, out of which 3 cases got MTX concentration > 10 micromol/L at 24 hours, 50 cases > 1.0 micromol/L at 44 hours, the remaining 57 cases > 0.1 micromol/L at 68 hours. CF dosage was adjusted according to the concentration of MTX until it was less than 0.1 micromol/L. 1 case had renal interstitial inflammation and acute renal failure, but finally he was cured. No patients received plasma exchange or died. It is concluded that the extramedullary leukemia control protocol, in which MTX is main drug, is effective therapy for obtaining long-term remission and event-free survival rate in ALL patients, but the side effects and risks increase along with the increase of MTX dose. The metabolic level of HD-MTX has found to be obvious individual, so the dynamic monitoring of MTX concentration in plasma and administration of proper dosage of CF are important factors for HD-MTX protocol application in ALL patients.",,"['Wang, Hong', 'Chi, Zuo-Fei', 'Li, Shuang', 'Wang, Xiu-Li', 'Hao, Liang-Chun']","['Wang H', 'Chi ZF', 'Li S', 'Wang XL', 'Hao LC']","['Department of Pediatrics, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. wang_hong354@hotmail.com']",['chi'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy']",2011/08/27 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2011/08/27 06:00'],"['2011/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)04-0949-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Aug;19(4):949-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression pattern of transcription factor mRNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells during in vitro differentiation. The 2 human leukemic cell lines HL-60 and NB4 had been used as model cell lines. Differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells was induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 4 days. Morphological changes were observed by May-Grunwald Giemsa stainings, the CD11b expression level was detected by flow cytometry. Transcription factor mRNA profiles (PU.1, C/EBPalpha, epsilon, gamma, GATA-1, GATA-2) were determined by real time RT-PCR during in vitro HL-60 and NB4 differentiation; The expression level of transcription factor mRNA was relatively quantitatively analyzed by using 2(-DeltaDeltaCT) and compared with control group. The results showed that the expression levels of PU.1 and C/EBP epsilon mRNA in NB4 differentiation group were 5.75 and 6.16, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in untreated group; while the expression level of C/EBPalpha, gamma, GATA-1, GATA-2 mRNA in NB4 differentiation group were 62%, 31%, 63% and 8.7% respectively, which were significantly lower than those in untreated group; In HL-60 differentiation group, the expression levels of PU.1, C/EBPalpha, epsilon were 1.97, 1.95 and 2.35 respectively, which were significantly higher than those in untreated group; while the expression levels of C/EBPgamma, GATA-1, GATA-2 in HL-60 differentiation group were 20%, 21% and 18% respectively, which were significantly lower than those in untreated group.

As a result of these advances, standard of care in frontline therapy has started to gravitate toward dasatinib and nilotinib, although more observation is needed to fully support this. Stopping therapy altogether remains a matter of clinical trials, and more must be learned about the mechanisms underlying the persistence of leukemic cells with treatment.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the immune system may play an important role in neuronal excitability and epileptogenesis. In many animal models of epilepsy, seizures induced chemically or electrically cause glial activation and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF- alpha, IL-6). The studies show that the IL-1 beta /IL-1Ra system may modulate epileptic activity and contribute to neuronal excitability. Exogenous IL-1 beta has pro-convulsive properties. The action of TNF- alpha and IL-6 is complex (either stimulating or inhibitory action of these cytokines on seizures, depending on their concentration and the type of receptors involved in the response). In vitro and in vivo experiments show that antiepileptic drugs could affect cytokine levels (e.g. valproate significantly inhibited production of TNF- alpha and IL-6 by human monocytic leukaemia cells). In epilepsy patients studies (including ex vivo) show elevated levels of IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6 or TNF- alpha after carbamazepine, valproic acid and phenytoin.

Few studies on this topic have assessed maternal exposures. METHODS: In an Australian case-control study of ALL in children aged <15 years, parents were asked about tasks they undertook in each job using a set of job-specific modules (JSMs). An expert reviewed the likelihood of exposure to exhausts, solvents, glues, and paints. Exposure was examined in each job 2 years, 1 year and anytime before birth of the child, and up to 1 year after birth of child. RESULTS: Solvent exposure was similar for case and control mothers in all time periods. More case mothers had moderate/high exposure to exhausts than control mothers anytime before the birth of the child (p = 0.010). Exposure to moderate or substantial levels of exhausts by mothers (OR = 1.97 95% CI 0.99-3.90) or fathers (OR = 1.37 95% CI 1.01-1.86) before the birth increased the risk of ALL in their offspring.

The present study aims to explore the effect of 4-AP on the apoptosis of human AML cells and the underlying mechanism. We found 4-AP inhibited the proliferation and induces apoptosis in both AML cell lines and primary cultured human AML cells. The apoptosis of AML cells after 4-AP treatment was further confirmed by the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and activation of caspase 3 and 9. 4-AP inhibited Kv currents in NB(4), HL-60 and THP-1 cells. Furthermore, 4-AP induced significant increment in [Ca(2+)](i), which were inhibited by KN-62, a specific blocker of P(2)X(7) receptors. KN-62 also abrogated 4-AP induced apoptosis. Knockdown of P(2)X(7) receptor by small interfering RNA blocked the effect of 4-AP. Conclusively, this study indicated that 4-AP promotes apoptosis in human AML cells via increasing [Ca(2+)](i) through P(2)X(7) receptor.","['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

Induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is particularly important for the invasiveness of various cancer cells. Celastrol, a triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine, is known to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells, including leukemia, glioma, prostate and breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of celastrol on the migration and invasion of human breast carcinoma cells. RESULTS: We observed that celastrol suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced invasion and migration of MCF-7 cells. We also found that celastrol inhibited PMA-induced MMP-9 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels, and the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 in MCF-7 cells. Our results revealed that celastrol inhibited the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 by suppression of the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB in the MMP-9 promoter, and inhibited degradation of IkappaBalpha and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that celastrol inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated MMP-9 expression, resulting in suppression of breast cancer cell invasion and migration that is induced by PMA. Celastrol is a potential agent for clinical use in preventing the invasion and metastasis of human malignant breast tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

These deliver doses to all organs and tissues including red bone marrow (RBM), the tissue in which leukaemia is thought to originate. In this paper we calculate the age-dependent annual RBM doses from natural radiation sources to young people and to adults at average levels of exposure in the UK. The contributions to dose are generally less complex than in the case of doses to foetuses and young children where it is necessary to take into account transfer of radionuclides across the placenta, intakes in mother's milk and changes in gut uptake in young infants. However, there is high uptake of alkaline earths and of similar elements in the developing skeleton and this significantly affects the doses from radioisotopes of these elements, not just in the teens and twenties but through into the fifth decade of life. The total equivalent dose to the RBM from all natural sources of radiation at age 15 years is calculated to be about 1200 microSv a year at average UK levels, falling to rather less than 1100 microSv per year in later life; the gentle fall from the late teens onwards reflects the diminishing effect of the high uptakes of radioisotopes of the alkaline earths and of lead in this period. About 60% of the equivalent dose is contributed by the low linear energy transfer (LET) component. Radionuclides in food make the largest contribution to equivalent doses to RBM and much the largest contribution to the absorbed dose from high LET radiation (mainly alpha particles).",,"['Kendall, G M', 'Fell, T P']","['Kendall GM', 'Fell TP']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, Richards Building, Headington, Oxford, UK.

These mutations classically lead to complete absence of functional T and natural killer cell lineages as well as to intrinsically compromised B cell function. Although human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is highly successful in SCID-X1 patients, HLA-mismatched procedures can be associated with prolonged immunodeficiency, graft-versus-host disease, and increased overall mortality. Here, 10 children were treated with autologous CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with a conventional gammaretroviral vector. The patients did not receive myelosuppressive conditioning and were monitored for immunological recovery after cell infusion. All patients were alive after a median follow-up of 80 months (range, 54 to 107 months), and a functional polyclonal T cell repertoire was restored in all patients. Humoral immunity only partially recovered but was sufficient in some patients to allow for withdrawal of immunoglobulin replacement; however, three patients developed antibiotic-responsive acute pulmonary infection after discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis and/or immunoglobulin replacement. One patient developed acute T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia because of up-regulated expression of the proto-oncogene LMO-2 from insertional mutagenesis, but maintained a polyclonal T cell repertoire through chemotherapy and entered remission. Therefore, gene therapy for SCID-X1 without myelosuppressive conditioning effectively restored T cell immunity and was associated with high survival rates for up to 9 years.

The study enrolled 288 patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 200) or imatinib-intolerant (n = 88) CML and no other previous kinase inhibitor exposure. At 24 weeks, 31% of patients achieved major cytogenetic response (primary end point).

Introduction of T-cell receptor (TCR) variable beta-chain (Vbeta) monoclonal antibodies has facilitated identification and enumeration of clonal CTLs by flow cytometry. A highly skewed TCR Vbeta repertoire identified by flow cytometry is strongly associated with monoclonal CDR3 regions by quantitative sequencing and positive TCRgamma rearrangement assays. Therefore, Vbeta expansions can serve as surrogate markers of CTL clonality to assess clonal kinetics in T-LGLL.

We investigated whether ZAP-70 can directly govern migration and the underlying mechanisms. In the ZAP-70 stably transfected Ramos cell line, IgM stimulation, but no IgD, enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and Syk, and delayed IgM and CD79b internalization. In contrast, in the Raji cell line, where ZAP-70 was constitutively phosphorylated, ERK1/2, but not Akt, was phosphorylated, suggesting that MAPK pathway mediates ZAP-70 effects. BCR stimulation modulated the expression of CCR7, CXCR4, CXCR5, CD44, CD49d, and CD62L, which were up-regulated in ZAP-70-positive CLL primary subclones. The most dramatic change after BCR engagement in ZAP-70-transfected cells was CCR7 up-regulation, this being impaired by ERK1/2 inhibition and translating into both increased signaling and migration toward CCL21. Primary CLL subclones with high ZAP-70 expression showed increased migration toward CCL21. In conclusion, ZAP-70 ectopic expression led to enhanced BCR signaling after IgM stimulation and increased the expression of CCR7 predominantly via ERK1/2, increasing the response and migration toward CCL21. In primary CLL samples, cellular subsets with high ZAP-70 expression had increased expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors in addition to an enhanced ability to migrate toward CCL21.",,"['Calpe, Eva', 'Codony, Carles', 'Baptista, Maria Joao', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Carpio, Cecilia', 'Purroy, Noelia', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Crespo, Marta']","['Calpe E', 'Codony C', 'Baptista MJ', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Carpio C', 'Purroy N', 'Bosch F', 'Crespo M']","[""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110824,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL21/*immunology', '*Chemotaxis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Receptors, CCR7/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*immunology']",2011/08/26 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/08/26 06:00'],"['2011/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41015-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-333682 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Oct 20;118(16):4401-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-333682.

Fifteen proteins thought to function in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) comprise what is known as the FA-BRCA pathway. Activation of this pathway leads to the monoubiquitylation and chromatin localization of FANCD2 and FANCI. It has previously been shown that FANCJ interacts with the mismatch repair (MMR) complex MutLalpha. Here we show that FANCD2 interacts with the MMR proteins MSH2 and MLH1. FANCD2 monoubiquitylation, foci formation and chromatin loading are greatly diminished in MSH2-deficient cells. Human or mouse cells lacking MSH2 or MLH1 display increased sensitivity and radial formation in response to treatment with DNA crosslinking agents. Studies in human cell lines and Drosophila mutants suggest an epistatic relationship between FANCD2, MSH2 and MLH1 with regard to ICL repair. Surprisingly, the interaction between MSH2 and MLH1 is compromised in multiple FA cell lines, and FA cell lines exhibit deficient MMR. These results suggest a significant role for MMR proteins in the activation of the FA pathway and repair of ICLs.

Three major types of treatment (excluding cellular therapy) are currently available in onco-hematology: conventional chemotherapy, small molecules for targeted therapy and monoclonal antibodies. Conventional chemotherapy with optimization of doses and multidrug-based regimens allowed to substantially improve survival of patients and keeps a place of choice in treatment of these diseases. Targeted treatments came from the cytogenetic and molecular characterization of hemopathies. Thus, the kinase Bcr-Abl, as a result of the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), has been successfully targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Molecular abnormalities like internal-tandem duplication/point activating mutations in FLT3 in some acute myeloblastic leukemia or epigenetic dysregulations in some blood malignancies can also be targeted by small molecules. Hematopoietic malignant cells are phenotypically characterized by expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) on their surface. These CD are detected by flow cytometry using specific antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different CD have been developed for treatment. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, was the first monoclonal antibody successfully developed for treatment of malignant hematologic diseases. Since rituximab, many other monoclonal antibodies are being developed. Trends in malignant hematologic diseases presented here will include treatments, which have at least entered phase I/II clinical trials in adult or childhood leukemia. They include some novel drugs of conventional chemotherapy like second-generation nucleoside analogues. We will give an overview of the small molecules targeting the different cellular pathways and we will highlight those appearing as the most promising like novel TKIs.

SHIP1 mediates its regulatory function after relocalization from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it converts its substrate PI(3,4,5)P(3) to PI(3,4)P(2) thereby terminating PI3-kinase mediated signaling. In addition, SHIP1 converts Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4) to Ins(1,3,4)P(3) thereby regulating inositol phosphate metabolism. Here we report, that SHIP1 can be detected in nuclear puncta of Jurkat cells by confocal microscopy after expression of SHIP1 from a tetracycline inducible vector. SHIP1-containing nuclear puncta partially co-localize with FLASH, a multifunctional nuclear protein that has been linked to apoptotic signaling and transcriptional control. Nuclear localization was confirmed for endogenously expressed SHIP1 in the myeloid leukemia cell line TF1. In addition, enzymatically active SHIP1 was found in nuclear fractions of Jurkat cells with a similar specific activity as cytoplasmic SHIP1. Further analysis revealed that SHIP1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein which is actively imported into and exported out of the nucleus. Nuclear import is mediated by two canonical nuclear localization signals (NLS) i.e. K(327)KSK and K(547)KLR.

Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the most important mechanisms of action of rituximab against B-cell malignancies. We studied ways to increase the cytotoxic effect of rituximab on CLL cells by enhancing ADCC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) or purified natural killer (NK) cells from healthy donors were activated with interleukin-15 (IL-15) and cultured with rituximab-coated CLL cells, and ADCC was evaluated using a (51)chromium release assay. The IL-15 significantly enhanced in vitro ADCC against CLL cells, and this effect was mainly mediated by NK cells. The IL-15 treated effector cells with the low affinity FcgammaRIIIA receptor (158FF) had an ADCC comparable to those with the high affinity FcgammaRIIIA form (158VF). In addition, IL-15 enhanced rituximab-mediated ADCC of CLL cells in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta. The IL-15 increases rituximab-mediated ADCC against CLL, and supports the use of such agents with the goal of improving clinical response to chemoimmunotherapy in patients with CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Due to its significant role in hematopoiesis, Jak2 is a frequent target for mutations in cancer, especially myeloid leukemia, lymphoid leukemia and the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). These mutations are common amongst different populations all over the world and there is a great deal of effort to develop therapeutic drugs for the affected patients. Jak2 mutations, whether they are point, deletion, or gene fusion, most commonly result in constitutive kinase activation. Here, we explore the structure-function relation of various Jak2 mutations identified in cancer and understand how they disrupt Jak2 regulation. Current Jak2 inhibitors target the highly conserved active site in the kinase domain and therefore, these inhibitors may lack specificity. Based on our knowledge regarding structure-function correlations as they pertain to regulation of Jak2 kinase activity, an alternative approach for specific Jak2 targeting could be via allosteric inhibitor design. Successful reports of allosteric inhibitors developed against other kinases provide precedent for the development of Jak2 allosteric inhibitors. Here, we suggest plausible target sites in the Jak2 structure for allosteric inhibition. Such targets include the type II inhibitor pocket and substrate binding site in the kinase domain, the kinase-pseudokinase domain interface, SH2-JH2 linker region and the FERM domain. Thus, future Jak2 inhibitors that target these sites via allosteric mechanisms may provide alternative therapeutic strategies to existing ATP competitive inhibitors.",,"['Gnanasambandan, K', 'Sayeski, P P']","['Gnanasambandan K', 'Sayeski PP']","['Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2011/08/26 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/08/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CMC/E-Pub/2011/ 348 [pii]', '10.2174/092986711797379267 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2011;18(30):4659-73. doi: 10.2174/092986711797379267.,PMC4943318,,"['R01 HL067277/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL67277/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS460595'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to report the novel synthesis of a chloroquine analogue, n.c.a. iodoquine, and the in vitro and in vivo uptake in cells with high ALDH1 content. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Iodoquine was synthesized in novel no-carrier-added forms (n.c.a.) for both 125I and 123I. I25I IQ and 18F FDG cell uptake assays were performed in the L1210 and L1210cpa (cyclophosphamide resistant), A549, and MG456 glioblastoma cell lines. Uptake was expressed as a percent of the administered activity. 125I IQ biodistribution studies assessed organ uptake at 1, 4, and 24 hours after IV administration (n= 15 total; 5 mice/timepoint). Radiation dosimetry estimates were calculated using standard OLINDA/EXM software. In vivo imaging of 123I IQ uptake in MG456 glioblastoma mouse model (n=10) was performed with small animal high resolution micro-SPECT. Autoradiography and histology co-localized radiotracer and tumor biodistribution. Uptake in MG456 glioblastoma tumors was quantified with gamma counting. RESULTS: L1210 cpa (high ALDH1) showed significantly higher 125I IQ uptake compared to the parental L1210 (low ALDH1) for all time points through 4 hours (20.7% +/- 1.4% versus 11.0% +/- 0.5%; 21.3% +/- 0.9% versus 11.0% +/- 0.4%; 20.6% +/- 0.7% versus 9.4% +/- 0.3%; and 15.7% +/- 0.7% versus 7.5% + 0.4% at 30 minutes, and 1, 2 and 4 hours, respectively; p < 0.001 for all time points). In the CD133+ fraction of MG456 glioblastoma cell line, IQ uptake was significantly higher compared to FDG at all time points through 4 hours (81.5% +/- 0.9% versus 1.3% +/- 0.1%; 88.8% +/- 0.4% versus 1.3% +/- 0.1%; 87.8% +/- 2.1% versus 1.7% +/- 0.2%; and 87.0% +/- 2.4% versus 1.8% +/- 0.1 at 30 minutes, and 1, 2 and 4 hours, respectively; p > 0.001 for all time points). The A549 lung cancer cell line also showed high IQ uptake through 4 hours. IQ normal biodistribution studies showed rapid renal excretion and very low normal background brain activity after IV administration. In vivo micro-SPECT images showed mild uptake in larger MG456 glioblastomas (n=6) as verified with autoradiography and histology. Gamma well counter uptake in large tumors was 2.3% +/- 0.48% ID/g (n=5). CONCLUSION: Iodoquine localizes to cells with high ALDH1 content. Cell assays show high 125I IQ uptake in the MG456 cell line, and in vivo micro-SPECT imaging showed mild 123I IQ uptake in MG456 glioblastomas.

This study investigated the effect of carrot juice extracts on myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines together with normal hematopoietic stem cells. Leukemia cell lines and nontumor control cells were treated with carrot juice extracts for up to 72 hours in vitro. Induction of apoptosis was investigated by using annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis, and results were confirmed by using 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole morphology. Effects on cellular proliferation were investigated via cell cycle analysis and cell counts. Treatment of leukemia cell lines with carrot juice extract induced apoptosis and inhibited progression through the cell cycle. Lymphoid cell lines were affected to a greater extent than were myeloid cell lines, and normal hematopoietic stem cells were less sensitive than most cell lines. This study has shown that extracts from carrots can induce apoptosis and cause cell cycle arrest in leukemia cell lines.

Whereas its activities are known primarily to be under regulation of the high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) gene, the expression of HMGB1 and its function in leukemia cells still remain unclear. In this study, we found that HMGB1 was expressed abundantly in various kinds of both leukemia and non-blood cancer cell-lines, and its expression was positively correlated with clinical status in childhood leukemia. In leukemia cells, when endogenous HMGB1 increased starvation-induced autophagy, this reaction was inhibited by the suppression of HMGB1. While the use of autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), blocked the autophagic reaction and increased leukemia cell sensitivity to chemotherapy, enhancing HMGB1 expression decreased this sensitivity. Notably, suppressing HMGB1 expression also increased leukemia cell chemosensitivity. Furthermore, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway was found to be functionally connected with HMGB1. HMGB1 gene transfection increased the LC3-II level and inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K levels. Knockdown of HMGB1 expression blocked the association between mTOR and raptor in the setting of enhanced autophagy. When class I PI3K was inhibited by PI3K-I shRNA, it decreased the PI3K-I expression level. Knockdown of HMGB1 expression had no further effects on LC3-II. These results suggest that endogenous HMGB1 is an intrinsic regulator of autophagy in leukemia cells and it enhances leukemia cell chemoresistance likely through the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway.",,"['Yang, Liangchun', 'Yu, Yan', 'Kang, Rui', 'Yang, Minghua', 'Xie, Min', 'Wang, Zhuo', 'Tang, Daolin', 'Zhao, Mingyi', 'Liu, Liying', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Cao, Lizhi']","['Yang L', 'Yu Y', 'Kang R', 'Yang M', 'Xie M', 'Wang Z', 'Tang D', 'Zhao M', 'Liu L', 'Zhang H', 'Cao L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HMGB1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/08/26 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/08/26 06:00'],"['2011/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.616962 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Feb;53(2):315-22. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.616962.

The RCSD1 gene, located at 1q23, is involved in t(1;9)(q23;q34) translocation in acute B lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we describe RCSD1-ABL1-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) followed by rapid clonal evolution exhibiting three rare reciprocal translocations. We performed breakpoint analysis of the transcript expressed by the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion gene. RT-PCR and sequence analyses detected transcription of a single RCSD1-ABL1 fusion gene variant, which had breakpoints in exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1. The RCSD1 portion of the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion transcript consists of exons 1, 2, and 3. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, coadministered with dexamethasone achieved transient clinical effects in the present RCSD1-ABL1-positive ALL. However, leukemic cells rapidly became refractory to this treatment following the subsequent development of three additional reciprocal chromosomal translocations, t(5;16)(q33;q24), dic(18;20)(p11.2;q11.2) and t(10;19)(q24;p13.3).

The effect of ER stress on renal tubular damage and fibrosis remains controversial. This study aims to investigate whether ER stress is involved in tubular destruction and interstitial fibrosis in vivo. Renal cell apoptosis was proven by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) stain and poly-ADP ribose polymerase expression in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidney. ER stress was evoked and confirmed by the upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and the common Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) motif of ER retention proteins after UUO. ER stress-associated proapoptotic signals, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 2-associated x protein (BAX) expression, caspase-12 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, were activated in the UUO kidney. Prolonged ER stress attenuated both unsplicing and splicing X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) protein expression, but continued to activate inositol-requiring 1alpha (IRE1alpha)-JNK phosphorylation, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha subunit (eIF2alpha), activating transcription factor (ATF)-4, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) and cleavage activating transcription factor 6 (cATF6)-CHOP signals, which induce ER stress-related apoptosis but attenuate adaptive unfolded protein responses in UUO kidneys. However, renal apoptosis and fibrosis were attenuated in candesartan-treated UUO kidney. Candesartan was associated with maintenance of XBP-1 expression and attenuated ATF4, cATF6 and CHOP protein expression. Taken together, results show that overwhelming ER stress leads to renal cell apoptosis and subsequent fibrosis; and candesartan, at least in part, restores renal integrity by blocking ER stress-related apoptosis. Reducing ER stress may present a way to attenuate renal fibrosis.",,"['Chiang, Chih-Kang', 'Hsu, Shih-Ping', 'Wu, Cheng-Tien', 'Huang, Jenq-Wen', 'Cheng, Hui-Teng', 'Chang, Yi-Wen', 'Hung, Kuan-Yu', 'Wu, Kuan-Dun', 'Liu, Shing-Hwa']","['Chiang CK', 'Hsu SP', 'Wu CT', 'Huang JW', 'Cheng HT', 'Chang YW', 'Hung KY', 'Wu KD', 'Liu SH']","['Department of Integrated Diagnostics and Therapeutics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110819,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Tetrazoles)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'S8Q36MD2XX (candesartan)']",IM,"['Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Kidney/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Tubules/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetrazoles/pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects', 'Ureteral Obstruction/complications/pathology/physiopathology']",2011/08/25 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/08/25 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00131 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00131 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2011;17(11-12):1295-305. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00131.

A defective p53 pathway is a hallmark of ovarian carcinoma. The p53 mutation correlates significantly with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, early relapse and shortened overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein, was recently identified as a transcriptional target of p53 and a potent apoptosis inducer in various cancer cells. In this study, we showed that the induction of PUMA by cisplatin was abolished in p53-deficient SKOV3 cells. Elevated expression of PUMA-induced apoptosis and sensitized A2780s and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin, and the combination of PUMA and low-dose cisplatin, significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo through enhanced induction of apoptosis compared with treatment with PUMA or cisplatin alone. The effects of PUMA were mediated by enhanced caspase activation and release of cytochrome c and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) into the cytosol. Furthermore, PUMA chemosensitized intrinsically resistant SKOV3 cells to cisplatin through downregulation of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-x(L)) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1). PUMA-mediated Bcl-x(L) downregulation mainly happened at the transcription level, whereas PUMA-induced Mcl-1 down-regulation was associated with caspase-dependent cleavage and proteasome-mediated degradation. To our knowledge, these data suggest a new mechanism by which overexpression of PUMA enhances sensitivity of SKOV3 cells to cisplatin by lowering the threshold set simultaneously by Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. Taken together, our findings indicate that PUMA is an important modulator of therapeutic responses of ovarian cancer cells and is potentially useful as a chemosensitizer in ovarian cancer therapy.",,"['Yuan, Zhu', 'Cao, Kang', 'Lin, Chao', 'Li, Lei', 'Liu, Huan-yi', 'Zhao, Xin-yu', 'Liu, Lei', 'Deng, Hong-xin', 'Li, Jiong', 'Nie, Chun-lai', 'Wei, Yu-quan']","['Yuan Z', 'Cao K', 'Lin C', 'Li L', 'Liu HY', 'Zhao XY', 'Liu L', 'Deng HX', 'Li J', 'Nie CL', 'Wei YQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. yuanzhujyx@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110819,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2011/08/25 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/08/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00176 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00176 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2011;17(11-12):1262-74. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00176.

Evidence suggests a key role of dendritic cells (DCs) in cancer immunotherapy due to their capacity to present tumour antigens to effector cells. We generated cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells from healthy donors and examined their responses in vitro in an LDH release assay against three cell lines and allogeneic HLA non-matched blasts from three patients with de novo AML after coincubation with autologous peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs. Although DCs were unable to enhance CIK cell effects against all three cell lines tested, the cytotoxic activity against the patients' AML cells increased after coculture with mature DCs, which was significant in two of three patients. However, neither prior pulsing of the DCs with blast cell lysates nor with leukemic cell-derived total RNA further enhanced the lytic capacity of the CIK cells. On the contrary, pulsing reduced or even reversed the cytotoxic activity of the effector cells. This decrease of allogeneic cytotoxicity led us to conclude that monocyte-derived DCs may be useful in autologous or allogeneic vaccine strategies for the treatment of AML or in priming donor lymphocytes in vitro, but unfractionated antigens as pulsing agents may have inhibitory effects on T cell efficiency and their employment in immunotherapeutic strategies for AML seems questionable.",,"['Schottker, Bjorn', 'Schmidt-Wolf, Ingo G H']","['Schottker B', 'Schmidt-Wolf IG']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinik Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110804,Germany,Ger Med Sci,German medical science : GMS e-journal,101227686,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Phenotype', 'RNA/immunology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2011/08/25 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/08/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3205/000141 [doi]', '000141 [pii]']",ppublish,Ger Med Sci. 2011;9:Doc18. doi: 10.3205/000141.

Outcome has improved remarkably over the past decade because of improvements in imaging and staging systems that more accurately reflect the clinical behavior, and the development of risk adapted multiagent chemotherapeutic regimens. The aim of this work is to study the outcome, Overall Survival (OS) and Event Free Survival (EFS) of patients receiving FAB LMB96 protocol applied for treatment of mature B cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study analyzing the data of 103 newly diagnosed pediatric NHL [Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia, Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)] who received LMB96 protocol at Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, during the time period from 1st of January 2006 to the end of December 2008. A total of 103 patients were included in the study, and were followedup till 31st December 2009. RESULTS: This study included were 80 males (77.7%) and 23 females (22.3%), their mean age was 6.55+/-3.9 years ranged from 2 to 16 years. Abdominal presentation was the most common clinical presentation seen in 85 patients (82.5%) followed by thoracic mass in 27 patients (26.2%) and cervical mass in 22 patients (21.4%). CNS involvement occurred in 16 patients (15.5%) while bone marrow infiltration occurred in 18 patients (17.5%). The most common pathological subtype was Burkitt's lymphoma seen in 83 patients (80.6%) followed by DLBCL in 12 patients (11.7%). Stage III was the most commonly seen; detected in 65 patients (63.1%). The commonest treatment group seen was group B in 80 patients (77.7%) followed by group C in 19 patients (18.4%) then group A in 4 patients (3.9%).Complete remission for the whole group of patients was achieved in 72 patients (70%), relapses and disease progression occurred in 9 patients (8.7%) and stable disease in 1 patient (1%). Death due to septicemia occurred in 13 patients (12.6%). There were 8 patients (7.7%) who discontinued treatment. CONCLUSION: FAB LMB96 protocol is well tolerated, giving results close to the international literature for both group A and B patients, while it seems toxic for group C patients.

It plays an important role in the leukemia pathogenesis. This phenomenon is frequently observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and results in the functional inactivation of its associated genes. The aim of this study is to investigate the frequency and the prognostic impact of p15 and p73 genes methylation in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze methylation of the p15 and p73 genes in 51 newly diagnosed adult ALL patients. RESULTS: The methylation frequencies of p15 and p73 genes at diagnosis were 41.2% and 27.5% respectively, while concomitant methylation was detected in 14% of the patients. Concomitant methylation of p15 and p73 genes was associated with significant lower rate of CR compared to patients without methylation (57% versus 90%), p=0.008. Overall survival (OS) was not affected by p15 methylation, but was poorer with p73 methylation and the difference was near significant (p=0.059). For patients without meyhylation, the survival benefit was significant when compared to patients with p15, p73 or both genes methylation (p=0.047). The leukemia free survival was not affected by the methylation status of single gene p15 or p73, but tended to be worse in patients with methylated p15, p73 or both genes when compared to patients without methylation (p=0.08). CONCLUSION: Aberrant p73 promoter methylation is a potential prognostic factor in adult ALL patients. P15 methylation is frequent in Egyptian adult ALL patients, its concomitant methylation with p73 is of poor prognostic significance. Identification of these molecular targets improve risk assessment and selection of appropriate therapy.

This effect has been associated with the inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity but also as an off-target effect essentially in adherent cancer cell models. In this study, we investigated the effect of three COX-2 inhibitors (nimesulide, NS-398 and celecoxib) on cell proliferation of leukemic and lymphoblastic cells expressing COX-2 at high (U937, Jurkat, Hel and Raji) and very low (K562) protein levels. We found that the inhibitors reduce cell proliferation in all COX-2-expressing cells leading to an accumulation in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. We provide evidence that this modulation corresponds to an accumulation of cells in G0 paralleled by the expression of cell differentiation markers in U937 (CD15) and Hel (CD41a and CD61) cells but not in the insensitive K562. These events are associated with a rapid down-regulation (within one hour) of c-Myc expression, accompanied by the up-regulation of p27 and the down-regulation of PCNA and cyclin D1.

Tax activates NF-kappaB through activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, similar to cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activation, which involves active signalling complex formation using polyubiquitin chains as a platform. Although polyubiquitination of Tax was reported to be required for IKK activation, most studies have been performed using intact cells, in which secondary NF-kappaB activation can be induced by various cytokines that are secreted due to Tax-mediated primary NF-kappaB activation. Therefore, a cell-free assay system, in which IKK can be activated by adding highly purified recombinant Tax to cytosolic extract, was used to analyse Tax-induced IKK activation. In contrast to the cytosolic extract, the purified IKK complex was not activated by Tax, whereas, it was efficiently activated by MEKK1, that does not require polyubiquitination to activate IKK. Moreover, Tax-induced IKK activation was blocked when the cytosolic extract was mixed with either lysine-free, methylated or K63R ubiquitin. These results obtained through our cell-free assay suggest that K63-linked polyubiquitination is critical, but linear polyubiquitination is dispensable or insufficient for Tax-induced IKK activation.",,"['Shibata, Yuri', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Gohda, Jin', 'Inoue, Jun-ichiro']","['Shibata Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Gohda J', 'Inoue J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Shirokane-dai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110823,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', ""0 (4(2'-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline)"", '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Baculoviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Quinoxalines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', '*Ubiquitination']",2011/08/25 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2011/08/25 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['mvr106 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvr106 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2011 Dec;150(6):679-86. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvr106.

The influence of T cells and natural killer cells in the immune system of the patient with cancer as a response to cancer cells is particularly noted. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We prospectively assessed the prognostic value of absolute lymphocytic count (ALC) in 105 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), treated in the Cuban Immunology and Hematology Institute from 1995 to 2008. ALC was studied at days 15 (ALC-15) and 28 (ALC-28) of treatment. RESULTS: In our patients, 1000 cells/uL was the median ALC value for patients who relapsed or died. Using 1000/uL we found that ALL patients with an ALC-15 <1000 cells/mul had a 5-year relapse free survival (RFS) of 51%. In contrast, an ALC-15 >1000 cells/uL showed an excellent prognosis, with a 5-year RFS of 83% (p=0.02). Similarly in our study, an ALC-28 <1000 cells/mul predicted a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 66%, whereas an ALC-28 >1000 cells/mul predicted excellent outcome, with a 5-year OS of 86% (p=0.01). Importantly, ALC is also a strong predictor in multivariate analysis with known prognostic factors. ALC is a simple, statistically powerful measurement for patients with de novo ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The results, when combined with previous studies, demonstrate that ALC is a powerful new prognostic factor for a range of malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria.

We investigated molecular events in CIOM from buccal mucosa tissue collected before and 2 days after chemotherapy from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and healthy controls by microarray analysis. METHODS: Microarray analysis was performed using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array on buccal mucosa punch biopsies from patients with AML before (n = 4) or after chemotherapy (n = 4), and from healthy controls (n = 3). Following Robust Multichip Average (RMA) normalization, we applied Linear Models for Microarray data (LIMMA) and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) for data analysis using the TM4/TMeV v4.5.1 program. RESULTS: LIMMA and SAM identified genes potentially affected by the presence of AML, including homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1), mex-3 homolog D (MEX3D), and genes potentially affected by chemotherapy, including argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1), zinc transporter ZIP6 (SLC39A6), and TP53-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (TRIAP1). The expression of 2 genes with potential biological significance in oral mucositis, ASS1 and SLC39A6 (alias LIV-1), was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that AML-specific deregulated immune responses and inflammatory tissue damage to the oral mucosa caused by chemotherapy may not be overcome by the natural cellular repair processes and therefore contribute to CIOM.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Mosby, Inc.

One week after intravenous injection of 1x10(6) leukemic cells (EL-4, H-2(b)) into 8-week-old B6 (H-2(b)) mice, the mice were 8 Gy irradiated and transplanted with 1x10(7) bone marrow cells (BMCs) from 8-week-old BALB/c mice (H-2(d)) by IBM-BMT with or without donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or ATT.

Further, because of the similarities between mouse EpiSCs and human ESCs, EpiSCs are expected to be effective experimental models for human stem cell therapy. Recently, study for conversion from ESC state to EpiSC state or reversion from EpiSC state to ESC state has attracted interest since these techniques may lead to increasing the potential of pluripotent stem cells and our knowledge about their developmental status. In the present study, we find that a low oxygen concentration in culture environment accelerated, improved, and stabilized the EpiSC state of the converted cells from the ESC state using Oct4DeltaPE-GFP transgenic ESCs. Induced EpiSCs (iEpiSCs) in hypoxia possess closer gene expression patterns to native EpiSCs, and bisulfite sequences for the promoter regions of Stella and Oct4 genes have elucidated that the iEpiSC gain EpiSC-specific methylation patterns in hypoxia.

Twelve of the 51 patients (24%) were still alive after a median follow-up time of 11.5 years (range 10.7-13.1). The Ly(+)AML patients showed significantly better overall survival compared with Ly(-)AML patients (8/18 vs. 4/33 patients alive at the last follow-up, P = 0.003). The subgroup of patients with co-expression of PGP and Ly also showed better overall survival compared with PGP(+)AML patients without Ly expression (4/8 vs. 0/13 patients alive at the last follow-up; P = 0.04). Our results suggest that expression of lymphoid antigens on PGP(+) myeloblasts in AML can positively affect survival in AML patients, mainly due to a decreased relapse risk and better survival. Although the small number of patient may be perceived as a limitation of the study, the long follow-up period strengthens its value. Further prospective trials are needed to obtain more information concerning the association between PGP and lymphoid antigens in AML, which would put our results in their ultimate proper context.",,"['Machaczka, Maciej', 'Wahlin, Bjorn Engelbrekt', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas, Beata', 'Rucinska, Malgorzata', 'Jurczak, Wojciech', 'Balana-Nowak, Agnieszka', 'Klimkowska, Monika', 'Hagglund, Hans', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander B']","['Machaczka M', 'Wahlin BE', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas B', 'Rucinska M', 'Jurczak W', 'Balana-Nowak A', 'Klimkowska M', 'Hagglund H', 'Skotnicki AB']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine at Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, and Hematology Center Karolinska, M54, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden. maciej.machaczka@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110823,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Ly', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Young Adult']",2011/08/24 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/08/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0044-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2070-6. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0044-4.

The sample consisted of 17 children aged 2 to 12 years that underwent clinical examination of the oral mucosa for the detection of oral lesions. In addition, biological material was collected from labial and buccal mucosa for microbiological analysis. Oral mucositis was observed in only 5 (29.4%) patients. Microbiological analysis revealed a reduced number of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (47%), Candida albicans (35.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.9%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (5.9%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5.9%). Patients with oral mucositis showed a higher frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci (80%) when compared with patients with normal oral mucosa (33.3%). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the prophylactic use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate reduces the frequency of oral mucositis and oral pathogens in children with ALL.

TG02 is anti-proliferative in a broad range of tumor cell lines, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Primary cultures of progenitor cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and polycythemia vera patients are very sensitive to TG02. Comparison with reference inhibitors that block only one of the main targets of TG02 demonstrate the benefit of combined CDK and JAK2/FLT3 inhibition in cell lines as well as primary cells. In vivo, TG02 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetics after oral dosing in xenograft models and accumulates in tumor tissues, inducing an effective blockade of both CDK and STAT signaling. TG02 induces tumor regression after oral dosing on both daily and intermittent schedules in a murine model of mutant-FLT3 leukemia (MV4-11) and prolongs survival in a disseminated AML model with wild-type FLT3 and JAK2 (HL-60).

The molecular mechanisms that regulate energy requirements in these diseases are poorly understood. Transformed cells tend to rely on fermentation instead of more efficient oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. Our data in JAK2V617F-transformed cells show that growth and metabolic activity were strictly dependent on the presence of glucose. Uptake of glucose and cell surface expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 required the oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Importantly, JAK2V617F as well as active STAT5 increased the expression of the inducible rate-limiting enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), which controls glycolytic flux through 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. PFKFB3 was required for JAK2V617F-dependent lactate production, oxidative metabolic activity and glucose uptake. Targeted knockdown of PFKFB3 also limited cell growth under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and blocked in vivo tumor formation in mice. Overall, these data suggest that inducible PFKFB3 is required for increased growth, metabolic activity and is regulated through active JAK2 and STAT5.

As HLA-class II molecules are predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells, CD4+ T cells may selectively mediate GvL reactivity without GvHD. Here, we assessed the capacity of human CD4+ T cells to act as sole mediators of GvL reactivity in a NOD/scid mouse model for human acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis. Highly purified CD4+ DLI eradicated the leukemic cells. The anti-tumor immunity was mediated by a polyclonal CD4+ T cell response comprising cytokine-producing T-helper and cytolytic T-effector cells directed against the mismatched HLA-class II molecules of the patients. Furthermore, primary leukemic cells acquired an antigen-presenting cell (APC) phenotype in vivo after DLI, as well as in vitro after co-culture with leukemia-specific CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, our results show that CD4+ T cells can be strong mediators of anti-tumor immunity, and provide evidence that cross-talk between CD4+ T cells and leukemic cells is the basis for induction of leukemic cells with an APC phenotype.

The reduced effectiveness of the GVL effect in EM sites, as compared with BM, has been suggested to underlie this problem. We retrospectively analyzed the pattern of relapse after haploidentical SCT (haplo-SCT), performed as the first or second SCT. Among 38 patients who received haplo-SCT as their first SCT, the cumulative incidences of BM and EM relapse at 3 years were 40.5 and 10.9%, respectively. Among 19 patients who received haplo-SCT as their second SCT, the cumulative incidences of BM and EM relapse were 30.9 and 31.9%, respectively. Moreover, most of the patients who underwent repeat haplo-SCT for the treatment of EM relapse had further EM relapse at other sites. Post-relapse survival did not differ significantly with different patterns of relapse. The frequent occurrence of EM relapse after haplo-SCT, particularly when performed as a second SCT, suggests that the potent GVL effect elicited by an HLA disparity also occurs preferentially in BM.

Here we reveal a central role for TNFalpha in promoting clonal dominance of JAK2(V617F) expressing cells in MPN. We show that JAK2(V617F) kinase regulates TNFalpha expression in cell lines and primary MPN cells and TNFalpha expression is correlated with JAK2(V617F) allele burden. In clonogenic assays, normal controls show reduced colony formation in the presence of TNFalpha while colony formation by JAK2(V617F)-positive progenitor cells is resistant or stimulated by exposure to TNFalpha. Ectopic JAK2(V617F) expression confers TNFalpha resistance to normal murine progenitor cells and overcomes inherent TNFalpha hypersensitivity of Fanconi anemia complementation group C deficient progenitors. Lastly, absence of TNFalpha limits clonal expansion and attenuates disease in a murine model of JAK2(V617F)-positive MPN. Altogether our data are consistent with a model where JAK2(V617F) promotes clonal selection by conferring TNFalpha resistance to a preneoplastic TNFalpha sensitive cell, while simultaneously generating a TNFalpha-rich environment. Mutations that confer resistance to environmental stem cell stressors are a recognized mechanism of clonal selection and leukemogenesis in bone marrow failure syndromes and our data suggest that this mechanism is also critical to clonal selection in MPN.",,"['Fleischman, Angela G', 'Aichberger, Karl J', 'Luty, Samuel B', 'Bumm, Thomas G', 'Petersen, Curtis L', 'Doratotaj, Shirin', 'Vasudevan, Kavin B', 'LaTocha, Dorian H', 'Yang, Fei', 'Press, Richard D', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Pahl, Heike L', 'Silver, Richard T', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Druker, Brian J', 'Bagby, Grover C', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Fleischman AG', 'Aichberger KJ', 'Luty SB', 'Bumm TG', 'Petersen CL', 'Doratotaj S', 'Vasudevan KB', 'LaTocha DH', 'Yang F', 'Press RD', 'Loriaux MM', 'Pahl HL', 'Silver RT', 'Agarwal A', ""O'Hare T"", 'Druker BJ', 'Bagby GC', 'Deininger MW']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA. fleischm@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110822,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Fancc protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/blood/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/08/24 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/08/24 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40507-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-348144 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 8;118(24):6392-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-348144.

METHODS: DNA samples from 368 patients with lymphoid malignancies and 139 patients with benign lymphadenopathy or other malignant disease were screened for XMRV, using three specific and sensitive quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: XMRV was not detected in any sample using any of the three assays. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that this virus is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of common types of lymphoid malignancy and that XMRV is not a prevalent blood borne infection, at least in the United Kingdom.

Glycans on cell membrane proteins play important roles in many cellular processes such as recognition and apoptosis, and this study investigated whether changes to the glycan structures on cell membrane proteins occur when cells become resistant to drugs. Specifically, we investigated the alteration of glycan structures on the cell membrane proteins of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CEM) cells that were selected for resistance to desoxyepothilone B (CEM/dEpoB). The glycan profile of the cell membrane glycoproteins was obtained by sequential release of N- and O-glycans from cell membrane fraction dotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with PNGase F and beta-elimination respectively. The released glycan alditols were analyzed by liquid chromatography (graphitized carbon)-electrospray ionization tandem MS. The major N-glycan on CEM cell was the core fucosylated alpha2-6 monosialo-biantennary structure. Resistant CEM/dEpoB cells had a significant decrease of alpha2-6 linked sialic acid on N-glycans. The lower alpha2-6 sialylation was caused by a decrease in activity of beta-galactoside alpha2-6 sialyltransferase (ST6Gal), and decreased expression of the mRNA. It is clear that the membrane glycosylation of leukemia cells changes during acquired resistance to dEpoB drugs and that this change occurs globally on all cell membrane glycoproteins. This is the first identification of a specific glycan modification on the surface of drug resistant cells and the mechanism of this downstream effect on microtubule targeting drugs may offer a route to new interventions to overcome drug resistance.",,"['Nakano, Miyako', 'Saldanha, Rohit', 'Gobel, Anja', 'Kavallaris, Maria', 'Packer, Nicolle H']","['Nakano M', 'Saldanha R', 'Gobel A', 'Kavallaris M', 'Packer NH']","['Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Macquarie University, NSW 2109, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110822,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Epothilones)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (ST6GAL1 protein, human)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'T0358E0YUF (desoxyepothilone B)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epothilones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polysaccharides/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/genetics/metabolism']",2011/08/24 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/08/24 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)30106-7 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M111.009001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2011 Nov;10(11):M111.009001. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M111.009001.

DESIGN AND METHODS: To address this issue we compared the survival of 104 patients in whom first-line therapy with imatinib failed and who were then treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors with the outcome of 246 patients in whom interferon-alpha therapy failed and who did not receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. RESULTS: Patients treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors had longer overall survival than the interferon controls (adjusted relative risk= 0.28, P=0.0001). However this survival advantage was limited to the 64.4% of patients in whom imatinib failed but who achieved complete cytogenetic response with the subsequent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (adjusted relative risk =0.05, P=0.003), whereas the 35.6% of patients who failed to achieve complete cytogenetic response on the second or third inhibitor had similar overall survival to that of the controls (adjusted relative risk=0.76, P=0.65).

DESIGN AND METHODS: To further clarify the prognostic impact of parameters such as FLT3 mutations, we comprehensively characterized the relation between genetic features and outcome in 147 patients (aged 19.7-86.3 years) with acute promyelocytic leukemia. RESULTS: Internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) were detected in 47/147 (32.0%) and tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD) in 19/147 (12.9%) patients. FLT3-ITD or FLT3-TKD mutation status did not have a significant prognostic impact, whereas FLT3-ITD mutation load, as defined by a mutation/wild-type ratio of less than 0.5 was associated with trends to a better 2-year overall survival rate (86.7% versus 72.7%; P=0.075) and 2-year event-free survival rate (84.5% versus 62.1%, P=0.023) compared to the survival rates of patients with a ratio of 0.5 or more. Besides the t(15;17), an additional chromosomal abnormality was detected in 57 of 147 cases and did not show a significant impact on survival. White blood cell counts of 10x10(9)/L or less versus more than 10x10(9)/L were associated with a better 2-year overall survival rate (88.3% versus 69.4%, respectively; P=0.015), as was male sex (P=0.040). In multivariate analysis, only higher age had a significant adverse impact.

OBJECTIVES: We focused on 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT), a benzene metabolite that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) by autoxidation, to investigate the toxicity of benzene leading to leukemogenesis. METHODS: After exposing HL-60 human myeloid cells to BT, we investigated the cellular effects, including apoptosis, ROS generation, DNA damage, and protein damage. We also investigated how the cellular effects of BT were modified by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger catalase, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) scavenger methionine, and 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-specific inhibitor. RESULTS: BT increased the levels of apoptosis and ROS, including superoxide (O2*-), H2O2, HOCl, and the hydroxyl radical (*OH). Catalase, ABAH, and methionine each inhibited the increased apoptosis caused by BT, and catalase and ABAH inhibited increases in HOCl and *OH. Although BT exposure increased halogenated DNA, this increase was inhibited by catalase, methionine, and ABAH. BT exposure also increased the amount of halogenated tyrosines; however, it did not increase 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that BT increases H2O2 intracellularly; this H2O2 is metabolized to HOCl by MPO, and this HOCl results in possibly cytotoxic binding of chlorine to DNA. Because myeloid cells copiously express MPO and because halogenated DNA may induce both genetic and epigenetic changes that contribute to carcinogenesis, halogenative stress may account for benzene-induced bone marrow disorders and myeloid leukemia.",,"['Nishikawa, Takuro', 'Miyahara, Emiko', 'Horiuchi, Masahisa', 'Izumo, Kimiko', 'Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Kawai, Yoshichika', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi', 'Takeuchi, Toru']","['Nishikawa T', 'Miyahara E', 'Horiuchi M', 'Izumo K', 'Okamoto Y', 'Kawai Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Takeuchi T']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1 Sakuraga-oka, Kagoshima, Japan. adu44150@ams.odn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110822,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '173O8B04RD (hydroxyhydroquinone)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '5351-17-7 (4-aminobenzhydrazide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catalase/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*chemically induced', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Halogenation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Methionine/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/*drug effects', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2011/08/24 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2011/08/24 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1103437 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Jan;120(1):62-7. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1103437.

This paper summarizes this risk assessment. Risk was characterized using two distinct methods: USEPA's default type of risk assessment, which used the Reference Dose (RfD) and Cancer Slope Factor (CSF) to characterize non-cancer and cancer risks, as well as a Margin of Safety (MOS) approach that utilized a point of departure (POD). The exposures for most scenarios evaluated in this VCCEP risk assessment are lower than both the cancer and non-cancer PODs by several orders of magnitude, indicating a large MOS and corresponding low potential for toxicity at these exposures. The highest benzene exposures likely experienced by children, associated with the lowest MOS, are from cigarette smoke. In addition, the potential for age-related differences in the sensitivity towards benzene-induced toxicity was investigated.

In this intricate process, progression through the phases of the cell cycle relies on various cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase protein complexes that are regulated by multiple cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Ultimately, the transcription factor E2F is influenced by this cascade and regulates the mRNA levels of proteins needed for cell cycle progression. Thus, disturbance of cell cycle regulation has been shown to be responsible for various types of cancer including adult and pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (T-ALL and T-LBL, respectively), which are suggested to arise due to developmental arrest of precursor T lymphoblasts at certain early time points in T-cell maturation. Therapy optimization in recent years has resulted in good prognoses for patients of both malignancies.

The authors, therefore, evaluated its effects on T-cell immunophenotype and cytokine production in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: To study the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide in CLL, the authors recruited 24 patients with untreated CLL enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial of lenalidomide and obtained peripheral blood specimens for immunologic studies consisting of enumeration of T cells and assessing their ability to synthesize cytokines after activation through T-cell receptor (TCR). RESULTS: After 3 cycles of therapy, patients had a significant reduction in percentage (%) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and an increase in percentage of T cells, percentage of activated CD8(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma, and percentage of regulatory T (T(R) ) cells when compared with their respective levels before treatment. After 15 cycles of treatment, responder patients had significant reduction in percentage of lymphocytes and ALC, percentage of activated CD4(+) T cells producing IL-2, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha, and percentage of T(R) cells when compared with their perspective levels after 3 cycles of treatment. Furthermore, the numbers of activated CD4(+) T cells producing IL-2, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha, activated CD8(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma, and T(R) cells normalized to the range of healthy subjects.

METHODS: We reviewed all 6,713,059 death certificates in Italy (1995-2006) to identify those mentioning MCC. We evaluated the association with other primary cancers by calculating the ratio of observed to expected deaths, using a standardized mortality ratio (SMR)-like analysis. We also evaluated the geographic distribution of deaths. RESULTS: We identified 351 death certificates with the mention of MCC. The age-adjusted mortality was 0.031/100,000, with a significant trend of increase and a slight north-south gradient. There was a significant deficit for solid cancers (SMR = 0.15) and a non-significant excess for lymphohematopoietic malignancies (SMR = 1.62). There were significant excesses for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SMR = 4.07) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (SMR = 27.2) and a non-significant excess for chronic myeloid leukemia (SMR = 5.12).

The cells were treated with DOX at different concentrations (1, 3, 10, 20, 30, and 50 muM) and for different exposure times (1, 3, 5, 24, and 48 h). At least 20 cells were analyzed for each DOX-treated cell population. A marked heterogeneity in DOX uptake among single cells was observed, because the relative standard deviation of the uptake of DOX by single cells ranged from 24.0% to 61.1% within each cell population. The cell-to-cell heterogeneity in DOX uptake first decreased and then became constant with increasing drug concentration, but it did not exhibit regular variation with increasing exposure time. The mean DOX uptake was a linear function of drug concentration (r>/=0.9667). In terms of the correlation with exposure time, the mean DOX uptake reached its maximum at 3 h for the cell populations treated with 1-10 muM DOX, while it kept increasing during 48 h exposure of cell populations to 20-50 muM DOX. Because it eliminates DOX fluorescence quenching and sample loss, the CE-LIF method directly detects the true DOX uptake by single cells, and thus presents accurate information on both the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in DOX uptake and the patterns of DOX uptake in K562 cells as functions of drug concentration and exposure time.",['(c) Springer-Verlag 2011'],"['Deng, Bin', 'Wang, Zhiming', 'Song, Jian', 'Xiao, Yuxiu', 'Chen, Dan', 'Huang, Jun']","['Deng B', 'Wang Z', 'Song J', 'Xiao Y', 'Chen D', 'Huang J']","['Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery (Wuhan University), Ministry of Education, and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110820,Germany,Anal Bioanal Chem,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,101134327,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/*instrumentation/methods', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', '*Lasers', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology']",2011/08/23 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/08/23 06:00'],"['2011/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00216-011-5315-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Bioanal Chem. 2011 Oct;401(7):2143-52. doi: 10.1007/s00216-011-5315-6.

Recently it gained attention because of its antiproliferative properties in many cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sulforaphane could act as a radiosensitizer in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (i.e., (HNSCC) SCC9, SCC25, CAL27, and FADU) were treated with sulforaphane and subsequently irradiated. Then proliferation and clonogenic assays were performed. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Possible regulation of Akt and Mcl-1 was investigated by western blotting. RESULTS: Sulforaphane and radiation in combination leads to stronger inhibition of cell proliferation and of clonogenic survival than each treatment method alone. Western blot analysis of Akt and Mcl-1 showed no changed expression. CONCLUSION: Sulforaphane is a promising agent in the treatment of head and neck cancer due to its antiproliferative and radio-sensitizing properties. A combination of sulforaphane and radiation decreases clonogenic survival.

Therefore, we investigated mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to DAC in MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed Quantitative Real-Time PCR to examine expression of genes related to DAC metabolism prior to therapy in 32 responders and non-responders with MDS as well as 14 patients who achieved a complete remission and subsequently relapsed while on therapy (secondary resistance). We then performed quantitative methylation analyses by bisulfite pyrosequencing of 10 genes as well as Methylated CpG Island Amplification Microarray (MCAM) analysis of global methylation in secondary resistance. RESULTS: Most genes showed no differences by response, but the CDA/DCK ratio was 3 fold higher in non-responders than responders (P<.05), suggesting that this could be a mechanism of primary resistance. There were no significant differences at relapse in DAC metabolism genes, and no DCK mutations were detected. Global methylation measured by the LINE1 assay was lower at relapse than at diagnosis (P<.05). On average, the methylation of 10 genes was lower at relapse (16.1%) compared to diagnosis (18.1%) (P<.05). MCAM analysis showed decreased methylation of an average of 4.5% (range 0.6%-9.7%) of the genes at relapse. By contrast, new cytogenetic changes were found in 20% of patients.

Nevertheless, its development in oncology remains limited, because of the low selectivity of photosensitizers (PS) towards human tumor cells. To enhance PS efficiency, we recently covalently linked a porphyrin (TrMPyP) to a plant lectin (Morniga G), known to recognize with high affinity tumor-associated T and Tn antigens. The conjugation allowed a quick uptake of PS by Tn-positive Jurkat leukemia cells and efficient PS-induced phototoxicity. The present study was performed: (i) to evaluate the targeting potential of the conjugate towards tumor and normal cells and its phototoxicity on various leukemia cells, (ii) to investigate the mechanism of conjugate-mediated cell death. The conjugate: (i) strongly increased (x1000) the PS phototoxicity towards leukemic Jurkat T cells through an O-glycan-dependent process; (ii) specifically purged tumor cells from a 1ratio1 mixture of Jurkat leukemia (Tn-positive) and healthy (Tn-negative) lymphocytes, preserving the activation potential of healthy lymphocytes; (iii) was effective against various leukemic cell lines with distinct phenotypes, as well as fresh human primary acute and chronic lymphoid leukemia cells; (iv) induced mostly a caspase-independent cell death, which might be an advantage as tumor cells often resist caspase-dependent cell death.

Therapeutic decision making and treatments based upon mHAs will require the evaluation of multiple candidate mHAs and the selection of those with the potential to have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that common, immunodominant mHAs, which are presented by HLA-A, B, and C molecules, can mediate clinically significant GvL and/or GvHD, and that these mHAs can be identified through association of genomic data with clinical outcomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Because most mHAs result from donor/recipient cSNP disparities, we genotyped 57 myeloid leukemia patients and their donors at 13,917 cSNPs. We correlated the frequency of genetically predicted mHA disparities with clinical evidence of an immune response and then computationally screened all peptides mapping to the highly associated cSNPs for their ability to bind to HLA molecules. As proof-of-concept, we analyzed one predicted antigen, T4A, whose mHA mismatch trended towards improved overall and disease free survival in our cohort. T4A mHA mismatches occurred at the maximum theoretical frequency for any given SCT. T4A-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) were detected in 3 of 4 evaluable post-transplant patients predicted to have a T4A mismatch. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our method is the first to combine clinical outcomes data with genomics and bioinformatics methods to predict and confirm a mHA. Refinement of this method should enable the discovery of clinically relevant mHAs in the majority of transplant patients and possibly lead to novel immunotherapeutics.",,"['Armistead, Paul M', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Li, Hua', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'St John, Lisa', 'Hunsucker, Sally A', 'Sarantopoulos, Stefanie', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Armistead PM', 'Liang S', 'Li H', 'Lu S', 'Van Bergen CA', 'Alatrash G', 'St John L', 'Hunsucker SA', 'Sarantopoulos S', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America. paul_armistead@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20110809,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/08/23 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/08/23 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0023217 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-02811 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e23217. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023217.

This enzyme is composed of three domains and is hard to crystallize in its full form. First structural results on IN were obtained on the catalytic core domain (CCD) of the avian Rous and Sarcoma Virus strain Schmidt-Ruppin A (RSV-A) and on the CCD of HIV-1 IN. A ribonuclease-H like motif was revealed as well as a dimeric interface stabilized by two pairs of alpha-helices (alpha1/alpha5, alpha5/alpha1). These structural features have been validated in other structures of IN CCDs. We have determined the crystal structure of the Rous-associated virus type-1 (RAV-1) IN CCD to 1.8 A resolution. RAV-1 IN shows a standard activity for integration and its CCD differs in sequence from that of RSV-A by a single accessible residue in position 182 (substitution A182T). Surprisingly, the CCD of RAV-1 IN associates itself with an unexpected dimeric interface characterized by three pairs of alpha-helices (alpha3/alpha5, alpha1/alpha1, alpha5/alpha3). A182 is not involved in this novel interface, which results from a rigid body rearrangement of the protein at its alpha1, alpha3, alpha5 surface. A new basic groove that is suitable for single-stranded nucleic acid binding is observed at the surface of the dimer. We have subsequently determined the structure of the mutant A182T of RAV-1 IN CCD and obtained a RSV-A IN CCD-like structure with two pairs of buried alpha-helices at the interface. Our results suggest that the CCD of avian INs can dimerize in more than one state.

Curiously, some IFN-alpha treated patients were able to discontinue therapy without disease progression. The aim of this project was to study the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-alpha in CML patients in prolonged remission and isolate biological markers predicting response. Due to rarity of patients on IFN-alpha monotherapy, a relatively small cohort of patients still on treatment (IFN-ON, n = 10, median therapy duration 11.8 years) or had discontinued IFN-alpha therapy but remained in remission for >2 years (IFN-OFF, n = 9) were studied. The lymphocyte immunophenotype was analyzed with a comprehensive flow cytometry panel and plasma cytokine levels were measured with multiplex bead-based assay. In addition, the clonality status of different lymphocyte subpopulations was analyzed by TCR gamma/delta rearrangement assay. Median NK-cell absolute number and proportion from lymphocytes in blood was higher in IFN-OFF patients as compared to IFN-ON patients or controls (0.42, 0.19, 0.21x10(9)/L; 26%, 12%, 11%, respectively, p<0.001). The proportion of CD8+ T-cells was significantly increased in both patient groups and a larger proportion of T-cells expressed CD45RO. Most (95%) patients had significant numbers of oligoclonal lymphocytes characterized by T-cell receptor gamma/delta rearrangements. Strikingly, in the majority of patients (79%) a distinct clonal Vgamma9 gene rearrangement was observed residing in gammadelta(+) T-cell population. Similar unique clonality pattern was not observed in TKI treated CML patients. Plasma eotaxin and MCP-1 cytokines were significantly increased in IFN-OFF patients. Despite the limited number of patients, our data indicates that IFN-alpha treated CML patients in remission have increased numbers of NK-cells and clonal gammadelta(+) T-cells and a unique plasma cytokine profile. These factors may relate to anti-leukemic effects of IFN-alpha in this specific group of patients and account for prolonged therapy responses even after drug discontinuation.",,"['Kreutzman, Anna', 'Rohon, Peter', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Indrak, Karel', 'Juvonen, Vesa', 'Kairisto, Veli', 'Voglova, Jaroslava', 'Sinisalo, Marjatta', 'Flochova, Emilia', 'Vakkila, Jukka', 'Arstila, Petteri', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Kreutzman A', 'Rohon P', 'Faber E', 'Indrak K', 'Juvonen V', 'Kairisto V', 'Voglova J', 'Sinisalo M', 'Flochova E', 'Vakkila J', 'Arstila P', 'Porkka K', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110809,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2011/08/23 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/08/23 06:00'],"['2011/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0023022 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-04483 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e23022. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023022.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes CNS become a refugee to leukemic cells and serves as a resource of cells that seed extraneural sites. How can the leukemic cells disrupt this barrier and invasive the CNS, even if many of the currently available chemotherapies can not cross the BBB? Tight junction in endothelial cells occupies a central role in the function of the BBB. Except the well known role of degrading extracellular matrix in metastasis of cancer cells, here we show matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, secreted by leukemic cells, mediate the BBB opening by disrupting tight junction proteins in the CNS leukemia. We demonstrated that leukemic cells impaired tight junction proteins ZO-1, claudin-5 and occludin resulting in increased permeability of the BBB. However, these alterations reduced when MMP-2 and -9 activities were inhibited by RNA interference strategy or by MMP inhibitor GM6001 in an in vitro BBB model. We also found that the disruption of the BBB in company with the down-regulation of ZO-1, claudin-5 and occludin and the up-regulation of MMP-2 and -9 in mouse brain tissues with leukemic cell infiltration by confocal imaging and the assay of in situ gelatin zymography. Besides, GM6001 protected all mice against CNS leukemia.

METHODS: A review of the index case was carried out at the paediatric department of Federal Medical Centre, Bida, Nigeria. This review took into cognisance patient's demographic bio data, case history, general and physical examination, various investigations, methods of diagnosis and the type treatment. A comprehensive analysis and account of events before and after the commencement of chemotherapy were also reviewed. RESULTS: This case identifies a 5 year old girl with aggressive malignant lymphoma; lymphoblastic type and the myriad of limitations faced by oncologists and pathologists in the management of haematological malignancies. Socio-cultural, financial (cost implications for the patient for both investigative and therapeutic interventions), inadequate resources and facilities were identified as some of the constraints leading to inadequate management and poor outcome in patients with this condition. CONCLUSION: Given the limitations associated with the management of cancers in this part of the world, efforts on the part of government and non-governmental agencies are necessary to strengthen and upgrade the existing facilities in various hospitals.

Such a phenotypic switch also is seen in the case of endogenous oncogenic Kras. Two possibilities might account for this observation and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. First, the MPD phenotypes in primary Nras G12D/G12D mice might be a transient phenomenon attributable to microenvironmental factors that do not necessarily imply the potential for long-term maintenance in a hematopoietic-cell autonomous manner. Second, it is likely that MPD phenotypes are maintained by genetically altered hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Nras G12D/G12D signaling might substantially alter HSC behaviors (e.g. induce their proliferative exhaustion) so that these HSCs no longer sustain MPD phenotypes to a lethal stage in recipient mice.

The checkpoint at the Fraction C'-D transition is critical for immunoglobulin light chain gene recombination and to prevent malignant transformation into acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Inducible activation of BCL6 downstream of the pre-B cell receptor results in transcriptional repression of MYC and CCND2.

Here we tested the hypothesis that blockade of Th1 and Th17 differentiation is required to prevent GVHD in mice.

We have previously shown that TGF-beta-induced expression and activation of serum response factor (SRF) is required for this process. In this study, we examined the signaling mechanism for SRF activation by TGF-beta as it relates to pulmonary myofibroblast differentiation. TGF-beta stimulated a profound, but delayed (18-24 h), activation of Rho kinase and formation of actin stress fibers, which paralleled SM alpha-actin expression. The translational inhibitor cycloheximide blocked these processes without affecting Smad-dependent gene transcription. Inhibition of Rho kinase by Y-27632 or depolymerization of actin by latrunculin B resulted in inhibition TGF-beta-induced SRF activation and SM alpha-actin expression, having no effect on Smad signaling. Conversely, stabilization of actin stress fibers by jasplakinolide was sufficient to drive these processes in the absence of TGF-beta. TGF-beta promoted a delayed nuclear accumulation of the SRF coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1)/myocardin-related transcription factor-A, which was inhibited by latrunculin B. Furthermore, TGF-beta also induced MKL1 expression, which was inhibited by latrunculin B, by SRF inhibitor CCG-1423, or by SRF knockdown. Together, these data suggest a triphasic model for myofibroblast differentiation in response to TGF-beta that involves 1) initial Smad-dependent expression of intermediate signaling molecules driving Rho activation and stress fiber formation, 2) nuclear accumulation of MKL1 and activation of SRF as a result of actin polymerization, and 3) SRF-dependent expression of MKL1, driving further myofibroblast differentiation.",,"['Sandbo, Nathan', 'Lau, Andrew', 'Kach, Jacob', 'Ngam, Caitlyn', 'Yau, Douglas', 'Dulin, Nickolai O']","['Sandbo N', 'Lau A', 'Kach J', 'Ngam C', 'Yau D', 'Dulin NO']","['Univ. of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 5229 MFCB 1685 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705, USA. nsandbo@medicine.wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110819,United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

We established a rat model of MTX-induced cognitive deficits to further investigate the underlying pathophysiology and to develop protective therapeutic interventions. IT MTX 0.5 mg/kg was administered to 10-week old male Long Evans rats. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected for measurement of folate, homocysteine, and excitotoxic glutamate analogs. Recognition and spatial memory were tested in the novel object recognition (NOR) task and the object placement (OP) task, respectively. Four doses of IT MTX in a two-week period induced cognitive deficits persisting at least three months after the final injection. CSF concentrations of the excitotoxic glutamate analogs homocysteic acid and homocysteine sulfinic acid were increased relative to baseline for the same three-month period. Dextromethorphan, a noncompetitive antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily for a total of four doses, improved cognitive function among the MTX-treated rats, with no effect on control rats. Although this improvement was transient, each repeated treatment with dextromethorphan was followed by normalization of cognitive function. In conclusion, IT MTX induces persistent alterations in glutaminergic tone that may contribute to persistent cognitive deficits.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of 5-aza on human dendritic cells (DC) generated from peripheral blood monocytes, and to test the type of immune response induced in patients treated with 5-aza. On the phenotypic level, CD40 and CD86 expression was significantly increased on mature DC exposed to 5-aza (5-aza-DC), compared with control untreated DC. Mature control DC and mature 5-aza-DC secreted comparable amounts of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, mature 5-aza-DC secreted significantly lower levels of IL-10 and IL-27 compared to mature control DC (p = 0.04 and p = 0.005, respectively). In the peripheral blood of 14 patients (7 males and 7 females; age range, 53-81 years) with advanced myeloid malignancies (8 acute myeloid leukemia and 6 myelodysplastic syndrome) treated with 5-aza, there was a significant decrease of IL-4-secreting CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.001), and a significant increase of IL-17A- and IL-21-secreting CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.003 and p = 0.01, respectively, compared to 5 healthy donors) suggesting a Th17 response pattern in the blood of patients receiving 5-aza. In all, these data suggest potentially novel mechanisms of action of epigenetic therapies, such as 5-aza, which may have broader implications for immunotherapeutic strategies.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

A crucial prerequisite to obtain a downregulation is an efficient and nontoxic delivery of the siRNA into the target cells. However, this has proven difficult to accomplish, particular in cells in suspension. Thus, there is a need for a systematic evaluation of different methodologies to identify the most suitable protocol. We compared Nucleofection with Accell, a novel nonviral-based delivery system in the setting of leukemic blasts from patients with myeloid leukemias. Two cell surface proteins, human inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor and CD96, both believed to be associated with leukemic stem cells, were chosen as target genes. Accell not only yielded higher transfection rates, but also retained superior cell viabilities for both cell lines and primary leukemic cells. Thus, transfection efficiencies in primary cells after Accell delivery was 85% (range, 71-97%) compared to 38% (23-65%) using Nucleofection for siRNA delivery. Preliminary studies of clonal growth of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells indicated growth inhibition after siRNA transfection. Our results reveal that Accell delivery is suitable for nonviral transfection of cells in suspension, including primary leukemic cells. These data should provide a platform for further studies of genes involved in early leukemogenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

Among the genes identified, one of particular interest was DOK1, or downstream of tyrosine kinase 1, previously recognized as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) for leukemia and other human malignancies. Using bisulfite sequencing, we determined that a 5'-non-coding DNA region (located at nt -1158 to -850, upstream of the DOK1 translation start codon) was extensively hypermethylated in primary serous EOC tumors compared with normal ovarian specimens; however, this hypermethylation was not associated with DOK1 suppression. On the contrary, DOK1 was found to be strongly overexpressed in serous EOC tumors as compared to normal tissue and importantly, DOK1 overexpression significantly correlated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) values of serous EOC patients. Ectopic modulation of DOK1 expression in EOC cells and consecutive functional analyses pointed toward association of DOK1 expression with increased EOC cell migration and proliferation, and better sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Gene expression profiling and consecutive network and pathway analyses were also confirmative for DOK1 association with EOC cell migration and proliferation. These analyses were also indicative for DOK1 protective role in EOC tumorigenesis, linked to DOK1-mediated induction of some tumor suppressor factors and its suppression of pro-metastasis genes. Taken together, our findings are suggestive for a possible tumor suppressor role of DOK1 in EOC; however its implication in enhanced EOC cell migration and proliferation restrain us to conclude that DOK1 represents a true TSG in EOC. Further studies are needed to more completely elucidate the functional implications of DOK1 and other members of the DOK gene family in ovarian tumorigenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

We present data from the Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials-newly diagnosed patients (ENESTnd) study after a minimum follow-up of 24 months. METHODS: ENESTnd was a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised study. Adult patients were eligible if they had been diagnosed with chronic phase, Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML within the previous 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive nilotinib 300 mg twice a day, nilotinib 400 mg twice a day, or imatinib 400 mg once a day, all administered orally, by use of a computer-generated randomisation schedule, using permuted blocks, and stratified according to Sokal score. Efficacy results are reported for the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was major molecular response at 12 months, defined as BCR-ABL transcript levels on the International Scale (BCR-ABL(IS)) of 0.1% or less by real-time quantitative PCR in peripheral blood. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471497. FINDINGS: 282 patients were randomly assigned to receive nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 281 to receive nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 283 to receive imatinib. By 24 months, significantly more patients had a major molecular response with nilotinib than with imatinib (201 [71%] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 187 [67%] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 124 [44%] with imatinib; p<0.0001 for both comparisons). Significantly more patients in the nilotinib groups achieved a complete molecular response (defined as a reduction of BCR-ABL(IS) levels to </=0.0032%) at any time than did those in the imatinib group (74 [26%] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 59 [21%] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 29 [10%] with imatinib; p<0.0001 for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs imatinib, p=0.0004 for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily vs imatinib). There were fewer progressions to accelerated or blast phase on treatment, including clonal evolution, in the nilotinib groups than in the imatinib group (two with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, five with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 17 with imatinib; p=0.0003 for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs imatinib, p=0.0089 for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily vs imatinib). At 24 months, survival was comparable in all treatment groups, but fewer CML-related deaths had occurred in both the nilotinib groups than in the imatinib group (five with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, three with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and ten with imatinib). Overall, the only grade 3 or 4 non-haematological adverse events that occurred in at least 2.5% of patients were headache (eight [3%] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, four [1%] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and two [<1%] with imatinib) and rash (two [<1%], seven [3%], and five [2%], respectively). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more common with imatinib than with either dose of nilotinib (33 [12%] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 30 [11%] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 59 [21%] with imatinib). Serious adverse events were reported in eight additional patients in the second year of the study (four with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, three with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and one with imatinib). INTERPRETATION: Nilotinib continues to show better efficacy than imatinib for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase. These results support nilotinib as a first-line treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed disease. FUNDING: Novartis.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Over 93% of the population present on the day of the accident within a 5-mile radius was enrolled and interviewed. We used the registry to investigate the potential cancer risk from low-dose radiation exposure among the TMI population. METHODS: Cancer incidence data among the TMI cohort were available from 1982 to 1995. Because more than 97% of the population were white and few cancer cases were reported for those younger than 18 years of age, we included whites of age 18 years and older (10,446 men and 11,048 women) for further analyses. Cox regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) per 0.1 mSv and 95% confident interval (CI) of cancer by radiation-related exposures. The cancers of interest were all malignant neoplasms, cancer of bronchus, trachea, and lung, cancer of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, leukemia, and female breast. RESULTS: Among men and women, there was no evidence of an increased risk for all malignant neoplasms among the TMI cohort exposed to higher maximum and likely gamma radiation (RR=1.00, 95% CI=0.97, 1.01 and RR=0.99, 95% CI=0.94, 1.03, respectively) after adjusting for age, gender, education, smoking, and background radiation. Elevation in risk was noted for cancer of the bronchus, trachea, and lung in relation to higher background radiation exposure (RR=1.45, 95% CI=1.02-2.05 at 8.0-8.8 muR/h compared to 5.2-7.2 muR/h). An increased risk of leukemia was found among men exposed to higher maximum and likely gamma radiation related to TMI exposure during the ten days following the accident (RR=1.15, 95% CI=1.04, 1.29 and RR=1.36, 95% CI=1.08, 1.71, respectively). This relationship was not found in women. CONCLUSION: Increased cancer risks from low-level radiation exposure within the TMI cohort were small and mostly statistically non-significant. However, additional follow-up on this population is warranted, especially to explore the increased risk of leukemia found in men.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study examines the incidence, characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients who developed secondary myeloid-type leukemia after a diagnosis of EOC. METHODS: National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database was pooled for diagnosis of secondary myeloid leukemia after an initial diagnosis of EOC. This group of patients was compared to patients with de novo AML, and to EOC patients who did not develop secondary myeloid leukemia. Demographic, cytopathological and survival data were recorded. Cox Proportional Hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for developing secondary leukemia and to determine the statistically significant variables impacting survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were obtained and comparisons between the groups were performed using log-rank test. RESULTS: One hundred and nine myeloid leukemia cases were identified among 63,359 patients with a prior diagnosis of EOC for an overall incidence of 0.17%. The median latency to development of leukemia was 4 years (range 0-27 years). Median survival from the time of secondary leukemia diagnosis was 3 months and significantly worse than the 6 month median survival in patients with de novo AML (p<0.001). Age at leukemia diagnosis greater than 65 and development of secondary vs. de novo leukemia had a statistically worse prognosis on multivariate analysis (HR of 2.69, 95%CI 2.60-2.78 and 1.81, 95%CI 1.49-2.20 respectively). The development of secondary leukemia was more common with EOC diagnosis made prior to the platinum/taxane era (HR 6.70, 95%CI 3.69-12.18). There was no difference in median survival between EOC patients who developed AML and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Development of t-AML is a rare but lethal event among EOC patients, and its incidence has decreased significantly since the use of platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy became the standard of care.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to analyze subtype distribution of lymphomas in southwest China. METHODS: Lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed within 9 years in a single institution in Southwest China were analyzed according to the WHO classification. RESULTS: From January 2000 to December 2008, a total number of 6,382 patients with lymphoma were established, of which mature B-cell neoplasms accounted for 56%, mature T- and NK-cell neoplasms occupied 26%, and precursor lymphoid neoplasms and Hodgkin lymphomas were 5% and 13%, respectively. Mixed cellularity (76%) was the major subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma; and the bimodal age distribution was not observed. The top six subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma were as follows: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, follicular lymphoma, precursor lymphoid neoplasms, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Extranodal lymphomas comprised about half of all cases, and most frequently involved Waldeyer's ring, gastrointestinal tract, sinonasal region and skin. CONCLUSIONS: The lymphoid neoplasms of Southwest China displayed some epidemiologic features similar to those reported in literature from western and Asian countries, as well as other regions of China, whereas some subtypes showed distinct features.

They are produced by translocations and other chromosomal rearrangements of a subset of tyrosine kinase genes, including ABL, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, SYK, RET, JAK2 and ALK. Based on recent findings, this review discusses the common mechanisms of activation of these fusion genes. Enforced oligomerization and inactivation of inhibitory domains are the two key processes that switch on the kinase domain. Activated tyrosine kinase fusions then signal via an array of transduction cascades, which are largely shared. In addition, the fusion partner provides a scaffold for the recruitment of proteins that contribute to signalling, protein stability, cellular localization and oligomerization. The expression level of the fusion protein is another critical parameter. Its transcription is controlled by the partner gene promoter, while translation may be regulated by miRNA. Several mechanisms also prevent the degradation of the oncoprotein by proteasomes and lysosomes, leading to its accumulation in cells. The selective inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity by adenosine-5'-triphosphate competitors, such as imatinib, is a major therapeutic success. Imatinib induces remission in leukaemia patients that are positive for BCR-ABL or PDGFR fusions. Recently, crizotinib produced promising results in a subtype of lung cancers with ALK fusion. However, resistance was reported in both cases, partially due to mutations. To tackle this problem, additional levels of therapeutic interventions are suggested by the complex mechanisms of fusion tyrosine kinase activation. New approaches include allosteric inhibition and interfering with oligomerization or chaperones.","['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']","['Medves, Sandrine', 'Demoulin, Jean-Baptiste']","['Medves S', 'Demoulin JB']","['De Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '53AH36668S (Crizotinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Crizotinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Fusion/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/08/23 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2011/08/23 06:00'],"['2011/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01415.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2012 Feb;16(2):237-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01415.x.,PMC3823288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the impact of OSM on the gene activation profile of human synovial cells, which play a central role in the progression of inflammatory responses in joints. In synovial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, recombinant human OSM and native OSM secreted by human granulocytes both reduced the gene expression and secretion of IL-1beta and CXCL8, but increased that of IL-6 and CCL2. This impact on synovial cell activation was not obtained using IL-6 or leukaemia inhibitory factor. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 appeared to mediate the effects of OSM on stimulated human synovial fibroblasts. In the murine dorsal air pouch model of inflammation, OSM reduced the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in lining tissues, and their presence in the cavity.

Subsequent studies have shown that XMRV is also detected in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and even in some healthy controls and blood donors. However, some conflicting findings have been reported by different laboratories or in different regions. The association of XMRV with human diseases and the prevalence of XMRV in different populations needs to be further determined. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: XMRV was screened in 391 blood samples from healthy blood donors in China. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify gag and env genes of XMRV from total RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and plasma, respectively. Quantitative PCR was performed to detect XMRV env gene in genomic DNA of PBMNCs. To enhance the detection sensitivity, plasma was added into LNCaP cells to amplify XMRV in the plasma samples. RESULTS: No XMRV was found in the 391 blood donors in China or in the LNCaP cells inoculated with plasma from the blood donors. CONCLUSION: Both PCR and virus isolation in highly permissive LNCaP cells failed to detect XMRV in 391 Chinese blood donors, indicating that XMRV infection might not be present in blood donors in China.",['(c) 2012 American Association of Blood Banks.'],"['Mi, Zhiqiang', 'Lu, Ying', 'Zhang, Shana', 'An, Xiaoping', 'Wang, Xiaona', 'Chen, Bin', 'Wang, Quanli', 'Tong, Yigang']","['Mi Z', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang S', 'An X', 'Wang X', 'Chen B', 'Wang Q', 'Tong Y']","['Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology and Affiliated Hospital, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. zhiqiangmi@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110819,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Blood Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Blood Safety', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'China/epidemiology', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/epidemiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Young Adult']",2011/08/23 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/08/23 06:00'],"['2011/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03267.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2012 Feb;52(2):326-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03267.x.

The present study was aimed to elucidate the mechanism(s) of action of bresol at the cellular and molecular levels, using human monocyte leukemia cells. The effects of bresol on phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) gene expression were analyzed using human monocytic U937 leukemia cells. The ability of bresol to stimulate cAMP formation in these cells, as well as its effects on mediators of inflammation like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), nitric oxide (NO), and cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated U937 cells, were also studied. The results here indicated that bresol exhibited potential anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting LPS-induced PDE4B gene expression in the cells. Bresol also dose dependently activated cAMP formation, and inhibited TNFalpha, NO, as well as COX-2 formation in the LPS-stimulated cells. Based upon the results, we concluded that the reported anti-inflammatory activity of bresol might be attributed to its abilities to inhibit PDE4B and thus elevate cAMP levels in human monocytes.

In the present study, the complete nucleotide sequences of four isolates (Tym-43, U-1, Sp-40 and Sp-53) related to the FGV prototype were determined and their pathogenicity was investigated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 3'-long terminal repeat of all isolates grouped together in a cluster, while sequences of the surface (SU) proteins encoded by the env gene of these viruses had 85 to 96% identity with the corresponding region of FGV. The SU regions of Tym-43, U-1 and FGV grouped together in a cluster, but those of Sp-40 and Sp-53 formed a completely separate cluster. Next, C/O specific-pathogen-free chickens were inoculated in ovo with these isolates as well as the chimeric virus RCAS(A)-(FGVenvSU), constructed by substituting the SU region of FGV into the retroviral vector RCAS(A).

The quality of clinical response following treatment may be improved to a level where residual leukemic cells become undetectable. As patients with this type of response appear to have extended survival rates, minimal residual disease (MRD) eradication is considered a new objective in CLL treatment with the aim of improving progression-free survival (PFS) and potentially overall survival (OS). This review therefore aims to overview the prognostic value of MRD eradication in CLL, the role of post-remission intervention with ""passive"" immunotherapy (alemtuzumab or rituximab) so as to eliminate persistent MRD or prevent MRD relapse, the impact of these strategies on disease-free survival and their possible adverse consequences.

Cells with the surface antigen introduced into the channel immediately accumulated on the surface of the band electrode during p-DEP generated by the application of ac voltage between the ITO electrode and the band electrode to immobilize by the specific antibody. The removal of accumulated cells to the gap region during n-DEP was used for rapid estimation of the residual cells with a specific surface antigen.

Imatinib is a substrate of human organic cation transporter-1 (hOCT1), which actively delivers the drug into the cells, and efflux transporters. To identify potential imatinib failures, we investigated the expression of hOCT1 using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in 155 CML patients. Patients with low pretreatment hOCT1 expression had inferior major and complete molecular response (MMR and CMR) rates (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001) achieved any time or at 18 months of imatinib treatment (p = 0.023, p = 0.022).

In vitro culture of SSCs is a crucial technique for gene manipulation of SSCs to generate transgenic animals, for transplantation of SSCs to restore male fertility for infertile man, and for generation of pluripotent stem cells from SSCs to differentiate into various cell lineages. Isolation of highly purified SSCs is an all-important component for development of these techniques. However, definitive markers for SSCs, which purify SSCs (100% enrichment), are unknown. SSCs of many species can colonize the mouse testis; thus, we reasoned that same molecules of SSCs are conserved between species.

The hypothesis tested in this work was that E-cadherin (also known as CDH1) can be expressed by undifferentiated spermatogonia of rat testes. In this paper, cross-section immunohistochemistry and whole-mount immunohistochemistry of rat seminiferous tubules were conducted to show that E-cadherin-positive cells were small in number and there are single, paired, and aligned spermatogonia attached along the basement membrane.

Retroviral expression of Lnk has been shown to suppress hematopoietic leukemic cell proliferation indicating its therapeutic value in cancer therapy. However, retroviral gene delivery carries risks of insertional mutagenesis. To circumvent this undesired consequence, we fused a cell permeable peptide octa-arginine to Lnk and evaluated the efficacy of inhibition of leukemic cell proliferation in vitro. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, proliferation assays, flow cytometry, Western Blot analyses were performed on wild-type (WT), mutant Lnk R8 or BSA treated M-MOK cells. We found that delivered WT, but not mutant Lnk R8 blocked TPO-induced M-MOK megakaryoblastic leukemic cell proliferation. In contrast, WT Lnk R8 showed no growth inhibitive effect on non-hematopoietic HELA or COS-7 cell. Moreover, we demonstrated that TPO-induced M-MOK cell growth inhibition by WT Lnk R8 was dose-dependent. Penetrated WT Lnk R8 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation and Western blots data indicated WT Lnk R8 interacted with endogeneous Jak2 and downregulated Jak-Stat and MAPK phosphorylation level in M-MOK cells after TPO stimulation. Treatment with specific inhibitors (TG101348 and PD98059) indicated Jak-Stat and MAPK pathways were crucial for TPO-induced proliferation of M-MOK cells. Further analyses using TF-1 and HEL leukemic cell-lines showed that WT Lnk R8 inhibited Jak2-dependent cell proliferation. Using cord blood-derived CD34+ stem cells, we found that delivered WT Lnk R8 blocked TPO-induced megakaryopoiesis in vitro. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Intracellular delivery of WT Lnk R8 fusion protein efficiently inhibited TPO-induced M-MOK leukemic cell growth by promoting apoptosis. WT Lnk R8 protein delivery may provide a safer and more practical approach to inhibit leukemic cell growth worthy of further development.",,"['Looi, Chung Yeng', 'Imanishi, Miki', 'Takaki, Satoshi', 'Sato, Miki', 'Chiba, Natsuko', 'Sasahara, Yoji', 'Futaki, Shiroh', 'Tsuchiya, Shigeru', 'Kumaki, Satoru']","['Looi CY', 'Imanishi M', 'Takaki S', 'Sato M', 'Chiba N', 'Sasahara Y', 'Futaki S', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Kumaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110810,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (octaarginine)', '6L1XP550I6 (Fedratinib)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology']",2011/08/20 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0023640 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-06653 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e23640. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023640.

Thus the precise localization of nucleosomes relative to transcription start sites and other factor binding sites is expected to be a critical component of transcriptional regulation. Recently developed microarray approaches have allowed the rapid mapping of nucleosome positions over hundreds of kilobases (kb) of human genomic DNA, although these approaches have not yet been widely used to measure chromatin changes associated with changes in transcription. Here, we use custom tiling microarrays to reveal changes in nucleosome positions and abundance that occur when hormone-bound glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds to sites near target gene promoters in human osteosarcoma cells. The most striking change is an increase in measured nucleosome occupancy at sites spanning approximately 1 kb upstream and downstream of transcription start sites, which occurs one hour after addition of hormone, but is lost at 4 hours. Unexpectedly, this increase was seen both on GR-regulated and GR-non-regulated genes. In addition, the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor (a GR co-activator) was found to be important for increased occupancy upon hormone treatment and also for low nucleosome occupancy without hormone. Most surprisingly, similar increases in nucleosome occupancy were also seen on both regulated and non-regulated promoters during differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells and upon activation of human CD4+ T-cells. These results indicate that dramatic changes in chromatin structure over approximately 2 kb of human promoters may occur genomewide and in response to a variety of stimuli, and suggest novel models for transcriptional regulation.",,"['Pham, Chuong D', 'Sims, Hillel I', 'Archer, Trevor K', 'Schnitzler, Gavin R']","['Pham CD', 'Sims HI', 'Archer TK', 'Schnitzler GR']","['AstraZeneca R&D Boston, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110811,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (SWI-SNF-B chromatin-remodeling complex)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2011/08/20 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/08/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0023490 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07376 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e23490. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023490.

The deubiqituinase USP44 was identified as a key regulator of APC/C and has been proposed to suppress Cdc20-APC/C activity by maintaining its association with the inhibitory protein Mad2 until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. However, this notion has been challenged by data in which a lysine-less mutant of Cdc20 leads to premature anaphase, suggesting that it's ubiquitination is not required for APC/C activation. To further evaluate its role in checkpoint function and chromosome instability, we studied the consequences of over-expression of mouse Usp44 in non-transformed murine embryonic fibroblasts. Here we show that cells with high Usp44 are prone to chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidization. We find that high Usp44 promotes association of Mad2 with Cdc20 and reinforces the mitotic checkpoint. Surprisingly, the APC/C-Cdc20 substrate cyclin B1 is stabilized in G2 when Usp44 is over-expressed, but is degraded with normal kinetics once cells enter mitosis. Furthermore, we show that USP44 expression is elevated in subset of T-cell leukemias. These data are consistent with an important role for USP44 in regulating Cdc20-APC/C activity and suggest that high levels of this enzyme may contribute to the pathogenesis of T-ALL.",,"['Zhang, Ying', 'van Deursen, Jan', 'Galardy, Paul J']","['Zhang Y', 'van Deursen J', 'Galardy PJ']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110811,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Chromosomal Instability/drug effects/*genetics', 'Chromosome Segregation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases']",2011/08/20 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/08/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0023389 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07978 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e23389. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023389.

Mutations in MLL3 were found in a whole genome analysis of colorectal cancer but have not been confirmed by a separate study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed mutations of coding region and promoter methylation in MLL3 using 126 cases of colorectal cancer. We found two isoforms of MLL3 and DNA sequencing revealed frameshift and other mutations affecting both isoforms of MLL3 in colorectal cancer cells and 19 of 134 (14%) primary colorectal samples analyzed. Moreover, frameshift mutations were more common in cases with microsatellite instability (31%) both in CRC cell lines and primary tumors. The largest isoform of MLL3 is transcribed from a CpG island-associated promoter that has highly homology with a pseudo-gene on chromosome 22 (psiTPTE22). Using an assay which measured both loci simultaneously we found prominent age related methylation in normal colon (from 21% in individuals less than 25 years old to 56% in individuals older than 70, R = 0.88, p<0.001) and frequent hypermethylation (83%) in both CRC cell lines and primary tumors. We next studied the two loci separately and found that age and cancer related methylation was solely a property of the pseudogene CpG island and that the MLL3 loci was unmethylated. CONCLUSIONS: We found that frameshift mutations of MLL3 in both CRC cells and primary tumor that were more common in cases with microsatellite instability. Moreover, we have shown CpG island-associated promoter of MLL3 gene has no DNA methylation in CRC cells but also primary tumor and normal colon, and this region has a highly homologous of pseudo gene (psiTPTE22) that was age relate DNA methylation.",,"['Watanabe, Yoshiyuki', 'Castoro, Ryan J', 'Kim, Hyun Soo', 'North, Brittany', 'Oikawa, Ritsuko', 'Hiraishi, Tetsuya', 'Ahmed, Saira S', 'Chung, Woonbok', 'Cho, Mee-Yon', 'Toyota, Minoru', 'Itoh, Fumio', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Watanabe Y', 'Castoro RJ', 'Kim HS', 'North B', 'Oikawa R', 'Hiraishi T', 'Ahmed SS', 'Chung W', 'Cho MY', 'Toyota M', 'Itoh F', 'Estecio MR', 'Shen L', 'Jelinek J', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In the present study we investigated whether hypoxia in leukemic BM contributes to the protective role of the BM microenvironment. We observed a marked expansion of hypoxic BM areas in immunodeficient mice engrafted with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Consistent with this finding, we found that hypoxia promotes chemoresistance in various ALL derived cell lines. These findings suggest to employ hypoxia-activated prodrugs to eliminate leukemia cells within hypoxic niches. Using several xenograft models, we demonstrated that administration of the hypoxia-activated dinitrobenzamide mustard, PR-104 prolonged survival and decreased leukemia burden of immune-deficient mice injected with primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

Overexpression and rearrangement of the c-myb gene (MYB) has been reported in some patients with leukemias and other types of cancers, implicating activated alleles of c-myb in the development of human tumors. Alternative RNA splicing can produce variants of c-myb with qualitatively distinct transcriptional activities that may be involved in transformation and leukemogenesis. Here, by performing a detailed, single molecule assay we found that c-myb alternative RNA splicing was elevated and much more complex in leukemia samples than in cell lines or CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal donors. The results revealed that leukemia samples express more than 60 different c-myb splice variants, most of which have multiple alternative splicing events and were not detectable by conventional microarray or PCR approaches. For example, the single molecule assay detected 21 and 22 splice variants containing the 9B and 9S exons, respectively, most of which encoded unexpected variant forms of c-Myb protein. Furthermore, the detailed analysis identified some splice variants whose expression correlated with poor survival in a small cohort of precursor B-ALL samples.

However, ultimately the majority of patients will develop refractory disease, indicating the need for new treatment modalities. In preclinical and clinical studies, promising results have been obtained with several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the myeloma tumor cell or the bone marrow microenvironment. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these mAbs include direct induction of tumor cell apoptosis via inhibition or activation of target molecules, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The capability of IMiDs to enhance ADCC and the modulation of various important signaling cascades in myeloma cells by both bortezomib and IMiDs forms the rationale to combine these novel agents with mAbs as new treatment strategies for myeloma patients. In this review, we will give an overview of various mAbs directly targeting myeloma tumor cells or indirectly via effects on the bone marrow microenvironment. Special focus will be on the combination of these mAbs with IMiDs or bortezomib.",,"['van de Donk, N W C J', 'Kamps, S', 'Mutis, T', 'Lokhorst, H M']","['van de Donk NW', 'Kamps S', 'Mutis T', 'Lokhorst HM']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. n.w.c.j.vandedonk@umcutrecht.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology/*therapy']",2011/08/20 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/08/20 06:00'],"['2011/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011214 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.214 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Feb;26(2):199-213. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.214.

The development of MDS is poorly understood and therefore, effective treatment options are limited. Recent progress has been made in identifying altered signaling pathways and understanding the HSC defects, which are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS. Several of these findings have implicated aberrant expression and function of microRNAs (miRNAs). Unique miRNA expression patterns have been identified in MDS patients and modeled in mice to recapitulate features of MDS.

Here, we report on the expression of SPOC1 in promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF)-positive undifferentiated spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) of the mouse testis. To investigate further the biological function of SPOC1 in germ cells we generated Spoc1 mutant mice from a gene-trap embryonic stem cell clone. Postpubertal homozygous Spoc1(-/-) animals displayed a pronounced progressive loss of germ cells from an initially normal germ epithelium of the testis tubules leading to testis hypoplasia. This loss first affected non-SSC stages of germ cells and then, at a later time point, the undifferentiated spermatogonia. Remarkably, successive loss of all germ cells (at >20 weeks of age) was preceded by a transient increase in the number of undifferentiated A(aligned) (A(al)) spermatogonia in younger mice (at >10 weeks of age). The number of primary Spoc1(-/-) gonocytes, the proliferation of germ cells, and the initiation and progression of meiosis was normal, but we noted a significantly elevated level of apoptosis in the Spoc1(-/-) testis.

However, data are frequently limited to one gene and therefore incomplete and in some instances conflicting. We analysed expression of all Eph and ephrin genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and 153 clinical specimens, providing for the first time a comprehensive analysis of this system in CRC. Eph/ephrin mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and correlated with protein expression (flow cytometry, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry). These data show that EphA1, EphA2, EphB2 and EphB4 were significantly over expressed in CRC. In all cases, at least one Eph gene was found in normal colon (EphA1, EphA2, EphB2, EphB4), where expression was observed at high levels in most CRCs. However, other Eph gene expression was lost in individual CRCs compared to the corresponding normal, EphA7 being a striking example. Loss of expression was more common in advanced disease and thus correlated with poor survival. This is consistent with the redundant functionality of Eph receptors, such that expression of a single Eph gene is sufficient for effector function. Overall, the data suggest a progressive loss of expression of individual Eph genes suggesting that individual CRCs need to be phenotyped to determine which Eph genes are highly expressed. Targeted therapies could then be selected from a group of specific antibodies, such as those developed for EphA1.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2011. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): Ten anovulatory women with PCOS and 5 fertile ovulatory women. INTERVENTION(S): Patients received 2.5 mg of letrozole on cycle days 3-7 (5 patients, 1 cycle) or 50 mg of CC on cycle days 5-9 (5 patients, 1 cycle). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Serum estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) endometrial protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), dickkhopf homolog 1 (DKK-1), fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF-22), and endometrial mRNA expression of LIF/GP130 receptor (LIFR). RESULT(S): No statistically significant differences were observed between groups compared with fertile ovulatory women when serum E and P were examined, or between body mass index (BMI), and cycle day at time of biopsy. Letrozole increased mRNA expression of LIF, DKK1, LIFR, and FGF-22, whereas CC only increased endometrial mRNA expression of LIF.

In this study, to characterize the HTLV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) populations in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs), HAM/TSP patients, and carriers with autoimmune disorders (CAIDs), we examined the role of programmed death-1 and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) in HTLV-1-specific CTL functions using an HTLV-1 Tax/HLA-A*0201 tetramer and an HTLV-1 Tax/HLA-A*2402 tetramer. Interestingly, the percentage of HTLV-1 Tax301-309/HLA-A*2402 tetramer(+)CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 in ACs was significantly higher than the percentage of HTLV-1 Tax11-19/HLA-A*0201 tetramer(+)CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1. PD-1 expression was significantly downregulated on HTLV-1-specific CTLs in HAM/TSP compared with ACs. PD-L1 expression was observed in a small proportion of unstimulated lymphocytes from ACs and was greater in ACs than in HAM/TSP and CAIDs after short-term culture. Furthermore, CTL degranulation was impaired in HAM/TSP, whereas anti-PD-L1 blockade significantly increased CTL function in ACs. Downregulation of PD-1 on HTLV-1-specific CTLs and loss of PD-L1 expression in HAM/TSP and CAIDs, along with impaired function of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in HAM/TSP, may underlie the apparently dysfunctional immune response against HTLV-1.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, tumors often develop resistances over time, which becomes a major issue for most gemcitabine-related chemotherapies. In the present study, a previously reported stearoyl gemcitabine nanoparticle formulation (GemC18-NPs) was evaluated for its ability to overcome gemcitabine resistance. In the wild type CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells, the IC(50) value of GemC18-NPs was 9.5-fold greater than that of gemcitabine hydrochloride (HCl). However, in the CCRF-CEM-AraC-8C cells that are deficient in the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1, the IC(50) of GemC18-NPs was only 3.4-fold greater than that in the parent CCRF-CEM cells, whereas the IC(50) of gemcitabine HCl was 471-fold greater than that in the parent CCRF-CEM cells. The GemC18-NPs were also more cytotoxic than gemcitabine HCl in the deoxycytidine kinase deficient (CCRF-CEM/dCK(-/-)) tumor cells. Similar to gemcitabine HCl, GemC18-NPs induced apoptosis through caspase activation. Another gemcitabine-resistant tumor cell line, TC-1-GR, was developed in our laboratory. In the TC-1-GR cells, the IC(50) of GemC18-NPs was only 5% of that of gemcitabine HCl. Importantly, GemC18-NPs effectively controlled the growth of gemcitabine resistant TC-1-GR tumors in mice, whereas the molar equivalent dose of gemcitabine HCl did not show any activity against the growth of the TC-1-GR tumors. Proteomics analysis revealed that the TC-1-GR cells over-expressed ribonucleotide reductase M1, which was likely the cause of the acquired gemcitabine resistance in the TC-1-GR cells. To our best knowledge, this represents the first report demonstrating that a nanoparticle formulation of gemcitabine overcomes gemcitabine resistance related to ribonucleotide reductase M1 over-expression.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Since Ca2+ is closely related to cellular homeostasis, we examined the capacity of alpha1-adrenergic drugs to modulate the intracellular Ca2+ content in K562 cells. Because of morphological alterations of mitochondria following alpha1-adrenergic agonist treatment, we also scrutinized mitochondrial functions. In order to visualize the non-adrenoceptor binding site(s) of alpha1-adrenergic drugs in erythroleukemia cells, we evaluated the application of the fluorescent alpha1-adrenergic antagonist BODIPY(R) FL-Prazosin. We discovered that the alpha1-adrenergic agonists naphazoline, oxymetazoline and also the alpha1-adrenergic antagonist benoxathian are able to raise the intracellular Ca2+-content in K562 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that naphazoline treatment induces ROS-formation as well as an increase in Deltapsim in K562 cells. Using BODIPY(R) FL-Prazosin we were able to visualize the non-adrenoceptor binding site(s) of alpha1-adrenergic drugs in erythroleukemia cells. Interestingly, the SERCA-inhibitor thapsigargin appears to interfere with the binding of BODIPY(R) FL-Prazosin. Our data suggest that the effects of alpha1-adrenergic drugs on erythroleukemia cells are mediated by a thapsigargin sensitive binding site, which controls the fate of erythroleukemia cells towards differentiation, senescence and cell death through modulation of intracellular Ca2+.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

One strategy is to overexpress proteins that suppress apoptosis, such as the Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. The Mcl-1 protein plays a pivotal role in protecting cells from apoptosis and is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. AREAS COVERED: Targeting Mcl-1 for extinction in these cancers, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, represents a potentially effectual means of developing new efficacious cancer therapeutics. Here we review the multiple strategies that have been employed in targeting this fundamental protein, as well as the significant potential these targeting agents provide in not only suppressing cancer growth, but also in reversing resistance to conventional cancer treatments. EXPERT OPINION: We discuss the potential issues that arise in targeting Mcl-1 and other Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins, as well problems with acquired resistance.

Cyclin A is a cell cycle regulatory protein which plays the role of a parameter of cell proliferation in various types of carcinomas including hematological malignancies. The role of BMPRIA, BMPRIB, BMPRI and cyclin A in the pathogenesis of acute leukemias remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of BMP receptors and cyclin A on blast cells and their possible relationship with clinical outcome. Seventy patients with acute leukemias (28 female and 42 male) and 10 aged-matched healthy controls were studied. All patients were examined before cytostatic treatment. The expression of BMP receptors and cyclin A was detected by flow cytometry. The results show that higher expression of BMPRIA, BMPRIB, BMPRII and cyclin A is related with a higher complete response (CR) rate, higher overall survival (OS) and lower relapse risk.

However, there is limited clinical outcome information for patients with the favorable-risk del(13q) and poor-risk unmutated IGHV. We retrospectively screened all patients with CLL at our institution between 2004 and June 2010 for del(13q) who also had an IGHV analysis. Unmutated IGHV was found in 38/79 patients; age, Rai stage, prior therapy, and time to evaluation were similar to those for patients with mutated IGHV. Unmutated patients were nearly four times more likely to harbor additional chromosomal aberrations compared to mutated patients (p < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 4.5 years, unmutated patients were more likely to demonstrate Rai stage progression (69% vs. 31%, log-rank p < 0.001) and to receive treatment (5-year cumulative probability of treatment: 65% vs. 32%, p < 0.001). Patients with unmutated CLL also had a shorter overall survival (5-year survival probability: 72% vs. 100%, p < 0.001). When limiting analysis to the 47 patients with del(13q) as a sole chromosomal abnormality, the 13 (28%) unmutated patients were more likely to demonstrate Rai progression (p < 0.001), to receive treatment (p = 0.02), and to have a shorter overall survival (p = 0.13) than the 34 mutated patients.

Indeed, the clinical trial for the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) that is currently ongoing at the Hannover Medical School (Germany) has recently reported the correction of all affected cell lineages of the hematopoietic system in the first treated patients. However, an extensive study of the clonal inventory of those patients reveals that LMO2, CCND2 and MDS1/EVI1 were preferentially prevalent. Moreover, a first leukemia case was observed in this study, thus reinforcing the need of developing safer vectors for gene transfer into HSC in general. Here we present a novel self-inactivating (SIN) vector for the gene therapy of WAS that combines improved safety features. We used the elongation factor 1 alpha (EFS) promoter, which has been extensively evaluated in terms of safety profile, to drive a codon-optimized human WASP cDNA. To test vector performance in a more clinically relevant setting, we transduced murine HSPC as well as human CD34+ cells and also analyzed vector efficacy in their differentiated myeloid progeny. Our results show that our novel vector generates comparable WAS protein levels and is as effective as the clinically used LTR-driven vector.

METHODS: A total of 1041 women diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 40 years responded to a retrospective survey on reproductive health history. Five cancer types were included: leukemia, Hodgkin disease (HD), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), breast cancer, and gastrointestinal(GI) cancer. Survey questions addressed acute ovarian failure (cessation of menses after treatment), early menopause (menopause before 45 years old), and infertility (failed conception). Logistic regression was used to determine the proportions of acute ovarian failure and infertility based on age at diagnosis. Censored data methods were used to determine the probability of early menopause. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty women received chemotherapy alone. The percentage reporting acute ovarian failure was 8%, 10%, 9%, and 5% for HD, NHL, breast cancer, and GI cancer, respectively. Acute ovarian failure increased significantly with age at diagnosis (P < .05). In subjects not reporting acute ovarian failure, the incidence of infertility was at least 40% at age 35 years and increased significantly with age at diagnosis in HD and breast cancer (P < .05). The estimated probability of early menopause was at least 25% at age 30 years and increased significantly with younger age at diagnosis in HD, NHL, and GI cancer (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients to receive appropriate counseling, it is important that they understand the potential increased risk of infertility and early menopause beyond that of acute ovarian failure.

We analyzed whether UVB irradiation is tolerated during the course of human allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and whether depletion of LCs by broadband UVB could improve GvHD outcome. A total of 17 patients received six whole-body UVB irradiations with 75% of the individually determined minimal erythemal dose after conditioning with a reduced intensity protocol. LCs, dermal dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages were analyzed before and after UVB irradiation by immunohistochemical analysis. Circulating blood cells and serum factors were analyzed in parallel. In striking contrast to previous data, our irradiation protocol was well tolerated in all patients. UVB treatment decreased the number of LCs and also affected dermal DCs. UVB-treated patients also had significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 serum levels and higher numbers of circulating CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. Strikingly, nine out of nine patients with complete LC depletion (<1 LC per field) developed only grade I GvHD or no GvHD up to day 100.

Eight of the 9 treated patients tolerated 19-28z(+) T-cell infusions well. Three of 4 evaluable patients with bulky CLL who received prior conditioning with cyclophosphamide exhibited either a significant reduction or a mixed response in lymphadenopathy without concomitant development of B-cell aplasia. In contrast, one patient with relapsed ALL who was treated in remission with a similar T-cell dose developed a predicted B-cell aplasia. The short-term persistence of infused T cells was enhanced by prior cyclophosphamide administration and inversely proportional to the peripheral blood tumor burden. Further analyses showed rapid trafficking of modified T cells to tumor and retained ex vivo cytotoxic potential of CD19-targeted T cells retrieved 8 days after infusion. We conclude that this adoptive T-cell approach is promising and more likely to show clinical benefit in the setting of prior conditioning chemotherapy and low tumor burden or minimal residual disease.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is known to have multiple functions in tumors, including single-strand DNA repair and induction of caspase-independent apoptosis. PARP has been suggested as a therapeutic target in adult malignancies, and this study examines whether it could also be a potential target in pediatric high-grade glioma. Tissue microarrays containing 150 formalin-fixed pediatric high-grade gliomas were examined by immunohistochemistry for levels of PARP and expression of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Full retrospective clinical and survival data were available for this cohort. Stratification and statistical analysis was performed to assess the effect of PARP status on prognosis. The level of PARP immunopositivity had a statistically significant inverse correlation (P = .019) with survival in supratentorial pediatric high-grade glioma. AIF staining was notable for its absence in the majority of tumors but with moderate levels of expression in surrounding normal brain. PARP is expressed at high levels in many pediatric high-grade gliomas, and in these tumors, the ability of PARP to activate AIF appears to have been lost.

It is most commonly associated with lung carcinoma but rarely is seen with certain infections. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 51-year-old Caucasian man who had acute myeloid leukemia and who developed a rapidly fulminating pneumonia along with signs and symptoms of acute brachial plexopathy and left Horner syndrome. Also, a purpuric plaque developed over his left chest wall and progressed to skin necrosis. The skin biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage showed a Rhizopus species, leading to a diagnosis of mucormycosis. This is a rare case of pneumonia due to mucormycosis associated with acute Pancoast syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: According to our review of the literature, only a few infectious agents have been reported to be associated with Pancoast syndrome. We found only three case reports of mucormycosis associated with acute Pancoast syndrome. Clinicians should consider mucormycosis in their differential diagnosis in a patient with pulmonary lesions and chest wall invasion with or without neurological symptoms, especially in the setting of neutropenia or other immunosuppressed conditions.

The occurrence of activating mutations in the gene encoding FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has rendered inhibition of this receptor a promising therapeutic target. Due to possibility of cross-reactivity, we investigated the effect of the irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor canertinib (CI-1033) on leukaemic cells expressing FLT3. The drug had anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on primary AML cells and human leukaemic cell lines expressing mutated FLT3. In several AML patient samples, a blast cell population expressing FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) was eradicated by canertinib. Canertinib inhibited receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity of both mutated and FLT3 ligand stimulated wildtype FLT3, leading to inhibition of the PI3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways. Apoptotic induction was dependent on pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BCL2L11/BIM because siRNA silencing attenuated apoptosis. Moreover, the drug induced regression of cells expressing FLT3-ITD in a murine in vivo-transplantation model at previously described tolerated doses.

The mice displayed early development of myeloproliferative neoplasm seen in the chronic phase of CML, which resulted in the early death of the mice. Pathologically, increased infiltration of myeloid cells into several tissues was detected in the absence of Cas-L. In a hematopoietic reconstitution assay, Cas-L(-/-) p210Bcr/Abl transgenic cells showed a low population in the spleen, although only their myeloid cell population was normal.

METHODS: In this case-control study, the genotypes of potential functional Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in COX-2 gene were determined with PCR-RFLP method in 446 patients and 725 controls. COX-2 mRNA level in Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bone marrow and COX-2 protein level in serum samples were examined by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: It was found that carriers with -765CC genotypes had a 2.19-fold (95% CI = 1.24-3.88; P < 0.001) excess risk of developing AML compared with non-carriers. A greater risk of developing AML was observed for A(-1195) -C(-765) haplotype compared with G(-1195) -G(-765) haplotype. Moreover, individuals with -765C-containing genotypes had significantly increased COX-2 mRNA level and protein level compared with the -765G-containing counterparts.

In two patients, an almost identical gain of chromosome 8 was identified. In both patients, fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed a constitutional partial trisomy 8 mosaic (cT8M). A survey on 27 cT8M patients with neoplasms showed that 21 had myeloid malignancies, and five of these had a JMML. Notably, the region gained in our cases is the smallest gain of chromosome 8 reported in cT8M cases with malignancies so far. Our results dramatically reduce the critical region to 8p11.21q11.21 harbouring 31 protein coding genes and two non-coding RNAs, e.g. MYST3, IKBKB, UBE2V2, GOLGA7, FNTA and MIR486--a finding with potential implications for the role of somatic trisomy 8 in myeloid malignancies. Further investigations are required to more comprehensively determine how constitutional partial trisomy 8 mosaicisms may contribute to leukaemogenesis in different mutational subtypes of JMML and other myeloid malignancies.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Ripperger, Tim', 'Tauscher, Marcel', 'Praulich, Inka', 'Pabst, Brigitte', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Yeoh, Allen', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Steinemann, Doris']","['Ripperger T', 'Tauscher M', 'Praulich I', 'Pabst B', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Yeoh A', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Flotho C', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Steinemann D']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110818,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (MIRN486 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'Chromosome 7, monosomy']",IM,"['Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', '*Mosaicism', '*Trisomy']",2011/08/19 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/19 06:00'],"['2011/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08817.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Oct;155(2):209-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08817.x.

We retrospectively evaluated the results of palliative splenic irradiation (PSI) in terms of symptomatic relief in patients with hematologic disorders. In 1998-2006, 32 patients with hematologic disorders (median age 57) received 52 courses of PSI for SM.

Splenomegaly was accompanied by pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia and cachexia. Radiation therapy to the entire spleen was delivered by two parallel opposed fields using 0.5 Gy daily fractions given 5 days per week to a total dose of 6-10 Gy. PSI resulted in splenic size reduction in 78.8%, improvement of anemia in 75% and improvement of thrombocytopenia in 63.5% of PSI courses. The median survival (MS) of patients with MPD, CLL and ML was 45, 10 and 5 months, respectively.

The incidence of second cancers after CLL has not been reported in detail for Australia, a country with particularly high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). METHODS: The study cohort comprised of all people diagnosed with a primary CLL between 1983 and 2005 in Australia. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using Australian population rates. RESULTS: Overall, the risk of any second incident cancer was more than double that of the general population (SIR=2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.07, 2.27) and remained elevated for at least 9 years after CLL. Risks were increased for many cancers, particularly melanoma (SIR=7.74, 95% CI=6.85, 8.72). The risk of melanoma increased at younger ages, but was constant across >9 years of follow-up. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients also had an increased risk of death because of melanoma (SMR=4.79, 95% CI=3.83, 5.90) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC; SMR=17.0, 95% CI=14.4, 19.8), suggesting that these skin cancers may be more aggressive in CLL patients. CONCLUSION: We speculate that a shared risk factor, such as general immune suppression, modulated by UVR exposure may explain the increased risk of melanoma and NMSC in CLL patients.",,"['Royle, J A', 'Baade, P D', 'Joske, D', 'Girschik, J', 'Fritschi, L']","['Royle JA', 'Baade PD', 'Joske D', 'Girschik J', 'Fritschi L']","['Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, University of Western Australia, Hospital Avenue, Nedlands WA 6009, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110816,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2011/08/19 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/18 06:00'],"['2011/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011313 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.313 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Sep 27;105(7):1076-81. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.313.

The substrate and product specificities of SET domain KMTs are pivotal to eliciting these effects due to the distinct functions associated with site and state-specific protein lysine methylation.

Only a few reports in Chinese patients are available. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 16 patients with HCL-C and HCL-V in Taiwan over a 17-year period. RESULTS: Eight were HCL-C and 8 were HCL-V. All HCL accounted for 0.7% of all adult leukemias. Compared to HCL-V, HCL-C was characterized by profound leukopenia, monocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and fewer circulating hairy cells. One HCL-C and 2 HCL-V patients had second malignancies. Seven HCL-C patients achieved hematological remission after splenectomy (n = 1) or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (n = 6). Of the 8 HCL-V patients, 6 received splenic irradiation. Only one achieved complete remission and another had partial remission; relapse or disease progression was noted 13.4 or 25.7 months later, respectively. Two of three HCL-V patients who underwent splenectomy had stable disease. All patients with HCL-C were alive while 3 with HCL-V expired. Compared to HCL-C, HCL-V had a significantly shorter leukemia-free survival. CONCLUSION: A relatively higher proportion of HCL-V in all HCL comparing to Westerners is observed. Second malignancies are common. With an inferior outcome and dismal response to most treatment, enrollment in a clinical trial should be considered for HCL-V.","['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

The incidence rates were similar in the two countries, but the survival data were highly different. Thus, relative survival at 5 years for de novo AL patients in Estonia was virtually negligible, whereas the corresponding figures for the Swedish patients increased from 20.3 to 38.9% during the study period. AIM: To prospectively compare the results for incidence and outcome of de novo AL between the two countries during 1997-2001. RESULTS: Incidence rates for de novo AL were lower in Estonia than in western Sweden but not significantly so. However, the survival for de novo AL patients in Estonia had improved considerably, with the relative survival at 5 years being 16.4%; such improvement was particularly seen in acute myeloid leukemia patients. For the Swedish patients, no change in survival was recorded. CONCLUSION: In Estonia, a remarkable improvement in outcome for young de novo AL patients was seen after 1996. Nevertheless, relative survival for the Estonian patients had still not reached the levels found in the Swedish cohort.","['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

Normal mature B cells constitutively express CD1d, but with the exception of some conflicting data, its expression in B-CLPDs is unknown. We demonstrate that in 222 B-CLPD cases, CD1d expression of less than 45% is strongly predictive of CLL (likelihood ratio, 32.3; specificity, 97.4%; sensitivity, 84.1%). In addition, CD1d showed significantly higher staining intensity in splenic marginal zone lymphoma compared with atypical hairy cell leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, thus allowing the discrimination of the former from the latter immunophenotypically overlapping B-CLPDs.

PML has been reported to function as a negative regulator of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and nuclear Akt under some conditions. mTOR and Akt pathways regulate a diverse array of pathways, including those that control insulin signaling, energy metabolism, growth, cellular survival, and lifespan. Although the PML-mTOR/Akt link suggests that PML may have metabolic functions in the whole organism, very little is known about the metabolic functions of PML. Here we report that PML(-/-) mice did not show any significant metabolic defects. There was no impairment in the mTOR/Akt or AMPK signaling in white adipose tissue, liver, or muscle. However, despite having normal food intake and activity levels, PML(-/-) mice gained body weight faster and had more fat mass, particularly subcutaneous fat mass, in the diet-induced obesity model. Using in vitro adipogenesis models, we discovered that PML is a suppressor of adipogenesis. PML expression decreased during adipogenesis and was undetectable in fully differentiated adipocytes. Loss of PML increased expression of the adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. We found that the Sirt1-NCor-SMRT corepressor complex, which represses pparg transcription, does not bind to the pparg promoter efficiently upon PML depletion. On the basis of these findings, we propose that PML is a negative regulator of the adipogenic transcription factors and that, in times of energy excess, PML may limit fat accumulation by suppressing the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes.",,"['Kim, Myung K', 'Yang, Shutong', 'Lee, Kyoung-Hwa', 'Um, Jee-Hyun', 'Liu, Mengyang', 'Kang, Hyeog', 'Park, Sung Jun', 'Chung, Jay H']","['Kim MK', 'Yang S', 'Lee KH', 'Um JH', 'Liu M', 'Kang H', 'Park SJ', 'Chung JH']","['Laboratory of Obesity and Aging Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

A longer survival raises the question of late effects, including development of another malignancy. Records of 1445 patients with CML/myeloproliferative neoplasm or other hematologic malignancies treated with TKIs were reviewed to investigate frequency and characteristics of second malignancies (other than acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome). The number of second cancers was compared with the number expected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. After a median follow-up of 107 months (range, 13-362 months) after CML/myeloproliferative neoplasm diagnosis, 66 patients (4.6%) developed 80 second cancers, including skin (31%), prostate (15%), melanoma (13%), digestive system (10%), kidney (4%), thyroid (4%), breast (3%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3%), hepatobiliary (3%), and other cancers (14%). Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, 55 second cancers were seen in 51 (3.5%) of all patients treated. The risk of second cancer was lower than expected (observed-to-expected ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.81).

From the 408 upregulated genes, 72% showed VDR binding within 400 kb of their transcription start sites (TSSs), while this applied only for 43% of the 230 downregulated genes. The VDR loci showed considerable variation in gene regulatory scenarios ranging from a single VDR location near the target gene TSS to very complex clusters of multiple VDR locations and target genes.

Its most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is almost invariably fatal, due in part to the intrinsic resistance of GBM to radiation- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. We analyzed B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) anti-apoptotic proteins in GBM and found myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) to be the highest expressed in the majority of malignant gliomas. Mcl-1 was functionally important, as neutralization of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis and increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. To determine how Mcl-1 was regulated in glioma, we analyzed the promoter and identified a novel functional single nucleotide polymorphism in an uncharacterized E26 transformation-specific (ETS) binding site. We identified the ETS transcription factor ELK4 as a critical regulator of Mcl-1 in glioma, since ELK4 downregulation was shown to reduce Mcl-1 and increase sensitivity to apoptosis. Importantly the presence of the single nucleotide polymorphism, which ablated ELK4 binding in gliomas, was associated with lower Mcl-1 levels and a greater dependence on Bcl-xL. Furthermore, in vivo, ELK4 downregulation reduced tumor formation in glioblastoma xenograft models.

This study was to observe the influence of adding ATG on GVHD prophylaxis and the quality of life (QoL) of 96 hemopathic patients after allo-HSCT. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 96 consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT, including 54 patients who received ATG regimen without in vitro T cell depletion (TCD) (ATG group) and 42 patients who received neither ATG regimen nor TCD (control group). All patients were followed up, and the factors, including age, sex, HLA and ABO compatibility, related and unrelated donors, and disease status, were undertaken to analysis. All patients in the study achieved trilineage engraftment with full-donor chimerism. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) was lower in the ATG group than that in the control group (29.6% versus 57.1%, P = .006), and the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 35.2% for patients with ATG and 66.7% for patients without ATG (P < .01). Notably, the proportion of patients with Karnofsky scores of >90 was 70.4% in the patients with ATG, and 28.6% in the patients without ATG (P < .001). Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of patients with opportunistic infection was significantly different in both groups posttransplantation, with 44.4% and 19.1% in recipient patients with or without ATG respectively (P < .05).

It is particularly common in the Hispanic populations residing in the United States, Costa Rica, and Mexico City. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of acute leukemia in children who were diagnosed and treated in public hospitals in Mexico City. METHODS: Included in this study were those children, under 15 years of age and residents of Mexico City, who were diagnosed in 2006 and 2007 with leukemia, as determined by using the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. The average annual incidence rates (AAIR), and the standardized average annual incidence rates (SAAIR) per million children were calculated. We calculated crude, age- and sex-specific incidence rates and adjusted for age by the direct method with the world population as standard. We determined if there were a correlation between the incidence of acute leukemias in the various boroughs of Mexico City and either the number of agricultural hectares, the average number of persons per household, or the municipal human development index for Mexico (used as a reference of socio-economic level). RESULTS: Although a total of 610 new cases of leukemia were registered during 2006-2007, only 228 fit the criteria for inclusion in this study. The overall SAAIR was 57.6 per million children (95% CI, 46.9-68.3); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was the most frequent type of leukemia, constituting 85.1% of the cases (SAAIR: 49.5 per million), followed by acute myeloblastic leukemia at 12.3% (SAAIR: 6.9 per million), and chronic myeloid leukemia at 1.7% (SAAIR: 0.9 per million). The 1-4 years age group had the highest SAAIR for ALL (77.7 per million). For cases of ALL, 73.2% had precursor B-cell immunophenotype (SAAIR: 35.8 per million) and 12.4% had T-cell immunophenotype (SAAIR 6.3 per million).

One prospective cohort study reported that 41% of HIV-infected patients met the criteria for alcoholism, however; few reports exist on the co-morbid effects of these two disease processes on skeletal muscle homeostasis. Thus, we analyzed the atrophic effects of chronic alcohol ingestion in HIV-1 transgenic rats and identified alterations to several catabolic and anabolic factors. FINDINGS: Relative plantaris mass, total protein content, and fiber cross-sectional area were reduced in each experimental group compared to healthy, control-fed rats. Alcohol abuse further reduced plantaris fiber area in HIV-1 transgenic rats. Consistent with previous reports, gene levels of myostatin and its receptor activin IIB were not increased in HIV-1 transgenic rat muscle. However, myostatin and activin IIB were induced in healthy and HIV-1 transgenic rats fed alcohol for 12 weeks. Catabolic signaling factors such as TGFbeta1, TNFalpha, and phospho-p38/total-p38 were increased in all groups compared to controls. There was no effect on IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in control-fed, transgenic rats. However, the co-morbidity of chronic alcohol abuse and HIV-1-related protein expression decreased expression of the two anabolic factors, CT-1 and CNTF. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous reports, alcohol abuse accentuated skeletal muscle atrophy in an animal model of HIV/AIDS. While some catabolic pathways known to drive alcoholic or HIV-1-associated myopathies were also elevated in this co-morbid model (e.g., TGFbeta1), consistent expression patterns were not apparent. Thus, specific alterations to signaling mechanisms such as the induction of the myostatin/activin IIB system or reductions in growth factor signaling via CT-1- and CNTF-dependent mechanisms may play larger roles in the regulation of muscle mass in alcoholic, HIV-1 models.",,"['Clary, Caroline R', 'Guidot, Daniel M', 'Bratina, Margaux A', 'Otis, Jeffrey S']","['Clary CR', 'Guidot DM', 'Bratina MA', 'Otis JS']","['Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, 615 Michael Street, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. clarycaro@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110816,England,AIDS Res Ther,AIDS research and therapy,101237921,,,,2011/08/19 06:00,2011/08/19 06:01,['2011/08/18 06:00'],"['2011/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:01 [medline]']","['1742-6405-8-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-6405-8-30 [doi]']",epublish,AIDS Res Ther. 2011 Aug 16;8:30. doi: 10.1186/1742-6405-8-30.,PMC3170178,,['P50 AA013757/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation of leukemic cells and complete remission of APL are achieved by treatment of patients with pharmacological doses of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), making APL a model disease for differentiation therapy. However, because patients are resistant to further treatment with ATRA on relapse, it is necessary to develop alternative treatment strategies to specifically target APL. We therefore sought to develop a treatment strategy based on lentiviral vector-mediated delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets the breakpoint region of PML-RARalpha. Unlike treatment with ATRA, which resulted in differentiation of leukemic NB4 cells, delivery of siRNA targeting PML-RARalpha into NB4 cells resulted in both differentiation and apoptosis, consistent with the specific knockdown of PML-RARalpha. Intraperitoneal injection of NB4 cells transduced with lentiviral vectors delivering PML-RARalpha-specific siRNA but not control siRNA prevented development of disease in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Taken together, these results indicate that development of PML-RARalpha-specific siRNA may represent a promising treatment strategy for ATRA-resistant APL.",,"['Ward, Simone V', 'Sternsdorf, Thomas', 'Woods, Niels-Bjarne']","['Ward SV', 'Sternsdorf T', 'Woods NB']","['Laboratory of Genetics, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. simonevward@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111111,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2011/08/19 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/08/18 06:00'],"['2011/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2011.079 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2011 Dec;22(12):1593-8. doi: 10.1089/hum.2011.079.

Our goal in this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anti-cancer activity, beginning by studying its inhibitory effects on leukemia cells and then comparing it to tamibarotene. A112 effectively inhibited the growth of HL-60 and NB4 cells as estimated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The inhibitory effect of A112 was confirmed in mice in which A112 delayed the growth of HL-60 xenografts after 3 weeks' injection. The efficacy of A112 on leukemia cell growth was stronger than that of tamibarotene at the same dosage. The detection of A112 and tamibarotene in plasma of rats showed that A112 might sustain release of its hydrolysate tamibarotene, and the concentration was maintained at a higher level and for a longer time than that of tamibarotene injection. We studied the differentiation morphologies of leukemic cells exposed to A112 or tamibarotene. The number of differentiated NB4 cells was increased, suggesting that A112 possessed differentiation activity in the inhibition of leukemia growth. Further studies showed that the expression of CD11b, a marker of terminal granulocyte differentiation, was increased as estimated by flow cytometry with a direct immunofluorescence assay. A112 was found to induce the activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21(Waf1/cip1) and p27(Kip1) while cell growth was inhibited. These activities of A112 were greater than those of tamibarotene. The higher efficacy of A112 was also evidenced by induction of apoptosis in leukemia cells. A112 induced a greater number of annexin V-positive cells than did tamibarotene as measured by flow cytometry analysis. Treatment of mice with A112 resulted in stronger terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining in HL-60 xenografts. Western blot analysis revealed that A112 increased the expression of caspase-3, caspase-9 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that induction of apoptosis was involved in the inhibition of leukemia growth.

Germ cells are important targets of many chemicals. Most of the drugs are genotoxins and induce irreversible effect on genetic makeup. These mutagenic changes are proportionally related to carcinogenesis. This is alarmingly dangerous in youth and children, since these effects last longer, affecting fertility or forming basis for carcinogenesis. There is paucity of reports on planned studies of imatinib on the testicular function. Hence, the study was planned to assess the effects of imatinib on biochemical markers of testicular functions in male Swiss albino mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Swiss albino mice were treated with imatinib and sacrificed at the end of first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth week after the last exposure to imatinib. The testis were removed, weighed, and processed for biochemical analysis. RESULTS: The intratesticular testosterone level was significantly (P<0.001) reduced in treated groups and severe effect was observed on week 4 and 5.

We investigated whether interleukin (IL)-12, an immuno-modulatory cytokine with anti-tumor activity, may target AML blasts (CD45(+)CD33(+)) and populations known to contain leukemia ICs (that is, CD34(+)CD38(-), CD33(+)CD38(+) and CD44(+)CD38(-) cells). We demonstrate for the first time that: i) AML blasts and their CD34(+)CD38(-), CD33(+)CD38(+), CD44(+)CD38(-) subsets express the heterodimeric IL-12 receptor (IL-12R), ii) AML cells injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID/Il2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice developed a localized tumor mass containing leukemic ICs and blasts that were virtually eliminated by IL-12 treatment, iii) AML cells injected intravenously into NSG mice engrafted within the first month in the spleen, but not in bone marrow or peripheral blood. At this time, IL-12 dramatically dampened AML CD45(+)CD33(+), CD34(+)CD38(-), CD33(+)CD38(+) and CD44(+)CD38(-) populations, only sparing residual CD33(+)CD38(+) cells that did not express IL-12Rbeta2. From 30 to 60 days after the initial inoculum, these IL-12-unresponsive cells expanded and metastasized in both control and IL-12-treated NSG mice.

Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has been the mainstay of first-line therapy for CML for 10 years. Although patients with CML-CP respond well to imatinib, those who have delayed reductions in leukemic burden during imatinib therapy, such as not achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 12 months, have an increased risk of disease progression. It has been recognized, with 8 years of observation, that patients who achieve an early major molecular response (MMR) on imatinib have a very low probability of disease progression. Recent randomized phase 3 trials have shown that first-line treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib-more potent BCR-ABL inhibitors-results in significantly higher rates and more rapid achievement of CCyR and MMR in comparison with standard-dose imatinib.

In this study, we demonstrate a link between survivin expression and drug resistance and test the efficacy of a novel antisense agent in promoting apoptosis when combined with chemotherapy. Gene-silencing experiments targeting survivin mRNA using either short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) or a locked antisense oligonucleotide (LNA-ON) specifically reduced gene expression and induced apoptosis in leukemia cell lines. When used in combination with chemotherapy, the survivin shRNA and LNA-ON potentiated the chemotherapeutic antileukemia effect. Moreover, in a mouse primary xenograft model of relapse ALL, the survivin LNA-ON decreased survivin expression in a subset of animals, and produced a statistically significant decrease in tumor progression.

DNA from bone marrow (BM) aspirates drawn into EDTA specimen tubes (EDTA-BM) is widely used for CA.

We compared chimerism status at the 2 time-points by fluorescence PCR on STR markers using EDTA-BM vs PS-BM. RESULTS: Eight patients were eligible for this study. The recipient DNA (%R) from EDTA-BM was 0% at pre-relapse in all except 2 with 1.6% and 1.3%, while %R using PS-BM revealed mixed chimerism in all 8, %R ranging 1.6-13.2% (median 3.75%).

In CLL, increased levels of SET correlated significantly with disease severity (shorter time to treatment and overall survival). We developed SET antagonist peptides that bound SET, increased cellular PP2A activity, decreased Mcl-1 expression, and displayed selective cytotoxicity for CLL and NHL cells in vitro.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients, including 22 patients with fludarabine-refractory disease (28.2%) and 14 patients (17.9%) with deletion of 17p, received BR chemoimmunotherapy. Bendamustine was administered at a dose of 70 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 combined with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 0 of the first course and 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 during subsequent courses for up to six courses. RESULTS: On the basis of intent-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 59.0% (95% CI, 47.3% to 70.0%). Complete response, partial response, and nodular partial response were achieved in 9.0%, 47.4%, and 2.6% of patients, respectively. Overall response rate was 45.5% in fludarabine-refractory patients and 60.5% in fludarabine-sensitive patients. Among genetic subgroups, 92.3% of patients with del(11q), 100% with trisomy 12, 7.1% with del(17p), and 58.7% with unmutated IGHV status responded to treatment. After a median follow-up time of 24 months, the median event-free survival was 14.7 months. Severe infections occurred in 12.8% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were documented in 23.1%, 28.2%, and 16.6% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chemoimmunotherapy with BR is effective and safe in patients with relapsed CLL and has notable activity in fludarabine-refractory disease. Major but tolerable toxicities were myelosuppression and infections. These promising results encouraged us to initiate a further phase II trial evaluating the BR regimen in patients with previously untreated CLL.",,"['Fischer, Kirsten', 'Cramer, Paula', 'Busch, Raymonde', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Schweighofer, Carmen D', 'Bottcher, Sebastian', 'Staib, Peter', 'Kiehl, Michael', 'Eckart, Michael J', 'Kranz, Gabriele', 'Goede, Valentin', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Eichhorst, Barbara F', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin']","['Fischer K', 'Cramer P', 'Busch R', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Bahlo J', 'Schweighofer CD', 'Bottcher S', 'Staib P', 'Kiehl M', 'Eckart MJ', 'Kranz G', 'Goede V', 'Elter T', 'Buhler A', 'Winkler D', 'Kneba M', 'Dohner H', 'Eichhorst BF', 'Hallek M', 'Wendtner CM']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Str 62, 50937 Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110815,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intention to Treat Analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2011/08/17 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/08/17 06:00'],"['2011/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.33.8061 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.33.8061 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Sep 10;29(26):3559-66. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.33.8061.

N. gonorrhoeae is able to survive the bactericidal activity of these innate immune cells and can actively modulate PMN functions in vitro. PMNs are short-lived cells which readily undergo apoptosis, and thus the effect of N. gonorrhoeae infection on PMN survival has implications for whether PMNs might serve as an important site of bacterial replication during infection. We developed and validated an HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell culture model for PMN infection and used both these cells and primary PMNs to show that N. gonorrhoeae infection alone does not induce apoptosis and furthermore that N. gonorrhoeae can inhibit both spontaneous apoptosis and apoptosis induced by the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis inducers staurosporine (STS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), respectively. N. gonorrhoeae infection also results in the activation of NF-kappaB signaling in neutrophils and induces secretion of an identical profile of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both HL-60 cells and primary PMNs. Our data show that the HL-60 cell line can be used to effectively model N. gonorrhoeae-PMN interactions and that N. gonorrhoeae actively inhibits apoptosis induced by multiple stimuli to prolong PMN survival and potentially facilitate bacterial survival, replication, and transmission.",,"['Chen, Adrienne', 'Seifert, H Steven']","['Chen A', 'Seifert HS']","['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 E.

Benzene toxicity is likely mediated through metabolites induced by means of multiple pathways. Although benzene metabolites are known to induce oxidative stress and disrupt the cell cycle, the mechanism underlying leukemogenesis is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the genome-wide expression profiles of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that had been exposed to benzene and its metabolites. This was carried out using whole human genome oligonucleotide microarrays to ascertain potential biomarkers. Genes that were differentially expressed (>1.5-fold and p-values <0.05) after exposure to benzene (BZ), hydroquinone (HQ), and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) were then classified with GO, KEGG and GSEA pathway annotation. All genes that were identified were then functionally categorized as being involved in the cell cycle, the p53 signaling pathway, apoptosis, the MAPK signaling pathway, or the T cell receptor signaling pathway. Functionally important genes were further validated by means of real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that EGR1, PMAIP1, AR, CCL2, CD69, HSPA8, SLC7A11, HERPUD1, ELK1, and MKI57 genes altered their expression profiles. Similar expression profiles were also found in human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia K562 cells and in human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U937 cells. In conclusion, gene expression profiles along with GO, KEGG and GSEA pathway annotation analysis have provided an insight into the leukemogenesis as well as highlighted potential gene-based biomarkers of human leukemia cell lines when they are exposed to benzene and its metabolites.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Also, it is claimed to be useful in treating urinary discharges, enlargement of spleen, leucorrhoea, leukoderma, tumors, liver disorders, gonorrhea, gout and promotes wound healing in Indian traditional system of medicine. AIM: To establish a scientific validation for the antitumor effects of Tecomella undulata bark and explore the mechanistic pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia cell line, K562. The study was further extended to standardize the extract using quercetin as biomarker. METHODS: Induction of apoptosis by chloroform extract of Tecomella undulata bark (CTUB) was determined by MTT, Annexin V and caspase activation assays. The cell cycle analysis was done by flow cytometer and nuclear staining by DAPI. The standardization of the extract was performed through reverse phase-HPLC method under PDA detection. RESULT: Results clearly showed the induction of apoptosis by CTUB in K562 cells. The effect was found to be dose dependent, having IC(50) of 30 mug/ml with activation of FAS, FADD, caspase 8, caspase 3/7 and fragmentation of DNA. The bioactive CTUB was determined to possess 0.03% (w/w) of quercetin.

Since this biochemical difference between normal and cancer cells represents a specific vulnerability that can be selectively targeted for cancer therapy, various ROS-generating agents are currently in clinical trials, either as single agents or in combination with standard therapy. However, little is known about the potential consequences of an increased oxidative stress for the efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic agents. In this context, we have assessed the influence of an oxidative stress generated by the combination of ascorbate and the redox-active quinone menadione on the capacity of melphalan, a common alkylating agent, to induce apoptosis in a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line. Our data show that oxidative stress did not inhibit but rather promoted cancer cell killing by melphalan. Interestingly, we observed that, in the presence of oxidative stress, the type of cell death shifted from a caspase-3 dependent apoptosis to necrosis because of an ATP depletion which prevented caspase activation. Taken together, these data suggest that ROS-generating agents could be useful in combination with standard chemotherapy, even if all the molecular consequences of such an addition remain to be determined.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Recognizing that IR involves complex interactions between innate and adaptive immune networks, we hypothesized that patterns of both monocyte and lymphocyte recovery could provide additional prognostic information. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed data from 135 consecutive patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HSCT for acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from 2001 to 2010. The absolute lymphocyte and monocyte counts (ALC and AMC, respectively) were determined longitudinally at days +15, +30, +60, and +100, and correlated with clinical outcomes. At the day +30 time point, both ALC and AMC >0.3 x 10(9) cells/L were strongly associated with improved survival (overall survival [OS] 29.6 months versus 5.4 months, P = .006 and 25.3 months versus 5.1 months, P = .01 respectively), a pattern that generally continued through the day +100 evaluation. Multivariate analysis revealed the following independent prognostic factors: early disease status at transplantation, the development of chronic GVHD, the day +30 AMC, day +100 AMC, and day +100 ALC. To further explore whether any inherent patterns in the timing of lymphocyte and monocyte recovery had prognostic value post-HSCT, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the longitudinal hematopoietic parameters studied in this cohort. Four clusters of patients were identified: clusters A-D. Patient clusters B and D both demonstrated improved ALC and AMC recovery at the day +60 and day +100 time points and had significantly improved OS compared with clusters A and C (57.8 months versus 19.7 and 4.4 months, respectively, P < .001). Our data suggest that patients with poor lymphocyte and monocyte recovery beyond the day +60 time points may be at risk for poorer outcomes, and that further investigation into lymphoid/myeloid interactions in developing individualized immunotherapy is warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: For this case-control study, cases were children younger than 15 years who were newly diagnosed with ALL between January 2000 and March 2005 at 1 of 6 Colombian hospitals. An interview with both parents of 170 children (85 cases and 85 individually matched neighborhood controls) gathered information about each child's exposures and parental demographic and occupational characteristics, medical history, health risk behaviors, and pregnancy and birth history. A job-exposure matrix was used to classify parental exposure to hydrocarbons on the basis of the main industrial activity of each workplace where parents worked before (both parents) or during the index pregnancy (mother only). Conditional odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by period of exposure (preconception, pregnancy, and childhood). RESULTS: The risk of childhood ALL was linked to 1) parental occupational exposure to hydrocarbons before conception, 2) parental smoking before conception, 3) maternal low socioeconomic status during pregnancy, and 4) higher maternal age (>/=35 y) at the child's birth. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest an association between childhood ALL and parental occupational exposure to carcinogenic and probably carcinogenic hydrocarbons before conception.

Relevant risk factors (RF) for the introduction of IBR and EBL into Swiss cattle farms were identified and their relative risks defined based on literature review and expert opinions. A quantitative model based on the scenario tree method was subsequently used to calculate the required sample size of a targeted sampling approach (TS) for a given sensitivity. We compared the sample size with that of a stratified random sample (sRS) with regard to efficiency. RESULTS: The required sample sizes to substantiate disease freedom were 1,241 farms for IBR and 1,750 farms for EBL to detect 0.2% herd prevalence with 99% sensitivity. Using conventional sRS, the required sample sizes were 2,259 farms for IBR and 2,243 for EBL. Considering the additional administrative expenses required for the planning of TS, the risk-based approach was still more cost-effective than a sRS (40% reduction on the full survey costs for IBR and 8% for EBL) due to the considerable reduction in sample size. CONCLUSIONS: As the model depends on RF selected through literature review and was parameterised with values estimated by experts, it is subject to some degree of uncertainty. Nevertheless, this approach provides the veterinary authorities with a promising tool for future cost-effective sampling designs.",,"['Blickenstorfer, Sarah', 'Schwermer, Heinzpeter', 'Engels, Monika', 'Reist, Martin', 'Doherr, Marcus G', 'Hadorn, Daniela C']","['Blickenstorfer S', 'Schwermer H', 'Engels M', 'Reist M', 'Doherr MG', 'Hadorn DC']","['Veterinary Public Health Institute, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110816,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Bovine/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis/diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', '*Models, Immunological', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",2011/08/17 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1746-6148-7-49 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-6148-7-49 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2011 Aug 16;7:49. doi: 10.1186/1746-6148-7-49.,PMC3170209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diverse DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are being studied as potential anticancer drugs, and there is interest in developing novel and more effective DNMTIs. We evaluated zebularine, a stable and low-toxic cytidine analog, effects on human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines, NB4 and KG1. Zebularine caused a dose- and time-dependent NB4 and KG1 cell growth inhibition, did not induce myeloid differentiation but triggered concentration-dependent apoptosis as manifested by procaspase-3 and PAR-1 cleavage and the occurrence of early apoptosis detected by Annexin-V-propidium iodide. Zebularine co-treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) at pharmacological dose (1 muM for NB4 cells) and higher (3 muM for KG1 cells) increased granulocytic differentiation in both cell lines. Pretreatment for 24 or 48 h with zebularine before the treatment with different doses of RA alone or RA with histone deacetylase inhibitors, phenyl butyrate, and BML-210, resulted in significant acceleration and enhancement of differentiation and cell cycle arrest at G0/1. Zebularine alone or in sequential combination with RA decreased expression of DNMT1, caused fast and time-dependent expression of pan-cadherin and partial demethylation of E-cadherin but not tumor suppressor p15. When used in combination with RA, zebularine increased expression of both genes transcript and protein. Zebularine induced regional chromatin remodeling by local histone H4 acetylation and histone H3-K4 methylation in promoter sites of methylated E-cadherin and also in the promoter of unmethylated p21 as evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

Autophagy is a catabolic cellular process that is thought to regulate chemosensitivity, however its role in pediatric tumors is unknown. Here we present studies in pediatric medulloblastoma cell lines (DAOY, ONS76) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor cell lines (BT-16, BT-12) to test this role. Autophagy was inhibited using siRNA against autophagy-related genes ATG12 and ATG7 or pharmacologically induced or inhibited using rapamycin and chloroquine to test the effect of autophagy on chemosensitivity. Autophagic flux was measured using Western blot analysis of LC3-II and p62 and cell viability was determined using MTS assays and clonogenic growth. We found that when pediatric brain tumor cells under starvation stress, exposed to known autophagy inducers such as rapamycin, or treated with current chemotherapeutics (lomustine, cisplatin), all stimulate autophagy.

In the naive state of ESCs, the genome has an unusual open conformation and possesses a minimum of repressive epigenetic marks. In contrast, EpiSCs have activated the epigenetic machinery that supports differentiation towards the embryonic cell types. The transition from naive to primed pluripotency therefore represents a pivotal event in cellular differentiation. But the signals that control this fundamental differentiation step remain unclear. We show here that paracrine and autocrine Wnt signals are essential self-renewal factors for ESCs, and are required to inhibit their differentiation into EpiSCs. Moreover, we find that Wnt proteins in combination with the cytokine LIF are sufficient to support ESC self-renewal in the absence of any undefined factors, and support the derivation of new ESC lines, including ones from non-permissive mouse strains. Our results not only demonstrate that Wnt signals regulate the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition, but also identify Wnt as an essential and limiting ESC self-renewal factor.",,"['ten Berge, Derk', 'Kurek, Dorota', 'Blauwkamp, Tim', 'Koole, Wouter', 'Maas, Alex', 'Eroglu, Elif', 'Siu, Ronald K', 'Nusse, Roel']","['ten Berge D', 'Kurek D', 'Blauwkamp T', 'Koole W', 'Maas A', 'Eroglu E', 'Siu RK', 'Nusse R']","['Erasmus MC Stem Cell Institute, Department of Cell Biology, Erasmus Medical Center, P.O.

ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can then initiate apoptosis, when the cell fails to restore ER homeostasis. However, the mechanism employed by the UPR to lead cells into apoptosis is unknown. Among the three proximal sensors of ER stress, activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) is specifically activated in apoptotic myoblasts during myoblast differentiation. This implies that active ATF6 has the ability to mediate apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of active ATF6 induced apoptosis in myoblast cells. Moreover, coexpression of a dominant negative form of ATF6 suppressed apoptosis. This suggested that apoptosis-related pathways depended on ATF6-mediated transcription activation. ATF6 caused up-regulation of the WBP1 (WW domain binding protein 1), probably via an indirect mechanism. Furthermore, WBP1 was also found to be proapoptotic. The silencing of WBP1 with small hairpin RNAs caused partial, but significant suppression of ATF6-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of active ATF6 or WBP1 caused a specific reduction in an anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1). This suggested a molecular link between the UPR and an apoptosis regulator. Neither Bcl-2 nor Bcl-x(L) were reduced upon apoptosis induction in C2C12 cells that overexpressed ATF6 or WBP1. Cells treated with ER stressors underwent apoptosis concomitant with an up-regulation of WBP1 and suppression of Mcl-1. These results suggested that Mcl-1 is a determinant of cell fate, and ATF6 mediates apoptosis via specific suppression of Mcl-1 through up-regulation of WBP1.",,"['Morishima, Nobuhiro', 'Nakanishi, Keiko', 'Nakano, Akihiko']","['Morishima N', 'Nakanishi K', 'Nakano A']","['Molecular Membrane Biology Laboratory, RIKEN Advanced Science Institute, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. morishim@riken.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110813,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (WBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Wbp1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 6/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",2011/08/16 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/08/16 06:00'],"['2011/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)73903-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.233502 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Oct 7;286(40):35227-35. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.233502.

However, the consequences of this interaction for CD4(+) T cells are not entirely known. B cells generally promote CD4(+) T cell responses to pathogens, albeit to a variable degree. In contrast, CD4(+) T cell responses to self- or tumor Ags are often suppressed by B cells. In this study, we demonstrated that interaction with B cells dramatically inhibited the function of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells in retroviral infection. We have used Friend virus infection of mice as a model for retroviral infection, in which the behavior of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells was monitored according to their TCR avidity. We report that avidity for Ag and interaction with B cells determine distinct aspects of the primary CD4(+) T cell response to Friend virus infection. Virus-specific CD4(+) T cells followed exclusive Th1 and T follicular helper (Tfh) differentiation. High avidity for Ag facilitated expansion during priming and enhanced the capacity for IFN-gamma and IL-21 production. In contrast, Tfh differentiation was not affected by avidity for Ag. By reducing or preventing B cell interaction, we found that B cells promoted Tfh differentiation, induced programmed death 1 expression, and inhibited IFN-gamma production by virus-specific CD4(+) T cells. Ultimately, B cells protected hosts from CD4(+) T cell-mediated immune pathology, at the detriment of CD4(+) T cell-mediated protective immunity. Our results suggest that B cell presentation of vaccine Ags could be manipulated to direct the appropriate CD4(+) T cell response.",,"['Ploquin, Mickael J-Y', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Ploquin MJ', 'Eksmond U', 'Kassiotis G']","['Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110812,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/08/16 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/08/16 06:00'],"['2011/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1101006 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1101006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Sep 15;187(6):3321-30. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1101006.

This reaction occurs via an endocytic process called shaving/trogocytosis, mediated by FcgammaR on acceptor cells including monocytes/macrophages, which remove and internalize rituximab-CD20 immune complexes from B cells. Beers et al. reported that CD20 mAb-induced antigenic modulation occurs as a result of internalization of B cell-bound mAb-CD20 complexes by the B cells themselves, with internalization of approximately 40% observed after 2 h at 37 degrees C. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the relative importance of shaving versus internalization in promoting CD20 loss and have substantial implications for the design of mAb-based cancer therapies. Therefore, we performed direct comparisons, based on flow cytometry, to determine the relative rates and extent of shaving versus internalization. B cells, from cell lines, from patients with CLL, and from normal donors, were opsonized with CD20 mAbs rituximab or ofatumumab and incubated for varying times and then reacted with acceptor THP-1 monocytes to promote shaving. We find that shaving induces considerably greater loss of CD20 and bound mAb from opsonized B cells in much shorter time periods (75-90% in <45 min) than is observed for internalization. Both shaving/trogocytosis and internalization could contribute to CD20 loss when CLL patients receive rituximab therapy, but shaving should occur more rapidly and is most likely to be the key mechanism of CD20 loss.",,"['Beum, Paul V', 'Peek, Elizabeth M', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Beurskens, Frank J', 'Engelberts, Patrick J', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Beum PV', 'Peek EM', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Beurskens FJ', 'Engelberts PJ', 'Parren PW', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110812,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Endocytosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Transfection']",2011/08/16 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/08/16 06:00'],"['2011/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1101189 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1101189 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Sep 15;187(6):3438-47. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1101189.

However, its role in the development of colorectal cancer is not well defined. To rigorously test the impact of this phosphorylation on colorectal tumorigenesis, we engineered a STAT3 Y705F knock-in to interrupt STAT3 activity in HCT116 and RKO colorectal cancer cells. These STAT3 Y705F mutant cells fail to respond to cytokine stimulation and grow slower than parental cells. These mutant cells are also greatly diminished in their abilities to form colonies in culture, to exhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and to grow as xenografts in nude mice. These observations strongly support the premise that STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation is crucial in colorectal tumorigenesis. Although it is generally believed that STAT3 functions as a transcription factor, recent studies indicate that transcription-independent functions of STAT3 also play an important role in tumorigenesis. We show here that wild-type STAT3, but not STAT3 Y705F mutant protein, associates with phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1). PLCgamma1 is a central signal transducer of growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis. In STAT3 Y705F mutant colorectal cancer cells, PLCgamma1 activity is reduced. Moreover, overexpression of a constitutively active form of PLCgamma1 rescues the transformation defect of STAT3 Y705F mutant cells. In aggregate, our study identifies previously unknown cross-talk between STAT3 and the PLCgamma signaling pathways that may play a critical role in colorectal tumorigenesis.",,"['Zhang, Peng', 'Zhao, Yiqing', 'Zhu, Xiaofeng', 'Sedwick, David', 'Zhang, Xiaodong', 'Wang, Zhenghe']","['Zhang P', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhu X', 'Sedwick D', 'Zhang X', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-7285, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110812,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/08/16 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/08/16 06:00'],"['2011/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-11-0147 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0147 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Oct;9(10):1418-28. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0147.

This new sensor employs a hairpin locked nucleic acids (LNAs) probe dually labeled with biotin and carboxyfluorescein molecule (FAM). The probe is immobilized at a streptavidin-modified electrode surface via the biotin-streptavidin bridge, and FAM serves as an affinity tag for the peroxidase conjugate binding. Initially, the immobilized hairpin probe was in the ""closed"" state in the absence of the target, which shielded FAM from being approached by the bulky anti-FAM-HRP conjugate due to the steric effect. Target binding opens the hairpin structure of the probe, the probe undergoes a significant conformational change, forcing FAM away from the electrode. As a result, the FAM label becomes accessible by the anti-FAM-HRP, and the target hybridization event can be sensitively transduced via the enzymatically amplified electrochemical current signal. This new biosensor demonstrates its excellent specificity for single-base mismatch and able to detect as little as 83 fM target DNA even in the presence of human serum.

Results have been remarkably consistent, but there is still no explanation for this increase. In this study we evaluated the effect of 60 Hz magnetic fields on acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: This case-control study included ALL cases (n=162) recruited from eight hospitals between January 2003 and February 2009. Controls (n=565) matched on gender, age, and city of birth were selected from the Sao Paulo Birth Registry. Exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MF) was based on measurements inside home and distance to power lines. RESULTS: For 24h measurements in children rooms, levels of ELF MF equal to or greater than 0.3microtesla (muT), compared to children exposed to levels below 0.1 muT showed no increased risk of ALL (odds ratio [OR] 1.09; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.33-3.61). When only nighttime measurements were considered, a risk (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.46-5.01) was observed. Children living within 200 m of power lines presented an increased risk of ALL (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.49-5.75), compared to children living at 600 m or more of power lines. For those living within 50 m of power lines the OR was 3.57 (95% CI 0.41-31.44). CONCLUSIONS: Even though our results are consistent with the small risks reported in other studies on ELF MF and leukemia in children, overall our results do not provide support for an association between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia, but small numbers and likely biases weaken the strength of this conclusion.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Data were collected on all patients in major cities of Fars province who were diagnosed with cancer between 1998 and 2002. The data were computerized using SPSS (Chicago, IL) software, version 13.0, and MS EXCEL (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) software with Persian fonts. The results are presented as incidence rates of cases by site, sex, age, crude rates, and age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years (ASRs), using the direct method of standardization to the world population. RESULTS: During the 5-year study period, 8359 new cancer cases were registered. Diagnosis of cancer was based on histopathological criteria in 86.7%, clinical or radiological criteria in 9.4% and death certificate only in 3.9% of cases. According to the calculated ASRs, the 5 most frequent cancers in women were breast (13 per 100,000), stomach (4.4 per 100,000), lung and bronchus (2.9 per 100,000), uterus (2.7 per 100,000), and colon and rectum (2.6 per 100,000); and in men, the 5 most frequent types were stomach (9.2 per 100,000), bladder (6.8 per 100,000), lung and bronchus (6.3 per 100,000), lymphocytic leukemia (4.1 per 100,000), and skin melanoma (3.8 per 100,000). The ASR for all cancers in men was 64.5 per 100,000, and that for women was 55.5 per 100,000. CONCLUSION: Considering the limitations of this study, our results should be taken as the minimum incidence rates of cancers in Fars province, southern Iran.

Instead, surrogates that may be measured by flow cytometry have been sought. Measurements of the expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 have been the most popular assays for prognosis although both are in their own ways unsatisfactory. Many other candidates have emerged, but none has been universally endorsed. As the assay for IGHV mutations has been standardized the level of difficulty has diminished and as greater numbers of cases have been assessed it has become clear that there is even more information to be gathered from the study of the sequence of IGHV genes. It has been recognized that stereotypy within CLL is associated with more specific clinical features than mere longevity and an even greater heterogeneity has been revealed. It seems clear that the search for surrogacy is futile and that IGHV mutational status should become a routine investigation in CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of HHV-8 DNA and antibody response in allografted stem cell transplant (SCT) patients without Kaposis's Sarcoma. OBJECTIVES: To report the natural history of a HHV-8 seropositive patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed an active HHV-8 infection after SCT. STUDY DESIGN: HHV-8 antibodies were measured by IFA and ELISA assays. HHV-8 DNA was detected by real-time PCR quantitative assay in serum and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). RESULTS: Twenty-two out of 26 (85%) serum samples had detectable HHV-8 antibodies: 21/26 (80%) samples were positive by both IFA and ELISA assays, while 1 sample was ELISA positive-IFA negative. The remaining 4 samples (15%) were negative by both assays. Five out of 6 (83%) serum-PBL samples pairs had detectable HHV-8 DNA: a median of 934 genomes/ml (range 254-6316 genomes/ml) in the serum and a median of 10,000 genomes/10(5) (range 1472-93,460 gen/10(5)) in PBL. An active HHV-8 infection occurred early within the first 30 days after the transplant, extended up to day +180 and occurred without evidence of HHV-8-related neoplastic or non neoplastic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that a patient infected with HHV-8 before SCT can be either intermittently HHV-8 DNA-positive and/or seropositive for HHV-8 after SCT. A high and persistent HHV-8 replication may be ongoing even in the absence of overt HHV-8-associated diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An example of this may be the increased susceptibility of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers to the carcinogen formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is now a proven cause of human myeloid leukemias. Yet millions of tons of formaldehyde are produced every year and it is everywhere. High formaldehyde levels can overwhelm normal enzyme detoxification systems and cause DNA damage. It is known that some types of formaldehyde-associated DNA damage require error-free DNA repairs mediated by pathways containing BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins. Otherwise some formaldehyde-related DNA damage cannot be properly repaired so mutations may occur. Therefore, carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene defects should be unduly susceptible to myeloid leukemia. Studies show that inherited biallelic BRCA2 gene defects dramatically increase risks for myeloid leukemia. Heterozygous BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations also increase risks for myeloid leukemias in 11 of 12 relevant studies. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers may reduce risks for myeloid leukemias by using available precautions to lower their exposure to formaldehyde.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although CTLs bearing stably expressed CARs generated by integrating viral vectors are efficacious and have potential long-term persistence, this mechanism of CAR expression can potentially result in significant toxicity. T cells were electroporated with an optimized in vitro transcribed RNA encoding a CAR against CD19. These RNA CAR CTLs were then tested in vitro and in vivo for efficacy. We found that T cells expressing an anti-CD19 CAR introduced by electroporation with optimized mRNA were potent and specific killers of CD19 target cells. CD19 RNA CAR T cells given to immunodeficient mice bearing xenografted leukemia rapidly migrated to sites of disease and retained significant target-specific lytic activity. Unexpectedly, a single injection of CD19 RNA CAR T cells reduced disease burden within 1 day after administration, resulting in a significant prolongation of survival in an aggressive leukemia xenograft model. The surface expression of the RNA CARs may be titrated, giving T cells with potentially tunable levels of effector functions such as cytokine release and cytotoxicity.

This study aimed to describe serious medical complications (SMC) in children with FN regarding incidence, clinical spectrum, and associated characteristics. PROCEDURE: Pediatric patients presenting with FN induced by non-myeloablative chemotherapy were observed in a prospective multicenter study. SMC was defined as potentially life-threatening complication (PLTC), transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), or death. RESULTS: A total of 443 FN episodes were reported from 8 centers. Of these, 411 episodes were reported from 4 centers recruiting consecutively and without bias regarding the risk of complications. They were used for calculation of proportions. An SMC was reported in 23 episodes [5.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7-8.1], usually defined by more than one criterion. These were PLTC in 13 episodes, PICU in 22, and death in 3 (mortality, 0.7%; 95% CI: 0.2-2.1). Both a delayed onset of SMC (14 of 23 episodes, 61%) and a biphasic clinical course (11 of 23, 48%) were frequently observed. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, 4 characteristics were significantly and independently associated with the risk of SMC: diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, interval since chemotherapy </=7 days, severely reduced general condition, and hemoglobin >/=9.0 g/dl at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: In children with FN, SMC were rare, and mortality was very low. Those with SMC often had a delayed onset and biphasic clinical course with secondary deterioration.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Luthi, Fabienne', 'Leibundgut, Kurt', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Nadal, David', 'Aebi, Christoph', 'Bodmer, Nicole', 'Ammann, Roland A']","['Luthi F', 'Leibundgut K', 'Niggli FK', 'Nadal D', 'Aebi C', 'Bodmer N', 'Ammann RA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110811,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Fever/chemically induced/mortality', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', '*Neutropenia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Switzerland']",2011/08/13 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/08/13 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23277 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;59(1):90-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23277.

This paper provides evidence that cation exchange chromatography (CEX), a widely used polishing step for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, can effectively and reproducibly remove xMuLV, a retrovirus used as a model of non-infectious retrovirus-like particles found in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The dominant mechanism for xMuLV clearance by the strong cation exchanger, Fractogel SO (3)(-), is by retention of the virus via adsorption instead of inactivation. Experimental data defining the design space for effective xMuLV removal by Fractogel SO (3)(-) with respect to operational pH, elution ionic strength, loading, and load/equilibration buffer ionic strength are provided. Additionally, xMuLV is able to bind to other CEX resins, such as Fractogel COO(-) and SP Sepharose Fast Flow, suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to one type of CEX resin. Taken together, the data indicate that CEX chromatography can be a robust and reproducible removal step for the model retrovirus xMuLV.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Connell-Crowley, Lisa', 'Nguyen, Thao', 'Bach, Julia', 'Chinniah, Shivanthi', 'Bashiri, Houman', 'Gillespie, Ron', 'Moscariello, John', 'Hinckley, Peter', 'Dehghani, Houman', 'Vunnum, Suresh', 'Vedantham, Ganesh']","['Connell-Crowley L', 'Nguyen T', 'Bach J', 'Chinniah S', 'Bashiri H', 'Gillespie R', 'Moscariello J', 'Hinckley P', 'Dehghani H', 'Vunnum S', 'Vedantham G']","['Purification Process Development, Amgen Inc., 1201 Amgen Court West, Seattle, Washington 98119, USA. connelll@amgen.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20110823,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Buffers)']",IM,"['*Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*isolation & purification', 'Biotechnology/*methods', 'Buffers', 'CHO Cells', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange/*methods', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*isolation & purification', 'Osmolar Concentration', '*Virus Attachment']",2011/08/13 06:00,2012/03/08 06:00,['2011/08/13 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.23300 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2012 Jan;109(1):157-65. doi: 10.1002/bit.23300.

Adoptive T cell therapy with genetically engineered specificity is thought to fulfil expectations, and clinical trials for the treatment of CLL are initiated. Cytolytic T cells from patients are redirected towards CLL cells by ex vivo engineering with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which binds to CD19 on CLL cells through an antibody-derived domain and triggers T cell activation through CD3zeta upon tumor cell engagement. Redirected T cells thereby target CLL cells in an MHC-unrestricted fashion, secret proinflammatory cytokines, and eliminate CD19(+) leukaemia cells with high efficiency. Cytolysis of autologous CLL cells by patient's engineered T cells is effective, however, accompanied by lasting elimination of healthy CD19(+) B-cells.

Neural and hematopoietic stem cell niches, in particular, are characterized by restricted availability of oxygen and the resulting regulation by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor and also contains high degrees of hypoxia. Heterogeneity within the neoplastic compartment has been well characterized in GBM and may be derived from genetic and epigenetic sources that co-evolve during malignant progression. Recent experimental evidence has supported the importance of hypoxia in glioma stem cell (GSC) niches. We hypothesized that HIFs require epigenetic-modifying proteins to promote tumor malignancy in GBM. Here we demonstrate that in GBM the histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) is induced by hypoxia and enhances hypoxic responses. Loss of MLL1 reduces the expression of HIF transcripts and HIF2alpha protein. Targeting MLL1 by RNA interference inhibited the expression of HIF2alpha and target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). GSCs expressed higher levels of MLL1 than matched non-stem tumor cells and depletion of MLL1 reduced GSC self-renewal, growth, and tumorigenicity.

The basis for these contrasting cell fates, and for selective CpG hypomethylation by decitabine, is poorly understood. Promoter CpGs, with methylation measured by microarray, were classified by the direction of methylation change with normal myeloid maturation. In AML cells, the methylation pattern at maturation-responsive CpGs suggested at least partial maturation. Consistent with partial maturation, in gene expression analyses, AML cells expressed high levels of the key lineage-specifying factor CEBPA, but relatively low levels of the key late-differentiation driver CEBPE. In methylation analysis by mass spectrometry, CEBPE promoter CpGs that are usually hypomethylated during granulocyte maturation were significantly hypermethylated in AML cells. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation was greatest at these and other promoter CpGs that are usually hypomethylated with myeloid maturation, accompanied by cellular differentiation of AML cells. In contrast, decitabine-treated normal HSCs retained immature morphology, and methylation significantly decreased at CpGs that are less methylated in immature cells. High expression of lineage-specifying factor and aberrant epigenetic repression of some key late-differentiation driver genes distinguishes AML cells from normal HSCs, and could explain the contrasting differentiation and methylation responses to decitabine.",,"['Negrotto, S', 'Ng, K P', 'Jankowska, A M', 'Bodo, J', 'Gopalan, B', 'Guinta, K', 'Mulloy, J C', 'Hsi, E', 'Maciejewski, J', 'Saunthararajah, Y']","['Negrotto S', 'Ng KP', 'Jankowska AM', 'Bodo J', 'Gopalan B', 'Guinta K', 'Mulloy JC', 'Hsi E', 'Maciejewski J', 'Saunthararajah Y']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. saunthy@ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20110812,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Lineage', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Decitabine', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2011/08/13 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/08/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011207 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.207 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Feb;26(2):244-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.207.

Although several reports have suggested roles for RUNX1 as a tumor suppressor, its precise function remains unknown. Because gene alterations of RUNX1 by themselves do not lead to the development of leukemia in mouse models, additional mutation(s) would be required for leukemia development. Here, we report that the C-terminal deletion mutant of RUNX1, RUNX1dC, attenuates DNA-damage repair responses in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. gammaH2AX foci, which indicate the presence of DNA double-strand breaks, were more abundantly accumulated in RUNX1dC-transduced lineage(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) (LSK) cells than in mock-transduced LSK cells both in a steady state and after gamma-ray treatment. Expression profiling by real-time -PCR array revealed RUNX1dC represses the expression of Gadd45a, a sensor of DNA stress. Furthermore, bone marrow cells from MDS/AML patients harboring the RUNX1-C-terminal mutation showed significantly lower levels of GADD45A expression compared with those from MDS/AML patients with wild-type RUNX1. As for this mechanism, we found that RUNX1 directly regulates the transcription of GADD45A and that RUNX1 and p53 synergistically activate the GADD45A transcription. Together, these results suggest Gadd45a dysfunction due to RUNX1 mutations can cause additional mutation(s) required for multi-step leukemogenesis.",,"['Satoh, Y', 'Matsumura, I', 'Tanaka, H', 'Harada, H', 'Harada, Y', 'Matsui, K', 'Shibata, M', 'Mizuki, M', 'Kanakura, Y']","['Satoh Y', 'Matsumura I', 'Tanaka H', 'Harada H', 'Harada Y', 'Matsui K', 'Shibata M', 'Mizuki M', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan. ysatoh@bldon.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110812,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Gadd45a protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2011/08/13 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/08/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011202 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.202 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Feb;26(2):303-11. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.202.

Our previous study showed that the differentiation and apoptosis of Kasumi-1 induced by sodium phenylbutyrate (PB), were accompanied by significant upregulation of PIG7 and AML1b (one of the AML1 isoforms). Here, we further investigated the relationship between AML1b and PIG7, also the effects of PIG7 on leukemia cells. The results demonstrated that exogenous AML1b could upregulate PIG7 expression in HEK-293 and CV-1 cells in sequence-specific and dosage-dependent manners, and this effect was antagonized by AML1-ETO. The specific AML1-binding site required for p53-induced gene 7 (PIG7) transactivation was located between nucleotides -1511 and -1503 in the PIG7 promoter. Overexpression of PIG7 could induce the apoptosis and differentiation of Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells, but showed less effect on NB4 cells directly. Moreover, ectopic expression of PIG7 could sensitize these cell lines to PB or all-trans retinoic acid, respectively, which could then be abrogated by downregulation of PIG7 expression. Furthermore, the primary acute myeloid leukemia cells showed similar response to the ectopic expression of PIG7. In conclusion, PIG7 could be transactivated by AML1, which subsequently induces differentiation and apoptosis of leukemia cells, especially those with AML1-ETO fusion gene.",,"['Liu, J', 'Xing, H', 'Chen, Y', 'Wang, L', 'Wang, D', 'Rao, Q', 'Tang, K', 'Tian, Z', 'He, K', 'Wang, M', 'Wang, J']","['Liu J', 'Xing H', 'Chen Y', 'Wang L', 'Wang D', 'Rao Q', 'Tang K', 'Tian Z', 'He K', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110812,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (LITAF protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology']",2011/08/13 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/08/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011178 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.178 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):117-26. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.178.

Here, we report 2 apparently immunocompetent human T-lymphotrophic virus 1-negative patients with nodal and extranodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified with a T reg immunophenotype, based on the strong CD25 and FOXP3 positivity of the neoplastic cells. One patient was a 48-year-old woman with an early stage tumor in the cavum, who despite of chemotherapy subsequently developed systemic disease and died of tumor progression 46 months from diagnosis. The second patient was a 65-year-old male with generalized adenopathy and B symptoms who received chemotherapy achieving a complete remission but had recurrence and died 36 months from diagnosis. The histopathology revealed a diffuse infiltrate with an interfollicular distribution in the second case, with nodal involvement, consisted of large cells with clear cytoplasm associated with vascular proliferation and abundant mitoses. Neoplastic cells of first case showed typical T reg phenotype, whereas the second case had a CD4/CD8 double negative T reg variant. Only a single similar case was found in a review of the literature.

Normal rabbit IgG used as the control did not disturb embryo implantation. Anti-LIF antibody was localized not only in the stroma, but also in the luminal epithelium and the glandular lumen after i.p. injections. Growth-arrested blastocysts were recovered from the uterus without any implantation sites in both strains. Blastocysts made contact with the LE on the antimesometrial side; however, uterine stromal cells did not undergo secondary decidual reaction, and the uterine lumen was open, even at D7. Several regions of decidualization in ICR mice treated with anti-LIF antibody were smaller than those of the control, and development of blastocysts was delayed. The expression of LIF-regulated genes, such as immune-responsive gene-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, was significantly decreased in C57BL/6J mice treated with anti-LIF antibody compared with the control, but not in ICR mice.

Its impact on brain injury and blood-brain barrier permeability, so far, has not been assessed in animal models of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Wild-type and apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice, fed with normal or cholesterol-rich high-fat food, were subjected to 30 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Ischemic injury, brain edema, IgG extravasation, lipid peroxidation, calpain-1/2, matrix metalloproteinase-2/9, and RhoA activation, and occludin expression were evaluated 24 hours after reperfusion. RESULTS: Cholesterol-rich food, but not apolipoprotein E deficiency, increased IgG extravasation and brain edema without influencing infarct area and the density of DNA fragmented cells. Increased lipid peroxidation and low-density lipoprotein oxidation were noticed in the brain of hyperlipidemic mice and were associated with increased activation of calpain-1/2 and matrix metalloproteinase-2/9, overactivation of RhoA and its guanine exchange factor leukemia-associated guanine exchange factor , and downregulation of the tight junction protein occludin in cerebral microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: That postischemic blood-brain barrier permeability and brain edema are increased during hyperlipidemia points toward the importance of the recognition and adequate treatment of this highly prevalent condition.

Of interest, all sensitive cell lines harbored a t(11;14). We demonstrated that ABT-737-sensitive and ABT-737-resistant cell lines could be differentiated by the BCL2/MCL1 expression ratio. A screen of a public expression database of myeloma patients indicates that the BCL2/MCL1 ratio of t(11;14) and hyperdiploid patients was significantly higher than in all other groups (P < .001). ABT-737 first induced the disruption of Bcl-2/Bax, Bcl-2/Bik, or Bcl-2/Puma complexes, followed by the disruption of Bcl-2 heterodimers with Bak and Bim. Altogether, the identification of a subset of cell lines and primary cells effectively killed by ABT-737 alone supported the evaluation of ABT-263, an orally active counterpart to ABT-737, for the treatment of t(11;14) and hyperdiploid groups of myeloma harboring a Bcl-2(high)/Mcl-1(low) profile.",,"['Bodet, Linda', 'Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Touzeau, Cyrille', 'Dousset, Christelle', 'Descamps, Geraldine', 'Maiga, Sophie', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Le Gouill, Steven', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, Catherine', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Bodet L', 'Gomez-Bougie P', 'Touzeau C', 'Dousset C', 'Descamps G', 'Maiga S', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Bataille R', 'Moreau P', 'Le Gouill S', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Amiot M']","[""Inserm, Unite Mixte de Recherche_S892, Institut de Recherche Therapeutique de l'Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110811,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/08/13 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38514-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-11-317438 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Oct 6;118(14):3901-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-11-317438.

Such increase was much less or not observable in East Germany between 1960 and 1989 where diagnostic exposures were applied to a lesser extent. Low-level radiation can cause these diseases and the difference of cancer rates gives rise to renewed evaluation of current risk estimates. Risk factors for radiation-induced childhood leukaemia and breast cancer are derived from the literature, considering a higher relative biological effectiveness of diagnostic X rays in comparison to the A-bomb gamma rays in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The prostate is not considered as radiation sensitive by the ICRP. But following a variety of low-level findings in the last two decades it was shown by Myles et al. in the UK that prostatic cancer is inducible by diagnostic X-ray procedures. From their study in men below the age of 60, a doubling dose of about 20 mSv can be estimated. Medical exposures of the considered tissues are taken from published data for East and West Germany. The difference in breast cancer mortality can be explained by diagnostic exposures. The contribution of these to prostatic cancer and childhood leukaemia must be regarded as relevant in current incidences.

Through the inducible LIF receptor expression, LIF inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells in EAE mice and that from MS subjects. At the molecular level, LIF exerted an opposing effect on interleukin 6 (IL-6)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation required for Th17 cell differentiation by triggering a signaling cascade that activated extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinase (ERK) and upregulated suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to enhance BPDC diagnosis and indications for prognosis. METHODS: This study involved 26 patients with BPDC. To investigate the histogenesis of BPDC, we reviewed the clinical features and stained markers of various hematopoietic lineages, chemokines, and their receptors. RESULTS: Bone-marrow infiltration was detected in 13 of the 19 cases examined and leukemic changes in 18. Complete remission was achieved in 14 cases, but more than half of the patients showed recurrence within a short time, and 14 patients died of the disease after 1 to 25 months (mean 8.5 months). Positivity for CD123 was detected in 18 of 24 cases and for T-cell leukemia 1 in 18 of 22 cases. Of the chemokines and their receptors, 8 of 15 skin biopsy specimens proved to be positive for CXCL12. Leukemic change subsequent to skin lesions occurred in 7 of 8 CXCL12-positive cases (87.5%) and in 3 of 6 CXCL12-negative cases (50%). Seven of the 8 CXCL12-positive patients (87.5%) and two of the 6 CXCL12-negative patients (33.3%) have died, whereas one of 8 CXCL12-positive patients (12.5%) and 4 of 6 CXCL12-negative patients (66.7%) remain alive. LIMITATIONS: The number of patients was limited. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that the presence of CXCL12-positive cells in the skin may be associated with leukemic change and a poor prognosis.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by LV myocardial trabeculations and intertrabecular recesses that communicate with the LV cavity. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with evidence of severely depressed LV systolic and diastolic function. The LV may be dilated or hypertrophied, and clinical expression may be undulating. Several genetic causes of LVNC have been reported, with variable modes of inheritance, including autosomal dominant and X-linked inheritance, but relatively few responsible genes have been identified. A 12-year-old boy with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, dysmorphic features, and LVNC with preserved LV systolic function was referred to the Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic at our institution. The patient was asymptomatic in terms of cardiovascular function. Chromosome microarray testing revealed an interstitial deletion in the region of 8p23.1 containing GATA4. LVNC has not been reported previously in association with this chromosome deletion. Further investigation into the role of GATA4 in patients with LVNC is warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Blinder, Joshua J', 'Martinez, Hugo R', 'Craigen, William J', 'Belmont, John', 'Pignatelli, Ricardo H', 'Jefferies, John L']","['Blinder JJ', 'Martinez HR', 'Craigen WJ', 'Belmont J', 'Pignatelli RH', 'Jefferies JL']","[""The Section of Pediatric Cardiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20110810,United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

OBJECTIVES: To provide an evidence-based answer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP compared to chemotherapy including ABVD. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched for randomised controlled trials in MEDLINE, CENTRAL and conference proceedings (January 1985 to November 2010) and EMBASE (1985 to November 2008). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials examining chemotherapy including at least two cycles of escalated BEACOPP regimens compared to chemotherapy including at least four cycles of ABVD regimens as first-line treatment for patients with early unfavourable stage or advanced stage HL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Effect measures used were hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and freedom from first progression. Relative risks were used to analyse complete response rate, treatment-related mortality and adverse events. Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed quality of trials. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 790 records were screened. Five eligible trials (four published, one ongoing), were identified. These trials included only adult patients (16 to 60 years of age). Four trials with 2868 patients were included in the meta-analyses: the HD9 and HD14 trials from Germany, the HD2000 and GSM-HD trials from Italy. All trials reported results for PFS and OS. PFS was statistically significantly longer for escalated BEACOPP: HR was 0.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.64, I(2) = 0%). There was no statistically significant difference in OS between the comparators: HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.09, I(2) = 0%). Three trials reported adverse events: the escalated BEACOPP regimens caused statistically significantly more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV (anaemia P < 0.00001, neutropenia P = 0.007, thrombocytopenia P < 0.00001), infections (P < 0.00001)) and occurrence of myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (P = 0.05). There were no differences between both regimens for secondary malignancies, treatment-related mortality or infertility. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that adult patients between 16 and 60 years of age with early unfavourable or advanced stage HL benefited from chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP regarding PFS, but there was no significant difference in OS. Longer follow-up and the inclusion of the EORTC 20012 trial will lead to a more definitive answer with respect to OS.",,"['Bauer, Kathrin', 'Skoetz, Nicole', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Engert, Andreas', 'Brillant, Corinne']","['Bauer K', 'Skoetz N', 'Monsef I', 'Engert A', 'Brillant C']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50924.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20110810,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'BEACOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2011/08/13 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/08/12 06:00'],"['2011/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011 Aug 10;(8):CD007941. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 May 25;5:CD007941.

Pro-apoptotic ceramide mediates imatinib-induced apoptosis, and metabolism of ceramide by glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) activity, converting ceramide to glucosyl ceramide, might contribute to imatinib resistance. In this study, we investigated the role of ceramide metabolism by GCS in the regulation of imatinib-induced apoptosis in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant K562 and K562/IMA-0.2 and K562/IMA-1 human CML cells, which exhibit about 2.3- and 19-fold imatinib resistance, respectively. METHODS: Cytotoxic effects of PDMP and imatinib were determined by XTT cell proliferation assay. Expression levels of GCS were determined by RT-PCR and western blot. Intracellular ceramide levels were determined by LC-MS. Cell viability analyses was conducted by Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We first showed that mRNA and protein levels of GCS are increased in drug-resistant K562/IMA as compared to sensitive K562 cells. Next, forced expression of GCS in sensitive K562 cells conferred resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis. In reciprocal experiments, targeting GCS using its known inhibitor, PDMP, enhanced ceramide accumulation and increased cell death in response to imatinib in K562/IMA cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the involvement of GCS in resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis, and that targeting GCS by PDMP increased imatinib-induced cell death in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant K562 cells via enhancing ceramide accumulation.",,"['Baran, Yusuf', 'Bielawski, Jacek', 'Gunduz, Ufuk', 'Ogretmen, Besim']","['Baran Y', 'Bielawski J', 'Gunduz U', 'Ogretmen B']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir Institute of Technology, Faculty of Science, Gulbahce Campus, 35430, Urla, Izmir, Turkey. yusufbaran@iyte.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110811,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '73257-80-4 (RV 538)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2011/08/13 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/08/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-011-1016-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2011 Oct;137(10):1535-44. doi: 10.1007/s00432-011-1016-y.

Un-transfected cells (K562) and cells transfected with the empty vector (referred to as KC) were used as controls. Cell growth curve and (3)H-TdR test showed that the growth rate and DNA synthesis of KAT decreased compared with those of K562 and KC cells. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in KAT cells under normal culture condition were similar to those of K562 and KC cells, but changed after serum deprivation. KAT cells had significantly different biophysical characteristics from K562 and KC in terms of cell electrophoresis, membrane fluidity, membrane fluidity, and viscoelasticity. Furthermore, the transendothelial migration rate of KAT was much lower than those of K562 and KC cells. Confocal microscopy showed that KAT cells had higher F-actin content, suggesting the reorganization of cytoskeleton. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a lowered intracellular calcium concentration and CD71 expression, explaining the high F-actin content in KAT cells.

We report that CAR T cells that target CD19 and contain a costimulatory domain from CD137 and the T cell receptor zeta chain have potent non-cross-resistant clinical activity after infusion in three of three patients treated with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The engineered T cells expanded >1000-fold in vivo, trafficked to bone marrow, and continued to express functional CARs at high levels for at least 6 months. Evidence for on-target toxicity included B cell aplasia as well as decreased numbers of plasma cells and hypogammaglobulinemia. On average, each infused CAR-expressing T cell was calculated to eradicate at least 1000 CLL cells. Furthermore, a CD19-specific immune response was demonstrated in the blood and bone marrow, accompanied by complete remission, in two of three patients.

Ell2, the eleven-nineteen lysine rich leukemia gene, is a transcription elongation factor that is induced approximately 6-fold in plasma cells and has been shown to drive secretory-specific mRNA production. Reducing ELL2 by siRNA, which reduced processing to the secretion-specific poly(A) site, also influenced the methylations of histone H3K4 and H3K79 on the IgH gene and impacted positive transcription factor b (pTEFb), Ser-2 carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation, and polyadenylation factor additions to RNA polymerase II. The multiple lineage leukemia gene (MLL) and Dot1L associations with the IgH gene were also impaired in the absence of ELL2. To investigate the link between histone modifications, transcription elongation, and alternative RNA processing in IgH mRNA production, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation on cultured mouse B and plasma cells bearing the identical IgH gamma2a gene. In the plasma cells, as compared with the B cells, the H3K4 and H3K79 methylations extended farther downstream, past the IgH enhancer to the end of the transcribed region.

Here, we show that the block occurs after nuclear entry of viral DNA and prevents the accumulation of IE1/IE2 mRNAs, suggesting an inhibition of transcription. Remarkably, the presence of cis-regulatory regions of the MIE locus is neither sufficient nor necessary for IE1/IE2 repression in the S/G2 phase. Furthermore, the block of viral mRNA expression also affects other immediate-early transcribed regions, i.e. the US3 and UL36-38 gene loci. This suggests a mechanism of repression that acts in a general and not a gene-specific fashion. Such a nuclear, genome-wide repression of HCMV is typically mediated by the intrinsic immune defence at nuclear domain 10 (ND10) structures. However, we found that neither Daxx nor PML, the main players of ND10-based immunity, are required for the block to viral gene expression in the S/G2 phase. In addition, the viral tegument protein pp71 (pUL82), a major antagonist of the intrinsic immunity at pre-immediate-early times of infection, proved to be functional in S-phase cells. This suggests the existence of a yet undiscovered, CDK-dependent mechanism exerting higher-level control over immediate-early mRNA expression in HCMV-infected cells.",,"['Zydek, Martin', 'Uecker, Ralf', 'Tavalai, Nina', 'Stamminger, Thomas', 'Hagemeier, Christian', 'Wiebusch, Luder']","['Zydek M', 'Uecker R', 'Tavalai N', 'Stamminger T', 'Hagemeier C', 'Wiebusch L']","['Labor fur Padiatrische Molekularbiologie, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Ziegelstr. 5-9, 10117 Berlin, Germany.', 'Labor fur Padiatrische Molekularbiologie, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Ziegelstr. 5-9, 10117 Berlin, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie der Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie der Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Labor fur Padiatrische Molekularbiologie, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Ziegelstr. 5-9, 10117 Berlin, Germany.', 'Labor fur Padiatrische Molekularbiologie, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Ziegelstr. 5-9, 10117 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110810,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '107852-97-1 (cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 71kDa)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'G2 Phase', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2011/08/13 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/08/12 06:00'],"['2011/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.034173-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2011 Dec;92(Pt 12):2757-2769. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.034173-0.

Defects in its constituents, the lamins, lead to a class of genetic diseases collectively referred to as laminopathies. Using live cell imaging, we observed the occurrence of intermittent, non-lethal ruptures of the nuclear envelope in dermal fibroblast cultures of patients with different mutations of lamin A/C. These ruptures, which were absent in normal fibroblasts, could be mimicked by selective knockdown as well as knockout of LMNA and were accompanied by the loss of cellular compartmentalization. This was demonstrated by the influx of cytoplasmic transcription factor RelA and regulatory protein Cyclin B1 into the nucleus, and efflux of nuclear transcription factor OCT1 and nuclear structures containing the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumour suppressor protein to the cytoplasm. While recovery of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged nuclear localization signal in the nucleus demonstrated restoration of nuclear membrane integrity, part of the mobile PML structures became permanently translocated to the cytoplasm.

About 1000 annual paediatric CT investigations of the skull will lead to about three excess neoplasms in the head region, i.e. the probability of an induced late effect must be suspected in the range of some thousands. Additionally, a relevant increase of cataracts must be considered.

To select an appropriate test system reflecting inflammatory conditions, the responsiveness to TNF-alpha was compared in T84, Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. The highest TNF-alpha response was observed in HT-29 cells and this cell line was selected for exposure to the B. breve strains M-16V, NR246 and UCC2003. After one hour of bacterial pre-incubation followed by two hours of additional TNF-alpha stimulation, B. breve M-16V (86%), but to a much lesser extent strains NR246 (50%) or UCC2003 (32%), showed a strain-specific reduction of the HT-29 transcriptional response to the inflammatory treatment. The most important functional groups of genes that were transcriptionally suppressed by the presence of B. breve M-16V, were found to be involved in immune regulation and apoptotic processes. About 54% of the TNF-alpha induced genes were solely suppressed by the presence of B. breve M-16V. These included apoptosis-related cysteine protease caspase 7 (CASP7), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), amyloid beta (A4) precursor proteinbinding family A member 1 (APBA1), NADPH oxidase (NOX5), and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). The extracellular IL-8 concentration was determined by an immunological assay but did not change significantly, indicating that B. breve M-16V only partially modulates the TNF-alpha pathway.

This study analyzes the clinical benefit of such responses and identifies value in achieving such responses. Patients with less than complete cytogenetic response to second -line therapy or beyond should be considered to have benefit from therapy and the value of this considered in the context of which alternative options are available. BACKGROUND: Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) is the gold standard for response to therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) because it is associated with a survival benefit. However, patients who have failed initial therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) frequently achieve only partial or minor cytogenetic responses. The clinical benefit of such responses is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the records of all 165 consecutive patients treated in clinical trials with TKI as second-line therapy or beyond after failure to prior imatinib therapy. RESULTS: A CCyR was achieved with second-line TKI therapy or beyond in 52% of patients, whereas 7% achieved a partial cytogenetic response (PCyR), 14% a minor cytogenetic response (mCyR), 14% complete hematologic response (CHR) only, and 17% no response. The 3-year survival probability was 98% for those with CCyR, compared to 83% with PCyR, 83% for mCyR, 76% for CHR, and 71% for no response. Survival free from transformation rates at 3 years were 93%, 73%, 84%, 88%, and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CCyR is associated with the greatest survival benefit among patients treated with second-line therapy or beyond and remains the optimal cytogenetic goal of therapy. However, patients with partial and minor cytogenetic response derive a benefit compared to patients who have no response. This benefit should be recognized and evaluated against any alternative option available to a given patient before a change in therapy is recommended.",['Copyright (c) 2011.

Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor protein of calcitonin, is a specific and sensitive marker of severe bacterial infections during short-term neutropenia. Because the value of PCT measurements among patients undergoing long periods of neutropenia remains uncertain and because several mechanisms, such as bacterial or fungal infections, reactions to drugs or blood products or tumor-associated events, can cause fever, we described the dynamics of PCT in 29 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with 39 instances of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Plasma levels of PCT were determined prospectively by an immunoluminometric assay every four days starting at the onset of chemotherapy and continuing until the resolution of fever. We found that bacteremia did increase PCT levels above 0.5ng/mL and these levels predicted bacteremia at day 15 of chemotherapy.

In order to narrow down the critical region within the env gene that determines neuropathogenicity, we constructed chimeric viruses having chimeric env between A8 and non-neuropathogenic 57 on the background of A8 virus. After replacement of the BamHI (at nucleotide 5715)-AgeI (at nucleotide 6322) fragment of A8 virus with the corresponding fragment of 57, neuropathogenicity was lost. In contrast, the chimeric viruses that have the BamHI (5715)-AgeI (6322) fragment of A8 induced spongiosis in 100% of infected rats at the same or slightly lower intensity than A8 virus. These results indicate that the BamHI (5715)-AgeI (6322) fragment of A8, which contains the signal sequence and the N-terminal half of RBD, is crucial for the induction of spongiform neurodegeneration. In the BamHI (5715)-AgeI (6322) fragment, seven amino acids differed between A8 and 57, one in the signal sequence and six in RBD, which suggests that these amino acids significantly contribute to the neuropathogenicity of A8.",['(c) 2011 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.'],"['Seki, Yohei', 'Hirano, Naoki', 'Mizukura, Misaho', 'Watanabe, Rihito', 'Takase-Yoden, Sayaka']","['Seki Y', 'Hirano N', 'Mizukura M', 'Watanabe R', 'Takase-Yoden S']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Faculty of Engineering, Soka University, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Brain/pathology/virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology']",2011/08/13 06:00,2012/01/05 06:00,['2011/08/12 06:00'],"['2011/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.2011.00374.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2011 Oct;55(10):694-703. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2011.00374.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the popularity of approaches for relative protein quantitation, the widespread use of absolute quantitation has been hampered by inefficient and expensive production of labeled protein standards. To optimize production of isotopically labeled standards, we genetically modified a commonly employed protein expression Escherichia coli strain, BL21 (DE3), to construct an auxotroph for arginine and lysine. This bacterial strain allows low-cost, high-level expression of fully labeled proteins with no conversion of labeled arginine to proline. In combination with a fluorescence-based quantitation of standards and nontargeted LC-MS/MS analysis of unfractionated total cell lysates, this strain was used to determine the copy number of a post-translational modifier, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-2), in HeLa, human sperm, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.

Regarding cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines, it has been recognized as an important prototype. However, quinonoid drugs present a major challenge because of their toxicity. In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity and genetic toxicity of nor-beta-lapachone in human lymphocytes and HL-60 leukemia cells and murine V79 fibroblasts, to shed some light on its selectivity toward cancer cells. As measured by MTT test, exposure of V79 cells to nor-beta-lapachone resulted in a weak cytotoxicity (IC(50) = 13.41 muM), and at a concentration up to 21.9 muM, no cytotoxic effect was observed in lymphocytes, while in HL-60 cells, nor-beta-lapachone elicited significantly greater cytotoxicity (IC(50) = 1.89 muM). Cultures coexposed to GSH-OEt showed an increased viability, which may indicate a neutralization of ROS generated by quinonoid treatment. In fact, only the highest concentrations of nor-beta-lapachone (10 or 20 muM) caused an increase in oxidative stress in nontumor levels cells as measured by TBARS and nitrite/nitrate detection. This was accompanied by an alteration in intracellular thiol content. However, NAC pre-exposure restored the redox equilibrium of the cells and the concentration of thiol levels to control values. Nor-beta-lapachone at 2.5 and 5 muM failed to induce DNA damage in nontumor cells, but at the highest concentrations tested, it induced single and double DNA strand breaks and increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Interestingly, these damages were prevented by NAC pretreatment or exacerbated by prior exposure to the GSH-depleting agent 1-bromoheptane. In electrochemical experiments, nor-beta-lapachone at the same concentrations as those used in genotoxic tests did not damage DNA directly, but at the highest concentration tested (200 muM), it caused a very weak DNA interaction. Corroborating electrochemical data, oxidative modifications of DNA bases were observed, as checked by DNA repair enzymes EndoIII and FPG, which reinforced the indirect actions caused by nor-beta-lapachone through ROS generation and not via DNA intercalation. The DNA repair capacities were higher for nontumor cells than for leukemia cells, which may be related to the selective cytoxicity of nor-beta-lapachone toward cancer cells.

Clearly whole organisms vs their component cells will differ in the way in which they handle xenobiotics, with the latter more dependent on physiochemical parameters such as pH and temperature in the absence of active metabolism or excretion. This could impact on the cells' experience of drug in culture. We therefore report here on examination of a modified, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with assessment of degradant production from a 72 h solution stability study, clearly demonstrating that omacetaxine is highly stable in representative cell culture conditions (37 degrees C, neutral pH) and persists for many days in marked contrast to its short-half life in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Marenah, Lamin', 'Allan, Elaine K', 'Mountford, Joanne C', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Elliott, Moira A']","['Marenah L', 'Allan EK', 'Mountford JC', 'Holyoake TL', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Elliott MA']","['Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Davidson Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110809,England,Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,8610241,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Solutions)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Stability', 'Harringtonines/*chemistry', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Solutions/chemistry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Temperature']",2011/08/11 06:00,2012/08/18 06:00,['2011/08/11 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bmc.1686 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Chromatogr. 2012 May;26(5):545-7. doi: 10.1002/bmc.1686.

The simultaneous detection of intracellular GNLY and cell surface antigens (CD3 and CD56) was performed with flow cytometry. GNLY apoptotic protein was visualised by immunocytochemistry. Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity was analysed with a cytotoxicity assay against human erythroleukaemia K-562 cells. The percentage of GNLY(+) cells did not differ significantly between PsA patients in the acute phase and those in remission; however, it was always higher than in healthy examinees due to the increased percentage of GNLY(+) cells within T cells, NKT cells, and both, and in the CD56(+dim) and CD56(+bright) NK subsets. The mean fluorescence intensity for GNLY was higher in all lymphocyte subpopulations in the acute phase than in remission and in healthy controls. Accordingly, GNLY-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity against K-562 cells of active phase PsA patients was significantly higher than that in patients in remission or in healthy controls.

Emerging evidence has suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in redox-sensitive signal transduction, and the vascular endothelium plays a critical role in the vascular inflammatory response. In this communication, we present evidence for the potential role of ZNF580 in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-regulated inflammation-related signaling pathways. In a human endothelial cell hybridoma line (EA.hy926), ZNF580 levels were markedly upregulated with H2O2 stimulation in different concentrations (0-400 muM) and at different time-points (0-6 h). H2O2 promoted the rapid translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus according to immunocytochemistry staining. In subsequent research, inhibition of NF-kappaB by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, a selective chemical inhibitor of NF-kappaB) was shown to block the upregulated expression of ZNF580 that was induced by H2O2. Furthermore, transient transfection of ZNF580 resulted in an increase of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) 3.01+/-0.05 folds according to real-time RT-PCR and ELISA assays, which also showed significantly enhanced motility of human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1). These results suggest that H2O2 upregulates the expression of ZNF580 via the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, and overexpression of ZNF580 plays a critical role in augmenting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8.",,"['DangLi, Ren', 'HeKong, Wang', 'JiQin, Liu', 'MingHua, Zhang', 'WenCheng, Zhang']","['DangLi R', 'HeKong W', 'JiQin L', 'MingHua Z', 'WenCheng Z']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital, Medical College of Chinese People's Armed Police Force, Tianjin, 300162, China. ren.dangli@163.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110810,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZNF580 protein, human)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2011/08/11 06:00,2012/06/16 06:00,['2011/08/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-011-1013-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2012 Jan;359(1-2):183-91. doi: 10.1007/s11010-011-1013-0.

Such dependencies have been demonstrated in mouse models, where conditional expression systems have revealed that oncogenes able to initiate cancer are often required for tumor maintenance and progression, thus validating the pathways they control as therapeutic targets. Here, we implement an integrative approach that combines genetically defined mouse models, transcriptional profiling, and a novel inducible RNAi platform to characterize cellular programs that underlie addiction to MLL-AF9-a fusion oncoprotein involved in aggressive forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that MLL-AF9 contributes to leukemia maintenance by enforcing a Myb-coordinated program of aberrant self-renewal involving genes linked to leukemia stem cell potential and poor prognosis in human AML. Accordingly, partial and transient Myb suppression precisely phenocopies MLL-AF9 withdrawal and eradicates aggressive AML in vivo without preventing normal myelopoiesis, indicating that strategies to inhibit Myb-dependent aberrant self-renewal programs hold promise as effective and cancer-specific therapeutics. Together, our results identify Myb as a critical mediator of oncogene addiction in AML, delineate relevant Myb target genes that are amenable to pharmacologic inhibition, and establish a general approach for dissecting oncogene addiction in vivo.",,"['Zuber, Johannes', 'Rappaport, Amy R', 'Luo, Weijun', 'Wang, Eric', 'Chen, Chong', 'Vaseva, Angelina V', 'Shi, Junwei', 'Weissmueller, Susann', 'Fellmann, Christof', 'Taylor, Meredith J', 'Weissenboeck, Martina', 'Graeber, Thomas G', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Vakoc, Christopher R', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['Zuber J', 'Rappaport AR', 'Luo W', 'Wang E', 'Chen C', 'Vaseva AV', 'Shi J', 'Weissmueller S', 'Fellmann C', 'Taylor MJ', 'Weissenboeck M', 'Graeber TG', 'Kogan SC', 'Vakoc CR', 'Lowe SW']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myb/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference']",2011/08/11 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/08/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['25/15/1628 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.17269211 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2011 Aug 1;25(15):1628-40. doi: 10.1101/gad.17269211.,PMC3182026,,"['R37 CA072614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007150/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Genes Dev. 2011 Sep 15;25(18):1997.

Fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differ from adult HSCs in terms of gene expression profile, surface marker expression, differentiation, and self-renewal capacity. We previously showed that the transcription factor SOX17 is expressed by fetal, but not adult, HSCs and is required for the maintenance of fetal and neonatal, but not adult, HSCs. In the current study, we show that ectopic expression of Sox17 in adult HSCs and transiently reconstituting multipotent progenitors was sufficient to confer increased self-renewal potential and the expression of fetal HSC genes, including fetal HSC surface markers. Sox17 expression enabled transiently reconstituting adult progenitors to give long-term multilineage reconstitution that resembled fetal hematopoiesis, including increased erythropoiesis, increased myelopoiesis, and decreased lymphopoiesis. Long-term ectopic expression of Sox17 eventually led to leukemogenesis.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the imaging features of eight children (age 3-14 years) with chemotherapy-related ACPO, all of whom had undergone plain radiography and CT examinations. The diagnosis of ACPO was based on both clinical features and imaging findings. RESULTS: Abnormalities noted on plain radiography included faecal gaseous distension of the transverse colon (4/8), faecal gaseous distension of the ascending colon (3/8), gaseous distended transverse colon (3/8) and gaseous small bowel loops (6/8). As seen on CT scans, findings of faecal fluid distended the ascending and transverse colon (5/8), faecal gas distended the transverse and ascending colon (3/8), and small bowel dilatation (5/8) and pneumatosis intestinalis (2/8) were noted. Seven of the eight patients had colonic dilatation from the caecum to the transverse colon with the transition zone near the splenic flexure. CONCLUSION: In children presenting with abdominal pain and constipation following chemotherapy, imaging features of progressive colonic dilatation seen on radiography and dilatation from the caecum to the transverse colon with the transition zone near the splenic flexure, as noted on CT, are suggestive of ACPO. CT is more successful than plain radiography for evaluating this finding, particularly in colonic segments filled primarily with fluid, but CT should not be necessary for making the diagnosis as plain radiographs and clinical evaluation should be adequate.",,"['Lee, G E', 'Lim, G-Y', 'Lee, J-W', 'Cho, B']","['Lee GE', 'Lim GY', 'Lee JW', 'Cho B']","[""Department of Radiology, St Mary's Hospital, the Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110809,England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colon/diagnostic imaging', 'Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction/*chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Gases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pneumatosis Cystoides Intestinalis/diagnostic imaging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2011/08/11 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/08/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['13281402 [pii]', '10.1259/bjr/13281402 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2012 Apr;85(1012):377-81. doi: 10.1259/bjr/13281402.

We analyzed TET2 mutation in 486 adult patients with primary AML. TET2 mutation occurred in 13.2% of our patients and was closely associated with older age, higher white blood cell and blast counts, lower platelet numbers, normal karyotype, intermediate-risk cytogenetics, isolated trisomy 8, NPM1 mutation, and ASXL1 mutation but mutually exclusive with IDH mutation. TET2 mutation is an unfavorable prognostic factor in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, and its negative impact was further enhanced when the mutation was combined with FLT3-ITD, NPM1-wild, or unfavorable genotypes (other than NPM1(+)/FLT3-ITD(-) or CEBPA(+)). A scoring system integrating TET2 mutation with FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations could well separate AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics into 4 groups with different prognoses (P < .0001). Sequential analysis revealed that TET2 mutation detected at diagnosis was frequently lost at relapse; rarely, the mutation was acquired at relapse in those without TET2 mutation at diagnosis. In conclusion, TET2 mutation is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, especially when it is combined with other adverse molecular markers.

However, retrospective identification of the cell of origin in cancer is challenging because of the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in tumor cells. The biologic state of the cell of origin likely influences the genetic events that drive transformation. We directly tested this hypothesis by performing a Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis screen in which common insertion sites were identified in tumors that were produced by mutagenesis of cells at varying time points throughout the T lineage. Mutation and gene expression data derived from these tumors were then compared with data obtained from a panel of 84 human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples, including copy number alterations and gene expression profiles. This revealed that altering the cell of origin produces tumors that model distinct subtypes of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, suggesting that even subtle changes in the cell of origin dramatically affect genetic selection in tumors.

We conducted a phase 2 trial of decitabine (DAC) in 39 patients with advanced CMML defined according to a previous trial. Median number of DAC cycles was 10 (range, 1-24). Overall response rate was 38% with 4 complete responses (10%), 8 marrow responses (21%), and 3 stable diseases with hematologic improvement (8%). Eighteen patients (46%) demonstrated stable disease without hematologic improvement, and 6 (15%) progressed to acute leukemia.

We analyzed pretherapy MN1 expression in 140 older (>/= 60 years) de novo CN-AML patients treated on cytarabine/daunorubicin-based protocols. Low MN1 expressers had higher complete remission (CR) rates (P = .001), and longer overall survival (P = .03) and event-free survival (EFS; P = .004). In multivariable models, low MN1 expression was associated with better CR rates and EFS. The impact of MN1 expression on overall survival and EFS was predominantly in patients 70 years of age or older, with low MN1 expressers with mutated NPM1 having the best outcome. The impact of MN1 expression was also observed in the Intermediate-I, but not the Favorable group of the European LeukemiaNet classification, where low MN1 expressers had CR rates and EFS similar to those of Favorable group patients.

As the bone marrow environment plays an important role in survival and chemotherapy resistance of leukemia cells by activating different signaling pathways, such as the VLA-4 and PI3K/Akt pathways, we studied the prognostic and biological impact of VLA-4 expression in leukemia cells from children with relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its influence on the sensitivity of the leukemia cells to drugs. DESIGN AND METHODS: VLA-4 expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in leukemia cells from 56 patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 trial of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster study group. Gene expression changes related to VLA-4 expression were investigated by microarray-based mRNA profiling. The effect of VLA-4 signaling on proliferation and drug resistance was studied in co-cultures of leukemia and stromal cells. RESULTS: High expression of VLA-4 at first relapse was associated with adverse prognostic factors, poor molecular response to therapy and significantly worse probabilities of event-free and overall survival. VLA-4 expression was an independent prognostic parameter. Comparing gene expression profiles of leukemia cells with high versus low VLA-4 expression, we identified 27 differentially expressed genes primarily involved in the PI3K/Akt, ephrin and Rho GTPase pathways. Blocking of VLA-4 signaling in combination with cytarabine treatment abolished the growth supportive effect of stromal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that high VLA-4 expression is a marker of poor prognosis and a potential therapeutic target in children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and confirm that cellular interactions and biological effects related to VLA-4 play a decisive role in the survival of leukemia cells and response to therapy.

ICU mortality was the primary criterion. We also compared respiratory deterioration rates, need for ventilation and nosocomial infections. 17 (85%) patients had hyperleukocytosis, 19 (95%) had leukaemic masses, and all 20 had severe pancytopenia. All patients presented with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates prior to AML FAB-M5 diagnosis.

Twenty patients with relapsed or high-risk CLL were evaluated. Nineteen patients were previously treated. The complete response rate was 18%; the overall response rate was 53%. Median progression-free and overall survival was 5.3 and 10.6 months, respectively. The most common serious adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

This study aimed at investigating the key mechanisms that contribute to the potent anti-leukemia activity of PEITC and at evaluating its therapeutic potential. RESULTS: Our study showed that PEITC caused a rapid depletion of mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) and a significant elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide, and induced a disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport complex I manifested by an early degradation of NADH dehydrogenase Fe-S protein-3 and a significant suppression of mitochondrial respiration. Using biochemical and pharmacological approaches, we further showed that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration alone by rotenone caused only a moderate cytotoxicity in leukemia cells, whereas a combination of respiratory inhibition and an ROS-generating agent exhibited a synergistic effect against leukemia and lymphoma cells. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: Although PEITC is a reactive compound and might have multiple mechanisms of action, we showed that a rapid depletion of GSH and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration are two important early events that induced synergistic cytotoxicity in leukemia cells. These findings not only suggest that PEITC is a promising compound for potential use in leukemia treatment, but also provide a basis for developing new therapeutic strategies to effectively kill leukemia cells by using a novel combination to modulate ROS and inhibit mitochondrial respiration.",,"['Chen, Gang', 'Chen, Zhao', 'Hu, Yumin', 'Huang, Peng']","['Chen G', 'Chen Z', 'Hu Y', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110929,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 1.6.99.3 (NADH Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 7.1.1.2 (Electron Transport Complex I)', 'EC 7.1.1.2 (NDUFS3 protein, human)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electron Transport Complex I/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2011/08/11 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/08/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/ars.2011.4170 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2011 Dec 15;15(12):2911-21. doi: 10.1089/ars.2011.4170.

PRODECURE: We conducted a two-institution retrospective chart review of 245 patients with intraocular RB treated with six cycles of vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide for treatment of intraocular retinoblastoma. Cumulative incidence of SMN was calculated with adjustment for the competing risk of death. RESULTS: There were 187 patients with germline retinoblastoma and 58 with non-germline disease. External beam radiotherapy was subsequently utilized in 46 (24%) of germline cases and six (10%) of non-germline cases. Mean follow-up of germline and non-germline patients was 80 and 70 months, respectively. Seven subsequent cancers were found in six patients for an overall incidence of 3% at a mean of 11 years. For germline cases, following CEV alone (n = 156), SMN were found in 4% following the RB diagnosis. We found no SMN in patients with non-germline RB. One patient developed pineoblastoma. SMN included osteosarcoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1), orbital and conjunctival melanoma (n = 1), low-grade glioma (n = 1), and acute promyeloctic leukemia (n = 1). Five of the six patients with a second malignancy survive at mean of 46 months (range 15-71 months). CONCLUSIONS: At a mean of 11 years, 4% of children with germline RB treated with CEV as frontline therapy developed SMN's. No SMN was found in non-germline patients. Concerns regarding CEV-induced second cancers should not deter clinicians from using life and vision preserving therapy in patients with retinoblastoma.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Turaka, Kiran', 'Shields, Carol L', 'Meadows, Anna T', 'Leahey, Ann']","['Turaka K', 'Shields CL', 'Meadows AT', 'Leahey A']","['Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110808,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Eye Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*mortality', 'Retinoblastoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2011/08/10 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23278 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;59(1):121-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23278.

However, platelet counts alone do not reveal the underlying pathomechanism. New blood cell counters provide additional information on platelet size and volume, and enable the distinction of sub-populations. In this preliminary study, we evaluate whether one of these markers can be used for diagnosis of isolated thrombocytopenia in children. PROCEDURE: We provide normal values for mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), plateletcrit (PCT), platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR), platelet mean-frequent volume (P-MFV), relative immature platelet fraction (IPF%), and absolute IPF (IPF#) for 100 healthy children and analyzed 87 children with thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: In children with platelet production defects, IPF% was low, while in acute immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), IPF% was markedly increased (median 25.2%, P < 0.01), representing accelerated platelet turnover. Interestingly, children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) also had elevated IPF% (median 10%, P < 0.01), suggesting that thrombopoiesis is stimulated despite virtual absence of bone marrow progenitors. Low IPF# was only found in patients with acute ITP. CONCLUSIONS: IPF% is a marker for thrombocytopenia due to defective platelet production while IPF#, representing the immature platelet count, might become a practical parameter to distinguish acute ITP from thrombocytopenia in children with newly diagnosed ALL (P < 0.01).","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Strauss, Gabriele', 'Vollert, Cora', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Weimann, Andreas', 'Gaedicke, Gerhard', 'Schulze, Harald']","['Strauss G', 'Vollert C', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Weimann A', 'Gaedicke G', 'Schulze H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101222,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood/*diagnosis', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/*diagnosis/etiology']",2011/08/10 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22907 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Oct;57(4):641-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22907.

Alterations in the RAS-RAF-MAP kinase and PI3-kinase signaling pathways are commonly altered in melanoma. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT, and GNAQ occur in a mutually exclusive pattern and lead to MAP-kinase activation. Loss of PTEN function, primarily by deletion, is the most common known genetic alteration in the PI3-kinase cascade, and is commonly associated with BRAF mutations (Curtin et al., N Engl J Med 353:2135-2147, 2005; Tsao et al., Cancer Res 60:1800-1804, 2000, J Investig Dermatol 122:337-341, 2004). The growth advantage conveyed by the constitutive activation of these pathways leads to positive selection of cells that have acquired the mutations and in many instances leads to critical dependency of the cancer cells on their activation. This creates opportunities for therapeutic interventions targeted at signaling components within these pathways that are amenable for pharmacological inhibition. This concept follows the paradigm established by the landmark discovery that inhibition of the fusion kinase BCR-ABL can be used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (Druker et al., N Engl J Med 344:1031-037, 2001).

After SW480 cells were treated by UA at the concentrations of 0-40 mumol/L for 48 h, FCM showed that annexin V (AV) positive cells and hypodiploid peak ratio increased along with the increase in the drug's concentrations; and Western blot found that expressions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Both UA and OA have antitumor effects on cancer cells with MDR, and the optimal effect is shown by UA on colonic cancer cells. Also, UA shows cell apoptosis-inducing effect on SW480, possibly by way of down-regulating the expressions of apoptosis antagonistic proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin.",,"['Shan, Jian-zhen', 'Xuan, Yan-yan', 'Ruan, Shu-qin', 'Sun, Mei']","['Shan JZ', 'Xuan YY', 'Ruan SQ', 'Sun M']","['Department of Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110809,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Oleanolic Acid/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2011/08/10 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11655-011-0815-y [doi]'],ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2011 Aug;17(8):607-11. doi: 10.1007/s11655-011-0815-y.

In a comparative analysis, we recently showed that mature T cells, on the contrary, are highly resistant to transformation by gammaretroviral gene transfer. In the present study, we observed immortalization of a single T-cell clone in vitro after gammaretroviral transduction of the T-cell protooncogene LMO2. This clone was CD4/CD8 double-negative, but expressed a single rearranged T-cell receptor. The clone was able to overgrow nonmanipulated competitor T-cell populations in vitro, but no tumor formation was observed after transplantation into Rag-1 deficient recipients. The retroviral integration site (RIS) was found to be near the IL2RA and IL15RA genes. As a consequence, both receptors were constitutively upregulated on the RNA and protein level and the immortalized cell clone was highly IL-2 dependent. Ectopic expression of both, the IL2RA chain and LMO2, induced long-term growth in cultured primary T cells. This study demonstrates that insertional mutagenesis can contribute to immortalization of mature T cells, although this is a rare event. Furthermore, the results show that signaling of the IL-2 receptor and the protooncogene LMO2 can act synergistically in maligniant transformation of mature T lymphocytes.",,"['Newrzela, Sebastian', 'Cornils, Kerstin', 'Heinrich, Tim', 'Schlager, Julia', 'Yi, Ji-Hee', 'Lysenko, Olga', 'Kimpel, Janine', 'Fehse, Boris', 'von Laer, Dorothee']","['Newrzela S', 'Cornils K', 'Heinrich T', 'Schlager J', 'Yi JH', 'Lysenko O', 'Kimpel J', 'Fehse B', 'von Laer D']","['Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, Goethe-University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110727,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'LIM Domain Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/drug effects/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Integration/drug effects']",2011/08/10 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2010.00193 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2010.00193 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2011;17(11-12):1223-32. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2010.00193.

Human leukemia cells HL-60, Jurkat, and Molt-3 were treated with various doses of ATO, CMEMM, and combinations thereof for 24 and 48 h. Results indicated that the combination of 2.5 muM ATO and 50 mug/mL CMEMM synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in HL-60 and Jurkat cell lines. Apoptosis triggered by ATO/CMEMM treatment was confirmed by accumulation of cells in the sub-G(1) phase in cell cycle analyses, characteristic apoptotic nuclear fragmentation, and increased percentage of annexin V-positive apoptotic cells. Such combination treatments also led to elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), butylated hydroxytoluene, and alpha-tocopherol prevented cells from ATO/CMEMM-induced apoptosis. The ATO/CMEMM-induced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 can be blocked by NAC.

Our previous work has shown that cleavage of the alpha6beta1 integrin to produce the structural variant alpha6pbeta1 on tumor cell surfaces is mediated by the serine protease urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). Cleavage of alpha6beta1 increases tumor cell motility, invasion, and prostate cancer metastasis, and blockage of uPA inhibits alpha6pbeta1 production. In human tumors, uPA and uPAR are expressed in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAMs localize to solid tumors and contribute to increased tumor growth and the metastatic phenotype. In this study, we utilized a coculture system of PC-3 prostate tumor cells and macrophages [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-differentiated human leukemia HL-60 cells] to investigate the hypothesis that macrophages stimulate the production of the prometastatic variant alpha6pbeta1 on human prostate cancer cells via the uPA/uPAR axis. Our results indicate that adherent macrophages cocultured with PC-3 cells increased PC-3 uPAR mRNA, uPAR cell surface protein expression and alpha6 integrin cleavage. The stimulation does not require macrophage/tumor cell contact because macrophage conditioned medium is sufficient for increased uPAR transcription and alpha6 cleavage-dependent PC-3 cell invasion. The increased cleavage was dependent on uPAR because production was blocked by silencing RNA-targeting uPAR. These results indicate that macrophages can stimulate uPA/uPAR production in tumor cells which results in alpha6 integrin cleavage. These data suggest that TAMs promote prometastatic integrin-dependent pericellular proteolysis.",,"['Sroka, Isis C', 'Sandoval, Cynthia P', 'Chopra, Harsharon', 'Gard, Jaime M C', 'Pawar, Sangita C', 'Cress, Anne E']","['Sroka IC', 'Sandoval CP', 'Chopra H', 'Gard JM', 'Pawar SC', 'Cress AE']","['Department of Pharmacology, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110808,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Integrin alpha6beta1)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha6beta1/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator/metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism']",2011/08/10 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-11-0080 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0080 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Oct;9(10):1319-28. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0080.

Through binding with IL-21R, IL-21 induces activation of different JAK/STAT signal transduction pathways and regulates proliferation or apoptosis of tumor cells. In this review, we will discuss the expression of IL-21/IL-21R and its effect in different types of hematological malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to evaluate a flow cytometry assay for gammaH2AX detection (hereafter termed the gammaH2AX by flow assay), 6 prototypical (3 pro- and 3 proximate) genotoxins, i.e. dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), methyl methane sulphonate (MMS), methyl nitrosourea (MNU) and 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4NQO), were selected to define assay evaluation criteria. In addition, 3 non-genotoxic cytotoxins (phthalic anhydride, n-butyl chloride and hexachloroethane) were included to investigate the influence of cytotoxicity on assay performance. At similar cytotoxicity levels (relative cell counts; RCC 75-40%) all prototypical genotoxins induced marked concentration-dependent increases in gammaH2AX compared with the non-genotoxins. As a result, assay evaluation criteria for a positive effect were defined as >1.5-fold gammaH2AX @ RCC >25%. Twenty five additional chemicals with diverse structures and genotoxic activity were selected to evaluate the gammaH2AX by flow assay. Results were compared with Ames bacterial and in vitro mammalian genotoxicity tests (mouse lymphoma assay and/or chromosome aberration assay). gammaH2AX by flow assay results were highly predictive of Ames (sensitivity 100%; specificity 67%; concordance 82%) and in vitro mammalian genotoxicity tests (sensitivity 91%; specificity 89%; concordance 91%) and provide additional evidence that gammaH2AX is a biomarker of potential genotoxic activity, underpinned mechanistically by the cellular response to DSBs. Discordant findings were predominately attributed to differences in specificity for some mammalian cell genotoxins that are Ames non-mutagens or for ""biologically-irrelevant"" positives in the mammalian tests. Simple anilines were classified as genotoxic following rat liver S9-mediated bioactivation, however, effects on gammaH2AX were atypical and limited to a small sub-population of S-phase nuclei. Nevertheless, the gammaH2AX by flow assay represents a novel genotoxicity assay with the potential to flag both pro- and proximate genotoxins.",['2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies suggest that the signaling function of Tax requires its ubiquitination, although how the Tax ubiquitination is regulated remains unclear. RESULTS: We show here that the deubiquitinase CYLD physically interacts with Tax and negatively regulates the ubiquitination of this viral protein. This function of CYLD is associated with inhibition of Tax-mediated activation of IKK although not that of Tak1. Interestingly, CYLD undergoes constitutive phosphorylation in HTLV1-transformed T cells, a mechanism known to inactivate the catalytic activity of CYLD. Consistently, a phospho-mimetic CYLD mutant fails to inhibit Tax ubiquitination. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CYLD negatively regulates the signaling function of Tax through inhibition of Tax ubiquitination. Conversely, induction of CYLD phosphorylation may serve as a mechanism by which HTLV1 overrides the inhibitory function of CYLD, leading to the persistent activation of NF-kappaB.",,"['Wu, Xuefeng', 'Zhang, Minying', 'Sun, Shao-Cong']","['Wu X', 'Zhang M', 'Sun SC']","['Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 7455 Fannin Street, Box 902, Houston TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 7455 Fannin Street, Box 902, Houston TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 7455 Fannin Street, Box 902, Houston TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 7455 Fannin Street, Box 902, Houston TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110808,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,2011/08/10 06:00,2011/08/10 06:01,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['2045-3701-1-27 [pii]', '10.1186/2045-3701-1-27 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2011 Aug 8;1:27. doi: 10.1186/2045-3701-1-27.,PMC3170579,,"['R01 AI064639/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI064639/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the intimate association between bacterium and host, Chlamydia evolved various strategies to protect their host cell against death-inducing stimuli, allowing the bacterium to complete its development cycle. An RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen was used to identify host cell factors required for apoptosis resistance of human epithelial cells infected with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2. Among the 32 validated hits, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 was identified as a target. Protein network analyses implicated the transcription factor hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) to be central to the regulation of many of the identified targets. Further mechanistic investigations showed that HIF-1alpha was stabilized within the host cell cytoplasm during early infection time points, followed by its translocation to the nucleus and eventual transcriptional activation of Mcl-1. siRNA-mediated depletion of HIF-1alpha led to a drastic decrease in Mcl-1, rendering the cell sensitive to apoptosis induction. Taken together, our findings identify HIF-1alpha as responsible for upregulation of Mcl-1 and the maintenance of apoptosis resistance during Chlamydia infection.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Sharma, Manu', 'Machuy, Nikolaus', 'Bohme, Linda', 'Karunakaran, Karthika', 'Maurer, Andre P', 'Meyer, Thomas F', 'Rudel, Thomas']","['Sharma M', 'Machuy N', 'Bohme L', 'Karunakaran K', 'Maurer AP', 'Meyer TF', 'Rudel T']","['Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Chariteplatz 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110808,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Chlamydia trachomatis/*pathogenicity', 'Epithelial Cells/microbiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Testing', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Systems Biology/methods']",2011/08/10 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1462-5822.2011.01642.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2011 Oct;13(10):1573-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2011.01642.x.

The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of the Naja nigricollis phospholipase A(2) CMS-9 on adaphostin-induced death of human leukaemia U937 cells. 2. Leukaemia U937 cells (Bcr/Abl-negative cells) were treated with adaphostin (0-10 mumol/L) and CMS-9 (0-1 mumol/L). The effects of CMS-9, adaphostin and their combination on cell viability, the generation reactive oxygen species (ROS), [Ca(2+) ](i) , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inactivation, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m) ) and Bcl-2 family proteins were analysed. 3. Both adaphostin and CMS-9 induced U937 cell apoptosis, characterized by dissipation of DeltaPsi(m) and ROS generation. Combined treatment further increased DeltaPsi(m) loss and reduced the viability of adaphostin-treated cells. Unlike in CMS-9-treated cells, in adaphostin-treated cells ROS-induced increases in [Ca(2+) ](i) were observed. CMS-9-induced ROS generation resulted in p38 MAPK activation, whereas adaphostin treatment elicited ROS/Ca(2+) -mediated inactivation of Akt and ERK. Moreover, Akt was found to be involved in ERK phosphorylation. Suppression of p38 MAPK activation blocked CMS-9-induced DeltaPsi(m) loss and Bcl-xL downregulation. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 rescued adaphostin-induced DeltaPsi(m) loss and Bcl-2 downregulation. Similarly, CMS-9 augmented adaphostin toxicity in human leukaemia K562 cells via increased mitochondrial alterations. 4. The results suggest that two distinct pathways mediate adaphostin- and CMS-9-induced mitochondrial damage (i.e. the ROS-Ca(2+) -Akt-ERK and ROS-p38 MAPK pathways, respectively). These distinct pathway explain the augmentation by CMS-9 of DeltaPsi(m) loss and apoptosis in adaphostin-treated U937 cells.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity rate was significantly higher in the MM group (19.4% vs. 12.0% in patients with AL; p = 0.014). The rate of HCV infection did not differ between the two groups. The incidence of cirrhosis was significantly higher in HBsAg+ patients (17.2% vs. 6.2% in HBsAg- patients; p = 0.011). The rate of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection was also significantly higher in HBsAg+ patients (5.2% vs. 0.4% in HBsAg- patients; p = 0.025). Hepatic damage was much more common in HBsAg+ patients than in HBsAg- patients both prior to (22.4% vs. 8.7%; p = 0.006) and during chemotherapy for MM (67.2% vs. 28.6%; p < 0.001). ISS stage, HBsAg+, the use of bortezomib and thalidomide and autologous stem cell transplant were significant factors for overall survival in univariate analysis. In the Cox regression analysis, ISS stage (p = 0.027), HBsAg+ (p = 0.042) and the use of thalidomide (p = 0.001) showed a significant effect on the OS of these patients. The prevalence of HBV infection is higher in patients with MM than in subjects with other hematological malignancies such as AL. Hepatic injury is more common in patients with MM with HBV infection, particularly during chemotherapeutic treatment. HBsAg positivity may be a prognosis factor in patients with MM in HBV endemic areas.",,"['Huang, Beihui', 'Li, Juan', 'Zhou, Zhenhai', 'Zheng, Dong', 'Liu, Junru', 'Chen, Mei']","['Huang B', 'Li J', 'Zhou Z', 'Zheng D', 'Liu J', 'Chen M']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111024,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hepacivirus/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/metabolism', 'Hepatitis B virus/*isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis C/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2011/08/10 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.610013 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Feb;53(2):270-4. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.610013.

Using structure-based virtual screening, we previously identified a novel Jak2 inhibitor named G6. We showed that G6 specifically inhibits Jak2 kinase activity and suppresses Jak2-mediated cellular proliferation. To elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which G6 inhibits Jak2-mediated cellular proliferation, we treated Jak2-V617F expressing human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells for 12 h with either vehicle control or 25 muM of the drug and compared protein expression profiles using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. One differentially expressed protein identified by electrospray mass spectroscopy was the intermediate filament protein, vimentin. It was present in DMSO treated cells but absent in G6 treated cells. HEL cells treated with G6 showed both time- and dose-dependent cleavage of vimentin as well as a marked reorganization of vimentin intermediate filaments within intact cells. In a mouse model of Jak2-V617F mediated human erythroleukemia, G6 also decreased the levels of vimentin protein, in vivo. The G6-induced cleavage of vimentin was found to be Jak2-dependent and calpain-mediated. Furthermore, we found that intracellular calcium mobilization is essential and sufficient for the cleavage of vimentin. Finally, we show that the cleavage of vimentin intermediate filaments, per se, is sufficient to reduce HEL cell viability. Collectively, these results suggest that G6-induced inhibition of Jak2-mediated pathogenic cell growth is concomitant with the disruption of intracellular vimentin filaments. As such, this work describes a novel pathway for the targeting of Jak2-mediated pathological cell growth.",,"['Majumder, Anurima', 'Kirabo, Annet', 'Karrupiah, Kanchana', 'Tsuda, Shigeharu', 'Caldwell-Busby, Jennifer', 'Cardounel, Arturo J', 'Keseru, Gyorgy M', 'Sayeski, Peter P']","['Majumder A', 'Kirabo A', 'Karrupiah K', 'Tsuda S', 'Caldwell-Busby J', 'Cardounel AJ', 'Keseru GM', 'Sayeski PP']","['Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 32610, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110817,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Vimentin/chemistry/*metabolism']",2011/08/10 06:00,2011/11/02 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi200847n [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2011 Sep 13;50(36):7774-86. doi: 10.1021/bi200847n.

Recurrent genetic abnormalities in B-lymphoblastic leukemia with prognostic significance are well known and specifically delineated in the WHO 2008 classification (eg hyperdiploidy, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2); BCR-ABL1, t(12;21)(p13;q22); ETV6-RUNX1). In recent years, a subgroup of B-lymphoblastic leukemia with the recurring genetic alteration of RUNX1 amplification has emerged. This subgroup has a low incidence (2%) and an increased risk of relapse and overall worse outcome. Given these apparently distinctive clinicopathologic features, we evaluated eight cases of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia with RUNX1 amplification treated on Children's Oncology Group protocols from 2000-2009. Compared with 25 consecutive B-lymphoblastic leukemia cases without RUNX1 amplification, we identified a trend toward male predominance (P-value=0.082) and low white blood cell count at presentation (P-value=0.081) in B-lymphoblastic leukemia with RUNX1 amplification. Older age at presentation was significant (median age 9.5 years, P-value=0.006). There was no significant difference in the presence of central nervous system disease, CD20 or myeloid antigen positivity on the blasts or percent circulating blasts in B-lymphoblastic leukemia with RUNX1 amplification versus other B-lymphoblastic leukemia types.

According to the latest WHO classification, the term myelodisplastic syndrome includes diseases with an indolent course, as well as diseases with a fast evolution towards acute leukaemia. Because of this diversity, haematologists base their therapeutic decisions on prognostic scoring systems which incorporate all the significant factors with an influence on survival in this group of patients with myelodisplastic syndrome. Bearing in mind that anaemia is the most frequent form of cytopenia in patients with myelodisplastic syndrome, it is common that at some point of the disease almost every patient with myelodisplastic syndrome is transfusion-dependent. Frequently applied transfusions secure the correction of anaemia in these patients, giving them a good quality of life, but at the same time endangering them with the potential threat of iron overload, when the physiological mechanisms of iron excretion from the organism become insufficient. There is a clear correlation between transfusion dependence and the overall survival in patients with myelodisplastic syndrome. Chelators secure the lowering of the iron surfeit and are indicated in transfusion-dependant patients with myelodisplastic syndrome ( need for two blood units monthly, during one year ), when the ferritin level increases over 1000, in patients who are candidates for transplantation as well as in patients from good prognostic groups with median survival over one year.

Herein, we hypothesize that Obatoclax-mediated sensitization to TRAIL apoptosis may also result from alterations of the apoptotic pathways. The TRAIL-resistant B-cell line Ramos was used as a model for investigation. Treatment of Ramos cells with Obatoclax significantly inhibited the expression of several members of the Bcl-2 family, dissociated Bak from Mcl-1 and inhibited the NFkappaB activity. Cells treated with Mcl-1 siRNA were sensitized to TRAIL apoptosis. We examined whether the sensitization of Ramos to TRAIL by Obatoclax resulted from signaling of the DR4 and/or DR5. Transfection with DR5 siRNA, but not with DR4 siRNA, sensitized the cells to apoptosis following treatment with Obatoclax and TRAIL. The signaling via DR5 correlated with Obatoclax-induced inhibition of the DR5 repressor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Transfection with YY1 siRNA sensitized the cells to TRAIL apoptosis following treatment with Obatoclax and TRAIL. Overall, the present findings reveal a new mechanism of Obatoclax-induced sensitization to TRAIL apoptosis and the involvement of the inhibition of NFkappaB activity and downstream Mcl-1 and YY1 expressions and activities.",,"['Martinez-Paniagua, Melisa A', 'Baritaki, Stavroula', 'Huerta-Yepez, Sara', 'Ortiz-Navarrete, Vianney F', 'Gonzalez-Bonilla, Cesar', 'Bonavida, Benjamin', 'Vega, Mario I']","['Martinez-Paniagua MA', 'Baritaki S', 'Huerta-Yepez S', 'Ortiz-Navarrete VF', 'Gonzalez-Bonilla C', 'Bonavida B', 'Vega MI']","['Unidad de Investigacion Biomedica, Hospital de Infectologia CMN La Raza IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110815,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/08/09 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/08/09 06:00'],"['2011/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['16952 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.16.16952 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Aug 15;10(16):2792-805. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.16.16952.

Normally, telomeres are maintained by telomerase which is downregulated upon cellular differentiation in most somatic cell lineages. Telomerase activity is upregulated in immortalized cells and cancers to support an infinite lifespan and uncontrolled cell growth; however, some immortalized and transformed cells lack telomerase activity. Telomerase-negative tumors and immortalized cells utilize an alternative mechanism for maintaining telomeres termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). This research explored evidence for the ALT pathway in chicken cell lines by studying nontransformed immortalized cell lines (DF-1 and OU2) and comparing them to a normal (mortal) cell line and a transformed cell line (DT40). The research consisted of molecular and cellular analyses including profiling of telomeric DNA (array sizing and total content), telomerase activity, and expression of genes involved in the telomerase, recombination, and ALT pathways. In addition, an immunofluorescence analysis for an ALT marker, i.e. ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs), was conducted. Evidence for ALT was observed in the telomerase-negative immortalized cell lines. Additionally, the APB marker was also found in the other cell systems. The attributes of the chicken provide an additional vertebrate model for investigation of the ALT pathway.","['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

METHODS: Thirty-five MPN samples from 11 ET JAK2 V617F, 12 ET JAK2 wild type (WT) and 12 PV JAK2 V617F patients as well as 12 from healthy donors were analysed. DNA samples extracted from whole peripheral blood were hybridised to the 'HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip.' RESULTS: All groups showed a very homogeneous methylation pattern. Only the ZNF577 gene showed a differential methylation profile between PV JAK2 V617F positive and controls. This aberrant methylation was correlated with a differential gene expression of ZNF577. No aberrant hypermethylation was found in the SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 genes.

Both standard chemotherapy regimens and mAbs directed against ATLL tumor markers do not alter this aggressive clinical course. Therapeutic development would be facilitated by the discovery of genes and pathways that drive or initiate ATLL, but so far amenable drug targets have not been forthcoming. Because the IL-2 signaling pathway plays a prominent role in ATLL pathogenesis, mutational analysis of pathway components should yield interesting results. In this study, we focused on JAK3, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that signals from the IL-2R, where activating mutations have been found in diverse neoplasms. We screened 36 ATLL patients and 24 ethnically matched controls and found 4 patients with mutations in JAK3. These somatic, missense mutations occurred in the N-terminal FERM (founding members: band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain and induced gain of function in JAK3. Importantly, we show that these mutant JAK3s are inhibited with a specific kinase inhibitor already in human clinical testing.

Inhibitors of Bcr-abl such as imatinib mesylate have replaced the cytokine IFNalpha as the primary treatment for the management of patients with this malignancy. We found that pretreatment of CML cells with imatinib mesylate augments the antigrowth effects of IFNalpha. Furthermore, introduction of Bcr-abl into non-CML cells inhibits the cellular responses to IFNalpha. This inhibition is mediated via a mechanism that involves activation of protein kinase D2. The latter promotes an accelerated phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the interferon-alpha/beta receptor 1 chain of the type I interferon receptor, leading to attenuation of IFNalpha signaling. We discuss the relationship between Bcr-abl activity and IFNalpha signaling as a molecular basis of the combination of inhibitors of Bcr-abl and IFNalpha for CML treatment.",,"['Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi', 'Zheng, Hui', 'Tzimas, Christos', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Baker, Darren P', 'Fuchs, Serge Y']","['Bhattacharya S', 'Zheng H', 'Tzimas C', 'Carroll M', 'Baker DP', 'Fuchs SY']","['Department of Animal Biology and Mari Lowe Center for Comparative Oncology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110805,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (IFNAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase D2)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase D2', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', '*Signal Transduction']",2011/08/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/09 06:00'],"['2011/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41061-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-325373 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Oct 13;118(15):4179-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-325373.

Indeed, SHP-1 expression is significantly lower in resistant than in sensitive cell line, in which coimmunoprecipitation analysis shows the interaction between SHP-1 and a second tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, a positive regulator of RAS/MAPK pathway. In KCL22-R SHP-1 ectopic expression restores both SHP-1/SHP-2 interaction and IMA responsiveness; it also decreases SHP-2 activity after IMA treatment. Consistently, SHP-2 knocking-down in KCL22-R reduces either STAT3 activation or cell viability after IMA exposure. Therefore, our data suggest that SHP-1 plays an important role in BCR-ABL-independent IMA resistance modulating the activation signals that SHP-2 receives from both BCR/ABL and membrane receptor tyrosine kinases. The role of SHP-1 as a determinant of IMA sensitivity has been further confirmed in 60 consecutive untreated patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, whose SHP-1 mRNA levels were significantly lower in case of IMA treatment failure (P < .0001).

ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic that targets Bcl-2, which is overexpressed in MCL and implicated in drug resistance. The present work investigated the antitumor effect of ABT-737. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Six MCL cell lines and primary MCL cells (n = 13) were used. Sensitivity to ABT-737 was assessed, and expression levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were analyzed. Finally, ABT-737 was combined with other cytotoxic agents to promote tailored therapy. RESULTS: MINO and GRANTA-519 cell lines were highly sensitive to ABT-737 [the median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) = 20 and 80 nmol/L, respectively], whereas other cell lines were resistant. In primary MCL cells, 46% of patients' samples were sensitive to ABT-737. The analysis of protein expression levels revealed that both sensitive cell lines and primary MCL cells could be characterized by a Bcl-2(high)/Mcl-1(low) profile, whereas resistant MCL cells contained high levels of Mcl-1. ABT-737 induced a rapid disruption of both Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-2/Bik complexes. In addition, silencing of Mcl-1 by siRNA sensitized MCL cell lines to ABT-737. Similarly, flavopiridol, which induces Mcl-1 downregulation, in combination with ABT-737 led to a synergistic anti-MCL effect in ABT-737-resistant cell lines. This synergy was also observed when ABT-737 was combined with either bortezomib or cytarabine. CONCLUSIONS: The present work shows that ABT-737 induces strong apoptosis in MCL cells expressing a Bcl-2(high)/Mcl-1(low) profile. In ABT-737-resistant MCL cells, downregulation of Mcl-1 overcomes Mcl-1-induced resistance and synergizes ABT-737 effects. Our results strongly support the use of ABT-737 according to the Bcl-2/Mcl-1 tumor cell profiles in the treatment of MCL.",['(c)2011 AACR.'],"['Touzeau, Cyrille', 'Dousset, Christelle', 'Bodet, Linda', 'Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Bonnaud, Stephanie', 'Moreau, Anne', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, Catherine', 'Amiot, Martine', 'Le Gouill, Steven']","['Touzeau C', 'Dousset C', 'Bodet L', 'Gomez-Bougie P', 'Bonnaud S', 'Moreau A', 'Moreau P', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Amiot M', 'Le Gouill S']","['INSERM UMR 892, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110805,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2011/08/09 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/08/09 06:00'],"['2011/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0955 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0955 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Sep 15;17(18):5973-81. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0955.

We investigated a glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta/galectin-3-regulated mechanism used by leukemia cells to escape from apoptotic stimuli. Galectin-3 expression was time- and transcription-dependently deregulated in K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells stimulated for apoptosis by cisplatin (a platinum-based chemotherapy drug), sphingolipid ceramide analog C(2)-ceramide, and LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor). Notably, galectin-3 was upregulated in survival cells. Forced galectin-3 expression caused resistance to apoptosis, whereas knockdown galectin-3 expression increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Sub-cellular distribution of inducible galectin-3 was mitochondria-specific. Apoptotic stimuli decreased pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein expression (especially Mcl-1), whereas galectin-3 overexpression reversed but it was enhanced by a galectin-3 expression knockdown. Under apoptotic stimulation, GSK-3beta was activated after Akt was inactivated and GSK-3beta was inhibited-either pharmacologically or using short hairpin RNA to abolish galectin-3, increase apoptosis, and inhibit colony formation-which suggests a pro-survival role for GSK-3beta. We found that GSK-3beta upregulated galectin-3 and stabilized anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which is important for the escape of leukemia cells from apoptotic stimuli.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

CaP has been associated with other common malignancies. Recently, numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with CaP susceptibility. METHODS: We genotyped 1121 patients with CaP for 36 risk alleles known to be significantly associated with CaP susceptibility and determined their relationships to other malignancies in CaP probands and their first-degree relatives. RESULTS: The most common other malignancies in the CaP probands were nonmelanoma skin cancer (13.6%), leukemia (7.3%), melanoma (3.9%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (0.7%), colorectal cancer (0.6%), and multiple myeloma (0.3%). Among the probands, a significantly increased frequency of leukemia was found in the carriers of SNP rs2736098 (5p15, P = .03) and melanoma in the carriers of either SNP rs1512268 (8p21, P = .006) or SNP rs5759167 (22q13, P = .02). Multiple myeloma was more common in carriers of SNP rs9364554 (6q25, P = .02). The probands who were carriers of SNP rs16901979 (8q24) were significantly more likely to report a family history of melanoma (P = .03), and the probands with a family history of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's disease were significantly more likely to be carriers of SNP rs12621278 (2q31, P = .04) and rs6465657 (7q21, P = .02), respectively.

However, the frequencies of HLA class I (A, B) and class II (DRB1) alleles and haplotypes has not already been determined in Turkish patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: We investigated the relation of the HLA alleles and haplotypes in 237 adult acute leukemia patients [103 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 134 acute myeloid leukemia, (AML)] and 360 unrelated normal subjects by PCR-SSOP method using Luminex technology. RESULTS: Allele frequencies of HLA-A*03, and B*51 were higher in patients with AML compared with the controls (p = 0.019, and p = 0.001; respectively). Furthermore, HLA-A*11 and DRB1*01 allele frequencies were determined to be higher in patients with ALL (p = 0.01, p = 0.001; respectively), whereas DRB1*13 allele frequencies lower than controls (p = 0.003). The most observed haplotypes A*03 B*51 DRB1*11 (3.73 vs. 0%) in patients with AML; A*02 B*35 DRB1*01 (2.91 vs. 0%) and A*02 B*51 DRB1*11 (2.91 vs. 1.96%) in patients with ALL were determined. On the contrary, the most observed haplotype was A*02 B*35 DRB1*13 (2.19%) in the controls. We found A*02 B*39 DRB1*16 haplotype negatively associated with AML, whereas A*02 B*35 DRB1*13 was in ALL (p = 0.015, and p = 0.017; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HLA-A*03 and B*51 alleles may play a presumptive predisposing factor in AML. In addition, HLA-A*11 and DRB*01 alleles have been found to be associated with ALL, whereas DRB1*13 allele was determined to be negatively associated.",['Copyright (c) 2011 IMSS.

We found that triptolide, in nanomolar concentrations, suppressed both constitutive and inducible NF-kappaB activation, but did not directly inhibit binding of p65 to the DNA. The diterpene did block TNF-induced ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and degradation of IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB and inhibited acetylation of p65 through suppression of binding of p65 to CBP/p300. Triptolide also inhibited the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) that activates NF-kappaB and phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276, 536. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB reporter activity induced by TNF-TNFR1-TRADD-TRAF2-NIK-TAK1-IKKbeta was abolished by the triepoxide. Triptolide also abrogated TNF-induced expression of cell survival proteins (XIAP, Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2, survivin, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2), cell proliferative proteins (cyclin D1, c-myc and cyclooxygenase-2), and metastasis proteins (ICAM-1 and MMP-9). This led to enhancement of apoptosis induced by TNF, taxol, and thalidomide by the diterpene and to suppression of tumor invasion.

Approximately one third of all patients with AML carry an activating mutation in FLT3 that drives proliferation and survival of the leukemic cells. The most common activating mutation is the so-called internal tandem duplication (ITD), which involves an in-frame duplication of a segment of varying length in the region of the FLT3 gene that encodes the juxtamembrane domain. The pathways downstream of FLT3-ITD are partially known but further knowledge regarding the downstream signal transduction molecules is important in order to develop alternative strategies for pharmacological intervention. In this paper we have studied the role of MEK/ERK5 in FLT3-ITD mediated transformation. We have found that both wild-type FLT3 and FLT3-ITD activate MEK5 leading to the activation of ERK5. By use of the selective inhibitor of MEK5, BIX02188, we have shown that activation of AKT downstream of FLT3 is partially dependent on ERK5. Furthermore, inhibition of MEK5/ERK5 induces apoptosis of both FLT3-ITD transfected Ba/F3 cells as well as the FLT3-ITD carrying leukemic cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13. These results suggest that MEK5/ERK5 is important for FLT3-ITD induced hematopoietic transformation and may thus represent an alternative therapeutic target in the treatment of FLT3-ITD positive leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

There was no correlation between in vitro suppression by MSCs in mixed lymphocyte cultures and outcome. Soluble IL-2 receptors were measured in blood before and after MSC infusion and declined significantly during the first week after MSC infusion (P = .03). Levels of interleukin-6 and HLA-G were unaffected. Infectious complications occurred several years after recovery from aGVHD. Cytomegalovirus viral load was high, and cytomegalovirus disease was common. Among patients recovering from aGVHD, 54% died of late infections, between 4 months and 2 years after MSC treatment. No increase in leukemia relapse or graft rejection was found. Children had a better survival rate than adults (P = .005). In GVHD patients, 1-year survival was 75% in patients who received early-passage MSCs (from passages 1-2) in contrast to 21% using later passage MSCs (from passages 3-4) (P < .01).

T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta CDR3 repertoire diversity was analyzed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and BCR-ABL(+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) by GeneScan. A high frequency of oligoclonal expansion of the TCR Vbeta21 subfamily was observed in the peripheral blood of CML and B-ALL patients. These clonally expanded Vbeta21 T cells were correlated with the pathophysiologic process of CML. A conserved amino acid motif (SLxxV) was observed within the CDR3 region in only 3 patients with CML. Preferential usage of the Jbeta segments was also observed in a minority of patients. The 3-dimensional structures of the CDR3 region containing the same motif or using the same Jbeta segment displayed low similarity; on the contrary, the conformation of the CDR3 region containing no conserved motif in some T cell clones was highly similar. In conclusion, our findings indicate a high frequency of TCR Vbeta21 subfamily expansion in p210(BCR-ABL)-positive CML and B-ALL patients. The characterization of the CDR3 structure was complex. Regrettably, at this time it was not possible to confirm that the Vbeta21 T cell clones were derived from the stimulation of p210(BCR-ABL) protein.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Rescue treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and reinfusion of autologous 'back-up' stem cells failed, but transplantation of haploidentical donor stem cells following a fludarabine and antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-based conditioning regimen resulted in haematological reconstitution and long-term disease-free survival. The use of haploidentical donor stem cell transplantation as salvage therapy after engraftment failure in adult patients has not, to the authors' knowledge, been previously reported. Additionally, a review of the relevant literature is presented. This case report and literature review suggest that reinfusion of cryopreserved 'back-up' haematopoietic stem cells is a safe and effective salvage therapy for engraftment failure after allogeneic HSCT.

Because of their lack of immunity, SCID mice readily succumb to infectious pathogens and therefore must be maintained in an SPF, barrier-protected environment. Although SPF and barrier facilities prevent infection, SCID mice remain prone to premature death due in part to a high prevalence of spontaneous thymic lymphomas. However, little is known about spontaneous nonthymic tumors in SCID mice. We therefore analyzed the incidence of nonthymic tumor in our defined-flora C.B-17/Icr-SCID/Sed mice and examined their histopathologic characteristics. We necropsied 1060 retired SCID breeders (506 males, 554 females; average ages of 325 and 320 d, respectively) and found that 24 mice had developed nonthymic tumors, yielding an incidence of 2.26% (1.78% in males; 2.71% in females). The incidence of nonthymic tumors was substantially lower than that of thymic lymphomas in our retired SCID breeders (12.3% in males; 4.15% in females). Based on histopathology, 9 nonthymic tumors in male SCID mice consisted of 4 salivary gland myoepiteliomas, 2 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 3 cases of leukemia involving multiple organs. Female SCID mice had 15 nonthymic tumors consisting of 8 mammary adenocarcinomas, 4 salivary gland myoepitheliomas, and 1 case each of leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. In addition, we tested in vivo transplantability and characterized the growth behavior of several of these tumors.

Aberrant miRNA expression patterns have been found in various types of cancer. So far, information about the expression of miRNAs in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia is limited. PROCEDURE: We studied expression of miR-29a, -155, -196a, and -196b by stem-loop based RT-qPCR in 82 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients selected to represent relevant cytogenetic and molecular subgroups. RESULTS: High miR-196a and -b expression was observed in patients carrying MLL gene rearrangements (P < 0.001), NPM1 mutations (P < 0.001), or FLT3-ITD in a cytogenetically normal background (P </= 0.02), compared to all other patients. In contrast, CEBPA mutated cases had a low expression of miR-196a and -b (P </= 0.001). Expression of miR-196a and -b was correlated with expression of neighboring HOXA and HOXB genes (Spearman's r = 0.46-0.82, P < 0.01). Expression of miR-155 was not related to cytogenetic features but high expression of miR-155 was observed in FLT3-ITD (P = 0.001) and NPM1-mutated cases (P = 0.04). Lower miR-29a expression was mainly observed in MLL-rearranged pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, specifically in cases carrying t(10;11) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We show aberrant expression of specific miRNAs in clinically relevant cytogenetic and molecular subgroups of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting a role for these miRNAs in the underlying biology in these specific subgroups.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Danen-van Oorschot, Astrid A', 'Kuipers, Jenny E', 'Arentsen-Peters, Susan', 'Schotte, Diana', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Trka, Jan', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['Danen-van Oorschot AA', 'Kuipers JE', 'Arentsen-Peters S', 'Schotte D', 'de Haas V', 'Trka J', 'Baruchel A', 'Reinhardt D', 'Pieters R', 'Zwaan CM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110804,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (HOXB9 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN196 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2011/08/06 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/08/06 06:00'],"['2011/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23279 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 May;58(5):715-21. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23279.

Diabetes-induced anomalies of the face and heart are strongly correlated with neural crest cell (NCC) maldevelopment. We aimed to study glucose-induced alterations of mRNA levels in cranial and trunk NCCs isolated from rat embryos with increased risk of developing mandibular and cardiac malformations in diabetic pregnancy. METHODS: Inbred Sprague-Dawley rat embryos were used for NCC isolation from neural tube explants. The migrating cells were exposed to 5.5 or 30 mmol/l glucose concentration for 48 hr, harvested, and prepared for gene expression measurement by RT-PCR or immunostaining with either distal-less (Dlx) or AP-2-alpha antibodies. RESULTS: Evaluation of the immunostained slides showed that approximately 75% of the cells were of NCC origin. Exposure to 30 mM glucose decreased mRNA levels of Copper-Zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, extracellular superoxide dismutase, Catalase, Gpx-1, Nrf2, poly-ADP ribose polymerase, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma protein 2, and beta-Catenin genes in cranial neural crest explant cultures. In addition, Pax-3, Pax-6, Wnt3a, and Apc mRNA levels were decreased by high glucose exposure in both cranial and trunk neural crest explant cultures. CONCLUSION: Cranial NCCs diminish their mRNA levels of antioxidative enzymes and the Nrf2 response factor, as well as the antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma protein 2 gene, in response to increased ambient glucose concentration. Furthermore, both cranial and trunk NCC decrease the mRNA levels of the transcription factors Pax-3 and Pax-6, as well as key components of the Wnt pathway. These patterns of glucose-altered gene expression in a developmentally important cell population may be of etiological importance for NCC-associated malformations in diabetic pregnancy.","['(c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wentzel, Parri', 'Eriksson, Ulf J']","['Wentzel P', 'Eriksson UJ']","['Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Sweden. parri.wentzel@mcb.uu.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110804,United States,Birth Defects Res B Dev Reprod Toxicol,"Birth defects research.

Previous studies have demonstrated that pro-IL-16 can function as a regulator of cell cycle. A number of human T-cell leukemia and lymphoma cell lines are pro-IL-16 deficient. Intracellular expression of pro-IL-16 causes these cell lines to become quiescent, implicating loss of pro-IL-16 as a contributory step in T-cell malignancy. Therefore, we tested whether or not reintroduction of pro-IL-16 into solid tumors in mice could halt tumor growth. METHODS: MOLT-4 lymphoblastic leukemia cells were stably transfected with a dsRed-tomato virus and were injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID/gamma chain-knockout mice. Tumor growth was monitored with an in vivo imaging system. A pro-IL-16-GFP fusion virus or control GFP only virus was injected into the tumors, and mice were monitored for 1 week. RESULTS: Injection of the pro-IL-16-containing lentivirus inhibited growth of established MOLT-4 tumors in mice. Tumor explants exhibited diminished proliferative capacity.

However, while classical, NAD(+)-independent HDACs are an established therapeutic target, the relevance of NAD(+)-dependent HDACs (sirtuins) in leukemia treatment remains unclear. Here, we assessed the antileukemic activity of sirtuin inhibitors and of the NAD(+)-lowering drug FK866, alone and in combination with traditional HDAC inhibitors. Primary leukemia cells, leukemia cell lines, healthy leukocytes and hematopoietic progenitors were treated with sirtuin inhibitors (sirtinol, cambinol, EX527) and with FK866, with or without addition of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid, sodium butyrate, and vorinostat. Cell death was quantified by propidium iodide cell staining and subsequent flow-cytometry. Apoptosis induction was monitored by cell staining with FITC-Annexin-V/propidium iodide or with TMRE followed by flow-cytometric analysis, and by measuring caspase3/7 activity. Intracellular Bax was detected by flow-cytometry and western blotting. Cellular NAD(+) levels were measured by enzymatic cycling assays. Bax was overexpressed by retroviral transduction. Bax and SIRT1 were silenced by RNA-interference. Sirtuin inhibitors and FK866 synergistically enhanced HDAC inhibitor activity in leukemia cells, but not in healthy leukocytes and hematopoietic progenitors. In leukemia cells, HDAC inhibitors were found to induce upregulation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family-member whose translocation to mitochondria is normally prevented by SIRT1. As a result, leukemia cells become sensitized to sirtuin inhibitor-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, NAD(+)-independent HDACs and sirtuins cooperate in leukemia cells to avoid apoptosis.

We have previously shown that IRF4, together with IRF8, orchestrates pre-B cell development by limiting pre-B cell expansion and by promoting pre-B cell differentiation. Here, we report that IRF4 suppresses c-Myc induced leukemia in EmuMyc mice. Our results show that c-Myc induced leukemia was greatly accelerated in the IRF4 heterozygous mice (IRF4(+/-)Myc); the average age of mortality in the IRF4(+/-)Myc mice was only 7 to 8 weeks but was 20 weeks in the control mice. Our results show that IRF4(+/-)Myc leukemic cells were derived from large pre-B cells and were hyperproliferative and resistant to apoptosis. Further analysis revealed that the majority of IRF4(+/-)Myc leukemic cells inactivated the wild-type IRF4 allele and contained defects in Arf-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. p27(kip) is part of the molecular circuitry that controls pre-B cell expansion. Our results show that expression of p27(kip) was lost in the IRF4(+/-)Myc leukemic cells and reconstitution of IRF4 expression in those cells induced p27(kip) and inhibited their expansion.

Studies of CTCL cell lines have previously suggested that aberrant activation of STAT3 is mediated via silencing of the negative regulator SHP-1 by promoter methylation. In this study of ex vivo tumour cell populations from 18 Sezary syndrome (SS) patients, constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3, JAK1 and JAK2 was present in all patients, but was absent in comparative CD4+ T-cells from healthy controls. Furthermore, no loss or significant difference in SHP-1 expression was observed between patients and healthy control samples. Methylation-specific PCR analysis of the SHP-1 CpG island in 47 SS patients and 11 healthy controls did not detect any evidence of methylation. Moreover, small interfering RNA knockdown of SHP-1 had no effect on phosphorylation of STAT3. In contrast, treatment of SS tumour cells with the pan-JAK inhibitor pyridone 6 led to downregulation of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), its target genes and induction of apoptosis. No evidence for common JAK1/JAK2-activating mutations was found. These data demonstrate that constitutive activation of STAT3 in SS is not due to the loss of SHP-1, but is mediated by constitutive aberrant activation of JAK family members.",,"['McKenzie, R C T', 'Jones, C L', 'Tosi, I', 'Caesar, J A', 'Whittaker, S J', 'Mitchell, T J']","['McKenzie RC', 'Jones CL', 'Tosi I', 'Caesar JA', 'Whittaker SJ', 'Mitchell TJ']","[""Skin Tumour Unit, St John's Institute of Dermatology, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110805,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Sezary Syndrome/*metabolism']",2011/08/06 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/08/06 06:00'],"['2011/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011198 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.198 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Feb;26(2):323-31. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.198.

METHODS: Monoclonal antibody 7G3 was modified with 13-mer peptides [CGYGPKKKRKVGG] harboring the NLS of SV-40 large T-antigen and with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for labeling with (111)In. Immunoreactivity was evaluated in a competition radioligand binding assay and by flow cytometry. Nuclear localization of (111)In-NLS-7G3 was studied by cell fractionation in CD123(+)/CD131(-) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)-3, -4, and -5 cells or in primary AML or normal leukocytes. Micro-SPECT was performed in nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice engrafted subcutaneously with Raji-CD123 tumors or with disseminated AML-3 or -5 cells. The cytotoxicity of (111)In-NLS-7G3 on AML-5 cells was studied after 7 d in culture by trypan blue dye exclusion. DNA damage was assessed using the gamma-H2AX assay. RESULTS: NLS-7G3 exhibited preserved CD123 immunoreactivity (affinity, 4.6 nmol/L). Nuclear importation of (111)In-NLS-7G3 in AML-3, -4, or -5 cells was specific and significantly higher than unmodified (111)In-7G3 and was greater in primary AML cells than in normal leukocytes. Rapid elimination of (111)In-NLS-7G3 in NOD/SCID mice prevented imaging of subcutaneous Raji-CD123 tumors. This phenomenon was Fc-dependent and IgG(2a) isotype-specific and was overcome by the preadministration of excess IgG(2a) or using (111)In-NLS-7G3 F(ab')(2) fragments. AML-3 and -5 cells were engrafted into the bone marrow or spleen or at extramedullary sites in NOD/SCID mice. Micro-SPECT/CT with (111)In-NLS-7G3 F(ab')(2) showed splenic involvement, whereas foci of disease were seen in the spine or femur or at extramedullary sites in the brain and lymph nodes using (111)In-NLS-7G3 IgG(2a). The viability of AML-5 cells was reduced by exposure in vitro to (111)In-NLS-7G3; this reduction was associated with an increase in unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks. CONCLUSION: (111)In-NLS-7G3 is a promising novel Auger electron-emitting radioimmunotherapeutic agent for AML aimed at the leukemia stem cell population.

The supernatant of HTLV-I-infected Tax(+) MT-2 and C5/MJ cells induced ICAM-1 expression on A549 cells, a human tumour cell line with the properties of alveolar epithelial cells. Neutralization of ICAM-1 partially inhibited HTLV-I-infected T-cell adhesion to A549 cells. Analysis of the ICAM-1 promoter showed that the nuclear factor-kappa B-binding site was important for supernatant-induced ICAM-1 expression. Induction of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha (IL-1alpha) expression in MT-2 and C5/MJ cells was observed compared with uninfected controls and HTLV-I-infected Tax-negative cell lines. The significance of IL-1alpha as a soluble messenger was supported by blocking the biological activities of MT-2 supernatant with an IL-1alpha-neutralizing mAb. Moreover, Tax and IL-1alpha expression was demonstrated in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells of patients with HTLV-I-related pulmonary disease. Immunohistochemistry confirmed ICAM-1 and IL-1alpha expression in lung epithelial cells and lymphocytes of patients with HTLV-I-related pulmonary diseases, and in a transgenic mouse model of Tax expression.

We observed miR-17~92 genomic amplifications in murine retinoblastoma and high expression of miR-17~92 in human retinoblastoma. While miR-17~92 was dispensable for mouse retinal development, miR-17~92 overexpression, together with deletion of Rb and p107, led to rapid emergence of retinoblastoma with frequent metastasis to the brain. miR-17~92 oncogenic function in retinoblastoma was not mediated by a miR-19/PTEN axis toward apoptosis suppression, as found in lymphoma/leukemia models. Instead, miR-17~92 increased the proliferative capacity of Rb/p107-deficient retinal cells. We found that deletion of Rb family members led to compensatory up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. miR-17~92 overexpression counteracted p21Cip1 up-regulation, promoted proliferation, and drove retinoblastoma formation.

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics for this disease. Cellular senescence is an important tumor suppression mechanism that has recently been suggested as a novel mechanism to target for developing cancer therapeutics. Wnt5a is a noncanonical Wnt ligand that plays a context-dependent role in human cancers. Here, we investigate the role of Wnt5a in regulating senescence of EOC cells. We show that Wnt5a is expressed at significantly lower levels in human EOC cell lines and in primary human EOCs (n = 130) compared with either normal ovarian surface epithelium (n = 31; P = 0.039) or fallopian tube epithelium (n = 28; P < 0.001). Notably, a lower level of Wnt5a expression correlates with tumor stage (P = 0.003) and predicts shorter overall survival in EOC patients (P = 0.003). Significantly, restoration of Wnt5a expression inhibits the proliferation of human EOC cells both in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic EOC mouse model. Mechanistically, Wnt5a antagonizes canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and induces cellular senescence by activating the histone repressor A/promyelocytic leukemia senescence pathway. In summary, we show that loss of Wnt5a predicts poor outcome in EOC patients and Wnt5a suppresses the growth of EOC cells by triggering cellular senescence. We suggest that strategies to drive senescence in EOC cells by reconstituting Wnt5a signaling may offer an effective new strategy for EOC therapy.",,"['Bitler, Benjamin G', 'Nicodemus, Jasmine P', 'Li, Hua', 'Cai, Qi', 'Wu, Hong', 'Hua, Xiang', 'Li, Tianyu', 'Birrer, Michael J', 'Godwin, Andrew K', 'Cairns, Paul', 'Zhang, Rugang']","['Bitler BG', 'Nicodemus JP', 'Li H', 'Cai Q', 'Wu H', 'Hua X', 'Li T', 'Birrer MJ', 'Godwin AK', 'Cairns P', 'Zhang R']","[""Women's Cancer Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20110804,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'Fallopian Tubes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/metabolism/pathology', '*Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt-5a Protein']",2011/08/06 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/08/06 06:00'],"['2011/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-1341 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1341 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Oct 1;71(19):6184-94. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1341.

We hypothesized that one or more microRNAs (miRNA) known to control mouse hematopoiesis and lineage commitment might contribute to the ability of 1,25D to control the malignant phenotype. Here we report that 1,25D markedly induces expression of miR-32 in human myeloid leukemia cells, in which it targets the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the proapoptotic factor Bim to reduce its expression. RNAi-mediated suppression of the miRNA-processing enzymes Drosha and Dicer increased Bim levels, in support of the concept that Bim is under miRNA control in AML cells. Antisense-mediated suppression of miR-32 was sufficient to upregulate Bim expression in AML cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of miR-32 downregulated Bim expression and increased the differentiation response to 1,25D treatment in a manner that was associated with increased cell survival. The positive effects of miR-32 on cell survival were confirmed by evidence of increased cell death in AML cells preexposed to antisense miR-32 before treatment with arabinocytosine, a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat human AML. Together, our findings indicate that miR-32 blockade is sufficient to elevate Bim expression and sensitize AML cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.

In the present study, we explored the global gene expression profiles of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-regulated transcription factors Ets (E-twenty-six) variant gene 5 (Etv5); B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 6, member B (Bcl6b); and POU domain, class-3 transcription factor 1 (Pou3f1). We reasoned that these three factors may function as a core set of transcription factors, regulating genes responsible for maintaining the SSC population. Using transient siRNA oligonucleotides to individually target Etv5, Bcl6b, and Pou3f1 within mouse SSC cultures, we examined changes to the global gene expression profiles associated with these transcription factors. Only modest overlaps in the target genes regulated by the three factors were noted, but ETV5 was found to be a critical downstream regulator of GDNF signaling that mediated the expression of several known SSC self-renewal related genes, including Bcl6b and LIM homeobox 1 (Lhx1). Notably, ETV5 was identified as a regulator of Brachyury (T) and CXC chemokine receptor, type 4 (Cxcr4), and we showed that ETV5 binding to the Brachyury (T) gene promoter region is associated with an active state of transcription. Moreover, in vivo transplantation of SSCs following silencing of Brachyury (T) significantly reduced the number of donor cell-derived colonies formed within recipient mouse testes.

Recombinatorial and mutational patterns in the clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have revealed 2 major IgMD-expressing subsets and an isotype-switched variant, each developing from distinct B-cell populations. Tracking of conserved stereotypic features of Ig variable regions characteristic of U-CLL indicate circulating naive B cells as the likely cells of origin. In CLL, engagement of the BCR by antigen occurs in vivo, leading to down-regulated expression and to an unanticipated modulation of glycosylation of surface IgM, visible in blood cells, especially in U-CLL. Modulated glycoforms of sIgM are signal competent and could bind to environmental lectins. U-CLL cases express more sIgM and have increased signal competence, linking differential signaling responses to clinical behavior. Mapping of BCR signaling pathways identifies targets for blockade, aimed to deprive CLL cells of survival and proliferative signals. New inhibitors of BCR signaling appear to have clinical activity.

In this study we examine changes in T-lymphocyte CD39 and CD73 expression in patients with CLL. METHODS: Blood samples were drawn from 34 patients with CLL and 31 controls. The cells were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD39, and CD73 and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Overall, patients with CLL had a higher percentage of CD39(+) T lymphocytes than did controls. The percentage of cells expressing CD39 was higher in both CD4(+) cells and CD8(+) cells. Higher CD3/CD39 expression was associated with a later disease stage. No correlations between T-lymphocyte CD39 levels and CD38 or Zap-70 expression were observed. In contrast, the percentage of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes that expressed CD73 was decreased in patients with CLL. Average B-lymphocyte CD73 expression was decreased in CLL because the majority of CLL clones were CD73. However a minority of CLL clones were CD73(+), and patients with CD73(+) clones tended to have earlier stage disease. CONCLUSION: T-lymphocyte CD39 and CD73 expression may be useful prognostic markers in patients with CLL. Expression of CD73 on the malignant cell population in CLL may be a marker of better prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2011.

Mutations of FLT3 have been reported in about a third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and inhibitors of FLT3 are of clinical interest. Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor with potent activity against FLT3 and the Raf/ERK/MEK kinase pathway. METHODS: We studied the patterns of molecular response and relapse in 18 patients with mutated FLT3 treated with the combination of sorafenib, idarubicin, and cytarabine. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 9 months. Sixteen patients achieved complete remission (CR), and the other 2 patients achieved CR but lacked platelet recovery for an overall response rate of 100%. Ten patients had their FLT3-mutated clone eradicated, with 6 patients who showed some residual FLT3-mutated cells, and 2 patients who showed persistent FLT3-mutated cells. The elimination of FLT3-mutated population at the time of morphologic CR, however, was not predictive of relapse. After a median follow-up of 9 months (range, 1-16 months), 10 (55%) patients had relapsed, with a median CR duration of 8.8 months (range, 1-9.5 months). By DNA sequencing, there was no evidence of an acquired FLT3 point mutation at the time of relapse in 7 patients tested, which suggested the presence of other mechanisms of sorafenib resistance.

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that is currently approved for use in multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle-cell lymphoma. It induces apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells in vitro, but the activity of bortezomib in patients with imatinib-resistant CML is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a pilot trial to evaluate the activity of single-agent bortezomib in CML. Seven patients with imatinib-refractory CML were treated with bortezomib at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks. RESULTS: The median number of cycles received was 2. No patient had a hematologic or cytogenetic response. Three patients had a temporary decrease in basophil counts associated with therapy with bortezomib. Six patients experienced grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities. CONCLUSION: Bortezomib had minimal efficacy and considerable toxicity in patients with imatinib-refractory CML.

Identification of valuable factors that can facilitate therapeutic decision-making between intensive chemotherapy and investigational treatment strategies is warranted. METHODS: Analysis of proliferative (white blood cell [WBC] count) and invasive (percentage of blast cells in peripheral blood) characteristics of leukemic blasts at diagnosis is presented in a population of 432 promyelocytic leukemia AML patients who are older than than 60 years and have been selected for entering onto five successive clinical trials combining an anthracycline and cytarabine. RESULTS: Five groups of patients were defined according to these two relevant parameters used in clinical practice. Response rates were lower for the hyperproliferative groups (47% and 46%, respectively) and the nonproliferative groups displaying circulating blasts (56% and 59%, respectively) compared with those for the nonproliferative and noninvasive group (77%) (P = .0003). Median overall survivals were shorter for the hyperproliferative groups (5.7 and 5.8 months, respectively) compared with those observed for the nonproliferative groups (8.9 and12.6 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This combination of basic characteristics helps estimate the outcome of elderly AML patients who are usually selected for intensive chemotherapy. Although these factors remain valuable for identifying leukemia behavior, our study demonstrated that results of intensive chemotherapy in elderly patients remained poor, whatever the prognostic group. Comparison with recent data from the literature requires investigators to study results differently and to consider investigational therapy as being the most appropriate treatment even for this highly selected population.",['Copyright (c) 2011.

In this report we tested the ability of MCP to induce the activation of human blood lymphocyte subsets like T, B and NK-cells. METHODS: MCP treated human blood samples were incubated with specific antibody combinations and analyzed in a flow cytometer using a 3-color protocol. To test functionality of the activated NK-cells, isolated normal lymphocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of MCP. Log-phase PKH26-labeled K562 leukemic cells were added to the lymphocytes and incubated for 4 h. The mixture was stained with FITC-labeled active form of caspase 3 antibody and analyzed by a 2-color flow cytometry protocol. The percentage of K562 cells positive for PKH26 and FITC were calculated as the dead cells induced by NK-cells. Monosaccharide analysis of the MCP was performed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulse amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). RESULTS: MCP activated T-cytotoxic cells and B-cell in a dose-dependent manner, and induced significant dose-dependent activation of NK-cells. MCP-activated NK-cells demonstrated functionality in inducing cancer cell death. MCP consisted of oligogalacturonic acids with some containing 4,5-unsaturated non-reducing ends. CONCLUSIONS: MCP has immunostimulatory properties in human blood samples, including the activation of functional NK cells against K562 leukemic cells in culture.

As a transmembrane receptor that is ultimately converted into a transcription factor, NOTCH1 directly activates a spectrum of target genes, which function to mediate NOTCH1 signaling in normal or transformed T cells. During physiologic T-cell development, NOTCH1 has important functions in cell fate determination, proliferation, survival and metabolism. Activating NOTCH1 mutations occur in more than half of human patients with T-ALL, suggesting an important role for aberrant NOTCH1 signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease. Inhibiting NOTCH1 signaling in patient-derived cell lines and murine T-ALLs leads to growth arrest and/or apoptosis suggesting that NOTCH1 inhibitors can improve T-ALL treatment. However, there are challenges to translate NOTCH1 inhibitors to the clinic because of toxicity and resistance.

Accordingly, JL1 is expressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and can be used both for specific diagnosis and as a target for treatment. However, expression of JL1 by lymphomas has not been thoroughly assessed. Burkitt lymphoma is a potentially curable aggressive lymphoma, but prognostic markers that stratify risk have not been established. We therefore assayed JL1 expression in Burkitt lymphoma patients to assess its value as a prognostic marker for this disease. Tissue microarray blocks of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients with Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas, at the Asan Medical Center and Seoul National University Hospital from January 1998 to December 2008 were immunohistochemically assayed using a mouse monoclonal antibody against JL1. We found that 30.2% of Burkitt lymphoma samples, but no other lymphoma samples, were positive for JL1. JL-1 expression was significantly correlated with patient survival (P = 0.022), but not with other clinical manifestations of the disease, with 91.6% of JL1-positive patients achieving complete remission in response to chemotherapy and 6.25% experiencing disease recurrence. JL1 positivity was significantly correlated with prolonged overall survival by both Kaplan-Meier survival (P = 0.035) and Cox proportional hazard model (P = 0.043) analysis.

Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.",,"['Zuber, Johannes', 'Shi, Junwei', 'Wang, Eric', 'Rappaport, Amy R', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Sison, Edward A', 'Magoon, Daniel', 'Qi, Jun', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Taylor, Meredith J', 'Johns, Christopher', 'Chicas, Agustin', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Valent, Peter', 'Bradner, James E', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Vakoc, Christopher R']","['Zuber J', 'Shi J', 'Wang E', 'Rappaport AR', 'Herrmann H', 'Sison EA', 'Magoon D', 'Qi J', 'Blatt K', 'Wunderlich M', 'Taylor MJ', 'Johns C', 'Chicas A', 'Mulloy JC', 'Kogan SC', 'Brown P', 'Valent P', 'Bradner JE', 'Lowe SW', 'Vakoc CR']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1 Bungtown Road, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110803,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Brd4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",2011/08/05 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/08/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10334 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10334 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2011 Aug 3;478(7370):524-8. doi: 10.1038/nature10334.,PMC3328300,['GEO/GSE29799'],"['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'K08 CA128972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['HHMIMS345676'],,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: HHMIMS345676'],

However, epitopes derived from Id that stimulate human CD8(+) T-cell immunity are incompletely characterized. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The clonal Ig V(L) of human myeloma cell line U266 and five primary B-cell tumors were sequenced, and peptides corresponding to the Ig V(L) region were tested for their ability to stimulate CTLs from 10 HLA-A*0201-positive normal donors. The CTLs thus generated were tested against peptide-pulsed T2 cells and autologous tumor cells. RESULTS: Fourteen peptides derived from Ig light chain (V(L)) of U266 and primary B-cell tumors were used to generate 68 CTLs lines that specifically produced IFN-gamma when cocultured with peptide-pulsed T2 cells. These CTLs lysed peptide-pulsed T2 cell as well as U266 or autologous tumor targets in an HLA class I-dependent manner. Sequence analysis revealed shared V(L) T-cell epitopes in U266 and primary B-cell tumors, not previously reported within Ig heavy chain (V(H)) sequences. CONCLUSION: This study thus identifies novel immunogenic CTLs epitopes from Id V(L), suggests that they are naturally presented on the surface of B-cell malignancies, and supports their inclusion in next-generation Id vaccines. The ability to prime T cells derived from normal HLA-matched donors, rather than patients, may also have direct application to current strategies, designed to generate allogeneic tumor-specific T cells for adoptive transfer.",,"['Weng, Jinsheng', 'Cha, Soung-Chul', 'Matsueda, Satoko', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Popescu, Michael S', 'Yi, Qing', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J', 'Wang, Michael', 'Neelapu, Sattva S', 'Kwak, Larry W']","['Weng J', 'Cha SC', 'Matsueda S', 'Alatrash G', 'Popescu MS', 'Yi Q', 'Molldrem JJ', 'Wang M', 'Neelapu SS', 'Kwak LW']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, and Center for Cancer Immunology Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110803,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Peptides/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors']",2011/08/05 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/08/05 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0970 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0970 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Sep 15;17(18):5945-52. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0970.

Using a mouse knockin model of Flt3-internal tandem duplication (Flt3-ITD)-induced myeloproliferation, we herein demonstrate that the enhanced myeloid phenotype and expansion of granulocyte-monocyte and primitive Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-Kit(+) progenitors in Flt3-ITD homozygous mice can in part be mediated through the loss of the second wild-type allele.

To determine their exact frequency, we screened > 1000 well-characterized pediatric and adult AML cases using a NUP98/NSD1-specific RT-PCR. Twenty-three cases harbored the NUP98/NSD1 fusion, representing 16.1% of pediatric and 2.3% of adult CN-AML patients.

NUP98/NSD1 was mutually exclusive with all recurrent type-II aberrations. Importantly, NUP98/NSD1 was an independent predictor for poor prognosis; 4-year event-free survival was < 10% for both pediatric and adult NUP98/NSD1-positive AML patients. NUP98/NSD1-positive AML showed a characteristic HOX-gene expression pattern, distinct from, for example, MLL-rearranged AML, and the fusion protein was aberrantly localized in nuclear aggregates, providing insight into the leukemogenic pathways of these AMLs.

To understand the molecular basis of these UCBT-related complications, the characteristics of UCB-derived antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells were examined in a group of pediatric UCBT recipients. Compared with the UCB graft inoculum and the late post-UCBT period (12-36 months), declining clonal diversity of UCB-derived CD8(+) T cells specific for the Melan-A(26-35) A27L peptide and high frequencies of PD-1-expressing CD8(+) T cells were observed in the first 3 months after UCBT, a period during which OIs are most frequent. The CD8(+) T-cell compartment predominantly comprised CD45RA(+) CCR7(-) terminally differentiated effector-memory T cells until 6 months after UCBT, at which time the polyfunctionality of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells was reestablished. Finally, the frequency of PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells was significantly higher in subjects who subsequently experienced leukemic relapse. This study informs the biologic properties of UCB-derived CD8(+) T cells and provides a rationale for the characteristics of UCBT in terms of immune reconstitution and OI.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the outcome of patients with PCL in the era of novel agents and innovative transplantation strategies, we conducted a review of patients with PCL who were treated at our institution from August 2003 to October 2009. Our primary endpoint was to determine overall survival, which was calculated from time of PCL diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Secondary endpoints included response rates and analyses regarding how the novel agents and presence of adverse cytogenetic analyses affected outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 25 patients with PCL (13 with primary PCL [pPCL], 12 with secondary PCL [sPCL]) from our institution. Eighteen patients received bortezomib-based regimens, 19 received high-dose melphalan followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), and 6 underwent allogeneic HCT. The median overall survival for all patients was 23.6 months. Bortezomib-treated patients had a median survival of 28.4 months vs. 4.0 months for the non-bortezomib-treated group (P < .001).

This article analyzes lay accounts of learning a cancer diagnosis drawing on ethnographic interviews among a purposive sample of 28 patients recently diagnosed with leukemia, myeloma, or lymphoma and 30 of their family caregivers. The participants, recruited at a large cancer center in the United States, were asked to describe ""the day"" they learned the diagnosis. Narrative analysis revealed that in almost every case, detailed descriptions of preliminary events - such as the pace and sequence of testing; smooth or disorganized transitions between care providers; and the timeliness or delays in diagnosis - were used to contextualize the actual episode of hearing the diagnosis and reacting to the news. This study finds that patients' and caregivers' experience of the medical system prior to hearing the news played an important role in the way the news was ultimately internalized.

By using a specific antagonist that binds the C-terminal RGG domain of nucleolin, the HB-19 pseudopeptide, we recently reported that targeting surface nucleolin with HB-19 suppresses progression of established human breast tumor cells in the athymic nude mice, and delays development of spontaneous melanoma in the RET transgenic mice. METHODS: By the capacity of HB-19 to bind stably surface nucleolin, we purified and identified nucleolin partners at the cell surface. HB-19 and related multivalent Nucant pseudopeptides, that present pentavalently or hexavalently the tripeptide Lyspsi(CH2N)-Pro-Arg, were then used to show that targeting surface nucleolin results in distinct inhibitory mechanisms on breast, prostate, colon carcinoma and leukemia cells. RESULTS: Surface nucleolin exists in a 500-kDa protein complex including several other proteins, which we identified by microsequencing as two Wnt related proteins, Ku86 autoantigen, signal recognition particle subunits SRP68/72, the receptor for complement component gC1q-R, and ribosomal proteins S4/S6. Interestingly, some of the surface-nucleolin associated proteins are implicated in cell signaling, tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion, cell death, autoimmunity, and bacterial infections. Surface nucleolin in the 500-kDa complex is highly stable. Surface nucleolin antagonists, HB-19 and related multivalent Nucant pseudopeptides, exert distinct inhibitory mechanisms depending on the malignant tumor cell type. For example, in epithelial tumor cells they inhibit cell adhesion or spreading and induce reversion of the malignant phenotype (BMC cancer 2010, 10:325) while in leukemia cells they trigger a rapid cell death associated with DNA fragmentation. The fact that these pseudopeptides do not cause cell death in epithelial tumor cells indicates that cell death in leukemia cells is triggered by a specific signaling mechanism, rather than nonspecific cellular injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that targeting surface nucleolin could change the organization of the 500-kDa complex to interfere with the proper functioning of surface nucleolin and the associated proteins, and thus lead to distinct inhibitory mechanisms. Consequently, HB-19 and related Nucant pseudopeptides provide novel therapeutic opportunities in treatment of a wide variety of cancers and related malignancies.",,"['Krust, Bernard', 'El Khoury, Diala', 'Nondier, Isabelle', 'Soundaramourty, Calaiselvy', 'Hovanessian, Ara G']","['Krust B', 'El Khoury D', 'Nondier I', 'Soundaramourty C', 'Hovanessian AG']","['CNRS-Universite Paris Descartes, Unite Regulation de la Transcription de Maladies Genetique, 45 rue des Saints Peres, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110803,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (HB-19 peptide)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (nucleolin)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/08/05 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/08/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-333 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-333 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Aug 3;11:333. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-333.,PMC3199867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have demonstrated the strong association between MRD and risk of relapse in childhood and adult ALL, irrespective of the methodology used. MRD is now used in clinical trials for risk assignment and to guide clinical management.

Lentiviral gene transfer strategies are widely used to genetically modify hESCs but limited transduction efficiencies in the presence of feeder or stroma cells present problems, particularly if vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped viral particles are applied. Here, we investigated whether the recently described semen derived enhancer of virus infection (SEVI) and alternative viral envelope proteins derived from either Gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GALV) or feline leukaemia virus (RD114) are applicable for transducing hESCs during co-culture with feeder or stroma cells. Our first set of experiments demonstrates that SEVI has no toxic effect on murine or hESCs and that exposure to SEVI does not interfere with the pluripotency-associated phenotype. Focusing on hESCs, we were able to further demonstrate that SEVI increases the transduction efficiencies of GALV and RD114 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. More importantly, aiming at targeted differentiation of hESCs into functional somatic cell types, GALV pseudotyped lentiviral particles could efficiently and exclusively transduce hESCs grown in co-culture with OP9-GFP stroma cells (which were often used to induce differentiation into haematopoietic derivatives).",,"['Wurm, Melanie', 'Gross, Benjamin', 'Sgodda, Malte', 'Standker, Ludger', 'Muller, Thomas', 'Forssmann, Wolf-Georg', 'Horn, Peter A', 'Blasczyk, Rainer', 'Cantz, Tobias']","['Wurm M', 'Gross B', 'Sgodda M', 'Standker L', 'Muller T', 'Forssmann WG', 'Horn PA', 'Blasczyk R', 'Cantz T']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110804,Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",2011/08/05 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/08/05 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/BC.2011.085 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 2011 Oct;392(10):887-95. doi: 10.1515/BC.2011.085.

This is in part due to poor understanding of CLL biology and thus inadequate targeting of therapy. For years CLL has been proposed as bi-compartmental: the quiescent tumor in the periphery and the proliferating cells within specific microenvironments. Historically the bone marrow was considered the major tissue of the CLL microenvironment. However, many recent innovative studies have categorically shown that peripheral CLL cells are derived from the lymph nodes (LN). Proliferation here is largely driven by helper T cells via CD40-CD40L engagement. Critically, in vitro studies have shown that such engagement additionally protects LN CLLs from apoptosis. Agents inducing apoptosis in non-CD40 engaged CLL cells are frequently ineffective against those continually engaged with CD40L. This emphasizes that, in order to improve responses and prevent relapse, novel therapies must be assessed against CD40L engaged CLL cells to show effective targeting against the LN. This review discusses the evidence supporting the superior involvement of the LN in CLL, how CD40L engaged CLL studies should be conducted, and the novel therapies studied in vitro and in vivo that have been proposed to be effective in this setting.",,"['Hayden, Rachel E', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Roberts, Claudia', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Bunce, Chris M']","['Hayden RE', 'Pratt G', 'Roberts C', 'Drayson MT', 'Bunce CM']","['School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110923,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",2011/08/05 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2011/08/05 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.610014 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Apr;53(4):537-49. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.610014.

Some cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with nucleophosmin (NPM) mutations have an immunophenotype that is similar to APL. The objective of the study is to compare antigenic expression in a group of APL patients with that in AML patients with NPM mutations and an APL-like immunophenotype (CD15- CD34- HLA-DR-). A consecutive series of 40 APL and 12 NPM patients with an APL-like phenotype were included in the study. Immunophenotypic patterns were investigated by multiparametric flow cytometry. Promyelocytic leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha transcript type, NPM and FLT3 mutations were investigated using conventional methods. Statistically significant differences were found between APL and NPM-mutated AML in CD33, CD13, CD2 and CD110 reactivity. CD2 expression was absent in every patient with NPM-mutated AML. In addition, mean fluorescence intensity and the coefficient of variation (cv) of CD33 and CD13 showed statistical differences between the two groups for CD33 (p = 0.007) and a trend to significance for CD13 (p = 0.05). Furthermore, among 45 evaluable patients, CD110 expression statistically differentiates between the two groups: [2/33 (6%) in the APL group and 8/12 (66.6%) in the NPM-mutated AML (p = 0.014)]. However, these traits were subtle, raising the possibility of practical diagnostic challenges. In conclusion, CD110 and CD33 reactivity may be useful to distinguish APL from NPM-mutated AML with CD15, CD34 and HLA-DR negativity. Nevertheless, cytogenetic and molecular characterization is necessary to establish the accurate diagnosis of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Ferrari, Angela', 'Bussaglia, Elena', 'Ubeda, Josep', 'Facchini, Luca', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F']","['Ferrari A', 'Bussaglia E', 'Ubeda J', 'Facchini L', 'Aventin A', 'Sierra J', 'Nomdedeu JF']","['Department of Laboratory of Hematology, Institute of Biomedical Research, IIB Sant Pau, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110803,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (FUT4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fucosyltransferases/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2011/08/04 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/08/04 06:00'],"['2011/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.1011 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Sep;30(3):109-14. doi: 10.1002/hon.1011.

The P2X7R can be activated by extracellular ATP and induces the influx of calcium, releases cytokines, and participates in cell proliferation and apoptosis. CD44 is an adhesion molecule. The effects of CD44 include cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion interactions, lymphocyte activation, and cell migration. Many studies have shown that P2X7R and CD44 play important roles in hematological malignancies, but no study exists regarding the relationship between P2X7R and CD44. In the present study, we characterized P388D1 cells for the surface expression of CD44 and analyzed ATP-induced shedding. The data showed that P388D1 cells express CD44. Incubation of P388D1 cells with ATP induced a rapid loss of CD44 from the P388D1 cell surface. In addition, using a receptor inhibitor and P2X7R short hairpin RNA, we showed that the loss of CD44 is mediated via the P2X7R. Finally, we demonstrated that activation of P2X7R by ATP induces CD44 shedding.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Lin, Changwei', 'Ren, Shuangyi', 'Zhang, Li', 'Jin, Hongfei', 'Sun, Jianguo', 'Zuo, Yunfei']","['Lin C', 'Ren S', 'Zhang L', 'Jin H', 'Sun J', 'Zuo Y']","['Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110803,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Cd44 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis/*physiology', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7/*physiology']",2011/08/04 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2011/08/04 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.1008 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Jun;30(2):70-5. doi: 10.1002/hon.1008.

One key mechanism in leukemogenesis is increased self renewal of leukemic stem cells via aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Either X-RAR, PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha or AML-1/ETO activate Wnt signaling by upregulating gamma-catenin and beta-catenin. In a prospective study, a lower risk of leukemia was observed with aspirin use, which is consistent with numerous studies reporting an inverse association of aspirin with other cancers. Furthermore, a reduction in leukemia risk was associated with use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), where the effects on AML risk was FAB subtype-specific. To better investigate whether NSAID treatment is effective, we used Sulindac Sulfide in X-RARalpha-positive progenitor cell models. Sulindac Sulfide (SSi) is a derivative of Sulindac, a NSAID known to inactivate Wnt signaling. We found that SSi downregulated both beta-catenin and gamma-catenin in X-RARalpha-expressing cells and reversed the leukemic phenotype by reducing stem cell capacity and increasing differentiation potential in X-RARalpha-positive HSCs. The data presented herein show that SSi inhibits the leukemic cell growth as well as hematopoietic progenitors cells (HPCs) expressing PML/RARalpha, and it indicates that Sulindac is a valid molecular therapeutic approach that should be further validated using in vivo leukemia models and in clinical settings.",,"['Steinert, Gunnar', 'Oancea, Claudia', 'Roos, Jessica', 'Hagemeyer, Heike', 'Maier, Thorsten', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Puccetti, Elena']","['Steinert G', 'Oancea C', 'Roos J', 'Hagemeyer H', 'Maier T', 'Ruthardt M', 'Puccetti E']","['Department of Hematology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110719,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (gamma Catenin)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', '6UVA8S2DEY (sulindac sulfide)', 'K619IIG2R9 (sulindac sulfone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulindac/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism', 'gamma Catenin/metabolism']",2011/08/04 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/04 06:00'],"['2010/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0022540 [doi]', '10-PONE-RA-20447 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e22540. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0022540.

Among these alterations have been mutations in genes, such as IDH1/2, TET2, DNMT3A, and EZH2, which appear to affect DNA and/or histone lysine methylation. Large clinical correlative studies are beginning to decipher the clinical importance, prevalence, and potential prognostic significance of these mutations. Additionally, burgeoning insight into the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies has prompted increased interest in development of novel therapies which target DNA and histone posttranslational modifications. DNA demethylating agents have been demonstrated to be clinically active in a subset of patients with MDS and AML and are used extensively. However, newer, more specific agents which alter DNA and histone modification are under preclinical study and development and are likely to expand our therapeutic options for these diseases in the near future. Here, we review the current understanding of the clinical importance of these newly discovered mutations in AML and MDS patients.

These models fail to recognise 5-15% of cases with unexpected complications, and literature specifically addressing apparently stable patients (ASPs) is scarce. METHODS: We reviewed 861 episodes of FN in outpatients with solid tumours, including 692 (80%) episodes with apparent clinical stability. We aimed to investigate the prognosis of this latter group and explore the possibility of stratifying it according to the presenting features. A case-control study was performed and the MASCC index was evaluated. RESULTS: The rates of complications and bacteraemia in ASPs were 7.3% and 6.2%, respectively. The MASCC index yielded a low sensitivity to detect complications (36%). Prognostic factors were identified: ECOG performance status >/=2, chronic bronchitis, chronic heart failure, stomatitis NCI grade >/=2, monocytes <200 mm(-3) and stress hyperglycaemia. CONCLUSION: A very simple assessment is useful to classify the patients with FN according to the risk of complications. A few additional variables may predict the clinical course of the patients.

Our previous study reported that SSEA1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-1) cells had the potential of HB-like structure formation in vitro cellular models. Here, we characterized primary proliferating tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and their neoplasmtic transformation. Neural stem cell marker SSEA1 and its lineage-related genes were demonstrated; no embryonic and mesenchymal stem cell markers were detected whereas their lineage-related genes in part were activated. Immunohistochemistry showed that the proliferating marker was preferentially expressed in SSEA1 cells. There was significant difference in the percentage of SSEA1 cells (SSEA1+/Ki67+ cells) between inherited and sporadic HBs although the tumor proliferative index (Ki67+ cells/ all cells) did not reach statistical significance between the two groups.

Elderly patients often present with cardiac comorbidity. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is active in elderly (>/= 60 years) patients with relapsed AML with low cardiac toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized phase II study compared a standard combination of ara-C and daunorubicin (DNR; 7+3) versus ara-C plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin (7+GO) as the first course of induction therapy. Primary objectives were comparison of blast clearance on day 16, event-free survival (EFS), and remission duration. OS, complete remission (CR), and tolerability were secondary objectives. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients with de novo AML, treatment-related AML, AML with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or high-risk MDS entered the study. Median age of 115 patients (intent-to-treat population) was 69 years. Protocol outlined a second course 7+3 for patients without blast clearance and two courses of high-dose ara-C consolidation upon CR. Both treatments were equally effective in blast clearance, CR, EFS, remission duration, or OS (median: 7+3, 9 months; 7+GO, 10 months). Induction death rate was higher in the GO group due to veno-occlusive disease.

We studied 821 adult patients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) who underwent HCT for AML in first or second complete remission between 1999 and 2004. We compared the ability of the 6 existing classifications to stratify patients by overall survival. We then defined a new scheme specifically applicable to patients undergoing HCT using this patient cohort. Under this scheme, inv(16) is favorable, a complex karyotype (4 or more abnormalities) is adverse, and all other classified abnormalities are intermediate in predicting survival after HCT (5-year overall survival, 64%, 18%, and 50%, respectively; P = .0001). This scheme stratifies patients into 3 groups with similar nonrelapse mortality, but significantly different incidences of relapse, overall and leukemia-free survival. It applies to patients regardless of disease status (first or second complete remission), donor type (matched related or unrelated), or conditioning intensity (myeloablative or reduced intensity).

Several miRNAs have been found to be inappropriately regulated by DNA methylation in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We analysed the methylation status of the three members of the MIR9 family (MIR9-1, MIR9-2 and MIR9-3) in a uniformly treated cohort of 200 newly diagnosed ALLs. MIR9 was methylated in 54% of the patients and was associated with downregulation of MIR9 (P < 0.01). Hypermethylation of MIR9 was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival, overall survival and event-free survival in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.01). Epigenetic downregulation of MIR9 induced upregulation of its targets, FGFR1 and CDK6, while treatment of ALL cells with FGFR1 (PD-173074) and CDK6 (PD-0332991) inhibitors induced a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis of ALL cells.

NUP98-HOXA9 perturbed zebrafish embryonic haematopoiesis, with upregulated spi1 expression at the expense of gata1a. Markers associated with more differentiated myeloid cells, lcp1, lyz, and mpx were also elevated, but to a lesser extent than spi1, suggesting differentiation of early myeloid progenitors may be impaired by NUP98-HOXA9. Following irradiation, NUP98-HOXA9-expressing embryos showed increased numbers of cells in G2-M transition compared to controls and absence of a normal apoptotic response, which may result from an upregulation of bcl2. These data suggest NUP98-HOXA9-induced oncogenesis may result from a combination of defects in haematopoiesis and an aberrant response to DNA damage. Importantly, 23% of adult NUP98-HOXA9-transgenic fish developed a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) at 19-23 months of age. In summary, we have identified an embryonic haematopoietic phenotype in a transgenic zebrafish line that subsequently develops MPN.

Results of recent Phase III trials have led to its withdrawal in the USA although a beneficial effect of GO in genetically defined AML subgroups was evident. AREAS COVERED: This review examines the use of GO as a single agent or in combination with intensive chemotherapy in non-acute promyelocytic AML. The literature search was based on publications on GO indexed in the PubMed electronic database and selected meeting abstracts. GO has shown moderate activity as a single agent but promising activity in combination with intensive chemotherapy in refractory or relapsed AML. Relapsed AML defined molecularly by mutant nucleophosmin-1 without concurrent fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication seems to benefit most from GO. In newly diagnosed AML two up-front randomized Phase III trials evaluating GO in induction therapy failed to demonstrate an improvement in response and survival. Again, genetically defined subgroups may benefit. EXPERT OPINION: Future challenges of personalized therapy in AML will be to integrate the signals from current subgroup analyses underlining the role of GO in genetically defined AML entities.","['(c) 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.']","['Hutter, Marie-Luise', 'Schlenk, Richard F']","['Hutter ML', 'Schlenk RF']","['University of Ulm, Department of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110803,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism']",2011/08/04 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/08/04 06:00'],"['2011/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2011.604630 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2011 Oct;11(10):1369-80. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2011.604630.

Detection of NPM1 mutations is useful for stratifying patients for therapy, predicting prognosis, and assessing for minimal residual disease. Several methods have been developed to rapidly detect NPM1 mutations in genomic DNA and/or messenger RNA specimens. OBJECTIVE: To directly compare a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay with a widely used capillary electrophoresis assay for detecting NPM1 mutations. DESIGN: We adopted and modified a qPCR assay designed to detect the 6 most common NPM1 mutations and performed the assay in parallel with capillary electrophoresis assay in 207 bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood samples from patients with a range of hematolymphoid neoplasms. RESULTS: The qPCR assay demonstrated a higher analytical sensitivity than the capillary electrophoresis 1/1000 versus 1/40, respectively. The capillary electrophoresis assay generated 10 equivocal results that needed to be repeated, whereas the qPCR assay generated only 1 equivocal result. After test conditions were optimized, the qPCR and capillary electrophoresis methods produced 100% concordant results, 85 positive and 122 negative. CONCLUSIONS: Given the higher analytical sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR assay, that assay is less likely to generate equivocal results than the capillary electrophoresis assay. Moreover, the qPCR assay is quantitative, faster, cheaper, less prone to contamination, and well suited for monitoring minimal residual disease.",,"['Barakat, Fareed H', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Barkoh, Bedia A', 'Hai, Seema', 'Jamil, Waqar', 'Bhakta, Yaminiben I', 'Chen, Su', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Zuo, Zhuang']","['Barakat FH', 'Luthra R', 'Yin CC', 'Barkoh BA', 'Hai S', 'Jamil W', 'Bhakta YI', 'Chen S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Zuo Z']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

Although it was discovered approximately 5 years ago, its biomedical significance and regulatory mechanism remain obscure. Our preliminary data showed that miR-637 was significantly suppressed in four HCC cell lines and, also, in most of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens, thereby suggesting that miR-637 would be a tumor suppressor in HCC. Simultaneously, the enforced overexpression of miR-637 dramatically inhibited cell growth and induced the apoptosis of HCC cells. The transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), is constitutively activated in multiple tumors, and aberrant Stat3 activation is linked to the promotion of growth and desensitization of apoptosis. Our study showed that Stat3 tyrosine 705 phosphorylation and several Stat3-regulated antiapoptotic genes were down-regulated in miR-637 mimics-transfected and Lv-miR637-infected HCC cells. In addition, miR-637 overexpression negatively regulated Stat3 phosphorylation by suppressing autocrine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression and exogenous LIF-triggered Stat3 activation and rescued cell growth in these cells. A nude mice model also demonstrated the above-described results, which were obtained from the cell model. Furthermore, we found that LIF was highly expressed in a large proportion of HCC specimens, and its expression was inversely associated with miR-637 expression. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that miR-637 acted as a tumor suppressor in HCC, and the suppressive effect was mediated, at least in part, by the disruption of Stat3 activation.",['Copyright (c) 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],"['Zhang, Jin-fang', 'He, Ming-liang', 'Fu, Wei-ming', 'Wang, Hua', 'Chen, Lian-zhou', 'Zhu, Xiao', 'Chen, Ying', 'Xie, Dan', 'Lai, Paul', 'Chen, Gong', 'Lu, Gang', 'Lin, Marie C M', 'Kung, Hsiang-fu']","['Zhang JF', 'He ML', 'Fu WM', 'Wang H', 'Chen LZ', 'Zhu X', 'Chen Y', 'Xie D', 'Lai P', 'Chen G', 'Lu G', 'Lin MC', 'Kung HF']","['Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (MIRN637 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Cell Enlargement/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Primates', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/08/03 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/08/03 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.24595 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2011 Dec;54(6):2137-48. doi: 10.1002/hep.24595.,,,,['Ann Hepatol. 2012 Mar-Apr;11(2):272-4.

Arecoline treatment induced death of K562 cells and increased surface expression of TNFalpha, TNFR1, and TNFR2. Unlike that of TNFR1 mRNA, transcriptional levels of TNFalpha and TNFR2 mRNA increased in arecoline-treated cells. Moreover, arecoline-induced down-regulation of ADAM17 maturation was involved in surface up-modulation of TNFR1, TNFR2, and TNFalpha. Arecoline-elicited increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was responsible for JNK/c-Jun pathway activation and ERK inactivation. Abolition of JNK/c-Jun pathway suppressed arecoline-induced increase in transcriptional level of TNFalpha and TNFR2 mRNA. TNFalpha and TNFR2 promoter luciferase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitating analyses revealed that c-Jun increasingly bound with TNFalpha and TNFR2 promoter upon arecoline treatment. Over-expression of constitutively active MEK1 abolished the effect of arecoline on suppressing ADAM17 maturation. Pretreatment with TNFR2 antibody abrogated arecoline-induced increased susceptibility of K562 cells for the cytotoxicity of TNFalpha and arecoline-induced cell death. Taken together, our data suggest that up-modulation of TNFR2 surface expression is associated with arecoline-induced death of K562 cells.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chen YJ', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Cholinergic Agonists)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '4ALN5933BH (Arecoline)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Anthracenes/metabolism', 'Arecoline/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Chelating Agents/metabolism', 'Cholinergic Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2011/08/03 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/08/03 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22963 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 May;227(5):2240-51. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22963.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synaptobrevin 2 [also known as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2)], the most abundant synaptic vesicle protein and a major soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) component, is required for fast calcium-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion. In contrast to the extensive knowledge about the mechanism of SNARE-mediated exocytosis, little is known about the endocytic sorting of synaptobrevin 2. Here we show that synaptobrevin 2 sorting involves determinants within its SNARE motif that are recognized by the ANTH domains of the endocytic adaptors AP180 and clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM). Depletion of CALM or AP180 causes selective surface accumulation of synaptobrevin 2 but not vGLUT1 at the neuronal surface. Endocytic sorting of synaptobrevin 2 is mediated by direct interaction of the ANTH domain of the related endocytic adaptors CALM and AP180 with the N-terminal half of the SNARE motif centered around M46, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Our data unravel a unique mechanism of SNARE motif-dependent endocytic sorting and identify the ANTH domain proteins AP180 and CALM as cargo-specific adaptors for synaptobrevin endocytosis. Defective SNARE endocytosis may also underlie the association of CALM and AP180 with neurodevelopmental and cognitive defects or neurodegenerative disorders.",,"['Koo, Seong Joo', 'Markovic, Stefan', 'Puchkov, Dmytro', 'Mahrenholz, Carsten C', 'Beceren-Braun, Figen', 'Maritzen, Tanja', 'Dernedde, Jens', 'Volkmer, Rudolf', 'Oschkinat, Hartmut', 'Haucke, Volker']","['Koo SJ', 'Markovic S', 'Puchkov D', 'Mahrenholz CC', 'Beceren-Braun F', 'Maritzen T', 'Dernedde J', 'Volkmer R', 'Oschkinat H', 'Haucke V']","['Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, Freie Universitat Berlin, 14195 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110801,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (R-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (SNARE Proteins)', '0 (clathrin assembly protein AP180)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Endocytosis', 'Hippocampus/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'R-SNARE Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Rats', 'SNARE Proteins', 'Synapses/*metabolism', 'Synaptic Transmission']",2011/08/03 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/03 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['1107067108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1107067108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Aug 16;108(33):13540-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1107067108.

Although mutations that activate PI3K-Akt signaling have previously been identified, the relative contribution of growth factor-dependent activation is unclear. We show here that pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) blocks the growth and viability of T-ALL cells, whereas moderate diminution of IGF1R signaling compromises leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) activity as defined by transplantability in syngeneic/congenic secondary recipients. Furthermore, IGF1R is a Notch1 target, and Notch1 signaling is required to maintain IGF1R expression at high levels in T-ALL cells. These findings suggest effects of Notch on LIC activity may be mediated in part by enhancing the responsiveness of T-ALL cells to ambient growth factors, and provide strong rationale for use of IGF1R inhibitors to improve initial response to therapy and to achieve long-term cure of patients with T-ALL.",['(c) 2011 Medyouf et al.'],"['Medyouf, Hind', 'Gusscott, Samuel', 'Wang, Hongfang', 'Tseng, Jen-Chieh', 'Wai, Carol', 'Nemirovsky, Oksana', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Carboni, Joan', 'Gottardis, Marco', 'Pollak, Michael', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Holzenberger, Martin', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Medyouf H', 'Gusscott S', 'Wang H', 'Tseng JC', 'Wai C', 'Nemirovsky O', 'Trumpp A', 'Pflumio F', 'Carboni J', 'Gottardis M', 'Pollak M', 'Kung AL', 'Aster JC', 'Holzenberger M', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory/Department of Pathology, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, V52 1L3 Canada. h.medyouf@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110801,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2011/08/03 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/08/03 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20110121 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20110121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Aug 29;208(9):1809-22. doi: 10.1084/jem.20110121.

Many of these treatments could induce left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), and limit their efficacy. Angiotensin-converting enzime inhibitors and beta-blockers prevent LVD and prolong survival after infarction, and recent animal and pilot clinical studies suggest that they can prevent the development of chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity. METHODS: This is a prevention, parallel-assignment, randomized, controlled, clinical efficacy study. Ninety patients recently diagnosed of acute leukemia or undergoing autologous HSCT and with normal LV ejection fraction will be randomized to enalapril and carvedilol or to the control group. Echocardiogram and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging studies will be performed at baseline and 6-9 months after randomization. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in LV ejection fraction. Secondary endpoints include the assessment of LV volumes and diastolic function, and the incidence of death, heart failure, or LVD. CONCLUSIONS: The OVERCOME study will be the first clinical trial to test the preventive efficacy on LVD of combined treatment with enalapril and carvedilol administered to patients with hematologic malignancies submitted to current treatment with intensive chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A straightforward solution is to filter irrelevant genes via identifying significant ones. Considering some significant genes with multi-modal expression patterns exhibiting systematic difference in within-class samples are difficult to be identified by existing methods, a strategy that unimodal transform of variables selected by interval segmentation purity (UTISP) for CART modeling is proposed. First, significant genes exhibiting varied expression patterns can be properly identified by a variable selection method based on interval segmentation purity. Then, unimodal transform is implemented to offer unimodal featured variables for CART modeling via feature extraction. Because significant genes with complex expression patterns can be properly identified and unimodal feature extracted in advance, this developed strategy potentially improves the performance of CART in combating overfitting or underfitting while modeling microarray data. The developed strategy is demonstrated using two microarray data sets. The results reveal that UTISP-based CART provides superior performance to k-nearest neighbors or CARTs coupled with other gene identifying strategies, indicating UTISP-based CART holds great promise for microarray data analysis.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Especially, c-Myc is frequently overexpressed in many human cancers and widely involved in tumorigenesis. However, how the post-translational modifications, especially acetylation of c-Myc, contribute to its activity in the leukemia cells remains largely unknown. Sirt1, a NAD-dependent class III histone deacetylase, has a paradoxical role in tumorigenesis by deacetylating several transcription factors, including p53, E2F1 and forkhead proteins. In this study, we show that Sirt1 interacts physically with the C-terminus of c-Myc and deacetylates c-Myc both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the deacetylation of c-Myc by Sirt1 promotes its association with Max, a partner essential for its activation, thereby facilitating c-Myc transactivation activity on hTERT promoter. Finally, inhibition of endogenous Sirt1 in K562 cells by either RNAi or its inhibitor NAM causes the overall decrease of c-Myc target genes expression, including hTERT, cyclinD2 and LDHA, which further suppress cell proliferation and arrest cell cycle at G1/S phase. Thus, our results demonstrate the positive effect of Sirt1 on c-Myc activity by efficiently enhancing c-Myc/Max association in human leukemia cell line K562, suggesting a potential role of Sirt1 in tumorigenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We first generated AuNPs coated with cargo DNA, which was then coupled to complementary DNA linked to an antisense miR-29b sequence. When the AuNPs were delivered into HeLa cells, MCL-1 protein and mRNA levels were increased significantly. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was inhibited, proving that AMOs targeting miR-29b were effectively delivered by our innovative AuNP. In addition, we provided evidence that AuNP could deliver other AMOs against miR-21 into two independent cell lines, KGN and 293T, suggesting that the AuNP conjugates can be versatile for any AMO and cell type.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An applied flow enhances the interaction between CD44-positive cells and hyaluronan if a threshold shear stress of 0.2 dyn/cm(2) is exceeded. At shear stress approximately 1 dyn/cm(2), the cell rolling speed reaches a maximum of 15 mum/s.

Blood stem cell mobilization strategies are therefore important components of all transplant programs. AREAS COVERED: Stem cell mobilization strategies are evaluated based on current literature, with special focus on the use of plerixafor, a CXCR4 chemokine receptor antagonist. Mobilization methods in autologous settings include the use of G-CSF alone or following chemotherapy (chemomobilization), and the use of G-CSF alone in allogeneic transplants. A combination of G-CSF + plerixafor has been shown to be effective in patients who have failed a previous mobilization. This combination has also been found to be superior to G-CSF alone in Phase III studies in myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients as the first-line mobilization. EXPERT OPINION: Addition of plerixafor to chemomobilization or G-CSF mobilization may be more cost-effective than its routine use, and it is worth considering in predicted or proven poor mobilizers. Novel mobilization strategies have allowed more successful stem cell collection in autologous setting, although the effect of plerixafor on graft content and long-term patient outcomes needs further investigation.",,"['Jantunen, Esa']",['Jantunen E'],"['University of Eastern Finland, and Kuopio University Hospital, Department of Medicine, POB 1777, 70211 Kuopio, Finland. esa.jantunen@kuh.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzylamines', 'Cyclams', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2011/08/03 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/03 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2011.601737 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2011 Sep;11(9):1241-8. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2011.601737.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Induction of transporters and enzymes was quantified at the mRNA level by real-time RT-PCR in LS180 cells and for P-gp also at the protein level by Western blot. P-gp inhibition was evaluated by calcein assay in P388/dx and L-MDR1 cells and BCRP inhibition in MDCKII-BCRP cells by pheophorbide A efflux. Substrate characteristics were evaluated by growth inhibition assays in MDCKII cells overexpressing particular ABC-transporters. RESULTS: Atrasentan profoundly induced several CYPs and drug transporters (e.g. 12-fold induction of CYP3A4 at 50 muM). It was a moderate P-gp inhibitor (IC(50) in P388/dx cells = 15.1 +/- 1.6 muM) and a weak BCRP inhibitor (IC(50) in MDCKII-BCRP cells = 59.8 +/- 11 muM). BCRP or P-gp overexpressing cells were slightly more resistant towards antiproliferative effects of atrasentan. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of the induction profile of atrasentan and its interaction with P-gp and BCRP. The profound induction effects stress the need for thorough assessment of its interaction potential in vivo.",,"['Weiss, Johanna', 'Haefeli, Walter Emil']","['Weiss J', 'Haefeli WE']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. johanna.weiss@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110731,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endothelin A Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'V6D7VK2215 (Atrasentan)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Atrasentan', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Endothelin A Receptor Antagonists', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrrolidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/08/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/02 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1715-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2011 Oct;68(4):1093-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1715-8.

The treatment strategy implications in patients with Philadelphia positive CML are described. METHODS: RT-PCR and sequencing were carried out on the peripheral blood leukocytes to detect the type of BCR-ABL transcript. The BCR-ABL mutational status was assessed using sequencing of the RT-PCR products. The in vitro test of sensitivity to TKIs was based on detecting inhibited phosphorylation of the Crkl and Phospho-Src family kinases (SFK, Tyr416) using immunodetection. RESULTS: The cytogenetics revealed 90% of Ph+ (Philadelphia) cells in the bone marrow aspirate with no additional clonal chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis. This correlated with an accelerated phase of the CML. Sequencing analysis of reverse transcribed and PCR amplified BCR-ABL transcript revealed a rare e6a2 fusion, with no evidence for Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutation. Western blot analysis showed high phosphorylation (activation) of Crkl and the Src family of kinases (P-SFK). In vitro test of sensitivity of the patients' leukemic cells to imatinib demonstrated sensitivity of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase to imatinib, as assessed by a decrease in phosphorylated Crkl and the disappearance of P-SFK, suggesting that P-Src reflects only the Bcr-Abl-dependent Src activity. The initial treatment strategy was reduced imatinib and search for an unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donor (according to the ELN recommendations). The patient was allografted with peripheral stem cells from an HLA- identical male donor but on day +70 graft failure occurred. He was allografted again with the peripheral stem cells from an HLA-identical female donor, engrafted on day +15 and showed 100% donor chimerism with no evidence of the e6a2 BCR-ABL fusion transcript on day +30. CONCLUSION: The clinical disease course in patients with the rare e6a2 BCR-ABL transcript variant is aggressive. This may be the result of increased kinase activity due to partial loss of the guanine exchange factor/dbl-like domain which mediates the interaction with several Ras-like G-proteins involved in cell proliferation, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. For the above reasons, these patients should receive stem cell transplant immediately after a short course of treatment with imatinib/ dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor or they should be registered in clinical trials with experimental agents.",,"['Rohon, Peter', 'Divoka, Martina', 'Calabkova, Lenka', 'Mojzikova, Renata', 'Katrincsakova, Beata', 'Rusinakova, Zuzana', 'Lapcikova, Anna', 'Raida, Ludek', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Divoky, Vladimir', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Rohon P', 'Divoka M', 'Calabkova L', 'Mojzikova R', 'Katrincsakova B', 'Rusinakova Z', 'Lapcikova A', 'Raida L', 'Faber E', 'Jarosova M', 'Divoky V', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Olomouc and Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic. peter.rohon@centrum.cz']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,,IM,"['*Basophils', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/therapy', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2011/08/02 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/08/02 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2011.030 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2011 Jun;155(2):187-90. doi: 10.5507/bp.2011.030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with CML, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used to suppress the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, resulting in impressive response rates. However, resistance can occur, especially in acute-phase CML, through various mechanisms. Here, we show that the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ) modulates imatinib and dasatinib resistance and suppresses tumor growth by inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2)/AKT signaling pathway. In mouse and human models, GILZ binds to mTORC2, but not to mTORC1, inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT (at Ser473) and activating FoxO3a-mediated transcription of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim; these results demonstrate that GILZ is a key inhibitor of the mTORC2 pathway. Furthermore, CD34(+) stem cells isolated from relapsing CML patients underwent apoptosis and showed inhibition of mTORC2 after incubation with glucocorticoids and imatinib. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the role of mTORC2 in BCR-ABL(+) cells and indicate that regulation by GILZ may influence TKI sensitivity.",,"['Joha, S', 'Nugues, A-L', 'Hetuin, D', 'Berthon, C', 'Dezitter, X', 'Dauphin, V', 'Mahon, F-X', 'Roche-Lestienne, C', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Quesnel, B', 'Idziorek, T']","['Joha S', 'Nugues AL', 'Hetuin D', 'Berthon C', 'Dezitter X', 'Dauphin V', 'Mahon FX', 'Roche-Lestienne C', 'Preudhomme C', 'Quesnel B', 'Idziorek T']","['Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Universite Lille-Nord de France, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110801,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TSC22D3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection']",2011/08/02 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2011/08/02 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011328 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.328 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Mar 15;31(11):1419-30. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.328.

Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is a pan-leukemic marker used for identification of the leukemic clone rather than the use of individual specific molecular aberration of ALL. METHODS: Using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, bone marrow samples from 41 newly diagnosed Egyptian ALL patients; 22 adults and 19 children were examined for WT1 expression. After induction therapy, WT1 expression was reestimated in 20 ALL patients. RESULTS: WT1 was overexpressed in adult and pediatric ALL patients (95.4% and 89.4%, respectively). WT1 expression at diagnosis had no statistically significant impact on disease-free survival of patients (P = 0.054). However, WT1 expression increased after induction chemotherapy in the 3 pediatric patients who had relapse.

The MAGE-A3 proteins' functions are unknown, but they were found to play a role in cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and drug resistance. The aims of this study were to determine the expression of the MAGE-A3 gene in an Egyptian cohort of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and to define its role in the development of AML and its correlation with clinical presentation, laboratory data, as well as treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 40 de novo AML patients as well as 30 age- and sex-matched normal healthy subjects as a control group. They were all subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of MAGE-A3 gene expression. RESULTS: Our study revealed that 23 AML patients (57.5%) expressed the MAGE-A3 gene, whereas none of the control group subjects (0%) expressed this gene. It was found that the expression of MAGE-A3 gene was associated with an increased risk of AML (odds ratio = 2.763; 95% confidence interval, 1.890-8.041). Regarding treatment outcome, a highly statistical significant difference was found between MAGE-A3-positive and -negative AML patients with P < 0.001, as the MAGE-A3-positive AML patients had a higher incidence of unfavorable treatment outcome, whereas the MAGE-A3-negative patients had a higher incidence of favorable outcome. This clarifies that the MAGE-A3 gene expression was found to have a significant impact on the risk of treatment failure (odds ratio = 3.591; 95% confidence interval, 1.273-10.462).

By chromosomal breakpoint mapping in a patient with a Noonan syndrome-like phenotype that encompassed short stature, blepharoptosis, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, we identified haploinsufficiency of the histone acetyltransferase gene MYST histone acetyltransferase (monocytic leukemia) 4 (MYST4), as the underlying cause of the phenotype. Using acetylation, whole genome expression, and ChIP studies in cells from the patient, cell lines in which MYST4 expression was knocked down using siRNA, and the Myst4 querkopf mouse, we found that H3 acetylation is important for neural, craniofacial, and skeletal morphogenesis, mainly through its ability to specifically regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient database of MHF diagnosed at our institution from January 1, 1976, to December 31, 2008, was reviewed. For each MFH case with prior NHL or CLL, 3 matched controls from the same cohort without prior CLL or NHL were randomly selected. A retrospective chart review collected patient data, including sex; age; pathologic confirmation of MFH; tumor grade, size, and location; time since MFH diagnosis; history of chemotherapy or irradiation; treatment of MFH; recurrence; metastasis; and death. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival, survival free of recurrence, and survival free of metastasis. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate associations between case status and outcomes. RESULTS: Fifteen MFH cases with prior NHL or CLL were identified. Cases had frequent bone (n=7 [47%]) and cutaneous (n=5 [33%]) involvement. Five cases (33%) had previous irradiation, 6 (40%) had metastases, and 4 (27%) had recurrence. Overall survival and survival free of recurrence were not significantly different between the cases and controls (5-year overall survival, 49.9% and 58.7%; 12-month survival free of recurrence, 79.4% and 90.3%). However, cases were significantly more likely than controls to have metastasis (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-11.79; P=.02). In addition, survival free of metastasis at 12 months was 65.2% and 90.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the presence of CLL or NHL, MFH seems to behave more aggressively, suggested by the increased likelihood of metastases compared with controls without prior CLL or NHL. However, overall survival does not appear to be worse in cases of MFH and CLL or NHL than in MFH alone.",,"['Kubica, Agnieszka W', 'Rose, Peter S', 'Weaver, Amy L', 'Brewer, Jerry D']","['Kubica AW', 'Rose PS', 'Weaver AL', 'Brewer JD']","['Mayo Medical School, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histiocytoma, Malignant Fibrous/*epidemiology/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2011/08/02 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/08/02 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-6196(11)65176-8 [pii]', '10.4065/mcp.2010.0720 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2011 Aug;86(8):738-43. doi: 10.4065/mcp.2010.0720.,PMC3146374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CAL-101, a selective inhibitor of PI3Kdelta, displays clinical activity in CLL, causing rapid lymph node shrinkage and a transient lymphocytosis. Inhibition of pro-survival pathways, the presumed mechanism of CAL-101, does not explain this characteristic pattern of activity. Therefore, we tested CAL-101 in assays that model CLL-microenvironment interactions in vitro. We found that CAL-101 inhibits CLL cell chemotaxis toward CXCL12 and CXCL13 and migration beneath stromal cells (pseudoemperipolesis). CAL-101 also down-regulates secretion of chemokines in stromal cocultures and after BCR triggering. CAL-101 reduces survival signals derived from the BCR or from nurse-like cells, and inhibits BCR- and chemokine-receptor-induced AKT and MAP kinase (ERK) activation. In stromal cocultures, CAL-101 sensitizes CLL cells toward bendamustine, fludarabine, and dexamethasone. These results are corroborated by clinical data showing marked reductions in circulating CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL13 levels, and a surge in lymphocytosis during CAL-101 treatment. Thus, CAL-101 displays a dual mechanism of action, directly decreasing cell survival while reducing interactions that retain CLL cells in protective tissue microenvironments. These data provide an explanation for the clinical activity of CAL-101, and a roadmap for future therapeutic development.",,"['Hoellenriegel, Julia', 'Meadows, Sarah A', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Wierda, William G', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Giese, Neill', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Yu, Albert', 'Miller, Langdon L', 'Lannutti, Brian J', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Hoellenriegel J', 'Meadows SA', 'Sivina M', 'Wierda WG', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ', 'Giese N', ""O'Brien S"", 'Yu A', 'Miller LL', 'Lannutti BJ', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

However, little is known regarding the biological function of TET2 and its role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. To study the function of TET2 in vivo, we generated a Tet2 knock out mouse model. Deletion of Tet2 in mice led to dramatic reduction in the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and concomitant increase in the 5-methylcytosine levels in the genomic DNA of BM cells. The Tet2(-/-) mice contained an increased Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) (LSK) cell pool before the development of myeloid malignancies. A competitive reconstitution assay revealed that Tet2(-/-) LSK cells had an increased hematopoietic repopulating capacity with an altered cell differentiation skewing toward monocytic/granulocytic lineages. Approximately 1/3 of Tet2(-/-) and 8% of Tet2(+/-) mice died within 1 year of age because of the development of myeloid malignancies resembling characteristics of CMML, MPD-like myeloid leukemia, and MDS. Furthermore, transplantation of Tet2(-/-), but not wild-type (WT) or Tet2(+/-) BM cells, led to increased WBC counts, monocytosis, and splenomegaly in WT recipient mice.

Here, we test the hypothesis that defective ribosome biogenesis underlies the pathogenesis of SDS. We create conditional mutants in the essential SBDS ortholog of the ancient eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum using temperature-sensitive, self-splicing inteins, showing that mutant cells fail to grow at the restrictive temperature because ribosomal subunit joining is markedly impaired. Remarkably, wild type human SBDS complements the growth and ribosome assembly defects in mutant Dictyostelium cells, but disease-associated human SBDS variants are defective. SBDS directly interacts with the GTPase elongation factor-like 1 (EFL1) on nascent 60S subunits in vivo and together they catalyze eviction of the ribosome antiassociation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6), a prerequisite for the translational activation of ribosomes. Importantly, lymphoblasts from SDS patients harbor a striking defect in ribosomal subunit joining whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the level of SBDS protein. These findings in Dictyostelium and SDS patient cells provide compelling support for the hypothesis that SDS is a ribosomopathy caused by corruption of an essential cytoplasmic step in 60S subunit maturation.",,"['Wong, Chi C', 'Traynor, David', 'Basse, Nicolas', 'Kay, Robert R', 'Warren, Alan J']","['Wong CC', 'Traynor D', 'Basse N', 'Kay RR', 'Warren AJ']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110729,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)', '0 (eIF-6)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'Shwachman syndrome']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Dictyostelium/genetics/metabolism', 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipomatosis/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/metabolism', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protozoan Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomes/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome']",2011/08/02 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/08/02 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41002-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-353938 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Oct 20;118(16):4305-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-353938.

Presence of potential inhibitors of Fas which could block Fas signaling can explain cancer cells resistance to apoptosis. We identified promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) as a Fas-interacting protein using mass spectrometry analysis. The function of PML is blocked by its dominant-negative form PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PMLRARalpha). We found PMLRARalpha interaction with Fas in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived cells and APL primary cells, and PML-Fas complexes in normal tissues. Binding of PMLRARalpha to Fas was mapped to the B-box domain of PML moiety and death domain of Fas. PMLRARalpha blockage of Fas apoptosis was demonstrated in U937/PR9 cells, human APL cells and transgenic mouse APL cells, in which PMLRARalpha recruited c-FLIP(L/S) and excluded procaspase 8 from Fas death signaling complex. PMLRARalpha expression in mice protected the mice against a lethal dose of agonistic anti-Fas antibody (P < .001) and the protected tissues contained Fas-PMLRARalpha-cFLIP complexes. Taken together, PMLRARalpha binds to Fas and blocks Fas-mediated apoptosis in APL by forming an apoptotic inhibitory complex with c-FLIP.

Sialate-O-acetyltransferase (SOAT) and sialate-O-acetylesterase (SIAE) are the two main enzymes responsible for the quantity of the O-acetyl ester groups on sialic acids (Sias). We have earlier shown an enhanced level of SOAT activity, capable of transferring acetyl groups to Sias of glycoconjugates in the microsomes of lymphoblasts of these children. We further observed a decreased SIAE activity in both lysosomal and cytosolic fractions of ALL cell lines and primary cells from bone marrow of patients compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, which preferentially hydrolyze O-acetyl groups at C-9 of Sia. The level of O-acetylated Sias in the cytosolic and the lysosomal fractions showed a good correlation with SIAE activity in the corresponding fractions. The apparent K(M) values for SIAE in the lysosomal and the cytosolic fractions from lymphoblasts of ALL patients are 0.38 and 0.39 mM, respectively. These studies demonstrate that both SIAE and SOAT activities seem to be responsible for the enhanced level of Neu5,9Ac(2) in lymphoblasts, which is a hallmark in ALL. This was subsequently confirmed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that also demonstrated a steady decline in SOAT activities even in cell lysates of lymphoblasts during successful chemotherapy, like radioactive methods have shown earlier.",,"['Mandal, Chandan', 'Mandal, Chhabinath', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Schauer, Roland', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Mandal C', 'Mandal C', 'Chandra S', 'Schauer R', 'Mandal C']","['Cancer and Cell Biology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.C.

Activating lesions frequently affect Notch1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and, recently, have been found in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well. We explored the oncogenic potential of activated Notch1 in the lung by developing a transgenic mouse model in which activated Notch1 was overexpressed in the alveolar epithelium. The initial response to activated Notch1 was proliferation and the accumulation of alveolar hyperplasia, which was then promptly cleared by apoptosis. After an extended latency period, however, pulmonary adenomas appeared in the transgenic mice but failed to progress to become carcinomas. Interestingly, Myc and MycL1 were expressed in the adenomas, suggesting that selection for enhanced Myc activity may facilitate tumorigenesis. Using mice engineered to coexpress activated Notch1 and Myc, we found that supplementing Myc expression resulted in increased frequency of Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD)-induced adenoma formation and enabled progression to adenocarcinoma and metastases. Cooperation stemmed from synergistic activation of tumor cell cycling, a process that apparently countered any impedance to tumorigenesis posed by Myc and/or activated Notch1-induced apoptosis. Significantly, cooperation was independent of RAS activation. Taken together, the data suggest that activated Notch1 substitutes for RAS activation synergistically with Myc in the development of NSCLC. These tumor models should be valuable for exploring the role of activated Notch1 in the genesis of NSCLC and for testing therapies targeting either activated Notch1 or its downstream effectors.",,"['Allen, Thaddeus D', 'Rodriguez, Elena M', 'Jones, Kirk D', 'Bishop, J Michael']","['Allen TD', 'Rodriguez EM', 'Jones KD', 'Bishop JM']","['G.W.

Hypermethylation of this CpG island was found in NPC tissue samples and cancer cell lines, whereas no aberrant promoter methylation was detected in non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissue samples or normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Treatment of NPC 6-10B cells and leukemia HL60 cells with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased endogenous levels of NOR1 messenger RNA. Ectopic expression of NOR1 in NPC HNE1 cells inhibited tumor cell colony formation and viability.

A key barrier to the clinical success of arsenic is that it is not potent enough to achieve a clinical benefit at physiologically tolerable concentrations by targeting the leukemia cell differentiation pathway alone. We explored a novel combination approach to enhance the eradication of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) by arsenic in non-APL leukemia. In the present study, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation was strengthened after As(2)S(2) exposure in leukemia cell lines and stem/progenitor cells, but not in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs). propidium iodide-103, the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, effectively inhibited the transient activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by As(2)S(2). The synergistic killing and differentiation induction effects on non-APL leukemia cells were examined both in vitro and in vivo. Eradication of non-APL LSCs was determined using the nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model. We found that a combined As(2)S(2)/PI-103 treatment synergized strongly to kill non-APL leukemia cells and promote their differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, the combined As(2)S(2)/PI-103 treatment effectively reduced leukemia cell repopulation and eradicated non-APL LSCs partially via induction of differentiation while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that induction of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway could provide a protective response to offset the antitumor efficacy of As(2)S(2).

METHODS: We collected recorded data and interviewed families of the children with ALL diagnosed between January 1997 and August 2007, who refused or abandoned treatment. RESULTS: 323 patients were diagnosed with ALL. 173 patients (173/323, 53.6%) refused therapy and 35 (35/323, 10.8%) cases abandoned treatment. 191 (191/208, 91.8%) of these children were telephone/mail-visited. Different people had different reasons for refusal or abandonment. Financial difficulty and belief of ALL incurability were the main reasons for abandonment. Transportation difficulties and fear of severe side effects were also important reasons. Of the 173 patients who refused treatment, 13 patients lost follow-up. 160 parents were interviewed and 1 (6.3%) child was still alive at the date of last follow-up. Of the 35 patients who abandoned treatment, 4 patients lost follow-up. 31 parents were interviewed and 2 (6.5%) children were still alive at the date of last follow-up.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which induce histone hyperacetylation leading to chromatin remodeling and reactivation of transcriptionally repressed genes have shown efficacy against a variety of cancers. Herein, we tested if valproic acid and the novel orally bioavailable HDACi, AR-42 reduced the proliferation of ATL cell lines by promoting apoptosis and histone hyperacetylation. Both compounds were cytotoxic and elicited a dose dependent increase in cytochrome C and cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) indicating the induction of cell death by apoptosis and promoted acetylation of histone H3 in both MT-2 and C8166 cell lines.

PIM1, a serine/threonine kinase, is up-regulated in FLT3-ITD AML and may be involved in FLT3-mediated leukemogenesis. We employed a PIM1 inhibitor, AR00459339 (Array Biopharma Inc.), to investigate the effect of PIM1 inhibition in FLT3-mutant AML. Like FLT3 inhibitors, AR00459339 was preferentially cytotoxic to FLT3-ITD cells, as demonstrated in the MV4-11, Molm-14, and TF/ITD cell lines, as well as 12 FLT3-ITD primary samples. Unlike FLT3 inhibitors, AR00459339 did not suppress phosphorylation of FLT3, but did promote the de-phosphorylation of downstream FLT3 targets, STAT5, AKT, and BAD. Combining AR00459339 with a FLT3 inhibitor resulted in additive to mildly synergistic cytotoxic effects. AR00459339 was cytotoxic to FLT3-ITD samples from patients with secondary resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, suggesting a novel benefit to combining these agents.

We decided to compare these two methods and determine mutual correlation and compatibility. Eleven patients were studied and in all cases DCs promoted the survival and proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes. Both methods retained consistency with regard to survival and proliferation of CD4/CD8 lymphocytes. However, the correlation of these methods was not convincing. Therefore, both these methods might be used for evaluation of MLR, but each of them gives specific and complementary information.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, a mechanistic and systematic evaluation of the potential biological and toxic effects of SiO2NP becomes crucial in order to assess their complete safe applicability limits. RESULTS: In this study, human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 were exposed to a range of amorphous SiO2NP of various sizes and concentrations (0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml). Key biological indicators of cellular functions including cell population density, cellular morphology, membrane permeability, lysosomal mass/pH and activation of transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) were evaluated utilizing quantitative high content screening (HCS) approach and biochemical techniques. Despite the use of extremely high nanoparticle concentrations, our findings showed a low degree of cytotoxicity within the panel of SiO2NP investigated. However, at these concentrations, we observed the onset of stress-related cellular response induced by SiO2NP. Interestingly, cells exposed to alumina-coated SiO2NP showed low level, and in some cases complete absence, of stress response and this was consistent up to the highest dose of 0.5 mg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates and highlights the importance of subtle biological changes downstream of primary membrane and endocytosis-associated phenomena resulting from high dose SiO2NP exposure. Increased activation of transcription factors, such as ATF-2, was quantitatively assessed as a function of i) human cell line specific stress-response, ii) SiO2NP size and iii) concentration. Despite the low level of cytotoxicity detected for the amorphous SiO2NP investigated, these findings prompt an in-depth focus for future SiO2NP-cell/tissue investigations based on the combined analysis of more subtle signalling pathways associated with accumulation mechanisms, which is essential for establishing the bio-safety of existing and new nanomaterials.",,"['Mohamed, Bashir Mustafa', 'Verma, Navin Kumar', 'Prina-Mello, Adriele', 'Williams, Yvonne', 'Davies, Anthony M', 'Bakos, Gabor', 'Tormey, Laragh', 'Edwards, Connla', 'Hanrahan, John', 'Salvati, Anna', 'Lynch, Iseult', 'Dawson, Kenneth', 'Kelleher, Dermot', 'Volkov, Yuri']","['Mohamed BM', 'Verma NK', 'Prina-Mello A', 'Williams Y', 'Davies AM', 'Bakos G', 'Tormey L', 'Edwards C', 'Hanrahan J', 'Salvati A', 'Lynch I', 'Dawson K', 'Kelleher D', 'Volkov Y']","['Department of clinical medicine, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 8, Ireland. bashmohamed@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110729,England,J Nanobiotechnology,Journal of nanobiotechnology,101152208,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'LMI26O6933 (Aluminum Oxide)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2/metabolism', 'Aluminum Oxide/adverse effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/drug effects', 'Nanoparticles/*adverse effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Silicon Dioxide/*adverse effects', '*Stress, Physiological']",2011/08/02 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/08/02 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-3155-9-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-3155-9-29 [doi]']",epublish,J Nanobiotechnology. 2011 Jul 29;9:29. doi: 10.1186/1477-3155-9-29.,PMC3164618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ANIMALS: 27 adult Holstein cows. PROCEDURES: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood from lactating Holstein cows seronegative for BLV (n = 9 cows), seropositive for BLV and aleukemic (aleukemic; 9), and seropositive for BLV and persistently lymphocytotic (PL; 9). Isolated PBMCs were assayed for mitogen-induced proliferation and were analyzed by means of flow cytometry. The PBMCs from a subset of each group were assayed for apoptosis, caspase-9 activity, and expression of selected genes related to apoptosis. RESULTS: PL cows had significantly higher total lymphocyte counts and significantly lower proportions of T-lymphocyte populations than did BLV-negative and aleukemic cows. Both groups of BLV-infected cows had significantly higher proportions of B cells and major histocompatibility complex II-expressing cells than did BLV-negative cows. Proliferation with concanavalin A was significantly lower for PL cows, compared with proliferation for BLV-negative cows. Pokeweed mitogen-induced proliferation was significantly higher for aleukemic and PL cows than for BLV-negative cows. Gene expression of apoptosis-inhibitory proteins BCL2 and BCL2L1 was significantly higher for aleukemic cows and expression of BCL2 was significantly higher for PL cows than for BLV-negative cows. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cattle infected with BLV had marked changes in PBMC populations accompanied by alterations in proliferation and apoptosis mechanisms. Because the relative distribution and function of lymphocyte populations are critical for immune competence, additional studies are needed to investigate the ability of BLV-infected cattle to respond to infectious challenge.",,"['Erskine, Ronald J', 'Corl, Christine M', 'Gandy, Jeffery C', 'Sordillo, Lorraine M']","['Erskine RJ', 'Corl CM', 'Gandy JC', 'Sordillo LM']","['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. erskine@cvm.msu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Concanavalin A/metabolism', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology/physiology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology']",2011/08/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/08/02 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/ajvr.72.8.1059 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2011 Aug;72(8):1059-64. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.72.8.1059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we examined the ability of four naturally occuring and biologically active flavonoids from the genus Dorstenia, gancaonin Q (1), 6-prenylapigenin (2), 6,8-diprenyleriodictyol (3), and 4-hydroxylonchocarpin ( 4), to inhibit the proliferation of a panel of fourteen cancer cell lines including leukemia and solid cancer cells, as well as AML12 normal hepatocytes. The study was extended to the analysis of cell cycle distribution, apoptosis induction, and caspase 3/7 activity and the antiangiogenic properties of the four compounds. The results of the cytotoxicity assays showed that more than 50 % inhibition of proliferation was obtained with compound 1 on all the fourteen studied cancer cell lines, with IC (50) values below 20 microg/mL. Compounds 2, 4, and 3 showed selective activity, with IC (50) values below 20 microg/mL being noted on 57.15 %, 71.42 %, and 85.71 % of the fourteen cancer cell lines, respectively. None of the compounds exhibited more than 50 % inhibition against AML12 normal hepatocytes cells at 20 microg/mL. IC (50) values below or around 4 microg/mL were recorded on 28.57 % of the tested cell lines for both compound 1 and 4 and 21.43 % for compound 3, which appeared to be the best cytotoxic compounds. This study indicates that caspase 3/7 activation is one of the modes of induction of apoptosis for compounds 1, 3, and 4 in CCRF-CEM cells. The results of the antiangiogenic assay indicated that compounds 1, 3, and 4 were also able to inhibit the growth of blood capillaries on the chorioallantoic membrane of quail eggs, the best effect being noted for compound 4 (54.1 % inhibition).

The proliferation of cytokine type 1 secreting lymphocytes, the preferred target for viral infection, shifts the Th1/Th2 balance in favour of a Th1 response with a consequent increase in the production of gamma interferon (INF-gamma). In addition to other effects, this causes a decrease in the secretion of cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which results in substantial reduction in total and specific IgE; failure of activation of eosinophils or stagnation in or reduction of their numbers; and an increased risk of development of a severe form of strongyloidiasis. This risk is clearly correlated with the level of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies and the amplitude of the proviral load of peripheral lymphocytes. The polyclonal expansion of infected CD4 cells might be partly due to the activation of the IL-2/IL-2R system by parasite antigens together with the action of the virus type 1 Tax protein. The fact that adult T cell leukaemia arises significantly earlier and more often in individuals with combined infection is an argument in favour of the parasite's role as a leukaemogenic co-factor. In practice it is, therefore, appropriate to initiate all available measures to eliminate parasites from co-infected hosts although this does present difficulties, and one should not reject the possibility of a diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in the absence of hypereosinophilia. In all cases of chronic strongyloidiasis without hypereosinophilia, co-infection with HTLV-1 should be looked for routinely. The same applies to carriers of strongyloides with repeated treatment failures. Finally, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants should be used only with care in HTLV-1-positive patients who seem not to be co-infected, even if they have received precautionary therapy.",,"['Pays, J-F']",['Pays JF'],"['Faculte de medecine Descartes-Necker, Universite Paris-V-Rene-Descartes, Paris, France. pays@necker.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20110728,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,"['0 (Anthelmintics)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics/therapeutic use', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance', 'Eosinophils/physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/epidemiology/immunology', 'Host-Parasite Interactions/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Larva', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Models, Biological', 'Opportunistic Infections/parasitology', 'Prevalence', 'Strongyloides stercoralis/growth & development/*physiology', 'Strongyloidiasis/*complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/immunology', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Th1-Th2 Balance']",2011/07/30 06:00,2011/11/11 06:00,['2011/07/30 06:00'],"['2011/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13149-011-0175-z [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2011 Aug;104(3):188-99. doi: 10.1007/s13149-011-0175-z.

We retrospectively analyzed the flow cytometric data from a large study of antigen expression in 1,774 children with newly diagnosed ALL in JPLSG. T- and B-lineage ALL accounted for 13 and 87% of childhood ALL cases, respectively. Cytoplasmic CD3 and CD7 antigens were positive in all T-ALL cases. More than 80% of T-ALL cases expressed CD2, CD5 and TdT. In B-lineage ALL, the frequencies of early pre-B, pre-B, transitional pre-B and B-ALL were 81, 15.5, 0.6 and 2.9%, respectively. More than 90% of early pre-B ALL cases expressed CD19, CD79a, CD22, CD10 and TdT. CD34 was expressed in three-fourths of early pre-B ALL cases.

SCF-Kit signalling is crucial for the survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage. Furthermore, since myeloid leukaemia cells express the Kit receptor, SCF may play an important role in myeloid leukaemia progression too. However, the mechanisms of this pathophysiological effect remain unclear. Recent evidence shows that SCF triggers accumulation of the inducible alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in hematopoietic cells--a transcription complex that plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen availability. However, it is unknown how SCF impacts on HIF-1alpha accumulation in human myeloid leukaemia and mast cells. Here we show that SCF induces HIF-1alpha accumulation in THP-1 human myeloid leukaemia cells but not in LAD2 mast cells. We demonstrated that LAD2 cells have a more robust glutathione (GSH)-dependent antioxidative system compared to THP-1 cells and are therefore protected against the actions of ROS generated in an SCF-dependent manner. BSO-induced GSH depletion led to a significant decrease in HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) activity in THP-1 cells and to near attenuation of it in LAD2 cells. In THP-1 cells, SCF-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation is controlled via ERK, PI3 kinase/PKC-delta/mTOR-dependent and to a certain extent by redox-dependent mechanisms. These results demonstrate for the first time an important cross-talk of signalling pathways associated with HIF-1 activation--an important stage of the myeloid leukaemia cell life cycle.",,"['Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Yasinska, Inna M', 'Oniku, Abraham E', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Gibbs BF', 'Yasinska IM', 'Oniku AE', 'Sumbayev VV']","['Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Kent, United Kingdom.

Homozygous deletion of ESPL1 gene that encodes Separase protein results in embryonic lethality in mice and Separase overexpression lead to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. However, the effect of Separase haploinsufficiency has not been thoroughly investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we examined the effect of ESPL1 heterozygosity using a hypomorphic mouse model that has reduced germline Separase activity. We report that while ESPL1 mutant (ESPL1 (+/hyp)) mice have a normal phenotype, in the absence of p53, these mice develop spontaneous T- and B-cell lymphomas, and leukemia with a significantly shortened latency as compared to p53 null mice. The ESPL1 hypomorphic, p53 heterozygous transgenic mice (ESPL1(+/hyp), p53(+/-)) also show a significantly reduced life span with an altered tumor spectrum of carcinomas and sarcomas compared to p53(+/-) mice alone. Furthermore, ESPL1(+/hyp), p53(-/-) mice display significantly higher levels of genetic instability and aneuploidy in normal cells, as indicated by the abnormal metaphase counts and SKY analysis of primary splenocytes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that reduced levels of Separase act synergistically with loss of p53 in the initiation and progression of B- and T- cell lymphomas, which is aided by increased chromosomal missegregation and accumulation of genomic instability.

Cytologic examination of pleural effusions is an important initial step in management of malignant effusions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the spectrum of uncommon malignant pleural effusions in a chest disease center in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of samples of pleural effusions submitted to Ataturk Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Education and Research Hospital Department of Pathology between March 2005 and November 2008 was performed. RESULTS: Out of a total of 4684 samples reviewed 364 (7.8%) were positive for cancer cells. Of the malignant pleural effusions 295 (81%) were classified as adenocarcinoma or carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS). Pleural effusion specimens revealing a diagnosis other than adenocarcinoma/carcinoma NOS were: 32 (8.8%) malignant mesotheliomas, 14 (3.8%) small cell carcinomas, 13 (3.5%) hematolymphoid malignancies and 10 (2.7%) squamous cell carcinoma. Hematolymphoid malignancies included non- Hodgkin lymphoma (diffuse B large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma), multiple myeloma, chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite that adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of malignant pleural effusions, there is a significant number of hematological and non-hematological uncommon causes of such effusions.

The date patients satisfied the entry criteria was defined as time zero (T(0)). The median age at diagnosis was 58 years, and time from diagnosis to T(0) was 3.3 years. Following T(0), 213 (74%) patients had a treatment recorded with one or more regimens (median=1; range 0-8). The first regimen contained bortezomib in 55 (26%) patients and an IMiD in 70 (33%).

However, current salvage regimens are often assembled with agents that have similar mode of activity as the chemotherapeutics used in the initial treatment. Hence, novel therapeutic agents that are capable of distinct and diverse mechanisms of activity in, now resistant, leukemia cells are of great interest. We have investigated the opioid agonist methadone for its anti-leukemic activity, initially reported in studies with cell lines derived from adult patients. Our findings show that, compared to normal cells, methadone has enhanced cytotoxicity against specimens and cell lines established from refractory childhood leukemia. In addition, methadone's activity synergized with that of the anti-Bcl-2 agent ABT-737 and was characterized by the induction of distinct changes in tumor cell mitochondria. Data presented also identify biological correlates and a potential mechanism for methadone activity by its effects on Mcl-1 and other members of the apoptosis cascade. We provide mechanistic data for the therapeutic potential of a family of agents that is largely unexplored for anti-leukemic activity.",['Copyright A(c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

No data presently exists regarding the frequency of WT1 mutations in the Southeast Asian AML population. This study focused on WT1 exons 7-10 mutations and their correlation with other molecular markers and patients' characteristics. The zinc finger domain of WT1 gene covering exons 7-10 was directly sequenced. Six types of mutations were identified among 49 cases (12.24%); 4 localized on exon 7 and 2 on exon 9. Two novel mutations were identified including the insertion within codon 313 and codon 314. Patients harboring WT1 mutations seemed to have a younger age (29.5 vs 45.4 years), a higher white blood cell count (120.3 vs 19.8x10(9)/L), and a lower platelet count (54.2 vs 104.3x10(9)/L) as compared to those without the mutations although statistical differences could not be demonstrated. All exon 7 mutations were frameshift mutations and had NRAS mutation while exon 9 mutations were base substitutions and had FLT3-ITD mutation. Interestingly, the major allele for rs16754 single nucleotide polymorphism was G (25-homozygous and 6-heterozygous) which was in contrast to A in the Western reports. The frequency of WT1 mutation in the Southeast Asian AML was thus comparable to the figures reported from the West although the designated major allele for rs16754 polymorphism was different.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known about the function of Plzf in vertebrate, especially in fish species. To gain better understanding of its role in fishes, we have cloned Plzf from the testis of Labeo rohita (rohu), a commercially important freshwater carp. The full-length cDNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 2004bp translatable to 667 amino acids (aa) containing a conserved N-terminal BTB domain and C-terminal C(2)H(2)-zinc finger motifs. L. rohita Plzf, which is phylogenetically related to Danio rerio counterpart, abundantly expressed in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). A three-dimensional (3D) model of BTB domain of Plzf protein was constructed by homology modeling approach. Molecular docking on this 3D structure established a homo-dimer between two BTB domains creating a charged pocket containing conserved aa residues: L33, C34, D35 and R49. Thus, Plzf of SSC is structurally and possibly functionally conserved. The conserved aa residues in the cleft resulting from Plzf BTB self-association are likely to be the binding platform for interaction with recruited co-repressor peptides.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, from February 2008 to August 2009. METHODOLOGY: All the newly diagnosed cases of BCR-ABL or Philadelphia positive CML were tested for JAK2V617F mutation by Nested PCR. Demographic data, spleen size, hemoglobin levels, white blood cell and platelet counts were recorded. Independent sample t-test was used for age, haemoglobin level and spleen size. Fisher's exact test was applied to compare disease progression in JAK2V617F mutation positive and negative cases. RESULTS: Out of 45 newly diagnosed cases of CML, 40 were in chronic phase, 01 in accelerated phase and 04 in blast crisis. JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 12 (26.7%) patients; 09 (22.5%) in chronic phase, none in accelerated phase and 03 (75%) in blast crisis. During a mean follow-up of 8 months, 03 patients in chronic phase transformed in blast crisis and 02 into accelerated phase. Overall 08 out 0f 11 (73%) JAK2V617F positive patients either had advanced disease or showed disease progression. Only 2 of 20 (10%) available patients, negative for the mutation, showed disease progression by transforming into blast crisis (p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was seen in the age, spleen size, haemoglobin levels, white blood cells and platelets counts in JAK2V617F positive patients.

In addition caspase-3 activity is required for myogenic differentiation. Therefore the aim of this study was to further investigate mechanisms of the differentiation suppressing effect of LIF in particular the possibility of a caspase-3 mediated inhibition of differentiation. RESULTS: LIF dependent inhibition of differentiation appeared to involve several mechanisms. Differentiating myoblasts that were exposed to LIF displayed increased transcripts for c-fos. Transcripts for the cell cycle inhibitor p21 as well as muscle regulatory factors myoD and myogenin were decreased with LIF exposure. However, LIF did not directly induce a proliferative effect under differentiation conditions, but did prevent the proportion of myoblasts that were proliferating from decreasing as differentiation proceeded. LIF stimulation decreased the percentage of cells positive for active caspase-3 occurring during differentiation. Both the effect of LIF inhibiting caspase-3 activation and differentiation appeared dependent on mitogen activated protein kinase and extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase (MEK) signalling. The role of LIF in myogenic differentiation was further refined to demonstrate that myoblasts are unlikely to secrete LIF endogenously. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether this study provides a more comprehensive view of the role of LIF in myogenic differentiation including LIF and receptor regulation in myoblasts and myotubes, mechanisms of inhibition of differentiation and the link between caspase-3 activation, apoptosis and myogenic differentiation.",,"['Hunt, Liam C', 'Upadhyay, Aradhana', 'Jazayeri, Jalal A', 'Tudor, Elizabeth M', 'White, Jason D']","['Hunt LC', 'Upadhyay A', 'Jazayeri JA', 'Tudor EM', 'White JD']","['Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110407,England,Skelet Muscle,Skeletal muscle,101561193,,,,2011/07/30 06:00,2011/07/30 06:01,['2011/07/30 06:00'],"['2010/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['2044-5040-1-17 [pii]', '10.1186/2044-5040-1-17 [doi]']",epublish,Skelet Muscle. 2011 Apr 7;1(1):17. doi: 10.1186/2044-5040-1-17.,PMC3156640,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exploratory perspective often makes statistically guided visualization methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the methods of choice. However, the clarity of the obtained visualizations, and thereby the potential to use them to formulate relevant hypotheses, may be confounded by the presence of the many non-informative variables. For microarray data, more easily interpretable visualizations are often obtained by filtering the variable set, for example by removing the variables with the smallest variances or by only including the variables most highly related to a specific response. The resulting visualization may depend heavily on the inclusion criterion, that is, effectively the number of retained variables. To our knowledge, there exists no objective method for determining the optimal inclusion criterion in the context of visualization. RESULTS: We present the projection score, which is a straightforward, intuitively appealing measure of the informativeness of a variable subset with respect to PCA visualization. This measure can be universally applied to find suitable inclusion criteria for any type of variable filtering. We apply the presented measure to find optimal variable subsets for different filtering methods in both microarray data sets and synthetic data sets. We note also that the projection score can be applied in general contexts, to compare the informativeness of any variable subsets with respect to visualization by PCA. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the projection score provides an easily interpretable and universally applicable measure of the informativeness of a variable subset with respect to visualization by PCA, that can be used to systematically find the most interpretable PCA visualization in practical exploratory analysis.",,"['Fontes, Magnus', 'Soneson, Charlotte']","['Fontes M', 'Soneson C']","['Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, Box 118, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden. fontes@maths.lth.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110728,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Principal Component Analysis', 'Software']",2011/07/30 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/07/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-12-307 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-12-307 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2011 Jul 28;12:307. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-12-307.,PMC3167802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, groups of mRNAs acting in the same biochemical processes can be retained or exported in a coordinated manner thereby impacting on specific biochemistries and ultimately on cell physiology. mRNAs can be transported by either bulk export pathways involving NXF1/TAP or more specialized pathways involving chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1). Studies on primary tumor specimens indicate that many common and specialized mRNA export factors are dysregulated in cancer including CRM1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), HuR, nucleoporin 88, REF/Aly, and THO. This positions these pathways as potential therapeutic targets. Recently, specific targeting of the eIF4E-dependent mRNA export pathway in a phase II proof-of-principle trial with ribavirin led to impaired eIF4E-dependent mRNA export correlating with clinical responses including remissions in leukemia patients.

The tumor suppressor genes, CDKN2A and CDKN2B, encoding p16(INK4a) , p14(ARF) , and p15(INK4b) have been localized to 9p21. Abnormalities of 9p21 have been reported in 10-30% of childhood ALL using conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The incidence of 9p21 using more sensitive techniques, such as methylation specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA), remains uncertain, and thus also the prognostic significance. PROCEDURE: We investigated the incidence and prognostic importance of 9p21 abnormalities in pediatric ALL patients using MS-MLPA and compared these results to FISH. RESULTS: In total, MS-MLPA or FISH detected aberrations (both dosage and methylation abnormalities) at 9p21 in a remarkable 32/48 (67%) patients in contrast to a much lower rate of only 8% of patients identified to have deletions by standard G banding cytogenetics. MS-MLPA identified five deletions not found by FISH. Aberrant methylation at CDKN2B was found in 19 (46%) patients. 9p21 abnormalities were associated with National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk criteria (P = 0.04) and were present in all five patients with T-cell disease. Four pre-B-cell ALL patients relapsed, three of whom had prior 9p21 abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: MS-MLPA had a higher detection rate for 9p21 abnormalities than previously reported for other techniques. Given the ease of processing, minimal equipment and low cost of MS-MLPA, our results suggest that previous reports may have underestimated the true frequency of 9p21 abnormalities and their potential impact upon ALL outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gardiner, R Brett', 'Morash, Barbara A', 'Riddell, Christie', 'Wang, Hao', 'Fernandez, Conrad V', 'Yhap, Margaret', 'Berman, Jason N']","['Gardiner RB', 'Morash BA', 'Riddell C', 'Wang H', 'Fernandez CV', 'Yhap M', 'Berman JN']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, IWK Health Centre/Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110727,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2011/07/29 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2011/07/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23285 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jun;58(6):852-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23285.

We hypothesized that treatment approaches differ between pediatric oncologists and bone marrow transplant (BMT) physicians. PROCEDURE: A survey addressing management of relapsed ALL was sent to pediatric oncologists (n = 883) and BMT (n = 86) physicians across North America. RESULTS: A number of similarities in treatment approaches were identified including: choice of chemotherapy for re-induction/consolidation, preference for unrelated donors (URDs) in very early marrow relapse and the choice to not use URD donors in late marrow relapse. However, differences between the two disciplines were noted. For patients who relapsed 18-36 months from diagnosis, the majority of oncologists (53.7%) would retreat with chemotherapy while a majority BMT physicians (70.3%) recommended URD transplant (P < 0.001). Oncologists were also less likely to use minimal residual disease (MRD) in relapse assessment compared to BMT physicians (52% vs. 67.2%; P = 0.028) and more oncologists believed MRD testing was experimental and/or not proven in relapsed ALL (27.1% vs. 12.3%; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights management differences in children with ALL between pediatric oncologists and BMT physicians, identifying opportunities for collaborative clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Burke, Michael J', 'Lindgen, Bruce', 'Verneris, Michael R']","['Burke MJ', 'Lindgen B', 'Verneris MR']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. burke283@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110727,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pediatrics/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Physicians/standards/statistics & numerical data', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards/*statistics & numerical data"", 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods/standards/statistics & numerical data']",2011/07/29 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2011/07/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23269 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jun;58(6):840-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23269.

One widely used vector design is based on the MFG vector, which uses the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) transcriptional unit with extended packaging signals and insertion of the native MoMLV envelope splice acceptor region immediate 5' to the gene of interest inserted at an NcoI restriction site, which contains a translation start codon. Little is known about the impact of variations in start codon location within MFG-based vectors on protein expression. METHODS: To evaluate variation in start condo placement, a gene encoding a T-cell receptor (TCR) was cloned into an MFG-based vector and site-directed mutagenesis was used to move the gene away from the splice acceptor, as well as alter the frame with respect to the upstream start codon. Kozak consensus sequences were also added to the gene in an attempt to improve translation. RESULTS: Protein expression as measured by TCR surface expression and biological activity was substantially reduced when the gene was placed downstream and out-of-frame with the NcoI start codon. Expression was reestablished by mutation of the upstream start site, although at a reduced level. These findings were repeated with two other genes, a dominant negative TGFbetaRII and the reporter protein dEGFP. CONCLUSIONS: These finding emphasize the scanning rule for translation initiation and stress the importance of cloning genes of interest into or near the native NcoI start site of MFG-based retroviral vectors.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Frankel, Timothy L', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Burns, William R', 'Zheng, Zhili', 'Morgan, Richard A']","['Frankel TL', 'Zhang L', 'Burns WR', 'Zheng Z', 'Morgan RA']","['Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Codon, Initiator)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Codon, Initiator', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2011/07/29 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/07/29 06:00'],"['2011/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jgm.1599 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2011 Sep;13(9):478-86. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1599.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored intraclonal diversification (ID) of immunoglobulin genes in order to (i) follow the evolutionary history of the RS clone (ii) compare the role of ID in clonally related RS vs. clonally unrelated cases. Most (10/11, 90.9%) clonally related RS stem from the predominant clone observed at CLL diagnosis. One single RS had a transformation pattern compatible with sequential evolution from a secondary CLL subclone. Once RS transformation had occurred, all secondary CLL subclones disappeared and were substituted by the dominant RS clone with its own descendants. These observations suggest that genetic lesions associated with RS transformation are acquired by a cell belonging to the original CLL clone, rather than being progressively accumulated by later CLL subclones. Accordingly, most (9/11, 81.1%) clonally related RS harbored a genetic lesion disrupting TP53 that was already present, though at subclonal levels, in 5/11 (45.5%) samples of the paired CLL phase. A fraction of clonally related RS switched off ID (4/11, 36.4%) or reduced the levels of ID (5/11, 45.4%) at transformation. Conversely, all clonally unrelated RS harbored ID and were characterized by a significantly higher mutation frequency compared to clonally related RS (median: 1.18 x 10(-3) vs. 0.13 x 10(-3); p =0.002).

While most leukemia cells are initially sensitive to chemo- and radiotherapy, LSCs are resistant and are considered to be the basis for disease relapse after initial response. Albeit important knowledge on LSC biology has been gained from xenogeneic transplantation models introducing human leukemia cells into immune deficient mouse models, the prospective identification and isolation of human LSC candidates has remained elusive and their prognostic and therapeutic significance controversial. This review focuses on the identification, enrichment and characterization of human LSC derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Experimental data demonstrating the clinical significance of estimating LSC burden and strategies to eliminate LSC will be summarized.

We previously reported that the DOK1 gene can be mutated and its expression down-regulated in human malignancies. However, the mechanism underlying DOK1 silencing remains largely unknown. We show here that unscheduled silencing of DOK1 expression through aberrant hypermethylation is a frequent event in a variety of human malignancies. DOK1 was found to be silenced in nine head and neck cancer (HNC) cell lines studied and DOK1 CpG hypermethylation correlated with loss of gene expression in these cells. DOK1 expression could be restored via demethylating treatment using 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine. In addition, transduction of cancer cell lines with DOK1 impaired their proliferation, consistent with the critical role of epigenetic silencing of DOK1 in the development and maintenance of malignant cells. We further observed that DOK1 hypermethylation occurs frequently in a variety of primary human neoplasm including solid tumours (93% in HNC, 81% in lung cancer) and haematopoietic malignancy (64% in Burkitt's lymphoma). Control blood samples and exfoliated mouth epithelial cells from healthy individuals showed a low level of DOK1 methylation, suggesting that DOK1 hypermethylation is a tumour specific event. Finally, an inverse correlation was observed between the level of DOK1 gene methylation and its expression in tumour and adjacent non tumour tissues. Thus, hypermethylation of DOK1 is a potentially critical event in human carcinogenesis, and may be a potential cancer biomarker and an attractive target for epigenetic-based therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2011 UICC.'],"['Saulnier, Amandine', 'Vaissiere, Thomas', 'Yue, Jiping', 'Siouda, Maha', 'Malfroy, Marine', 'Accardi, Rosita', 'Creveaux, Marion', 'Sebastian, Sinto', 'Shahzad, Naveed', 'Gheit, Tarik', 'Hussain, Ishraq', 'Torrente, Mariela', 'Maffini, Fausto Antonio', 'Calabrese, Luca', 'Chiesa, Fausto', 'Cuenin, Cyrille', 'Shukla, Ruchi', 'Fathallah, Ikbal', 'Matos, Elena', 'Daudt, Alexander', 'Koifman, Sergio', 'Wunsch-Filho, Victor', 'Menezes, Ana M B', 'Curado, Maria-Paula', 'Zaridze, David', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Tommasino, Massimo', 'Herceg, Zdenko', 'Sylla, Bakary S']","['Saulnier A', 'Vaissiere T', 'Yue J', 'Siouda M', 'Malfroy M', 'Accardi R', 'Creveaux M', 'Sebastian S', 'Shahzad N', 'Gheit T', 'Hussain I', 'Torrente M', 'Maffini FA', 'Calabrese L', 'Chiesa F', 'Cuenin C', 'Shukla R', 'Fathallah I', 'Matos E', 'Daudt A', 'Koifman S', 'Wunsch-Filho V', 'Menezes AM', 'Curado MP', 'Zaridze D', 'Boffetta P', 'Brennan P', 'Tommasino M', 'Herceg Z', 'Sylla BS']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110922,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DOK1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RASSF1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2011/07/29 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26299 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Jun 1;130(11):2484-94. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26299.

It is estimated that around 10-20 million people are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide. However, HTLV-1 is not a ubiquitous virus. Indeed, HTLV-1 is present throughout the world with clusters of high endemicity including mainly southern Japan, the Caribbean region, parts of South America and intertropical Africa, with foci in the Middle East and Australia. The origin of this puzzling geographical repartition is probably linked to a founder effect in certain human groups. In the high endemic areas, 0.5 to 50% of the people have antibodies against HTLV-1 antigens. HTLV-1 seroprevalence increases with age, especially in women. HTLV-1 has 3 modes of transmission: mother to child, mainly through prolonged breastfeeding (> 6 months); sexual, mainly but not exclusively occurring from male to female; and by blood products contaminated by infected lymphocytes. HTLV-1 is mainly the etiological agent of two very severe diseases: a malignant T CD4+ cell lymphoproliferation of very poor prognosis, named adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and a chronic neuro-myelopathy named tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). HTLV-1 is also associated with rare anterior uveitis, infective dermatitis and myositis in some high HTLV-1 endemic areas. The repartition of the different molecular subtypes or genotypes is mainly linked to the geographical origin of the infected persons but not to the associated pathology. HTLV-1 possesses a remarkable genetic stability probably linked to viral amplification via clonal expansion of infected cells rather than by reverse transcription. This stability can be used as a molecular tool to gain better insights into the origin, evolution and modes of dissemination of HTLV-1 and infected populations. HTLV-1 originated in humans through interspecies transmission from STLV-1, a very closely related retrovirus, highly endemic in several populations of apes and Old World monkeys.",,"['Gessain, A']",['Gessain A'],"['Departement de virologie, CNRS-URA3015, Institut Pasteur, Paris cedex 15, France. antoine.gessain@pasteur.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20110727,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Viral', 'Global Health', '*HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Haplorhini/virology', 'Host Specificity', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/virology', 'Serologic Tests/methods', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/genetics']",2011/07/29 06:00,2011/11/11 06:00,['2011/07/29 06:00'],"['2011/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13149-011-0174-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2011 Aug;104(3):167-80. doi: 10.1007/s13149-011-0174-4.

The protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is up-regulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, suggesting a regulatory link between the two proteins. To investigate the interplay between these two proteins, we inhibited the activity of PTP1B in Bcr-Abl-expressing TonB.210 cells by either pharmacological or siRNA means and examined the effects of such inhibition on Bcr-Abl expression and function. Herein we describe a novel mechanism by which the phosphatase activity of PTP1B is required for Bcr-Abl protein stability. Inhibition of PTP1B elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl that triggers the degradation of Bcr-Abl through ubiquitination via the lysosomal pathway. The degradation of Bcr-Abl consequently inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl substrates and the downstream production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, PTP1B inhibition reduces cell viability and the IC(50) of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Degradation of Bcr-Abl via PTP1B inhibition is also observed in human CML cell lines K562 and LAMA-84. These results suggest that inhibition of PTP1B may be a useful strategy to explore in the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CML, particularly because host drugs currently used in CML such as imatinib focus on inhibiting the kinase activity of Bcr-Abl.",,"['Alvira, Daniel', 'Naughton, Ruth', 'Bhatt, Lavinia', 'Tedesco, Sara', 'Landry, William D', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Alvira D', 'Naughton R', 'Bhatt L', 'Tedesco S', 'Landry WD', 'Cotter TG']","['Tumour Biology Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Bioscience Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110727,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Lysosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*drug effects/genetics']",2011/07/29 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/29 06:00'],"['2011/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50941-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.249060 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Sep 16;286(37):32313-23. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.249060.

GSK3beta kinase activity has been reported to be critical for various types of cancer cells, but the mechanism has remained elusive. In this study we examine the mechanism by which GSK3beta regulates the survival of leukemia cells. We demonstrate that upon GSK3beta kinase inhibition different types of leukemia cells show severe proliferation defects as a result of apoptosis. The transcription factor c-Myb is found to be the main target of GSK3beta inhibition in cell survival. GSK3beta inactivation reduces the expression of c-Myb by promoting its ubiquitination-mediated degradation, thereby inhibiting the expression of c-Myb-dependent antiapoptotic genes Bcl2 and survivin. Coimmunoprecipitation, reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and knockdown studies show that c-Myb needs to interact and cooperate with transcription factor LEF-1 in the activation of Bcl2 and survivin and that both transcription factors are required for cell survival.

Alterations in chromatin structure appear to establish a permissive state for gene activation at some loci, but they play an integral role in activation at other loci. To determine the predominant roles of chromatin states and factor occupancy in directing gene regulation during differentiation, we mapped chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and nuclear factor occupancy genome-wide during mouse erythroid differentiation dependent on the master regulatory transcription factor GATA1. Notably, despite extensive changes in gene expression, the chromatin state profiles (proportions of a gene in a chromatin state dominated by activating or repressive histone modifications) and accessibility remain largely unchanged during GATA1-induced erythroid differentiation. In contrast, gene induction and repression are strongly associated with changes in patterns of transcription factor occupancy. Our results indicate that during erythroid differentiation, the broad features of chromatin states are established at the stage of lineage commitment, largely independently of GATA1. These determine permissiveness for expression, with subsequent induction or repression mediated by distinctive combinations of transcription factors.",,"['Wu, Weisheng', 'Cheng, Yong', 'Keller, Cheryl A', 'Ernst, Jason', 'Kumar, Swathi Ashok', 'Mishra, Tejaswini', 'Morrissey, Christapher', 'Dorman, Christine M', 'Chen, Kuan-Bei', 'Drautz, Daniela', 'Giardine, Belinda', 'Shibata, Yoichiro', 'Song, Lingyun', 'Pimkin, Max', 'Crawford, Gregory E', 'Furey, Terrence S', 'Kellis, Manolis', 'Miller, Webb', 'Taylor, James', 'Schuster, Stephan C', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Chiaromonte, Francesca', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Weiss, Mitchell J', 'Hardison, Ross C']","['Wu W', 'Cheng Y', 'Keller CA', 'Ernst J', 'Kumar SA', 'Mishra T', 'Morrissey C', 'Dorman CM', 'Chen KB', 'Drautz D', 'Giardine B', 'Shibata Y', 'Song L', 'Pimkin M', 'Crawford GE', 'Furey TS', 'Kellis M', 'Miller W', 'Taylor J', 'Schuster SC', 'Zhang Y', 'Chiaromonte F', 'Blobel GA', 'Weiss MJ', 'Hardison RC']","['Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20110727,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.- (histonase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Estradiol/pharmacology/physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Mice', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2011/07/29 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/07/29 06:00'],"['2011/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.125088.111 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.125088.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2011 Oct;21(10):1659-71. doi: 10.1101/gr.125088.111.

Patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy within six months, i.e. from 29% to 24% among males and from 25% to 21% among females. Five-year relative survival increased from 61% in 1989-1993 to 70% 2004-2008 for males, and from 71% to 76% for females. The relative excess risk of dying decreased in time to 0.7 (males) and 0.9 (females) in 2004-2008, reference 1989-1993, and increased with age to 2.9 (males) and 1.8 (females) in patients aged 75-94 years, reference 30-64 years. The increasing incidence among females aged 50-64 coincided with the introduction of mass screening for breast cancer, which resulted in a large group of women under increased surveillance and possibly led to increased detection of CLL.

Upon binding to the LIF receptor, LIF activates three major intracellular signalling pathways: the JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT and SHP2 [SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2]/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways. These pathways converge to orchestrate the gene expression pattern specific to mESCs. Among the many signalling events downstream of the LIF receptor, activation and DNA binding of the transcription factor STAT3 plays a central role in transducing LIF's functions. The fundamental role of LIF for pluripotency was highlighted further by the discovery that LIF accelerates the conversion of epiblast-derived stem cells into a more fully pluripotent state.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of reduced compared with intensive (conventional) ALL chemotherapy on serum immunoglobulin levels and specific antibody concentrations against vaccine-preventable diseases. PROCEDURE: Patients treated according to Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL 10 protocol were stratified by minimal residual disease to receive reduced (standard risk; SR) or intensive (medium risk; MR) intensification/maintenance treatment. Between November 2004 and July 2009 we compared serum immunoglobulins of 110 patients and specific antibodies against diphtheria toxin, tetanus toxin, and Bordetella pertussis antigens of 41 patients of SR and MR groups during chemotherapy. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin levels showed significantly different patterns between the SR and MR groups. In the MR group IgG, IgA, and IgM levels decreased towards the end of intensive treatment; in the SR group IgG levels increased while IgA and IgM stabilized. In both groups IgM and IgG levels were most affected. Specific antibody levels against vaccine-preventable diseases decreased in both groups, but more profound in MR group. CONCLUSIONS: Although reduced chemotherapy is beneficial for immunoglobulin level recovery and might prevent susceptibility for infections, specific antibodies remain decreased.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['van Tilburg, Cornelis M', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'Berbers, Guy A M', 'Wolfs, Tom F W', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Bloem, Andries C', 'Sanders, Elisabeth A M']","['van Tilburg CM', 'Bierings MB', 'Berbers GA', 'Wolfs TF', 'Pieters R', 'Bloem AC', 'Sanders EA']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. c.m.vantilburg@umcutrecht.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110725,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Tetanus Toxin)', '0 (Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*blood', 'Bordetella pertussis/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria Toxin/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*blood', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Tetanus Toxin/immunology', 'Vaccines/*immunology']",2011/07/28 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23258 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 May;58(5):701-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23258.

Purpose of this study was to assess blood pressure and body composition in childhood ALL survivors and compare data to reference values from the general population. PROCEDURE: This single-center retrospective study included 68 survivors of childhood ALL with a median age of 25 years (range 16.4-39.5) and a median follow-up of 16.0 years (range 5.3-30.4). Data on previous treatment, blood pressure and measurements of weight and height at diagnosis and at long-term follow-up (from which body mass index (BMI) was calculated) were obtained from medical records. All data were converted to control-referenced standard deviation scores. RESULTS: Of the ALL survivors 48(1/2)% were prehypertensive and 22.1% were hypertensive. Both the mean systolic (mean SDS 0.736, P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (mean SDS 0.409, P < 0.001) of survivors was significantly higher compared to reference control values. Based on BMI values, 38.2% of the survivors were considered overweight/obese and females, in contrast to males had a significantly higher BMI (mean SDS 1.355, P < 0.001) compared to reference values. In addition, females who had received cranial radiotherapy (mean SDS 2.078) had a significantly higher BMI than females who had not (mean SDS 0.512) (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Both diastolic and systolic blood pressure are significantly increased in survivors of childhood ALL. Female survivors treated with cranial radiation therapy have the highest prevalence and greatest risk of overweight/obesity. Therefore, survivors of childhood ALL are likely to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life, which stresses the need for follow-up and adequate medical and/or life style interventions.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Veringa, Susanna J E', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder, Eline', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Veening, Margreet A']","['Veringa SJ', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder E', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Veening MA']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20110725,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Pressure', '*Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2011/07/28 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23251 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Feb;58(2):278-82. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23251.

In our previous study, curcumin was able to inhibit murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vivo. However, there is no report addressing the cytotoxic responses and the mechanisms underlying curcumin-induced apoptotic cell death in WEHI-3 cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that that curcumin affected WEHI-3 cells and triggered cell death through apoptotic signaling pathways. The effects of curcumin on WEHI-3 cells were investigated by using flow cytometric analysis, comet assay, confocal laser microscopy and Western blotting. In this study, we found that curcumin induced apoptosis in WEHI-3 cells in a dose-dependent (5-20 muM) manner. Interestingly, curcumin enhanced the level of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 which might show that curcumin-induced apoptosis is done through the ER stress signaling pathways based on the increase of CIEBP homologous protein (CHOP), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and caspase-12 in WEHI-3 cells. Moreover, curcumin increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cytosolic Ca(2)(+) release, and induced DNA damage, but decreased the level of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim ) in WEHI-3 cells. In conclusion, curcumin-induced apoptosis occurs through the ROS-affected, mitochondria-mediated and ER stress-dependent pathways. The evaluation of curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of leukemia seems warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Huang, An-Cheng', 'Chang, Chia-Ling', 'Yu, Chun-Shu', 'Chen, Po-Yuan', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Ji, Bin-Chuan', 'Lin, Tsung-Ping', 'Chiu, Chang-Fang', 'Yeh, Su-Peng', 'Huang, Yi-Ping', 'Lien, Jin-Cherng', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Huang AC', 'Chang CL', 'Yu CS', 'Chen PY', 'Yang JS', 'Ji BC', 'Lin TP', 'Chiu CF', 'Yeh SP', 'Huang YP', 'Lien JC', 'Chung JG']","[""Department of Nursing, ST.

These studies include cancer stem cell populations, where eradication of this specific population is the ultimate goal of treatment. Whilst cellular signalling events and transcription factor complex-mediated changes in gene expression have been analysed in some detail within stem cells, full systematic understanding of the events promoting self-renewal or the commitment process leading to formation of a specific cell type require a systems biology approach. This in turn demands a need for proteomic analysis of post-translational regulation of protein levels, protein interactions, protein post-translational modification (e.g. ubiquitination, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation) to identify networks for stem cell regulation. Furthermore, the phenomenon of induced pluripotency via cellular reprogramming also can be understood optimally using combined molecular biology and proteomics approaches; here we describe current research employing proteomics and mass spectrometry to dissect stem cell regulatory mechanisms.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Williamson, Andrew J K', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Williamson AJ', 'Whetton AD']","[""Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, School of Cancer and Enabling Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Christie's NHS Foundation Trust, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Withington, Manchester, UK. awilliamson@picr.man.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Division/genetics/physiology', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'Proteomics/*methods/*trends', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods/trends']",2011/07/28 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22610 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 Oct;226(10):2478-83. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22610.,,,['11008/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study combines these parameters of major cancers to provide an overview of the progress achieved in the Netherlands since 1989 and to establish in which areas action is needed. The population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry and Statistics Netherlands provided incidence, 5-year relative survival and mortality of 23 major cancer types. Incidence, survival and mortality changes were calculated as the estimated annual percentage change. Optimal progress was defined as decreasing incidence and/or improving survival accompanied by declining mortality, and deterioration as increasing incidence and/or deteriorating survival accompanied by increasing mortality rates. Optimal progress was observed in 12 of 19 cancer types among males: laryngeal, lung, stomach, gallbladder, colon, rectal, bladder, prostate and thyroid cancer, leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among females, optimal progress was observed in 12 of 21 cancers: stomach, gallbladder, colon, rectal, breast, cervical, uterus, ovarian and thyroid cancer, leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Deterioration occurred in three cancer types among males: skin melanoma, esophageal and kidney cancer, and among females six cancer types: skin melanoma, oral cavity, pharyngeal, esophageal, pancreatic and lung cancer.

They are under evaluation for treatment of EpCAM(+) (ovarian) and GD2(+) (neuroblastoma and melanoma) malignancies because of their proven ability to enhance tumor cell killing by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and by antitumor cytotoxic T cells. Here, we demonstrate that huKS-IL2 and hu14.18-IL2 bind to tumor cells via their antibody components and increase adhesion and activating immune synapse (AIS) formation with NK cells by engaging the immune cells' IL-2 receptors (IL2R). The NK leukemia cell line, NKL (which expresses high affinity IL2Rs), shows fivefold increase in binding to tumor targets when treated with IC compared to matching controls. This increase in binding is effectively inhibited by blocking antibodies against CD25, the alpha-chain of the IL2R. NK cells isolated from the peritoneal environment of ovarian cancer patients, known to be impaired in mediating ADCC, bind to huKS-IL2 via CD25. The increased binding between tumor and effector cells via ICs is due to the formation of AIS that are characterized by the simultaneous polarization of LFA-1, CD2 and F-actin at the cellular interface. AIS formation of peritoneal NK and NKL cells is inhibited by anti-CD25 blocking antibody and is 50-200% higher with IC versus the parent antibody. These findings demonstrate that the IL-2 component of the IC allows IL2Rs to function not only as receptors for this cytokine but also as facilitators of peritoneal NK cell binding to IC-coated tumor cells.",,"['Gubbels, Jennifer A A', 'Gadbaw, Brian', 'Buhtoiarov, Ilia N', 'Horibata, Sachi', 'Kapur, Arvinder K', 'Patel, Dhara', 'Hank, Jacquelyn A', 'Gillies, Stephen D', 'Sondel, Paul M', 'Patankar, Manish S', 'Connor, Joseph']","['Gubbels JA', 'Gadbaw B', 'Buhtoiarov IN', 'Horibata S', 'Kapur AK', 'Patel D', 'Hank JA', 'Gillies SD', 'Sondel PM', 'Patankar MS', 'Connor J']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53711, USA. jennifer.gubbels@augie.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20110727,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '339986-90-2 (tucotuzumab celmoleukin)', '65988-71-8 (ganglioside, GD2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gangliosides/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunological Synapses/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/*analogs & derivatives/immunology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology', 'Protein Transport/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins']",2011/07/28 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1072-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Dec;60(12):1789-800. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1072-9.

In this paper, we investigate the consequences of a more general CTL response and show that a sigmoidal response function gives rise to complex behaviours previously unobserved. Multiple equilibria are shown to exist and none of the equilibria is a global attractor during the chronic infection phase. Coexistence of local attractors with their own basin of attractions is the norm. In addition, both stable and unstable periodic oscillations can be created through Hopf bifurcations. We show that transient periodic oscillations occur when a saddle-type periodic solution exists. As a consequence, transient periodic oscillations can be robust and observable.
