The clinical picture in these 5 patients did not differ materially from that of the other Ph1-positive patients with CML, probably indicating that the recipient chromosome, with which the translocation from No. 22 takes place, does not play a crucial role in the course of the CML. In the 21 cases with abnormal karyotypes, nonrandom chromosomal changes were observed. Most of the changes were related to events occurring at the centromeric region. The prognosis of cases with only an extra No. 8 or Ph1 appears to be better than that for cases with an iso-17q [I(17a)] chromosome or other extra chromosomes. The presence of the Ph1 (delected No. 22) in every case points to the essentiality of this karyotypic findings in the diagnosis of CML and possibly in the genesis of the disease.","['Hayata, I', 'Sakurai, M', 'Kakati, S', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Hayata I', 'Sakurai M', 'Kakati S', 'Sandberg AA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, 1-3', 'Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Chromosomes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1975/10/01 00:00,1975/10/01 00:01,['1975/10/01 00:00'],"['1975/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197510)36:4<1177::aid-cncr2820360402>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1975 Oct;36(4):1177-91. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197510)36:4<1177::aid-cncr2820360402>3.0.co;2-8.,,,

Differential and viable cell counts and 3H-thymidine labeling indices were performed at intervals up to 30 days. Differentiation was assessed morphologically by light and electron microscopy, histochemically, and by functional tests for phagocytosis and the presence of surface receptors for IgG. Colony-stimulating activity (CSA) was assayed against normal human bone marrow by the agar colony technique. In acute leukemia cultures, viable cell counts usually fell within the normal range. However, most AML cells failed to demonstrate significant maturation in vitro, and did not produce detectable CSA. In AMML cultures, maturation was defective but some differentiated macrophages were observed and the cells produced high concentrations of CSA. Preleukemic cultures demonstrated normal growth but maturation was impaired as evidenced by a high percentage of immature cells during the first 7 days. CML cultures showed abnormally high growth capacity resulting in viable cell counts 2-3 times normal. In the chronic phase of CML, maturation was qualitatively normal and the cells produced CSA. With the onset of blast transformation, maturation became abnormal but growth remained high. These studies support a concept of AML as a primary defect in cellular maturation and of CML as a primary abnormality of proliferation. The production of CSA by neoplastic cells relates to the degree of monocyte-macrophage differentiation within the leukemic population. Human preleukemia is characterized by a failure of normal maturation in vitro.","['Golde, D W', 'Byers, L A']","['Golde DW', 'Byers LA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Bibl Haematol,Bibliotheca haematologica,0372513,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Precancerous Conditions/blood']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000397539 [doi]'],ppublish,Bibl Haematol. 1975;(40):243-50. doi: 10.1159/000397539.,,,

Patients with myelomonocytic leukemia showed mixed populations of cells with ridge-like profiles and ruffled membranes whereas cells from two patients with undifferentiated leukemia had smooth surfaces, similar to those encountered in cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

This included prophylactic skull irradiation and intraspinal MTX injections. 29 children are still in their first remissions which range from 10 - 35 months in length.

In Case 2, cyclophosphamide had been given for rheumatoid arthritis. After a latency of 34 months 'smouldering leukaemia' developed with an atypical monocytic leukaemic cell population. In a third case, multiple myeloma and monocytic leukaemia developed synchronously. The causative role of melphalan and cyclophosphamide in the development of AML seems securely established. Despite the risk of alkylating agents in the treatment of multiple myeloma or Hodgkin's disease causing AML, they should not be replaced, as other drugs have been shown to be less beneficial.

One important difference is that most adults have myeloblastic or related forms of the disease (AML), whereas the majority of children have lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, even adults with ALL fail to respond as well to a similar regimen as do children with the same type of leukemia. In a recent series of patients with ALL who were treated with the complex multiple drug ""L-2"" protocol, the incidence of complete remission in adults was 78% vs. 99% in children, and the median duration of remission was only 24 months in the adults, whereas it has not yet been reached in the children and is projected to be over 4 years. In AML and the related nonlymphoblastic forms of acute leukemia, therapy is still unsatisfactory in both adults and children. With the best current drug treatment schedules, the incidence of complete remission is now better than 50%, but it is often difficult to compare the exact remission rates in different series because of differences in reporting results. In adults treated with the multiple drug ""L-6"" protocol, the incidence of remission in previously untreated patients was 56% and the median duration of remission was 10 months. The median survival of all patients (responders and non-responders) was 1 year whereas that of responders only was 2 years. It is encouraging that a significant proportion of those patients with AML who have complete remissions now remain in remission for extended periods; about 45% of patients responding to the ""L-6"" protocol remained in remission over 1 year, and 18% have been in continuous remission for 2 to over 4 years. Even after discontinuing treatment, some patients with AML stay in remission for long periods, and it is possible that some of them may have been cured. If this proves to be true, it becomes of great importance to determine what is different about the patients who do exceptionally well as compared to the majority who continue to die within a year. However, no consistent nor distinctive favorable prognostic features have yet been identified.","['Clarkson, B D', 'Dowling, M D', 'Gee, T S', 'Cunningham, I B', 'Burchenal, J H']","['Clarkson BD', 'Dowling MD', 'Gee TS', 'Cunningham IB', 'Burchenal JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1975/08/01 00:00,1975/08/01 00:01,['1975/08/01 00:00'],"['1975/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197508)36:2+<775::aid-cncr2820360824>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1975 Aug;36(2):775-95. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197508)36:2+<775::aid-cncr2820360824>3.0.co;2-v.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",

The patient had been given 40 ml of Thorotrast in connection with a neuro-radiological examination 34 years earlier. Clinically, the patient was now considered to be in an incipient myeloid leucaemic phase. Ninety-seven per cent of the bone marrow cells belonged to a clone with characteristic marker chromosomes induced by radiation. Few data are available on chromosome analysis of bone marrow cells from Thorotrast patients. Therefore, the results of the present study are compared with data from chromosome analyses of 32P-treated patients with polycythaemia vera, in whom large clones were found in the bone marrow. The results of chromosome analysis of bone marrow cells from the Thorotrast patient support previous hypotheses concerning the carcinogenesis in radiation-induced leucaemia in patients with polycythaemia vera, treated with 32P. In the latter patients, the clone cells are pressumed to represent cell populations with selective qualities, originating from radiation-damaged cells, which possibly possess an increased tendency to malignant transformation because of a more pronounced sensitivity to carcinogenic agents. The cells might also be potentially malignant and manifest themselves as leucaemic cells, if the patient's immunological defence mechanism is broken.","['Visfeldt, J', 'Jensen, G', 'Hippe, E']","['Visfeldt J', 'Jensen G', 'Hippe E']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Acta Pathol Microbiol Scand A,"Acta pathologica et microbiologica Scandinavica.

There are two requirements: the first is the prophylactic irradiation of the CNS in a systemic disease of the reticuloendothelial system mainly in acute lymphatic leukemia; the second is the treatment of solitary tumors in the CNS. Radiotherapy can improve dramatically the results obtained with intrathecal chemotherapy, particularly in leukemic involvement of the CNS in childhood. The fractionated single radiation dose should be increased slowly and total doses of 2 500 rd should not be exceeded. Prophylactic radiotherapy of the CNS in acute leukemia has to include the entire subarachnoid space. It is therefore necessary to irradiate the entire skull and spinal cord. This treatment schedule and its results will be discussed. There is a tendency to sue prophylactic radiotherapy in other systemic diseases of the RES as well. The indications and contraindications for this will be discussed. The methods and results of treatment of focal lesions with regard to the morphologic tumor pattern are discussed. Rare primary tumors of the CNS which have the histological features of lymphoma-sarcoma or reticulosarcoma have the best prognosis as far as radiotherapy is concerned.","['Karcher, K H', 'Jentzsch, K']","['Karcher KH', 'Jentzsch K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Acta Neuropathol Suppl,Acta neuropathologica.

Incorporation of radioactive phosphate into the cells from the patient samples was slightly less than that of the cell lines. Likewise, incorporation of (32P)-phosphate into the tRNA of the patient samples (approximately 5 x 106 DPM/mug tRNA) was also less then that incorporated into the tRNA of the cell lines.

The very low scores found at diagnosis rise when the disease is treated, and there is some inverse correlation between the NAP score and the absolute neutrophil count. Patients treated intensively developed high NAP scores. Elective splenectomy performed during the chronic phase of CGL is followed by a pronounced but transient neutrophilia and a concurrent striking rise in the NAP score. Similar changes were observed in patients without CGL who underwent splenectomy. These observations can be explained by assuming that newly formed neutrophils in CGL have a normal content of NAP but are rapidly sequestered in non-circulating extramedullary pools, whereas the circulating neutrophil with a typically low NAP content is a relatively aged cell which has lost enzyme activity. In subjects with or without CGL, removal of the spleen, a major site of such pooling, temporarily permits the circulation of newly formed neutrophils but eventually other organs assume the sequestering functions of the spleen. Thus the aberrations of NAP score seen in CGL might be attributable not to an intrinsic cellular defect but to an exaggeration of the granulocyte storage phenomena which also occur in subjects without CGL.","['Spiers, A S', 'Liew, A', 'Baikie, A G']","['Spiers AS', 'Liew A', 'Baikie AG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests/methods', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Leukemoid Reaction/enzymology', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Polycythemia/enzymology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/enzymology', 'Splenectomy', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",1975/07/01 00:00,1975/07/01 00:01,['1975/07/01 00:00'],"['1975/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.28.7.517 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1975 Jul;28(7):517-23. doi: 10.1136/jcp.28.7.517.,,"['EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",PMC475763

Fourteen patients with ALL responded to vincristine-prednisone induction therapy and two to induction therapy with CAV. The median duration of survival of the responding patients was 2.2 years, compared with 4 months for the patients who did not respond to treatment. Granulopoietic colony formation, assessed by assay of colony-forming units dependent on colony-stimulating activity in culture (CFU-C), was abnormal in 37 of 42 bone marrow aspirates from patients with AML before treatement. CFU-C concentration increased when leukocyte-conditioned medium (LCM) was added to the cultures; 13 cultures had normal or elevated CFU-C concentration with LCM. Marrow cells of patients with ALL or CML in blast crisis demonstrated a similar pattern. Serial studies of marrow CFU-C concentration of 31 patients with AML demonstrated a change to a normal pattern with successful remission induction. Results of this study suggest that administration of purified LCM to leukemic patients might increase granulocyte production from potential but unstimulated granulopoietic precursors.

Cobalophilin (earlier called R proteins or vitamin B12-binding proteins of R-type) was isolated from saliva and amniotic fluid in homogeneous form. It was found to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 59,300-69,100. The preparation from amniotic fluid contained 33% carbohydrate. Cobalophilin variants in plasma, serum, granulocytes, platelets, amniotic fluid, milk, saliva and gastric juice were characterized by isoelectric focusing. Most fluids and cells contained the same isoproteins, with pI values between 2.3 and 5.0. Isoproteins of presumably myelogenic origin (e.g. those in granulocytes and plasma) had pI values below 4.2, whereas those of glandular origin (in milk and saliva) had a pI range of 4.0-5.0. Serum contained more cobalophilin than plasma, owing to release of this protein from granulocytes during clotting. This phenomenon also changed the isoprotein pattern. Plasma and serum from newborn infants and from patients with leucocytosis, polycythaemia vera and chronic myelogenous leukaemia contained the same isoproteins as were found in plasma from healthy subjects. In addition to these, isoproteins with lower than 'normal' pI values were often found in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and occasionally in leucocytosis. It is concluded that cobalophilin from different fluids and cells is a single microheterogeneous protein with a variable carbohydrate composition. The distribution of cobalophilin in different body fluids and cells supports the suggestion that cobalophilin is an antimicrobial protein (Gullberg 1972) like lactoferrin and lysozyme.","['Stenman, U H']",['Stenman UH'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,IM,"['Amniotic Fluid/analysis', 'Blood Platelets/analysis', 'Blood Proteins/*analysis', 'Gastric Juice/analysis', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Granulocytes/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Leukocytosis/blood', 'Milk, Human/analysis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'Protein Binding', 'Saliva/analysis', 'Vitamin B 12/*analysis/blood']",1975/04/01 00:00,1975/04/01 00:01,['1975/04/01 00:00'],"['1975/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1975.tb00301.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1975 Apr;14(2):91-107. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1975.tb00301.x.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",

In chronic myelogenous leukaemia the high unsaturated vitamin B12-binding capacity of plasma was due to an increase in the fairly acid isoproteins, whereas in polycythaemia vera and in most cases of leukocytosis there was an increase in the least acid isoproteins.","['Stenman, U H']",['Stenman UH'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,IM,"['Blood Proteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Leukocytosis/*blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/*blood', 'Protein Binding', 'Vitamin B 12/*blood']",1975/03/01 00:00,1975/03/01 00:01,['1975/03/01 00:00'],"['1975/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00365517509087219 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 1975 Mar;35(2):157-61. doi: 10.1080/00365517509087219.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",

The disorder differs from the adult type by the early manifestation of anemia and thrombocytopenia, the minor degree of leucocytosis, the failure to demonstrate the Philadelphia chromosome, and the presence of fetal markers in the patients' erythrocytes. The persistence of fetal markers in erythrocytes and the clinical manifestation in infancy and early childhood suggest that the disease is congenital in origin. The occurrence of CML of the juvenile type in an 8-year-old boy, which is reported in this paper, favors a postnatal acquisition of the disorder.

We have detected chromosomally anomalous clones of lymphocytes in eight patients with this disorder. Chromosome banding disclosed that the clones are consistently marked by structural rearrangement of the long arm (q) of chromosome 14. A translocation involving 14q was found in clones obtained from seven of the eight patients whereas a ring 14 chromosome was found in a clone obtained from the other. These findings as well as data obtained by others for patients with ataxia-telangiectasia suggest that structural rearrangement of 14q is the initial chromosomal change in lymphocyte clones of patients with this disorder. Chromosomes of lymphocytes from one of the patients were studied before and after the onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Before leukemia was diagnosed, the patient had a lymphocyte clone with a 14q translocation. This clone appears to have given rise to the leukemic cells. We hypothesize that structural rearrangement of 14q is directly related to abnormal growth of lymphocytes and that it may be a step toward the development of lymphoid malignancies. Increasing evidence, provided by others, for the nonrandom involvement of 14q in African-type Burkitt's lymphoma and other lymphoid neoplasms further strengthens this hypothesis.","['McCaw, B K', 'Hecht, F', 'Harnden, D G', 'Teplitz, R L']","['McCaw BK', 'Hecht F', 'Harnden DG', 'Teplitz RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Male']",1975/06/01 00:00,1975/06/01 00:01,['1975/06/01 00:00'],"['1975/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.72.6.2071 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1975 Jun;72(6):2071-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.72.6.2071.,,,PMC432696

Dose-survival curves demonstrated that the D0 for HN2-sensitive cells (L5178Y) treated with HN2 in vitro was 9.79 ng/ml and the D0 for HN2-resistant cells (L5178Y/HN2) was 181.11 ng/ml; thus, sensitive cells were 18.5-fold more responsive than were resistant cells and the difference was highly significant (p less than 0.001). A similar evaluation of 5 additional alkylating agents, including chlorambucil, melphalan, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-l-nitrosourea, Mitomycin C, and 2,3,5-tris(ethyleneimino)-1,4-benzoquinone, revealed that L5178Y/HN2 cells were also cross-resistant, in part, to each of these compounds. Furthermore, the degree of cross-resistance was remarkably similar; for each drug, dose-survival studies showed that HN2-resistant cells were approximately 2- to 3-fold more resistant to therapy than were sensitive cells. L5178Y/HN2 cells were also cross-resistant to cyclophosphamide in vivo; after treatment with cyclophosphamide, DBA/2 female mice that were given inoculations of L5178Y cells, but not those given transplants of L5178Y/HN2 cells, showed a significant prolongation of survival time (p less than 0.01). Transport of HN2, hydrolyzed derivative of HN2 and choline by L5178Y lymphoblasts in vitro was not competitively inhibited by any of the other alkylating agents, suggesting that transport of these compounds was by an independent mechanism. These findings suggest that the mechanism whereby L5178Y/HN2 cells are cross-resistant to other alkylating agents may involve nontransport factors and that these other drugs may bypass a major portion of HN2 resistance by using independent transport systems.","['Goldenberg, G J']",['Goldenberg GJ'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biological Transport', 'Carmustine/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorambucil/toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/metabolism/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Melphalan/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitomycins/toxicity']",1975/07/01 00:00,1975/07/01 00:01,['1975/07/01 00:00'],"['1975/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1975 Jul;35(7):1687-92.,,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",

Acid-soluble adenosine triphosphate and guanosine triphosphate concentrations are greatly reduced initially, but guanosine triphosphate concentrations appear to recover partially by 10 hr. Acid-soluble uridine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate concentrations initially increase after methotrexate treatment but then, with time, they too decline. Hypoxanthine and guanine are more effective than is adenine in overcoming the methotrexate-induced inhibition of thymidine incorporation. These results suggest that, in the presence of methotrexate, guanine nucleotides become limiting for nucleic acid synthesis before adenine nucleotides do. The block of purine de novo synthesis in L5178Y cells by methotrexate is almost complete and is not reversed with time. This suggests that the additional purine nucleotides that are available for nucleic acid synthesis 8 to 10 hr after addition of methotrexate are being derived from nucleic acid breakdown. Consistent with this is the observed reduction in the number of polyribosomes and hence, presumably in messenger RNA levels.","['Hryniuk, W M', 'Brox, L W', 'Henderson, J F', 'Tamaoki, T']","['Hryniuk WM', 'Brox LW', 'Henderson JF', 'Tamaoki T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosine Nucleotides/biosynthesis', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Guanine/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Purines/*biosynthesis', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Uracil Nucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1975/06/01 00:00,1975/06/01 00:01,['1975/06/01 00:00'],"['1975/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1975 Jun;35(6):1427-32.,,"['0 (Cytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",

A number of structural defects were observed: (1) giant platelets, (2) marked variability in the number and size of cytoplasmic granules, (3) dilatation of the open channel system, (4) cytoplasmic vacuolization, and (5) poorly delineated microtubular system. Metabolic defects included reduced cellular concentrations of ATP and ADP and selective reduction of the storage pool (non-metabolic) nucleotides. Stimulation of platelets was associated with delayed and incomplete granule migration, reduced degranulation, subnormal release of ATP and ADP, and poor platelet aggregate formation. The structural and metabolic defects observed indicate abnormalities exist in the contractile mechanism and the release reaction of platelets in acute leukemia which partly explain the functional defects reported previously. Platelets from patients with pre-leukemic states share some of the structural and metabolic defects seen in acute leukemia. The defects are less uniform consistent with a lesser degree of functional impairment than seen in acute leukemia. Studies of megakaryocytic ultrastructure suggest that the structural defects seen in acute leukemia and pre-leukemia may arise in the late stages of megakaryocyte maturation.","['Cowan, D H', 'Graham, R C Jr']","['Cowan DH', 'Graham RC Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Denmark,Ser Haematol,Series haematologica (1968),101650673,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/blood/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/ultrastructure', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Time Factors', 'Vacuoles/ultrastructure']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ser Haematol. 1975;8(1):68-100.,,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",

Case material and therapeutic results].,1642-52,"In the five years period 1969-1973, 22 cases of acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and 75 of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were observed in adults. In ALL, complete remission was obtained in 61% of cases. The median duration of remission worked out to be 3 months in the group of patients who died and more than 6 months in the patients still alive. The mean survival time was 7,8 and more than 10,6 months respectively. The various regimens of treatment used in the phase of induction appeared to be equally effective, whilst cyclic chemotherapy was found to be preferable in maintaining remission. As far as AML is concerned, complete remission was achieved in 25% of the patients with stem cells leukaemia, 50% in myeloblastic leukaemia and 33% in mielyomoocytic leulaemia. The median duration of remission was 3,5 and 9 months respectively. No case of promyelocytic leukaemia and erythroleukaemia achieved complete remission. The mean survival time was 3,4 months in stem cells leukaemia, 6 months in myeloblastic leukaemia, 6,6 months in myelomonocytic leukaemia, 0,4 months in promyelocytic leukaemia and 2,5 months in erythroleukaemia. In stem cells leukaemia, the highest frequency of remission was found in patients aged 13 to 20 years, whilst in myeloblastic and myelomonocytic leukaemia the most favourable results were obtained in patients aged 50 to 70 and 20 to 50 respectively. The longest mediam duration of remission and the best survival time was obtained in myelomonocytic leukaemia. The best rate of remission was achieved in the patients whose initial leukocyte count ranged from 10.000 to 50.000/mm-3. No patient with an initial WBC count above 50.000/mm-3 entered complete remission. The frequency of complete remission worked out to be much higher in the patients treated with cyclic chemotherapy according to the Hammersmith protocol, except in the case of stem cells leukaemia.","['Paolino, W', 'Resegotti, L', 'Rossi, M', 'Infelise, V', 'Degani, G F']","['Paolino W', 'Resegotti L', 'Rossi M', 'Infelise V', 'Degani GF']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",1975/05/09 00:00,1975/05/09 00:01,['1975/05/09 00:00'],"['1975/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1975/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Med. 1975 May 9;66(35):1642-52.,Leucemia acuta.

The activity of the membrane fragments reflected the activity of the whole cells in that cells which did not form rosettes (P3J and RPMI 4098) resulted in inactive membranes and cells with high rosette formation (NC37 and Raji) yielded highly active membrane fragments. Two test systems were devised to detect these receptor activities, namely a rosette inhibition and a hemagglutination assay. Solubilization of C3 receptors was accomplished by extraction of active plasma membrane fragments with 2 MKBr. Dissociation and reassociation experiments suggest C3b and C3d receptors to be highly complex molecular structures.

Fourteen patients died within 14 days after admission to hospital. In 15 cases partial remissions, rather short-lasting, were achieved. In 4 cases the remissions were complete and in 3 of them the survival exceeds now 3 years.

Normal peripheral blood lymphocytes were tagged with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) at a ratio of 10-11 molecules/cell. Various concentrations of WGA were added to leukemic or tagged or untagged normal lymphocytes and incubated for 20 minutes at 37 degrees C, after which agglutination was scored visually. A readily discernible quantitative difference in the agglutinability of leukemic and DNP-tagged versus untagged normal cells was seen at all concentrations of WGA in the range of 50-800 mug/ml. The reaction was maximal when a ratio of 10-11 molecules of DNFB/cell was used for tagging and decreased progressively with 10-8, 10-6, 10-4, 0r 10-2 molecules. The agglutination of leukemic and DNP-tagged normal lymphocytes by 200 mug/ml of WGA was completely blocked by 0.1 M N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) while as low a concentration as 0.001 M GlcNAc inhibited the reactivity of untagged cells. Since the agglutination of leukemic and DNP-tagged normal lymphocytes was equally inhibited by GlcNAc, this suggests that the same or similar receptor sites were involved in the two reactions. On the basis of our observations we propose that the initial step in the agglutination of leukemic and DNP-tagged normal lymphocytes by WGA IS THE BINDING OF THE LECTIN TO SPECIFIC RECEPTORS RATHER Than to DNP residues on the cell surface, since leukemic cells tagged with DNFB did not show increased agglutinability.","['Madyastha, P R', 'Barth, R F', 'Madyastha, K R']","['Madyastha PR', 'Barth RF', 'Madyastha KR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/pharmacology', '*Agglutination/drug effects', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Dinitrophenols/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1975/03/01 00:00,1975/03/01 00:01,['1975/03/01 00:00'],"['1975/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975 Mar;54(3):597-600.,,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Lectins)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",

Blood leukocytes were isolated and incubated with (U-14C) isoleucine. Separation of metabolic intermediates was accomplished by sequential extraction. The rate of isoleucine incorporation into protein by immature cells from untreated patients with acute leukemia (15.9 plus or minus 2.4 nmoles/hr per 10-8 leukocytes) was considerably higher than the rates of incorporation by mature neutrophils (3.2 plus or minus 0.5 nmoles/hr per 10-8 leukocytes), lymphocytes (7.7 plus or minus 1.2 nmoles/hr per 10-8 leukocytes), and eosinophils (6.2 plus or minus 1.3 nmoles/hr per 10-8 leukocytes). Those cell preparations with more blast cells had higher rates of protein synthesis. In addition, those cells with greater thymidine incorporation had higher rates of protein synthesis. The leukocytes both oxidized isoleucine and incorporated it into cell isoleucine and incorporated it into cell lipid. The rates of these metabolic processes were characteristic for various types and maturity of leukocytes. This study demonstrates a relationship of rate of protein synthesis to leukocyte immaturity. This relationship is maintained in neoplastic leukocytes. It suggests that the requirement of the mitotic process for newly synthesized protein is greater than that for the elaboration of the protein products of the mature leukocyte.","['Burns, C P']",['Burns CP'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blood Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoleucine/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Lipids/isolation & purification', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1975/05/01 00:00,1975/05/01 00:01,['1975/05/01 00:00'],"['1975/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68171-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1975 May;45(5):643-51.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lipids)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",

Interpretation of patterns in disease.,287-93,"The technique described in the preceding paper was applied to 12 abnormal sera selected for their increase in one or more B12-binding proteins. Even in the presence of large amounts of R-type binder, the ammonium sulfate technique gave a reliable separation of R binding proteins from TC II. Measurement of the TC II in abnormal sera gave results identical to those obtained by the more standard gel filtration. The R binders of four subjects with myeloproliferative disease were further separated into alpha2-R and alpha1-R. The pattern of B12 binding of polycythemia vera (PV) was an exaggeration of the normal pattern. Binding to alpha2-R was three to four times that to alpha1-R, although the total amounts bound to both were increased. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), both alpha2-R and alpha1-R were also increased, but in contrast to binding in normal sera, alpha1-R predominated. In order to interpret the findings, either whole serum R or alpha1-R and alpha2-R from patients with myeloproliferative disease were subject to isoelectric focusing. Alpha2-R consisted pricipally of components isoelectric at pH 2.9, 3.0, and 3.1. These components were present in only minor amounts in normal serum and were somewhat increased in the serum of PV. These components were very much increased in the serum of CML and predominated. Alpha2-R consisted of those components isoelectric at pH 3.4,3.6, and 4.0. These components predominated in the unsaturated binding capacity of normal sera and that of PV. It was concluded that the division of plasma R binders into alpha1-R and alpha1-R by the technique described provided information useful in the study of myeloproliferative diseases.","['Begley, J A', 'Hall, C A']","['Begley JA', 'Hall CA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Ammonium Sulfate', 'Blood Proteins/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*blood', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', '*Protein Binding', '*Vitamin B 12']",1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66576-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1975 Feb;45(2):287-93.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'SU46BAM238 (Ammonium Sulfate)']",

A propsective evaluation of the drug was undertaken in a randomized comparison with busulfan. Forty previously untreated, Philadelphia chromosome-positive cases were treated, with 20 patients in each treatment group. The protocol provided for continuous maintenance therapy after remission induction, with a crossover to the opposite drug in patients who became refractory to the primary agent but are without evidence of blastic tranformation. There were 14 remissions in the DBM group and 15 in those treated with busulfan. The rate of decrease of the elevated leukocyte count was more rapid with DBM, but prolonged disease control off treatment occurred in only three of 14 cases as opposed to nine of fifteen busulfan-treated patients who required a median delay of 12 mo before maintenance could be initiated. Hypoplasia occurred in one DBM patient and two busulfan cases. Following recovery, crossover to the opposite drug in two cases again resulted in hypopllasia. Increased skin pigmentation, amenorrhea, pulmonary fibrosis, and cytologic dysplasia, commonly associated with busulfan adminstration, were also noted with DBM. The median duration of disease control with busulfan was 34 mo and 26 mo with DBM. There was no signigicant difference in the incidence of blastic transformation, and median survival for both groups was 44 mo. DBM appears to be as effective as busulfan in the treatment of the chronic phase of CGL but with a more predictable myelosuppressive action. The principal advantage of busulfan over DBM is the fact that more than half the busulfan-treated patients experienced prolonged disease control off treatment.","['Canellos, G P', 'Young, R C', 'Neiman, P E', 'DeVita, V T Jr']","['Canellos GP', 'Young RC', 'Neiman PE', 'DeVita VT Jr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amenorrhea/chemically induced', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mannitol/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', 'Skin Pigmentation']",1975/02/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/02/11 19:15'],"['1975/02/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/02/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66566-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1975 Feb;45(2):197-203.,,"['3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",

Of leukemic children born in areas for which information on past influenza activity was available, the population-based Alameda County Cancer Registry recorded 89 cases during 1960-1969, the California Tumor Registry recorded 653 cases during 1950-1970, and Children's Hospital recorded 575 cases during 1957-1972. Flu epidemics were identified and flu cohorts constructed such that leukemic children who could have been in utero during a flu epidemic constituted a flu cohort. Based on the total number of leukemia cases reported and the proportion of at-risk weeks contributed by the flu cohort, expected numbers of leukemia cases from the flu cohort were computed for each age. In each series, there was an excess of leukemia cases in the flu cohort, contributed primarily by the 0-4 age group. Trimester analysis indicated that the greatest excess occurred in children who were in the first trimester of gestation during a flu epidemic. Incidence data from the Cancer Incidence System of the San Francisco Bay Area Resource for Cancer Epidemiology and the Third National Cancer Survey show a relative risk of 3.4 for this group. Due to sources of misclassification in this study, such as analysis of flu cohorts rather than individuals whose mothers actually had influenza during pregnancy, the results tend to be diluted. If influenza is a causative factor, the actual increase in leukemia risk is likely to be much greater than this analysis indicates.","['Austin, D F', 'Karp, S', 'Dworsky, R', 'Henderson, B E']","['Austin DF', 'Karp S', 'Dworsky R', 'Henderson BE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Influenza, Human/*complications/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*complications/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*complications/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Risk', 'Statistics as Topic']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112074 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1975 Jan;101(1):77-83. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112074.,,,

This study was designed to determine if dimethylsulfoxide causes the expression of erythroid differentiation by an effect on a particular phase of the cell division cycle. The infected cells were synchronized by exposure to 2 mM thymidine. It is shown that dimethylsulfoxide must be present during DNA synthesis (S-phase) and, possibly, shortly thereafter, to induce differentiation assayed by measuring hemoglobin synthesis. In order to achieve an effective intracellular incorporation of dimethylsulfoxide, cells must be exposed to the agent for at least 24-30 hr before the critical S phase.

HBAg was detected at some time in 17 patients, and HBAb in 40 patients. Seventeen patients who had HBAb detected immediately pretreatment had a decrease in HBAb titer which paralleled the fall in white blood cell count. In 5 of these patients, HBAg appeared when HBAb titers fell. In 3 of the 5 patients, a reappearance of HBAb was observed with disappearance of HBAg from the serum, and in the 2 other patients HBAg persisted once it appeared. In all 3 patients who had HBAg at the time of initiation of chemotherapy, bone marrow suppression was associated with a marked increase in HBAg titer. The increase in HBAg titer was associated with hepatocellular damage, as manifested by an elevation in serum transaminase enzymes. These observations suggest that antitumor chemotherapeutic agents reduce HBAb titers. In some patients, HBAg appears after a decrease in HBAb titers. In patients with preexisting HBAg, such therapy leads to large increases in HBAg titer. Whether this appearance or increase of HBAg is related to an inhibition of antibody formation, allowing expression of preexisting antigen, or to an inhibition of cellular immunity, allowing viral proliferation, is uncertain.","['Wands, J R', 'Chura, C M', 'Roll, F J', 'Maddrey, W C']","['Wands JR', 'Chura CM', 'Roll FJ', 'Maddrey WC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antibodies, Viral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Hepatitis B Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Procarbazine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0016508575000005 [pii]'],ppublish,Gastroenterology. 1975 Jan;68(1):105-12.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antigens)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",

As an index of the thymineless state, we measured the effect of MTX on conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate. This was measured as the rate of incorporation of tritiated deoxyuridine into DNA, but it was corrected for changes in incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Thus we derived the ""calculated tritiated deoxyuridine rate."" During the MTX treatment, the calculated tritiated deoxyuridine rate decreased rapidly at first and then more slowly. The slow 2nd-phase block was not reversed by hypoxanthine. As the 2nd-phase block deepened, the lymphoblasts continued to die (loss of cloning ability) but recovered the ability to incorporate tritiated thymidine into DNA. After 7 hr of MTX treatment, the kinetics of the 2nd-phase block in calculated tritiated deoxyuridine rate correlated closely with the kinetics of cell kill. Thus, MTX may inhibit dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, rapidly deplete S-phase L5178Y of reduced folates, and thus produce a purineless and thymineless state. As treatment continues, MTX intensifies the thymineless state, possibly by direct inhibition of thymidylate synthetase enzyme, and the cells die predominantly a thymineless death. The purineless state initially contributes to cell kill but later does not, possibly because it partially reverses spontaneously.","['Hryniuk, W M']",['Hryniuk WM'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1975/04/01 00:00,1975/04/01 00:01,['1975/04/01 00:00'],"['1975/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1975 Apr;35(4):1085-92.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",

In view of our new findings7 that normal mature human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) contain two types of granules, azurophils (1/3) and specifics (2/3), and that alkaline phosphatase is present only in specific granules, we undertook the present studies to determine whether these neoplastic PMN lack a specific granule population or simply lack the enzyme. The cellular buffy coats of five patients with CML (Ph1 plus, LAP minus) were fixed in glutaraldehyde, incubated for peroxidase to identify the azurophil population, and examined by electron microscopy. It was found that the specific granule population was present in all mature PMN. Counts of both azurophil and specific granules per cell were slightly lower than normal but were within an 80%-90% overlap of the normal range. We therefore conclude that the low level of LAP in patients with CML reflects a deficiency of the enzyme rather than a missing granule population. Although the mature PMN appeared relatively normal (with few exceptions), circulating myeloblasts and promyelocytes revealed several abnormalities, the most notable being the presence of large bundles of cytoplasmic microfilaments. The blood of two patients in the terminal phase of disease was reexamined. Most of their cells were immature, with aberrations similar to those in myeloblasts and promyelocytes in the chronic phase of the disorder. In addition, however, we discovered three adnormal populations of mature PMN: (1) PMN containing both populations of granules but lacking peroxidase, (2) PMN lacking specific granules, and (3) PMN lacking azurophil granules. Our findings emphasize the value of electron microscopy and cytochemistry in detecting abnormalities of maturation in the cytoplasm of leukemic PMN.","['Ullyot, J L', 'Bainton, D F']","['Ullyot JL', 'Bainton DF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', '*Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Peroxidases/blood']",1975/04/01 00:00,1975/04/01 00:01,['1975/04/01 00:00'],"['1975/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66517-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1975 Apr;45(4):469-82.,,['EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)'],

Its presence in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis lends biochemical support to the suggestion that some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia undergo a lymphoblastic rather than a myeloblastic crisis. The thymocyte and leukemic-cell enzyme have the same substrate and primer preference. Normal thymocytes and leukemic cells contain two forms of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase that can be separated by phosphocellulose chromatography.

The major form of labelled liver folate was found to be pteroylpentaglutamate in both hepatectomized and normal rats and there was no difference in the proportion of pteroylpentaglutamate to other forms of folate in the regenerating or resting liver. 3. Folate concentrations were also measured in leucocytes from normal and leukaemic patients. 4. Pteroylpolyglutamates constituted the main form of folate in both sets of cells. There was again no difference in proportion of pteroylpolyglutamate to pteroylmonoglutamate forms of folate between normal mature cells and primitive blast cells. 5. It is therefore suggested that pteroylpolyglutamates, which constitute nearly all the folates in cells actively synthesizing DNA and protein as well as in resting cells, probably act as the coenzymes in vivo for the folate-dependent reactions in DNA, RNA and protein synthesis in mammalian systems.","['Lavoie, A', 'Tripp, E', 'Parsa, K', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Lavoie A', 'Tripp E', 'Parsa K', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Sci Mol Med,Clinical science and molecular medicine,0367540,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/blood/*metabolism', 'Hepatectomy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/analysis/*metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', '*Liver Regeneration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rats']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/cs0480067 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Sci Mol Med. 1975 Jan;48(1):67-73. doi: 10.1042/cs0480067.,,['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)'],

Four years after the onset of the disease, a hematologic relapse occurred. Behavioral disorders became more severe and the child died after a period of seizures and unconsciousness. The main pathologic data obtained by the study of a brain biopsy and after a complete postmortem examination consisted of calcifications located bilaterally in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. No signs of leukemia were present. Cerebral calcification is an extremely rare complication in the course of the therapy of lymphocytic leukemia.

Whole brain radiation was also given either before or during intrathecal therapy. Three of the children had a progressive irreversible neurologic illness, which developed either at or shortly after the completion of combined triple intrathecal therapy, death ensuing approximately 2 months later. The neuropathologic lesions consisted of discrete multifocal necroses of coagulative type, apparently extending by confluence, and disseminated in the cerebral white matter in a random manner. In one case, extensive symmetrical demyelinating and necrotizing lesions involved the centrum ovale bilaterally. There was a remarkable absence of inflammatory cellular response and a relative paucity of macrophage reaction, with usually little or no tissue breakdown. In addition to demyelination and glial cell loss, there was striking axonal damage, with conspicuous axonal swelling both within and around the necrotizing lesions. The surrounding white matter showed focal status spongiosus and a moderate astrocytic response. Vascular fibrinoid necrosis was inconstant and, except in one case, rarely observed. The possible causal relationship of these lesions to combined triple intrathecal antimetabolite therapy and brain radiation is discussed.","['Rubinstein, L J', 'Herman, M M', 'Long, T F', 'Wilbur, J R']","['Rubinstein LJ', 'Herman MM', 'Long TF', 'Wilbur JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain/pathology/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/therapeutic use', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', '*Meninges', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197502)35:2<291::aid-cncr2820350202>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1975 Feb;35(2):291-305. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197502)35:2<291::aid-cncr2820350202>3.0.co;2-v.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",

Isolated clinical observations as well as both cytogenetic and cytokinetic evidence suggest that the spleen may play a special though not exclusive role in the development of undifferentiated cell clones which lead to metamorphosis of C.G.L. The results of a study of elective splenectomy during the chronic phase of the disease are reported. Twenty-six patients with C.G.L. underwent splenectomy during clinical remission of their disease, and there were no deaths after the operation. Twenty-one patients were alive at the time of writing, two of them eight years after splenectomy. Five cases of metamorphosis of C.G.L. to a refractory phase occurred whereas 10 would have been expected, a significant difference. After the onset of metamorphosis the quality of life was better in splenectomized than in non-splenectomized patients. These results show that splenectomy is a reasonable and safe procedure in C.G.L., and its apparently beneficial effects on prognosis justify a larger controlled clinical trial.","['Spiers, A S', 'Baikie, A F', 'Galton, D A', 'Richards, H G', 'Wiltshaw, E', 'Goldman, J M', 'Catovsky, D', 'Spencer, J', 'Peto, R']","['Spiers AS', 'Baikie AF', 'Galton DA', 'Richards HG', 'Wiltshaw E', 'Goldman JM', 'Catovsky D', 'Spencer J', 'Peto R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br Med J,British medical journal,0372673,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Splenectomy']",1975/01/25 00:00,1975/01/25 00:01,['1975/01/25 00:00'],"['1975/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.1.5951.175 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J. 1975 Jan 25;1(5951):175-9. doi: 10.1136/bmj.1.5951.175.,,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",PMC1672174

The source of these granulocytic colonies was found in a population of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes which could be separated from the more mature granulocytic cells of the peripheral blood by sedimentation of the buffy coat on Ficoll-Hypaque. The predominance of granulocytic colonies is in contrast to our observations previously made on the peripheral blood of children with ""juvenile"" type(Ph1 chromosome negative)CGL in which large numbers of exclusively monocytic colonies were produced in tissue culture. These current studies, when interpreted in light of relevant clinical data, suggest that the ""juvenile"" and ""adult"" types of CGL represent two very different forms of chronic leukemia in childhood. The Ph1 chromosome negative form may be classified as a monocytic leukemia with a granulocytic component but the Ph1 chromosome positive adult form, even when it occurs in a child, appears to be a true granulocytic leukemia.","['Altman, A J', 'Baehner, R L']","['Altman AJ', 'Baehner RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/classification/genetics', 'Monocytes']",1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(75)80472-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(75)80472-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1975 Feb;86(2):221-4. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(75)80472-0.,,,

Progression of cells to G2 phase during the period of exposure to the agent is not a requisite for cell-killing, because cells exposed for periods insufficient to permit their accumulation in G2 are killed.","['Wheeler, G P', 'Bono, V H', 'Bowdon, B J', 'Adamson, D J', 'Wallace, R']","['Wheeler GP', 'Bono VH', 'Bowdon BJ', 'Adamson DJ', 'Wallace R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy']",1976/09/01 00:00,1976/09/01 00:01,['1976/09/01 00:00'],"['1976/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1976 Sep;60(9):1307-16.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)']",

A possible relationship of the free cytoplasmic mononucleotide with the nucleotide in the tRNA for control of mammalian cell protein synthesis in vivo was investigated by addition of N6-(delta2-isopentenyl)adenosine to the culture medium.

The reaction of 5 with 2,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-D-ribofuranosyl chloride gave a mixture of the 7-, 8-, and 9-(2,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-8-azapurines 4a-c which was converted to 8-azaguanosine (7c) and the corresponding 7- and 8-substituted isomers 7a and 7b. 4a-c were also converted with NaOMe to 6-O-methyl-8-azaguanosine (8c) and to the corresponding 7- and 8-substituted isomers 8a and 8b. The preferred route, however, to 6-substituted 8-azaguanosine analogues is an unambigous synthesis through N2-acetyl-6-(benzylthio)-N4-(2,3-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-5-nitro-2 ,4-pyrimidinediamine (13), prepared from the reaction of the chloropyrimidine 10 with the aminoribose 11.

Treatment of beta-20 with dilute acid gave 7-(benzylthio)-3-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-3H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-5-amine (19). Replacement of the benzylthio group of 19 with various nucleophilic reagents gave 8-aza-6-thioguanosine 17 and analogues 8c, 15, and 16.

However, when these cells had been treated with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VCN) prior to injection, tumor deaths did not occur. Both untreated and VCN-treated L1210 cells elicited a humoral response, as manifested by an increasing percent of cells in the spleen and peritoneal cavity, with various types of membrane-associated immunoglobulins. Progressive tumor growth was associated with a large percent of peritoneal exudate (PE) cells bearing membrane-associated IgG, a late increase in the percent of PE cells with IgG, and only a small percent of PE cells with IgM on their surfaces. Conversely, PE cells from mice given VCN-treated L1210 cells were characterized by a small percent with IgG, an early increase in percent of cells with IgG, and a large percent with membrane-associated IgM. An injection of VCN-treated L1210 cells into mice with progressively growing L1210 tumors caused frequent tumor remissions, with a corresponding alteration of the ongoing humoral responses. Both the degree of alteration and the number of cures depended on the tumor burden at the time VCN-treated tumor cells were injected.

The metabolic half-life of each antigen was distinct from the others examined. The half-life of TL antigens was 18 hr; in cells exposed to TL antiserum, it changed to 9 hr. In RADA-1 cells, the half-life of TL antigens was 16 hr; in the presence of TL antiserum it became 4 hr. The half-lives of H-2a antigens and the tumor-associated antigen were unaffected by specific antiserum. Somatic hybrids of ASL-1 or RADA-1 cells were formed with LM(TK)-cells, a thymidine kinase deficient mutant of mouse L cells. Hybrid cells formed TL antigens, but unlike their parental cells their half-life of expression, approximately 30 hr, was unaffected by TL antiserum. Hybrid cells failed to undergo antigenic modulation under conditions more stringent than required to stimulate the modulation of ASL-1 or RADA-1 cells. The hybrids formed the tumor-associated antigen of their murine leukemia parental cells; however, the metabolic rate of the tumor antigen in hybrid cells was defferent than the metabolic rate of the analogous antigen in parental cells. Hybrid cells formed H-2 antigens of both parental sources, and possessed a hybrid karyotype. The half-life of H-2 antigens, approximately 26 hr, was the same both in parental and hybrid cells. H-2a antiserum had no detectable effect upon the metabolism of TL antigens in hybrid or parental cells; nor did TL antiserum have an effect upon the metabolism of H-2a antigens.","['Cohen, E P', 'Liang, W']","['Cohen EP', 'Liang W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fucose/metabolism', 'HLA Antigens', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Precipitin Tests']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1976;9:89-99.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)']",

Trinitrophenylated and inactivated Moloney induced YAC tumor cells (YAC-TNP) were able to induce the production of cytotoxic antibodies in low responding A/J mice, while inactivated YAC tumor cells (YAC-In) failed to induce such a response. Furthermore, A mice which were injected with YAC-TNP rejected 103 viable YAC tumor cells at a higher frequency than those injected with YAC-In. B. Trinitrophenylated and inactivated Gross virus induced G-35 tumor cells or Monoloney induced LSTRA cells (both syngeneic in BALB/c mice) were as immunogenic as nonmodified inactivated tumor cells. About 50% of the immunized mice survived indefinitely after injection of 103 viable tumors. Fruthermore, spleen cells from mice primed with either modified or nonomodified G-35 cells responded in vitro to G-35 in a mixed leukocyte tumor interaction and generated specific cell-mediated cytotoxic activity to 51Cr-G-35 syngeneic tumors. However, the donors of the primed cells did not produce detectable cytotoxic antibodies to G-35. C. In vitro sensitization of C57B1 spleen cells by trinitrophenylated Mitomycin C treated syngeneic EL-4 generated a stronger cytotoxic response to EL-4 cells than obtained by sensitization with Mitomycin C treated EL-4 cells alone, The superiority of the sensitizing capacity of trinitrophenylated EL-4 was readily demonstrated in conditions which were suboptimal for nonmodified Mitomycin C treated tumor.

There was evidence of an interactive effect in the association of work and smoking histories with pulmonary disability retirement.","['Tyroler, H A', 'Andjelkovic, D', 'Harris, R', 'Lednar, W', 'McMichael, A', 'Symons, M']","['Tyroler HA', 'Andjelkovic D', 'Harris R', 'Lednar W', 'McMichael A', 'Symons M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Chemical Industry', 'Chronic Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lung Diseases/complications/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Rubber', 'Smoking/complications', 'United States']",1976/10/01 00:00,1976/10/01 00:01,['1976/10/01 00:00'],"['1976/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.761713 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1976 Oct;17:13-20. doi: 10.1289/ehp.761713.,,['9006-04-6 (Rubber)'],PMC1475252

The compartment model of Bischoff and Dedrick is extended to the intracellular level by inclusion of equations describing the phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and deamination of ara-C with enzymatic feedback control. The activities of kinase, deaminase, and phosphatase are explicitly included in the models and are estimated from relevant data. Cell proliferation is described by a continuous-flow mathematic model in which cellular maturation and cell-to-cell variability in maturation rates are key variables. Cell proliferation is related to intracellular biochemistry through mathematic expressions which relate cell lethality and progression delay to the time course of intracellular ara-CTP. In vitro and in vivo experiments performed in a number of laboratories are compared by simulation. The most sensitive parameters in dose-response and cell-survival simulations are deoxycytidine kinase activity, ara-CTP half-life, renal clearance of ara-C, and cell-kinetic parameters for proliferation and cell killing. Progression delay is vital to the realistic simulation of divided-dose schedules. By comparative simulation we have identified areas of uncertainty which can be classified by a few additional measurements. The applications of simulations combining pharmacokinetic, biochemical, and cell-kinetic data in vitro and in vivo are discussed, exploring consistency among different measurements, and relating experimental protocols to clinical treatment.","['Lincoln, T', 'Morrison, P', 'Aroesty, J', 'Carter, G']","['Lincoln T', 'Morrison P', 'Aroesty J', 'Carter G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Computers', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Time Factors']",1976/12/01 00:00,1976/12/01 00:01,['1976/12/01 00:00'],"['1976/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1976 Dec;60(12):1723-39.,,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],

Kinetics of biochemiluminescence of muscles homogenates and muscular tissue tumours (Moloney's sarcoma) and that of chemiluminescence of total lipids extracted from the muscular and tumour tissue were studied as well. A sharp increase in the intensity of lipids biochemiluminiscence and decrease in the tissue homogenates biochemiluminiscence were observed during the period of progressive tumour growth on the 6-8 days following introduction of the virus. At the same time the values of the antioxidative activity and antiradical activity of the tissue lipids bioantioxidants were minimal. Results of this investigation suggest that the expenditure of bioantioxidants are rather active during the period of progressive tumour growth. The regularities of the changes in biochemiluminescence intensity in the muscle tissue homogenates with viral carcinogenesis cannot be explained exceptionally by an increase in the amount of bioantioxidants in the tumour tissue lipids.

A formalin vaccine was employed which was able to protect mice against the development of virus-induced Rauscher leukemia: 8/12 vaccinated mice survived versus 1/12 controls. When mice so immunized were challenged with near-threshold doses of chemical carcinogen, sarcoma incidence and death latency did not differ between vaccinated and control groups: within 10 months, a 320 mug dose of methylcholanthrene induced 100% sarcomas in both groups, while a 64 mug dose induced 62% and 65% tumors in vaccinated and control mice respectively. Thus, a relevant postulate of the oncogene hypothesis could not be supported by these studies. Formalin treatment neutralizes the oncogenic effect of mouse leukemia viruses yiwlding preparations that are immunogenic and can be successfully used as vaccines to protect against virus-induced leukemia (5). The finding of murine leukemia viruses in chemically induced tumors (1, 2) poses the question of whether these viruses are present in the tumors as passengers, or whether they are etiologically involved in the process of tumor induction. An approach to answering this question would be to challenge with chemical carcinogens mice which have been vaccinated with leukemia virus. If the virus were somehow involved in tumor induction, antiviral immunization might conceivably interfere with chemical carcinogenesis. Whitmire and Huebner (9) have reported that mice immunized with formalin-treated leukemia viruses, become resistant to sarcomagenesis by methylcholanthrene. Repetition of this experiment by Gericke and Chandra (6) gave non-significant differences between experimental and control groups. The present paper deals with the effect of immunization against Rauscher leukemia virus upon tumor induction by near-threshold doses of methylcholanthrene.","['Basombrio, M A', 'Pasqualini, C D']","['Basombrio MA', 'Pasqualini CD']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,IM,"['Animals', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Experimental/prevention & control', 'Methylcholanthrene', 'Mice', 'Rauscher Virus/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/chemically induced/*prevention & control', '*Viral Vaccines']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1976;46(8):630-3.,,"['0 (Viral Vaccines)', '56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)']",

One line (MS-2) was subject only to continuous tissue culture transfer (tct). After 21 tct, MS-2 cells produced progressive tumors (MS-2 tumors) in syngeneic hosts. The second cell line (MS-2T) was established by cultivation of a MS-2 tumor. The ability to produce progressive tumors decreased with increased number of tct, in both cell lines. The virus content of MS-2 and MS-2T cells was very low, as shown by uridine incorporation and electron microscopy. Immmunofluorescence tests demonstrated that antigens different from the viral MSV-M antigens were present on the cell lines, and that antigenic changes occurred with increased number of tct. Serum of mice bearing progressive MS-2 tumors reacted with MS-2T cells when these cells produced progressive tumors and did not react with MS-2 cells when they produced regressing tumors. MS-2 cells producing regressing tumors reacted with serum from mice in which the MS-2 tumor had regressed and with serum from mice immunized with MS-2T cells at late tct when they were poorly oncogenic. The antigenic changes seemed, therefore, to parallel the decrease of malignancy. A chromosomal analysis carried out on MS-2 and MS-2T cells, when both produced progressive tumors, showed a modal number of 48 and 44, respectively. MS-2T cells showed a large acrocentric chromosome. In contrast, the MS-2 cells at late tct, when they gave regressing tumors, showed a modal number of 60 and a wide range of distribution of chromosome number.","['Di Marco, A', 'Dasdia, T', 'Giuliani, F', 'Necco, A', 'Casazza, A M', 'Mora, P T', 'Luborsky, S W', 'Waters, L']","['Di Marco A', 'Dasdia T', 'Giuliani F', 'Necco A', 'Casazza AM', 'Mora PT', 'Luborsky SW', 'Waters L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes/analysis', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology']",1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1976 Jul-Aug;62(4):415-28.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",

It is also a factor in deciding the level of expenditure to reduce radiation levels experienced by workers. Here we discuss some of the difficulties in analysing the situation and present the results of some calculations which estimate the expected age-specific radiation mortalities from all inducible cancers and also from leukaemia separately. Using a high value for the average occupational exposure and a conservative estimate of the associated risk, we find that a survey of mortality among radiation workers must run over many years before sufficient data would be accumulated to resolve the effects of radiation-induced neoplasms from those arising from other causes. We show the advisability of determining the cause of death both of persons who remain employed in the industry and all for only a short time. Our estimates are based on maintenance of an occupationally exposed dose of one rad per person per year during the period of the survey which may extend over several decades. However, scaling of the estimates to any other exposure rates is easily performed. We also give estimates of the lowest risk coefficients detectable in a given observation time. Since for a work force of 3000 these lowest detectable values are an order of magnitude larger than those expected, it is clear that only a national or international survey can produce data adequate for even modest objectives.","['Reissland, J A', 'Kay, P', 'Dolphin, G W']","['Reissland JA', 'Kay P', 'Dolphin GW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Phys Med Biol,Physics in medicine and biology,0401220,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",1976/11/01 00:00,1976/11/01 00:01,['1976/11/01 00:00'],"['1976/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0031-9155/21/6/001 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Med Biol. 1976 Nov;21(6):903-19. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/21/6/001.,,,

In hemodialysis staphylococci and gram-negative rods are shown to occur with equal frequency. The most important clinical manifestation of septicaemia is fever with rigor. The poor prognosis in gram-negative septicaemia is mainly due to the onset of septic shock. Skin colonisation is often a typical sign of septicaemia and can also sometimes serve as a diagnostic indication. Hemorrhagic pustules surrounded by a zone of inflammation are typical in septicaemia caused by meningococci or gonococci.

A quantitative study of the chromatin constituents at various times after infection indicated that they vary in the same temporal manner as the rate of RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei.

Evidence for this conclusion was obtained mainly by electron spin resonance (ESR) studies and by the determination of the catalase activity. ESR spectra of leukemic blood revealed an additional signal not present in spectra of healthy blood. Investigation of different blood fractions has shown that this signal is caused by a species present in the leukocytes only. Addition of reduced glutathione to healthy blood immediately after blood drawing resulted in the same signal. On the contrary, oxidizing substances, such as oxidized glutathione and KMnO4, added to the blood of leukemic patients immediately after its drawing, caused a disappearance of this signal depending on the concentration. Since the strongly reducing substances causes a reduction in the concentration of the oxidizing substances in biological systems, the H2O2 levels should be also affected and, thus, the catalase activity, too. As expected, the activity of this enzyme in the leukemic blood seems to be considerably lower than in healthy blood.","['Lohmann, W']",['Lohmann W'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Catalase/*blood', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/enzymology/*microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxides/blood', 'Reference Values']",1976/12/23 00:00,1976/12/23 00:01,['1976/12/23 00:00'],"['1976/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01331172 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 1976 Dec 23;13(4):281-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01331172.,,"['0 (Peroxides)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",

Either newborn mice which can be considered as essentially fully differentiated animals were infected with M-MuLV or preimplantation mouse embryos were infected in vitro at the 4-8 cell stage, a stage of development before any differentiation has taken place. After surgical transfer to the uteri of pseudopregnant surrogate mothers, the latter developed to term and adult mice. In both cases, animals were obtained that had developed an M-MuLV induced leukemia. Molecular hybridization tests for the presence of M-MuLV-specific sequences were conducted on DNA extracted from different tissues of leukemic animals to determine which tissues were successfully infected by the virus. Mice which were infected as newborns carried M-MuLV-specific DNA sequences in ""target tissues"" only, i. e., thymus, spleen, lymph nodes or in organs infiltrated by tumor cells, whereas ""non-target tissues"" did not carry virus-specific sequences. In contrast, when leukemic animals derived from M-MuLV-infected preimplantation embryos were analyzed, virus-specific sequences were detected in target tissues as well as in non-target tissues, such as liver, kidney, brain, testes and the germ line. To study the expression of the viral DNA integrated in target and non-target organs, RNA was extracted from different tissues of an animal infected at the preimplantation stage. Fifty to 100 times more M-MuLV-specific RNA was detected in tumor tissues than was found in non-target organs. Since all organs contained the same amount of virus-specific DNA, these results indicate that the integrated virus genome can be differentially expressed in different tissues. The organ-tropism of RNA tumor viruses is discussed in view of these findings. Mice that were infected at the preimplantation stage were found to have M-MuLV integrated into their germ line. Virus transmission from the father to the offspring occurred according to simple Mendelian expectations. Molecular hybridization tests revealed that in the animals studied, the virus was integrated into the germ line at only one out of two or three possible integration sites. During the development of leukemia amplification of this virus copy was observed in the target tissues only, but not in the non-target tissues.","['Jaenisch, R', 'Dausman, J', 'Cox, V', 'Fan, H']","['Jaenisch R', 'Dausman J', 'Cox V', 'Fan H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Hamatol Bluttransfus,Hamatologie und Bluttransfusion,7804332,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/microbiology', 'Blood/microbiology', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Embryo, Mammalian/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_35 [doi]'],ppublish,Hamatol Bluttransfus. 1976;19:341-56. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_35.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",

In order to answer some of the basic questions about the control mechanisms of cellular changes and the order in which they proceed one must have access to homogeneous classes of cells. Friend virus transformed erythroid cells which are stably maintained in tissue culture can be chemically induced to differentiate and are thus very advantageous for in vitro studies (1-3). With such a system the questions which we pose are a) the reversibility of the differentiation process; b) the order of steps in the production of specialized messenger RNA; c) the time of shut-off of undifferentiated messenger production; d) the relationship of viral RNA production to the differentiation process; e) the onset and extent of specific protein synthesis; f) the correlation of DNA metabolism with the timing or course of events. By using a computer-controlled cell separator we can select live cells on the basis of their macromolecular content, membrane properties (using a new parameter, fluorescence emission anisotropy), and size (4, 5, 34). Thus with proper probes as described here, we are able to select cells at different stages in their differentiation and can begin to attack the questions posed above.","['Arndt-Jovin, D J', 'Ostertag, W', 'Eisen, H', 'Jovin, T M']","['Arndt-Jovin DJ', 'Ostertag W', 'Eisen H', 'Jovin TM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Hamatol Bluttransfus,Hamatologie und Bluttransfusion,7804332,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/physiology', '*Cell Separation/instrumentation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Computers', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Isoantibodies', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A/metabolism']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Hamatol Bluttransfus. 1976;19:137-49. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_14.,,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",

Combination immunochemotherapy of P388 leukemia and Lewis lung carcinoma with C. parvum and adriamycin was better than either regimen alone in increasing the lifespan of mice with tumors. The results show that the effects of C. parvum are due to nonspecific stimulation of the host rather than direct cytotoxic action on tumor cells. C. parvum protected the mice when given before as well as after tumor challenge. In vitro 51Cr-release assay showed that the peritoneal cells were cytotoxic to P388 tumor cells but spleen cells were not. While the C. parvum was effective against P388 in conventional mice, it was ineffective against P388 growing in athymic (nude) mice.

Diagnosis of these states is facilitated by the identification of anomalies in all the myeloid cell lines (i.e., those derived from the bone marrow). These cellular anomalies may be morphologic, biochemical, or functional in nature or may affect the quantity of cell in each line in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood. Such anomalies may occur alone or may be associated. A tentative classifiction is proposed which is based on one or several of these anomalies. Among the quantitative criteria of classification is a moderate and static excess of myeloblasts and promyelocytes in the bone marrow. Refractory anemia with an excess of myeloblasts (RAEM) in the most frequent of these states. Its main clinical and hematologic features are described. The disease course is quite typical, the mean survival being 20 months; some patients survive for more than 30 months. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the cause of death in less than 28% of cases. Infection in the absence of severe neutropenia was frequent. The relationship between RAEM and AML is disc,ssed, and the individual characteristics of RAEM are emphasized.","['Dreyfus, B']",['Dreyfus B'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol Blood Cells,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie; blood cells,7701899,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/classification/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Terminology as Topic']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol Blood Cells. 1976;17(1-2):33-55.,,,

Although replication of the virus is strongly thymotropic, the bone marrow and spleen are also susceptible when infection is initiated at birth rather than in adult life. Irradiation transiently restores the susceptibility of adults almost to the neonatal level.

Using a standard FVP preparation in a dose range of 25 to 1,000 SFFU, it was possible to determine the SFFU titers of unknown samples by extrapolation of the percent splenic 59Fe incorporation to the logarithm of SFFU.

Advantages of the 9-day 59Fe assay over the enumerative-response assay include a 50-fold greater virus dose range, an easier and a more objective counting procedure, and a reduced coefficient of variation.","['Menna, J H', 'Hankins, W D', 'Krantz, S B']","['Menna JH', 'Hankins WD', 'Krantz SB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development/*isolation & purification', '*Iron Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/metabolism/*microbiology']",1976/12/01 00:00,1976/12/01 00:01,['1976/12/01 00:00'],"['1976/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.4.6.486-491.1976 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1976 Dec;4(6):486-91. doi: 10.1128/jcm.4.6.486-491.1976.,,['0 (Iron Radioisotopes)'],PMC274509

These results and the fact that initial uptake in these tissues within this dosage range was inhibited to the expected relative extent by the simultaneous administration of leucovorin suggest that carrier mediation and not passive diffusion is the major route of drug entry at these extremely high doses. Maximum accumulation of intracellular drug occurred within 2 hr and reached much higher levels in small intestine than in tumor cells at the higher dosages. At a 3-mg/kg dose of methotrexate s.c., intracellular exchangeable drug levels persisted more than four times longer in L1210 cells than in small intestine, but differences in persistence (L1210 cell versus gut) diminished markedly with increasing dosage. At 96 mg/kg, the difference in persistence was less than 2-fold.

The leukemic infiltration mainly took place in the interstitial spaces. The seminiferous tubules were atrophic and lined by Sertoli cells. Occasional spermatogenic cells could be found in some cases. The leukemic cells were also observed to invade and accumulate beneath the Sertoli cell layer. Destruction of the tubules by the infiltrate was seen in advanced cases. Postradiation biopsies were characterized by fibrosis. The sigeveloped subsequent marrow relapse despite the effective control of the testicular relapse by irradiation. Another important observation is the high incidence of testicular relapse (16.2% so far).,"['Kuo, T T', 'Tschang, T P', 'Chu, J Y']","['Kuo TT', 'Tschang TP', 'Chu JY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Recurrence', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Seminiferous Tubules/pathology', 'Sertoli Cells/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1976/12/01 00:00,1976/12/01 00:01,['1976/12/01 00:00'],"['1976/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197612)38:6<2604::aid-cncr2820380655>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1976 Dec;38(6):2604-12. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197612)38:6<2604::aid-cncr2820380655>3.0.co;2-6.,,,

At various times after infection, megakaryocytes in bone marrow and spleen were collected on Nuclepore filters, stained with the Feulgen procedure, and counted. At the same times, platelets in circulating blood were enumerated by the direct method of Brecher et al., 1963 We found that megakaryocyte numbers decreased within 3 days of infection; platelet numbers began to fall at 7 to 9 days. At 11 days megakaryocyte numbers in femoral marrow and spleen were reduced to less than one-third of control values, platelets to about one-quarter of control values. The data are compatible with the hypothesis that the thrombocytopenia which occurs after FV infection in mice results from the reduction in megakaryocytes that is brought about by the infection. Whether all classes of megakaryocytes are equally affected by FV was next examined. At various times following infection, megakaryocytes in marrow suspensions were concentrated by unit gravity sedimentation and microspectrophotometric measurements of nuclear DNA content were made. The kinetic data showed that, following FV infection, megakaryocytes of high nuclear DNA content were markedly reduced in number, but those of low nuclear DNA content were relatively unaffected. Thus the virus infection may interfere with the normal sequential doubling in DNA content of megakaryocytes and/or it may lead to preferential elimination by the host of those megakaryocytes in the higher DNA classes.","['Brown, W M', 'Axelrad, A A']","['Brown WM', 'Axelrad AA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', '*Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spleen/cytology']",1976/12/15 00:00,1976/12/15 00:01,['1976/12/15 00:00'],"['1976/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910180607 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1976 Dec 15;18(6):764-73. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910180607.,,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],

Effect of treatment with BCNU and cyclophosphamide.,710-6,"An experimental model of meningeal leukemia in rats is developed by intracerebral (IC) inoculation of leukemic cells from the transplantable acute leukemia L5222. The L5222 proliferates exponentially in the central nervous system (CNS) and the disease becomes systemic 2 days following IC inoculation. Chemotherapeutic studies with BCNU and cyclophosphamide yielded cures in a high percentage of cases when treatment began at an early stage of meningeal leukemia. When treatment was started at the advanced stage, only BCNU showed a large number of cures. However, cyclophosphamide resulted in a marked increase of life-span. The activity of cyclophosphamide against meningeal leukemia, which is in contrast to the results obtained by Skipper et. al. (1961) in the L1210 mouse leukemia, suggests that cyclophosphamide crosses in part the blood--brain barrier in a rat bearing meningeal leukemia. After subcutaneous inoculation, BCNU and cyclophosphamide showed the same rate of cures.","['Fiebig, H H', 'Zeller, W H', 'Schmahl, D']","['Fiebig HH', 'Zeller WH', 'Schmahl D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Carmustine/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1976/11/15 00:00,1976/11/15 00:01,['1976/11/15 00:00'],"['1976/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1976/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910180521 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1976 Nov 15;18(5):710-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910180521.,,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",

The electrophoretic mobility of thymocytes is increased when Con A is used under conditions expected to induce a cap formation and the subsequent endocytosis. This increase persists as long as the lectin is present in the medium and disappears as soon as the lectin is eliminated. The redistribution of the Con A receptors into spots and caps may partially explain this electrical modification. The ionized groups of the thymocyte membrane are drastically modified during these phenomena with: 1) a diminution by 61% in the density of the sialic carboxyl groups, 2) a decrease of 40% in the density of phosphate groups and of 60% in the density of amino groups, 3) a 20 times higher density of unidentified negatively charged groups. The electrophoretic mobility of normal human blood lymphocytes is similarly increased by Con A. A marginal difference exists in the shape of the dose response curves obtained when normal and cancerous thymocytes react with increasing doses of Con A. No measurable electrical modification was observed during redistribution of H-2 and Thy-1.2 antigens on EL4 cells. Some experiments suggest a possible correlation between the mitogenicity of the lectin and a measurable modification of the cell electrophoretic mobility.","['Wioland, M', 'Donner, M', 'Neauport-Sautes, C']","['Wioland M', 'Donner M', 'Neauport-Sautes C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Electrophoresis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitogens', 'Phosphates', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Drug/*physiology', 'Sialic Acids', 'Spleen', 'Temperature', 'Thymus Gland', 'Time Factors']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830060408 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1976 Apr;6(4):273-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830060408.,,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",

In 14 patients, growth of blast cells could be observed during the culture period of up to 21 days. To question whether this growth of blast cells was due only to proliferation of the initially proliferating fraction or whether a re-entry of resting leukaemic cells into proliferation was involved, various 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) labelling studies were carried out. The absolute increase of blast cells in EC showed no correlation with the fraction of leukaemic blast cells in DNA-synthesis in the implanted cell suspension as measured by 3H-TdR labelling in vitro. Furthermore, in 2 patients where the kinetic behaviour of initially labelled leukaemic blast cells was followed during DC culture, the increase in total blast cells could only be attributed to a small extent to proliferation of those cells initially in the cell cycle. Lastly, ""in vivo"" labelling during the culture period showed that in one case 25% and in another case 60% of the blast cells in DC were proliferating. The conclusion is that, owing to the stimulation of the diffusion chamber milieu and possibly also due to removal of an in vivo inhibition, in most cases of acute leukaemia resting leukaemic blast cells can apparently re-enter the active cell cycle. This has relevance for an understanding of the self-maintenance of the leukaemic cell population and may also be a reason for relapse of leukaemia after the usual cytostatic drug treatment which affects mainly the proliferating leukaemic cells.","['Hoelzer, D', 'Schmucker, H', 'Kurrle, E']","['Hoelzer D', 'Schmucker H', 'Kurrle E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division', '*Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Recurrence', 'Thymidine', 'Tritium']",1976/11/01 00:00,1976/11/01 00:01,['1976/11/01 00:00'],"['1976/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01002127 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1976 Nov;33(5):301-12. doi: 10.1007/BF01002127.,,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",

Lymphocytes not containing complement receptors (CR-) while maintaining a low profile in RNA synthesis, had a 10-12-fold greater activity in adenosine deaminase enzyme which is believed to be related to lymphocyte-immune responses and cell-mediated immunity. These two biochemical characteristics can be useful tools for future studies in lymphocyte functions. By using these two biochemical markers, we found that CLL lymphocytes were predominantly of the CR+ type, had high active RNA synthesis, and very low adenosine deaminase level.

It is noteworthy that a cutaneous hemangioma overlay one cranial and one intraspinal arteriovenous malformation. One small but deep cerebral arteriovenous malformation apparently destroyed itself after its second hemorrhage. Not only have multiple sclerosis and a brain tumor mimicked a vascular lesion, but a series of vascular accidents was misdiagnosed first as multiple sclerosis then as a thalamic tumor. The many possible causes of childhood strokes has been thoroughly cataloged in the Report of the Joint Committee for Stroke Facilities in 1973 (11). Children may be more susceptible to strokes because of congenital abnormalities such as congenital heart disease, hemophilia, and sickle cell anemia, or by diseases which more commonly occur in this age group, such as leukemia. The likelihood of brain abscess in cyanotic congenital heart disease is stressed. Arteriographic studies in our series have been safe; however, there have been reports of probable worsening of symptoms in children with multiple cerebral occlusive lesions in the presence of homocystinuria.","['Shillito, J Jr']",['Shillito J Jr'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Neurosurg,Clinical neurosurgery,2985141R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aneurysm, Infected/diagnosis', 'Arteritis/diagnosis', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hamartoma/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Aneurysm/complications/diagnosis', 'Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications/diagnosis', 'Intracranial Embolism and Thrombosis/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Migraine Disorders/diagnosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis/diagnosis', 'Parietal Lobe']",1976/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/neurosurgery/23.cn_suppl_1.185 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Neurosurg. 1976;23:185-219. doi: 10.1093/neurosurgery/23.cn_suppl_1.185.,,,

However, the known biological activity is different. The antibiotic can be isolated from culture filtrates and from the mycelium by extraction with lower aliphatic alcohols. It can be purified by gel filtration methods. Lambdamycin displays antimicrobial activity, particularly against grampositive bacteria. Strains which produce enzymes inactivating different commercial antibiotics are also inhibited. Moreover, lambdamycin shows antiviral activity, as well as cancerostatic and ergotropic action in vitro and in vivo.

By combining continuous and pulse labeling the growth fraction of CLL lymphocytes was found to be progressively increasing, because of the recruitment of new cells in cycle, from the third day of culture.

The time course of DNA synthesis inhibition was then investigated by utilizing a shorter (6-hr) exposure time. This period was found to be insufficient to cause DNA synthesis inhibition in any of test tissues. Because anesthesia was found to be associated with hypothermia at normal room temperatures, it was established that the inhibition of DNA synthesis was not due to cooling of the mice under anesthesia by demonstrating that inhibition in sensitive tissues occurred at warmer temperatures as well. To examine the specificity of this finding, the DNA synthesis rate of cells in other normal tissues, e.g., skin and muscle, and in s.c.-growing tumor cells of a mouse mammary carcinoma, L1210 leukemia, and a first transplant AKR lymphoma were examined. In none were responses noted with 24 hr of halothane exposure. However, halothane was found to inhibit DNA synthesis in regenerating marrow.

In past and present studies banding analysis have uncovered a much larger number of markers in cancer cells than was seen with standard (Giemsa) staining. Furthermore, common markers of identical morphology and origin were found in tumors of related or unrelated tissues or organs, suggesting that in all probability such markers, although present in cancers of diverse nature, may indicate a common etiology, either related to the causation of the cancers, to the progression of the tumors, or to the predilection of certain chromosomes to undergo morphologic changes leading to marker formation. Even though some markers were common to different tumors, the bulk of the markers in the cancers studied could not be identified with certainty and their nature varied from tumor to tumor.","['Kakati, S', 'Oshimura, M', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Kakati S', 'Oshimura M', 'Sandberg AA']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1976/08/01 00:00,1976/08/01 00:01,['1976/08/01 00:00'],"['1976/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197608)38:2<770::aid-cncr2820380220>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1976 Aug;38(2):770-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197608)38:2<770::aid-cncr2820380220>3.0.co;2-0.,,,

The finding of identical chromosomal aberrations (20q- and +9, respectively) in two patients who had received no drugs and in four patients who had received 32P and busulfan or procarbazine favors the view that these aberrations are specifically associated with the disease and not induced by the drugs.

Data derived from the measurmenets of initial influx, the complete time-course of uptake, intracellular steady-state level and unidirectional efflux were found to be consistent with a simple empirical equation containing three constants. Properties of the system include the following: (1) saturability of initial influx: (2) approach to steady state during uptake is exponential; (3) the half-time for drug uptake is independent of external concentration and equal to half-time for efflux; and (4) transport is concentrative at low external concentrations, whereas the reverse is true at high external concentrations. These observations are incorporated into a kinetic model which quantitatively accounts for the data on the basis of the hypothesis that influx and efflux take place via different carriers.","['Dembo, M', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Dembo M', 'Sirotnak FM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mathematics', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Biological']",1976/10/19 00:00,1976/10/19 00:01,['1976/10/19 00:00'],"['1976/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1976/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(76)90303-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(76)90303-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1976 Oct 19;448(3):505-16. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(76)90303-5.,,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],

The effect of these agents on membrane fluidity in phospholipid vesicles was studied by determining the solid-to-liquid crystalline phase transition using differential scanning calorimetry. Some of the inducing agents studies were found to raise the normal transition temperature (Tc) by a few degrees. All of these agents were found to produce a separate transition at a much higher temperature. Changes in the head group of the phospholipid, the pH, the presence of divalent cations, and the addition of other membrane-active compounds were found to significantly influence the inducing agent's effects on the Tc of phospholipid membranes. The ability of the different agents to produce a new transition at a high temperature was found to correlate well with their ability to induce Friend leukemic cell differentiation. The possible mechansims of action of the chemical inducers, and the significance of the observed membrane effects on differentiation and malignancy are discussed. It is concluded that inducing agents decrease the fluidity and stabilize phospholipid membranes, and that their effects in cell differentiation might be initiated by a similar change in the properties of cell membranes.","['Lyman, G H', 'Papahadjopoulos, D', 'Preisler, H D']","['Lyman GH', 'Papahadjopoulos D', 'Preisler HD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Calorimetry', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Dibucaine', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Magnesium', '*Membranes, Artificial', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/*physiology', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics']",1976/10/19 00:00,1976/10/19 00:01,['1976/10/19 00:00'],"['1976/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1976/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(76)90300-X [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(76)90300-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1976 Oct 19;448(3):460-73. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(76)90300-x.,,"['0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'L6JW2TJG99 (Dibucaine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",

In patients with normal blood counts there existed no correlation between the bone marrow and the blood counts within smaller limits of the cell count. Histomorphometric analysis shows no difference either between untreated and 32P-treated patients or between patients with and without splenomegaly. This is an argument against a significant intrasplenic hemopoiesis or an intrasplenic cell pooling, or destruction (hypersplenism), respectively. The blood sinusoids are hyperplastic and distended. With increasing hyperplasia of the hemopoiesis the sinusoids become relatively smaller.

In a variety of combinations of 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, and cyclophosphamide, a combination of cyclophosphamide and 6-thioguanine produced the highest increase in life span (ILS) and the highest number of 60-day survivors of all. In contrast, a combination of 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine showed as low as ILS as did single agents. A combination of 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, and 6-thioguanine exhibited the second best effect on survival time of leukemic mice. However, in myelosuppression as measured by changes in the total number of nucleated cells, in the number of hematopoietic colony-forming cell, and in peroxidase level of femoral bone-marrow, the combination of 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine showed no more toxicity than the other 2-drug combinations. In addition to these findings, the presence of a striking difference in the cell number in ascitic fluid of leukemic mice among the animals given 6-thioguanine, and those given other 2- or 3-drug combinations may suggest that the difference in the antileukemic activity is not due to the difference in the toxicity against the host, but due to the difference in the activity of direct action of combined drugs on leukemic cells in the peritoneal cavity or in other sites.","['Fujimoto, S', 'Inouye, T', 'Tsukagoshi, S']","['Fujimoto S', 'Inouye T', 'Tsukagoshi S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Gan,Gan,0151745,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Peroxidases/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gan. 1976 Apr;67(2):207-14.,,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",

According to their origin and to a panel of phenotypic markers these lines have been classified into lymphoma lines, myeloma lines and leukemia lines. Results were compared with those obtained on non-malignant EBV carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). Among the lymphoid cell lines the LCL showed a pattern of B-lymphocyte surface markers, i.e. surface immunoglobulins, C3 receptors but low density of Fc receptors. The non-Burkitt lymphoma lines bore in varying degree these B-lymphocyte markers. The lines U-698 M and DG-75 were exceptional in having only surface immunoglobulin. The Burkitt lymphoma lines had all B-lymphocyte markers. The myeloma lines differed from the lymphoid lines in lacking C3 and Fc receptors and showed only trace amounts of surface immunoglobulins. In contrast to lymphoid and myeloma lines, the leukaemia lines were completely lacking surface immunoglobulins, but showed C3 and Fc receptors in variable densities. On line, the ALL derived line MOLT-3 showed the capacity to spontaneous rosette formation with SRBC. The findings that LCL presented a homogeneous pattern of B-lymphocyte surface markers may be of value in order to discriminate between these lines and lines derived from haematopoietic malignancies other than Burkitt lymphomas.","['Huber, C', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Nilsson, K', 'Wigzell, H']","['Huber C', 'Sundstrom C', 'Nilsson K', 'Wigzell H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Complement C3', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Hematopoietic System/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell']",1976/09/01 00:00,1976/09/01 00:01,['1976/09/01 00:00'],"['1976/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1976 Sep;25(3):367-76.,,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",PMC1541411

Application of hamster papova virus to newborns of Syrian hamster has produced some s.c. sarcomas after a 5 to 6 month latency period, by virtue of the strong inducer effect of this papova virus to endogenous (latent) oncorna viruses. 2. Cellfree filtrates from a polymorphorus-cell sarcoma produced in this way, when applied to newborn hamsters of the spontaneously tumour-free hamster line HaP, again lead to sarcoma formation after a latency period of 3--8 months in about 20% of the animals; the same holds for cellfree filtrates of these cellfree induced sarcomas and their transplantation generations. 3. In these tumours C-type oncorna viruses, but no papova virus, could be demonstrated regularly. 4. The hamster specificity of this sarcoma virus is suggested by the complete absence of a tumorigenic effect of the cellfree filtrates from these hamster sarcomas in mice and rats. The preferential induction of hamster sarcomas by sarcoma filtrates, in conjunction with the fact that filtrates from hamster leukoses, indicates a certain difference between hamster leukemia and hamster sarcoma viruses.","['Graffi, A', 'Bender, E', 'Schramm, T', 'Graffi, I', 'Niezabitowski, A', 'Schneiders, F']","['Graffi A', 'Bender E', 'Schramm T', 'Graffi I', 'Niezabitowski A', 'Schneiders F']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', '*Cell-Free System', 'Cricetinae', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*pathogenicity/ultrastructure', 'Papillomaviridae/pathogenicity', 'Polyomaviridae', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/pathology/*transmission', '*Subcellular Fractions', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1976;46(2):77-84.,"Durch ein Oncornavirus induzierte, zellfrei ubertragbare Sarkome des Goldhamsters",,

The test birds had been vaccinated at the age of one day. The average month mortality rate among the vaccinated birds was 1.5 per cent, and among the untreated it was 4.9 per cent; for the whole exploitation period these values were 15.35 and 47.17 per cent, respectively. Mortality rate caused by Marek's disease and lymphoid leukosis (specific mortality) in the test groups was 4 times lower as compared with that of the control groups (11.54 as against 44.75 per cent), and the coefficient of epizootiologic effectiveness was 74.4 per cent. Considerable variation was established in the intensity and dynamics of the epizootic process with the vaccinated and unvaccinated birds, on the one hand, and the layers and cocks, on the other. White Cornish cocks proved more resistant to Marek's disease and more sensitive to lymphoid leukosis, while the layers of the White Plymouth Rock breed were more sensitive to Marek's disease and more resistant to lymphoid leukosis. These differences could explain the dynamics peculiarity of the specific mortality exhibited by layers and cocks.

Effector cells were generated which specifically lysed 51Cr-labeled targets (leukemia or mitogen-stimulated lymphoid cells) H-2-matched with the parental genotype used for sensitization. The response of F1 spleen cells to the C57BL/6 parent was stronger and more reproducible than that to the DBA/2 parent. The kinetics of generation of effector cells were similar for the F1 anti-parent and an F1 anti-allogeneic response. However, the magnitude of the F1 anti-C57BL/6 cytotoxic response was considerably lower than the F1 response to allogeneic cells. The ratio of responder to stimulator cells in the cultures was more critical for the former than for the latter response. Several lots of fetal bovine serum were found to be adequate for supplementing the medium in the induction of J1 hybrid anti-parent and anti-allogeneic cytotoxic effector cells. Based on these and other studies, it would appear that the F1 hybrid anti-parent cytotoxic response provides an in vitro model of murine hemopoietic graft rejection in vivo.

It follows that drugs that increase the metabolism or excretory capacity of the liver may decrease adriamycin concentrations to suboptimal values. Adriamycin metabolism was therefore studied in mice pretreated with phenobarbital (75 mg/kg i.v.) by injection. After an i.v. dose of adriamycin (30 mg/kg i.v.), plasma fluorescence due to drug and metabolites was less and disappeared at a greater rate in phenobarbital-pretreated mice than control animals. When extracted with chloroform: isoprophyl alcohol (1:1), the livers from the phenobarbital-pretreated group yielded a greater concentration of glycones. Experiments with liver microsomes confirmed that aglycone production occurred at a more rapid initial rate in phenobarbital-induced livers. No increase in aldoketo reductase (daunorubicin reductase) activity was noted. Phenobarbital-pretreated mice, inoculated i.p. with 1 million L1210 cells and then treated with adriamycin (6 mg/kg i.v.), had significantly lower survival than did controls (p less than 0.01). These findings show that phenobarbital affects the disposition of adriamycin by microsomal enzyme induction and suggest that drugs that induce microsomal enzymes should not be used concurrently with adriamycin if optimal drug efficacy is desired.","['Reich, S D', 'Bachur, N R']","['Reich SD', 'Bachur NR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Daunorubicin', 'Doxorubicin/blood/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Phenobarbital/*pharmacology']",1976/10/01 00:00,1976/10/01 00:01,['1976/10/01 00:00'],"['1976/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Oct;36(10):3803-6.,,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",

Because antitumor activity of triazinate in experimental tumors correlated closely with the in vitro inhibition of DNA synthesis in tumor cells derived from these tumors, we studied cells from patients with leukemia, solid tumor effusions, and cells from normal marrow to determine their in vitro sensitivity to TZT. DNA synthesis in cells from patients with acute leukemia was less sensitive to TZT than it was to methotrexate (MTX) at 2 X 10(-6) M concentration of the inhibitor, whereas the sensitivity was similar at 10(-5) M. This could be accounted for by the known greater sensitivity of dihydrofolate reductase to MTX than to TZT, and the observation that, whereas intracellular drug levels were similar at low (2 X 10(-6) M) extracellular concentrations of TZT or MTX, at the higher (10(-5) M) extracellular drug concentration intracellular TZT was greater than 3 times intracellular MTX. In vitro inhibition of DNA synthesis in cells obtained after patients were treated with TZT was correlated with drug serum concentration and with leukemia cell kill. The sensitivity of cells from solid tumor effusions to TZT was similar to the sensitivity to MTX. Since patients can tolerate doses of TZT five times higher than MTX with less toxicity, there may be advantage to the clinical use of TZT in some tumor cell types.","['Skeel, R T', 'Sawicki, W L', 'Cashmore, A R', 'Bertino, J R']","['Skeel RT', 'Sawicki WL', 'Cashmore AR', 'Bertino JR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Triazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1976/10/01 00:00,1976/10/01 00:01,['1976/10/01 00:00'],"['1976/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Oct;36(10):3659-64.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Triazines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'DD99Y262WC (triazinate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",

The ophthalmologists' preoperative (or premortem) clinical diagnoses were: orbital mass, 36%; metastatic carcinoma, 29%; leukemia, 7%; melanosarcoma, 4%; mixed tumor of lacrimal gland, 4%; and meningioma, 4%. The sites of the primary tumors in the 28 patients with orbital metastasis were as follows: breast, eight; lung, four; genitourinary tract, four; pancreas, one; and ileum, one. In 10 patients the site of the primary carcinoma was not determined. In 17 of the 28 patients, symptoms of orbital metastasis preceded detection of a primary tumor elsewhere in the body. In 10 of the remaining 11 patients, detection of the primary tumor had preceded the onset of orbital symptoms. In one patient, symptoms of the primary tumor and of orbital metastasis appeared at about the same time. The median survival of patients with carcinoma metastatic to the orbit was 15.6 months from the time of orbital surgery. This was much better than the median survival of the 227 patients in the overall study (7.4 months) and far better than the median survival of the patients with metastasis to the anterior segment of the eye (only 5.4 months).","['Font, R L', 'Ferry, A P']","['Font RL', 'Ferry AP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1976/09/01 00:00,1976/09/01 00:01,['1976/09/01 00:00'],"['1976/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197609)38:3<1326::aid-cncr2820380336>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1976 Sep;38(3):1326-35. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197609)38:3<1326::aid-cncr2820380336>3.0.co;2-#.,,,

It has proven effectiveness against several animal tumours and human acute leukaemias. We have compared the inhibitory effect of rubidazone to that of adriamycin on P388 leukaemia and normal bone marrow colony-forming units (CFU) using the spleen colony assay system in male DBA2 mice. The efficacy ratios (i.e., the ratio of the slopes of the normal bone marrow CFU to leukaemic CFU dose-survival curves) in the spleen colony assay system for rubidazone and adriamycin were 7-8 and 7-5 respectively. This near identity of efficacy ratios fro rubidazone and adriamycin correlated with the results of median survival time studies in the leukaemic mice. Their dose-median survival time curves were almost parallel, having nearly identical slopes. Rubidazone's equal therapeutic index as compared to adriamycin in the spleen colony assay system together with its known decreased toxicity to cardiac muscle cells makes it an extremely promising new anthracycline derivative to study in comparison to adriamycin in human malignancies.","['Alberts, D S', 'Van Daalen Wetters, T']","['Alberts DS', 'Van Daalen Wetters T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Time Factors']",1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1976.123 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1976 Jul;34(1):64-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1976.123.,,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'V25F9362OP (zorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",PMC2025119

Terminal acute leukemia or more often progressive bone marrow biopsy showing myelofibrosis with persistence of differentiated myeloid tissue, particularly megacaryocytes. Isotopic studies (59Fe and 51Cr) showed splenic erythroid metaplasia, poor bone marrow 59Fe uptake and increased peripheral red blood cell destruction. This study confirms that malignant myelosclerosis is a well-defined syndrome which must be distinguished from: a) Acute transformation of typical agnogenic myeloid metaplasia even though it was previously undiagnosed (4 cases of MMM illustrating this possibility have been reported); b) Acute myeloblastic leukemia with myelofibrosis; and c) Myelofibrosis secondary to lymphomatous or carcinomatous bone-marrow invasion (2 cases with acute myelofibrosis appearing long after appropriate treatment have been reported).","['Briere, J', 'Castro-Malaspina, H', 'Briere, J F', 'Bernard, J']","['Briere J', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Briere JF', 'Bernard J']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Survival', 'Erythrocytes', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Primary Myelofibrosis/blood', 'Uric Acid/analysis', 'Vitamin B 12/analysis']",1976/06/01 00:00,1976/06/01 00:01,['1976/06/01 00:00'],"['1976/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1976 Jun;16(1):3-22.,Les myelofibroses aigues ou subaigues,"['268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",

Both L-threonine residues were replaced by L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid. Starting with Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-Nbeta-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropioni c acid methyl ester hydrochloride the linear intermediate Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-Nbeta-(tert-butyloxycarbonylsarcosyl-L-N-methylvalyl)-L- alpha,beta-diaminopropionyl-D-valyl-L-proline p-nitrophenyl ester was prepared by conventional methods of peptide synthesis in solution. Selective cleavage of the Nbeta-tert-butyloxycarbonyl group and lactam formation afforded the desired cyclic pentapeptide derivative. The chromophore precursor, Nalpha-(2-nitro-3-benzyloxy-4-methylbenzoyl) substituent, was introduced via its symmetric anhydride. Catalytic reduction followed by ferricyanide-mediated phenoxazinone formation provided the lactam analog, [di(1'-L-alpha,beta-diaminopionic acid)]actinomycin D ([Dpr1]2-AMD). Its binding to natural and synthetic DNA and that of an analogous L-threo-alpha,beta-diaminobutyric acid containing lactam ([Dbu1]2-AMD) compared with the binding of AMD (in which the peptides are in lactone form) was studied by circular dichroic (CD) spectroscopy. The visible and uv CD spectra of free AMD differed from those of the free lactam analogs, indicating that the asymmetric environment of the pentapeptide rings in the region of the chromophore differs in free actinomycin lactone and lactams. In the presence of calf thymus DNA, PM2 DNA, and the synthetic d(A-T)-like copolymers containing 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP), poly[d(DAP-T)], and poly[d(DAP-A-T)], the rotational strengths of the optically active transitions in the visible region of the actinomycins increased, and the CD spectra in the presence of the various DNA duplexes were qualitatively similar. The CD spectra of bound actinomycin lactams resembled the spectrum of bound AMD. This suggests that the lactone and lactam actinomycins acquire a similar environment when bound to DNA. [Dpr1]2-AMD was less cytotoxic than AMD in antibacterial assays but exhibited somewhat higher toxicity in mice than AMD. At optimal dose levels the lactam analog had little or no antitumor activity in three murine tumor systems.","['Moore, S', 'Patel, R P', 'Atherton, E', 'Kondo, M', 'Meienhofer, J']","['Moore S', 'Patel RP', 'Atherton E', 'Kondo M', 'Meienhofer J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Dactinomycin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'beta-Lactams/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use']",1976/06/01 00:00,1976/06/01 00:01,['1976/06/01 00:00'],"['1976/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00228a006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1976 Jun;19(6):766-72. doi: 10.1021/jm00228a006.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (beta-Lactams)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",

In contrast to peak I, however, in NIH Swiss and AKR mice, peak II activity decreased rapidly at 2 weeks of age and by 6 weeks of age less than 2% of the initial activity remained. In C57BL/6 mice there was a similar loss of peak II activity with age although this change started at about 4 months of age and by 8 months of age approximately 15% of the initial activity remained.

The cells used were clones of mouse myeloid leukemic cells and the compounds used were the protein MGI2 (macrophage and granulocyte inducer) in serum from mice injected with bacterial endotoxin and the steroid inducer (SI) dexamethasone. Eight clones were isolated which could be divided into three groups. One group (MGI+SI+) was induced to form EA and EAC rosettes by MGI and only EAC rosettes by SI, the second group (MGI-SI+) was not inducible by MGI but was induced by SI to form EA or EA and EAC rosettes, and the third group (MGI-SI-) was not inducible for EA or EAC by MGI or SI. There were two types of MGI+SI+ clones, one type (D+) could be induced by MGI to differentiate to mature macrophages and granulocytes, and the other type (D-) could not be induced to differentiate to mature cells. The MGI-SI+ and MGI-SI- clones were all D-. The results indicate that there are different cellular sites for MGI and SI and that induction of EA and EAC rosettes did not seem to be mediated by cyclic AMP. Experiments with specifically bound 3H-BSA-anti-BSA complexes have indicated that there was an increase in the amount of 3H-BSA-anti-BSA bound per rosette-forming cell following induction by MGI or SI, and there were differences in the amount of 3H-BSA-anti-BSA bound per rosette-forming cell in different clones. These clones also showed differences in the shape of the curve for the number of EA rosette-forming cells obtained with erythrocytes coated with decreasing concentrations of antibody. The results suggest that such curves and those obtained with EAC rosettes can be used to determine the relative abundance of EA and EAC receptors on rosette-forming cells. EA rosettes on the myeloid leukemic cells, like those on normal macrophages and granulocytes, were specifically inhibited by IgG2a and by the Fc but not the Fab fragment of IgG. The EAC rosettes were inhibited by destroying the C3 component of complement. The different clones maintained their specific properties for at least 6 months in culture. The present system should, therefore, also be useful for studies on the genetic control of the regulation of Fc and C3 receptors.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement C3', 'Dexamethasone', 'Endotoxins', 'Granulocytes', 'Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophages', 'Mice']",1976/08/01 00:00,1976/08/01 00:01,['1976/08/01 00:00'],"['1976/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1976 Aug;117(2):580-6.,,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",

X-irradiation of L1210 cells and Ehrlich ascites cells at body temperatures above 41 degrees C resulted in strongly enhanced tumor cell death. The magnitude of this thermal effect increased with increasing temperatures. Hypoxic tumor cells were particularly sensitive to combined heat-radiation treatment. L1210 leukemia cells did not become resistant to the sensitizing effects of hyperthermia even after repeated heat exposures over several transplant generations. The sensitizing action of hyperthermia varied with different heating strategies. Heating before or during irradiation did not materially alter the radiation response of tumor cells. Maximal potentiation of radiation damage was achieved only when the tumorous mice were subjected to at least 20 minutes heat incubation after irradiation. LD studies on ICR mice revealed that moderate hyperthermia (41.5 degrees C) does not alter the radiation response of normal body tissues.

Within both populations, men excrete a greater variety and quantity of amino acids than women.

L1210 and L1210/ara-C, are both resistant to ara-A and have very high levels of the deaminase that inactivates ara-A. When an effective inhibitor of the deaminase, 2'-deoxycoformycin, was combined with ara-A in the treatment of mice bearing L1210 or L1210/ara-C tumors, both became responsive to ara-A. Studies are reported on the extent of effects of 2'-deoxycoformycin at several dose levels and the duration of its effect in tumor cells and normal tissues. Single doses produce essentially complete inhibition of the deaminase, and little recovery was seen before 24 hr. However, DNA synthesis in normal tissues recovered more quickly. It is suggested that ara-A and ara-C, the former as a new derivative (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-phosphate) and possibly combined with 2'-deoxycoformycin, be regarded as potentially alternative drugs for the treatment of neoplasms.","['LePage, G A', 'Worth, L S', 'Kimball, A P']","['LePage GA', 'Worth LS', 'Kimball AP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Azepines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Purine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Apr;36(4):1481-5.,,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",

The ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are reviewed. The following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication: abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of central nervous system leukemia, and epidural cerebrospinal leakage; elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high methotrexate doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults; the presence of neurotoxic preservatives in commercially available methotrexate preparations and diluents; and the use of methotrexate diluents of unphysiologic pH, ionic content and osmolarity. The role of methotrexate contaminants, local folate deficiency, and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal methotrexate toxicity is unclear. The incidence of neurotoxicity may be reduced by employing lower doses of methotrexate in the presence of central nervous system leukemia, in older children and adults, and in the presence of epidural leakage. Only preservative-free methotrexate in Elliott's B Solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg/ml should be used for intrathecal administration.

A complete inhibition of cell growth was achieved with 0.5 mug of the drug per ml. Leucinostatin showed membrane damage against L 1210 cells as well as mouse erythrocytes. L 1210 cells were partially protected from membrane damage by the addition of glucose to the medium. In contrast, no protective effect of glucose was observed with drug-induced hemolysis. The possible involvement of membrane lipid in the mechanism of action of leucinostatin is suggested by its action on liposomes. Liposomes prepared with lecithin, cholesterol, and an amphiphatic molecule, either dicetyl phosphate or stearylamine, were sensitive to leucinostatin and response to the drug was enhanced as the cholesterol level of liposomes was decreased. Changes in the net charge of the membrane did not show significant effects on leucinostatin action. In the presence of the antibiotic, on the other hand, protein synthesis in cells was markedly inhibited under conditions where the uptake of amino acids into an acid-soluble pool was not affected. However, leucinostatin did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on protein synthesis in a cell-free system from L 1210 cells. It is suggested that the inhibition of protein synthesis results from the initial interaction of the drug with membrane phospholipid.","['Ishiguro, K', 'Arai, T']","['Ishiguro K', 'Arai T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', '*Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Trypan Blue/metabolism', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1976/06/01 00:00,1976/06/01 00:01,['1976/06/01 00:00'],"['1976/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.9.6.893 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1976 Jun;9(6):893-8. doi: 10.1128/AAC.9.6.893.,,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '76600-38-9 (leucinostatin A)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",PMC429646

Increasing incidence and relationship to colonization.,23-8,"Torulopsis glabrata, an opportunistic pathogen, was found to be the etiologic agent of infections in patients with cancer. This observation prompted a retrospective review to determine the incidence and underlying factors of infection with this organism. This study showed that T. glabrata had been cultured frequently and that the incidence of infection has been progressively increasing. During a 48-month period (9/70-8/74), T. glabrata was cultured from routine surveillance and diagnostic cultures in 167 patients, 27 of whom had either presumed or documented infection. Review of clinical and necropsy records implicated T. glabrata infections as a contributory factor in the death of 14 of the 27 patients. Etiologic diagnosis of infection was established antemortem in only three patients. Pulmonary isolation in pure growth occurred in 24 of the 27 patients. Seventeen of 19 infected patients who had prior routine surveillance cultures were colonized prior to infection. Infection occurred in the setting of far advanced malignancy or leukopenia and followed the use of systemic, broad spectrum antibiotics. T. glabrata is a frequently overlooked opportunistic pathogen which, in the proper setting, appears to be producing increasing numbers of infections.","['Aisner, J', 'Schimpff, S C', 'Sutherland, J C', 'Young, V M', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Aisner J', 'Schimpff SC', 'Sutherland JC', 'Young VM', 'Wiernik PH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/complications', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications', 'Candida/*isolation & purification', 'Cellulitis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/etiology', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(76)90026-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(76)90026-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1976 Jul;61(1):23-8. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(76)90026-7.,,,

Using these methods, the cellular folate derivatives in logarithmically growing L1210 cells were found to consist entirely of polyglutamyl derivatives. When ascorbate extracts of these cells were digested with hog kidney gamma-glutamylcarboxypeptidase and then chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose columns, the cellular folates eluted coincident with tetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, with minimal amounts associated with folate (approximately 0.8%) or dihydrofolate (approximately 0.4%). When these experiments were repeated on cells previously depleted of folates which were then grown on 0.4 muM pteroylglutamic acid (a concentration insufficient to maintain an optimal growth rate) more than 95% of the folates were again found in polyglutamyl form. These results imply that the polyglutamyl derivatives found are not storage forms of enzymatically active cofactor, but rather are the actual cofactor forms used by these mammalian cells.","['Moran, R G', 'Werkheiser, W C', 'Zakrzewski, S F']","['Moran RG', 'Werkheiser WC', 'Zakrzewski SF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Carboxypeptidases', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Swine', 'Time Factors']",1976/06/25 00:00,1976/06/25 00:01,['1976/06/25 00:00'],"['1976/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1976/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)33382-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1976 Jun 25;251(12):3569-75.,,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)']",

MTX (5 mg/kg) was injected i.p. 3 days after the inoculation of 5 X 10(6) leukemia cells, into F1 (DBA X C57 BL) mice. It was shown that MTX causes degeneration of cells, being in G1- as well as in S-phase at the time of drug injection. Incorporation of 3H-TdR was suppressed for a period ranging from 2 to 12 hr after MTX administration, which is demonstrated by the decrease in the number of grains per cell. The number of cells labeled after 3H-TdR injection was also sharply decreased during this period. For a period of 3 until 15 hr after MTX administration the mitotic index decreased significantly as a result of inhibition of DNA synthesis. The blocking of the G1-S transition was evident during 4 hr after MTX. Thereafter the G1-S transition proceeds at a rate which is practically equal to that for nontreated controls. MTX did not inhibit transition to mitosis of cells being in G2-phase and in a very late S-phase at the time of drug injection. The sensitivity of G1-cells to the cytocidal effect of MTX shows that for L1210 leukemia cells MTX can be classified as a cycle-specific drug killing both G1-and S-cells rather than S-phase specific agent with self-limitation.","['Goncharova, S A', 'Frankfurt, O S']","['Goncharova SA', 'Frankfurt OS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Tissue Kinet,Cell and tissue kinetics,0174107,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mitotic Index/drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1976.tb01281.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Kinet. 1976 Jul;9(4):333-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1976.tb01281.x.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",
