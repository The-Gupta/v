In an attempt to identify prognostic factors influencing outcome, we collected data retrospectively on 60 consecutive adult patients who had undergone BMT at our center for primary MDS or acute myelogenous leukemia evolving from preexisting primary MDS (sAML). Patients were divided into subgroups according to cytogenetic abnormalities based on a recently described International MDS Workshop categorization system. The 7-year actuarial event-free survival (EFS), relapse rate, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) for all patients were 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16% to 43%), 42% (CI, 24% to 67%), and 50% (CI, 37% to 64%), respectively. The EFS for the good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk cytogenetic subgroups were 51% (CI, 30% to 69%), 40% (CI, 16% to 63%), and 6% (CI, 0% to 24%), respectively (P = .003). The corresponding actuarial relapse rates were 19% (CI, 6% to 49%), 12% (CI, 2% to 61%), and 82% (CI, 48% to 99%), respectively (P = . 002) with no difference in NRM between the subgroups. Univariate analysis showed cytogenetic category, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis used to be predictive of relapse and EFS. In multivariate analysis, only the cytogenetic category was predictive of EFS, with the relative risk of treatment failure for the good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk cytogenetic subgroups being 1.0, 1.5, and 3.5, respectively (P = . 004).

Therefore, we studied 57 adult patients with newly diagnosed pro-B ALL (median age, 30 years) enrolled in two consecutive German multicenter ALL studies (03/87 and 04/89). Extensive immunophenotypic characterization of leukemic blasts could be performed on all patients, whereas adequate cytogenetic data were available in 33 cases and molecular studies in 18 cases, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect MLL-AF-4 transcripts. Twenty-two patients demonstrated a t(4;11)(q21;q23) and/or MLL-AF-4 rearrangements, and 6 patients had other structural abnormalities, including a t(9;22)(q34;q11) (N = 2). Nine patients had a normal karyotype. Patients with 11q23 abnormalities tended to be younger (median age, 29 years) and were characterized by male predominance (64%), hyperleukocytosis (median leukocyte count, 168 x 10(9)/L), and a frequent coexpression of CD65s (64%) as compared with patients with other cytogenetic abnormalities or a normal karyotype. Twelve of 16 (75%) pro-B ALL patients in study 03/87 and 30 of 41 (73%) in study 04/89 achieved a complete remission (CR). Sixteen of 30 patients in study 04/89 remain in continuous CR (CCR) in contrast to only 2 of 12 patients in study 03/87. Interestingly, all 7 patients treated with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone as consolidation in study 04/89 remain alive and leukemia-free. One patient in study 03/87 and 8 in study 04/89 underwent autologous (N = 2) or allogeneic (N = 7) bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The median remission duration was 420 days for patients in study 03/87 and has not yet been reached in study 04/89. The median survival time of all pro-B ALL patients was 571 days in study 03/87 and 747 days in study 04/89. Among the 22 patients with a t(4;11) and/or MLL-AF-4 rearrangements, 17 achieved a CR and 8 are still in CCR, of whom 4 underwent an allogeneic BMT. Remission duration and overall survival did not differ significantly between pro-B ALL patients with 11q23 abnormalities and those with a normal karyotype or other structural abnormalities.

In this study using GALV-pseudotype vectors, we examined additional variables that have been reported to increase gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitor cells in culture for their ability to increase gene transfer into baboon hematopoietic repopulating cells. Baboon marrow was harvested after in vivo administration (priming) of stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). CD34-enriched marrow cells were divided into two equal fractions to directly compare transduction efficiencies under different gene transfer conditions. Transduction by either incubation with retroviral vectors on CH-296-coated flasks or by cocultivation on vector-producing cells was studied in five animals; in one animal, transduction on CH-296 was compared with transduction on bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated flasks. The highest level of gene transfer was obtained after 24 hours of prestimulation followed by 48 hours of incubation on CH-296 in vector-containing medium in the presence of multiple hematopoietic growth factors (interleukin-6, stem cell factor, FLT-3 ligand, and megakaryocyte growth and development factor). Using these conditions, up to 20% of peripheral blood and marrow cells contained vector sequences for more than 20 weeks, as determined by both polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. Gene transfer rates were higher for cells transduced on CH-296 as compared with BSA or cocultivation. In one animal, we have used a vector expressing a cell surface protein (human placental alkaline phosphatase) and have detected 10% and 5% of peripheral blood cells expressing the transduced gene 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation as measured by flow cytometry. In conclusion, the conditions described here have resulted in gene transfer rates that will allow detection of transduced cells by flow cytometry to facilitate the evaluation of gene expression. The levels of gene transfer obtained with these conditions suggest the potential for therapeutic efficacy in diseases affecting the hematopoietic system.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kiem, H P', 'Andrews, R G', 'Morris, J', 'Peterson, L', 'Heyward, S', 'Allen, J M', 'Rasko, J E', 'Potter, J', 'Miller, A D']","['Kiem HP', 'Andrews RG', 'Morris J', 'Peterson L', 'Heyward S', 'Allen JM', 'Rasko JE', 'Potter J', 'Miller AD']","['Clinical Research and Molecular Medicine Divisions, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. hkiem@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fibronectins/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Papio', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74056-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 15;92(6):1878-86.,"['N01 AI35191/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,

It was recently reported that hematopoietic cytokines activate not only classical MAP kinases (ERK), but also p38 and JNK. However, the physiological function of these kinases in hematopoiesis remains obscure. We found that all MAP kinases examined, ERK1, ERK2, p38, JNK1, and JNK2, were rapidly and transiently activated by erythropoietin (Epo) stimulation in SKT6 cells, which can be induced to differentiate into hemoglobinized cells in response to Epo. Furthermore, p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 but not MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 significantly suppressed Epo-induced differentiation and antisense oligonucleotides of p38, JNK1, and JNK2, but neither ERK1 nor ERK2 clearly inhibited Epo-induced hemoglobinization. However, in Epo-dependent FD-EPO cells, inhibition of either ERKs, p38, or JNKs suppressed cell growth. Furthermore, forced expression of a gain-of-function MKK6 mutant, which specifically activated p38, induced hemoglobinization of SKT6 cells without Epo. These results indicate that activation of p38 and JNKs but not of ERKs is required for Epo-induced erythroid differentiation of SKT6 cells, whereas all of these kinases are involved in Epo-induced mitogenesis of FD-EPO cells.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Nagata, Y', 'Takahashi, N', 'Davis, R J', 'Todokoro, K']","['Nagata Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Davis RJ', 'Todokoro K']","['Tsukuba Life Science Center, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74054-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 15;92(6):1859-69.,,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,

T cells, B cells, and astrocytes, but not neurons, are infected by the virus. Primary splenocytes and thymocytes isolated from age-matched infected or control mice, when incubated in serum-deficient media containing phytohemagglutinin-L, either homotypically aggregate and survive or swell, expose their inner membrane phospholipids, and then shrink as they fragment their nuclei and excrete DNA-containing hypoploid minicells. In our present studies, the rates of these apoptotic changes were greatly increased in the infected cells. This thymocyte death was ameliorated in vitro by addition of Th2 cytokines, but not by Th1 cytokines, or by redox agents. In contrast, death of splenocytes, which were already mitogenically activated in vivo by the virus, was prevented by Th1 and Th2 cytokines plus redox support. In vivo, this ts1-induced neuroimmunodegenerative syndrome could be completely prevented by the immunomodulator polyinosine-cytosine and partially prevented by cytokines or redox modifiers. Viral titer primarily in the brain was also diminished by polyinosine-cytosine therapy.

It is now over 40 years since human pituitary GH (pit-hGH) was purified and the first GH-deficient patient, a 17-year-old male, was successfully treated with pit-hGH. However, the shortage of pit-hGH limited its use and the dose, the biopotency of preparations varied, strict criteria of GH deficiency (GHD) were used for patient selection including peak plasma immunoreactive GH levels after provocative stimuli of <3.5-5 ng/ml, treatment was not infrequently interrupted, the mean age for initiating treatment was often late in childhood (12-13 years) and the growth deficiency severe (height -4 to -6 SDS), and finally pit-hGH therapy was often discontinued when girls attained a height of 5' and boys 5'5"". Nonetheless, the effects of pit-hGH were dramatic; the final height SDS increased in isolated GHD to about -2 SDS in boys and -2.5 to -3.0 SDS in girls, and in multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies to between -1 and -2 SDS. Between 1962 and 1985 when the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease crisis struck, the number of GH-deficient patients treated with pit-hGH increased from about 150 to over 3,000. The advent of biosynthetic GH (rhGH) and its availability to treat large numbers of idiopathic GH-deficient children (the minimum prevalence rate of which in the USA and UK is between 1 in 3,400 and 4,000) dramatically changed this picture in 1985. It is estimated that more than 60,000 patients have been or are now on treatment. With rhGH treatment the attained mean adult height SDS is now about -1.0, and in our experience with the treatment of patients under 4 years of age, final height may exceed the target height. It is now recognized that (a) the replacement dose of rhGH ranges from 0.175 to 0.35 mg/kg/week and should be individualized; (b) dividing this dose into 6 or 7 daily subcutaneous injections is more effective than giving the same total dose in three weekly portions, and (c) final height correlates significantly with pretreatment chronologic age, height SDS and predicted adult height, duration of therapy, birth length, in some studies height SDS and age at start of puberty, weight, and serum GHBP (an indicator of GH receptor mass). Early recognition of GHD is essential for an optimal height outcome. rhGH treatment should not be delayed in children with documented GHD; the greater the height deficit, the lower the probability that target height will be reached. GHD needs to be detected earlier in children with organic hypopituitarism whether due to a developmental defect, neoplasm, radiation, head trauma, or a CNS infection. Early rhGH therapy in neonatal hypopituitarism has resulted in excellent growth responses. As the height prognosis in isolated GHD is not as good (especially in girls) as in GHD associated with gonadotropin deficiency, the use of LHRH agonists to delay puberty or potent aromatase inhibitors to delay skeletal maturation should be considered in selected patients with isolated GHD. When the growth response to rhGH is less than predicted, one must consider: (a) poor compliance; (b) improper preparation of rhGH for administration or faulty injection techniques; (c) the timing of administration; (d) the dose of glucocorticoid in the ACTH-deficient patient; (e) occult hypothyroidism; (f) inadequate nutrition; (g) a chronic illness; (h) neutralizing antibodies to rhGH, and (i) the wrong diagnosis. The major cause of mortality (unrelated to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or a CNS neoplasm) is adrenal crisis and hypoglycemia in children with both GH and ACTH deficiency. Major adverse effects of rhGH treatment in children are uncommon and include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and acute pancreatitis. The rhGH is not an added risk for leukemia in the US and Europe in the absence of coexisting risk factors, nor is there a higher risk of recurrence of b",,"['Grumbach, M M', 'Bin-Abbas, B S', 'Kaplan, S L']","['Grumbach MM', 'Bin-Abbas BS', 'Kaplan SL']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco 94143-0434, Calif., USA. grumbac@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,IM,"['Animals', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/*deficiency/history/*therapeutic use', 'History, Modern 1601-', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Time Factors']",1998/09/08 02:04,2000/08/16 11:00,['1998/09/08 02:04'],"['1998/09/08 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [medline]', '1998/09/08 02:04 [entrez]']","['hre9b041 [pii]', '10.1159/000053087 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 1998;49 Suppl 2:41-57. doi: 10.1159/000053087.,"['5T32-DK-07161/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR01271/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HD-02335/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],129,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocyte proliferative responses to Con A or to allogeneic lymphocytes with foreign major histocompatibility complex molecules (allo MHC) were determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation assays. Antigen-specific antibody and lymphocyte proliferative responses were measured following vaccination with tetanus toxoid (TT) and bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1). Lymphocytes from BIV-infected cattle had significantly (p<0.05) reduced proliferative responses to Con A, but responses to allo-MHC and TT did not differ from those of uninfected controls. BIV infection also had little effect on TT-specific antibody responses in vivo. In contrast, BLV-infected cattle had significantly increased secondary antibody responses to vaccination with TT, as well as enhancement of antibody responses to BHV-1. Co-infection with BIV did not alter the BLV effect, suggesting a lack of significant interaction between the two viruses in vivo. Numbers of circulating mononuclear cells were also higher in BLV-infected cattle, which was attributable to increases in both T and B cell numbers. Unstimulated lymphocytes from BLV-infected cattle had significantly increased spontaneous uptake of 3H-thymidine in vitro. When differences in counts per minute were analyzed, lymphocytes from BLV-infected cattle had slightly increased proliferative responses to Con A, but no consistent alternations in responsiveness to allo-MHC, TT, or BHV-1.

None of the cattle in this group were classified as persistently lymphocytotic, but they did have significantly increased numbers of circulating T and B cells. In order to investigate the potential mechanisms of BLV-induced immune activation, dual-color flow cytometry was used to compare the expression of MHC class II (MHC II) molecules and the inducible IL-2 receptor alpha chain, CD25, on lymphocyte subsets in freshly isolated and cultured PBMC from these same BLV-infected cattle (n=5) with that of age-matched, uninfected controls (n=3). Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BLV-infected cattle were found to contain a significantly higher percentage of B cells that expressed MHC II molecules (p<0.01). In addition, an increased proportion of CD4+ T cells from BLV-infected cattle expressed MHC II molecules after 20 h of Concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation (p<0.05), and MHC II expression was increased on both CD4+ (p<0.01) and CD8+ (p<0.05) T cells from BLV-infected cattle after 68 h in vitro, even in the absence of exogenous mitogen. Although CD25 expression was not increased on freshly isolated lymphocytes from BLV-infected cattle, an increased percentage of B cells from BLV-infected cattle expressed CD25 after 20 h of culture, either in the presence (p<0.05) or absence (p<0.01) of Con A. Thus, in addition to causing alterations in absolute numbers of circulating lymphocytes, BLV infection appears to cause a functional activation of both B and T cells, even in cattle that are non-lymphocytotic.

METHODS: The authors reviewed medical records of 10 consecutive patients with intraocular-CNS lymphoma seen at Okayama University Hospital during 16 years from 1981 to 1996. RESULTS: Three patients showed only vitreous opacity as an initial sign, whereas five other patients had typical yellowish-white infiltrates at the sub-retinal pigment epithelial (sub-RPE) level without vitreous opacity. Both manifestations were found in two patients. In seven patients, ocular symptoms developed first, followed by brain lesions. In contrast, in three patients the initial presentation was brain tumor, for which they received chemotherapy; subsequently, vitreous opacity without sub-RPE infiltrates developed. The diagnosis was made by vitrectomy in four patients, three of whom had also undergone brain biopsy; by aqueous tap in one; and by brain biopsy in one. The other four patients were diagnosed clinically, and one of them was confirmed later to have lymphoma by autopsy.

Interleukin-2-activated T cells expressed a large amount of FasL protein and could efficiently kill a Fas-sensitive leukemic cell line, MML-1. The major part (over 80%) of MML-1 cell death was Fas-dependent. Antibodies to CD2 and CD11a/CD18 completely inhibited MML-1 target cell lysis, whereas effector to target cell binding was partially reduced or not affected at all. These results suggest that effector/target interaction via CD2/CD58 and LFA-1/CD54 systems would be essential for triggering target cell death. More interestingly, there is the discordance in the ability of anti-CD2, and particularly anti-LFA-1 antibodies, to block Fas-dependent cell death versus effector to target conjugate formation. This suggests some non-adhesive role for CD2 and LFA-1 in induction of Fas-dependent cell death.

In order to understand the molecular mechanism regulating ML-1 cell differentiation, we focused on the characterization of immediate early genes activated by TPA using the mRNA differentiation display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) and Northern analyses. A modified procedure, the reverse dot slot, was developed to confirm upregulated genes during the early stages of TPA-induced ML-1 cell differentiation. DNA sequencing analyses of 10 subcloned cDNA fragments, selected on the basis of the outcome of the reverse dot slot procedure, revealed that eight were derived from distinct genes. Among these clones, one was a novel gene (G07-5), another (A02-1) was highly homologous to the sequence of a fetal brain cDNA fragment, and the remaining six corresponded to jun-D, rantes, ssat, CD 14, ferritin heavy chain (fhc) and transposons Tn10-like transcript, respectively. Although these genes were all upregulated by TPA, the peak time of mRNA expression varied. jun-D, ssat and A02-1 expressions were superinduced in the presence of cycloheximide, which indicates that they belong to the immediate early gene family.

Expression of this protein is regulated during the cell cycle, peaking in late G1 and S. We have previously shown that constitutive expression of p55Cdc results in inhibition of granulocyte differentiation. Degradation of p55Cdc is also required for apoptosis in growth factor and serum starved cells. In the present study we prepared stably transfected cells conditionally expressing p55Cdc in response to zinc stimulation to investigate the role of inducible p55Cdc expression in apoptosis of myeloid cells. We report that inducible expression of p55Cdc in the myeloid leukemic cell line 32Dc13 resulted in increased cell death. p55Cdc overexpression led to a statistically significant decrease in the viability of 32Dc13 cells compared with that of control cells. Furthermore, cell staining and flow cytometry analysis revealed that p55Cdc-overexpressing 32Dc13 cells progressed to apoptosis much earlier than uninduced cells. These results suggest that inducible expression of p55Cdc leads to earlier increases in cell death in the absence of growth factor and serum in myeloid leukemic cells.",,"['Lin, M', 'Mendoza, M', 'Kane, L', 'Weinstein, J', 'Sakamoto, K M']","['Lin M', 'Mendoza M', 'Kane L', 'Weinstein J', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine 90095-1752, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Cdc20 Proteins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/05 00:00,1998/09/05 00:01,['1998/09/05 00:00'],"['1998/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Sep;26(10):1000-6.,,"['0 (Cdc20 Proteins)', '0 (Cdc20 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,

However, gene-marking studies in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma have revealed that malignant cells reinfused along with leukapheresis products (LPs) contribute to relapse. Thus, a reduction in the number of malignant cells in autografts is desirable. We analyzed the percentage of malignant cells and the number of CD34+ PBSCs in LPs mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (LP-S) compared with high-dose cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF (LP-CY) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay involving CDR3-specific primers based on the method of limiting dilutions was used to determine the tumor loads of LPs. Sixteen LPs from eight patients with MM were analyzed intraindividually in matched pairs. The percentage of malignant cells was lower in LP-CY (p = 0.017; median 0.0067 vs. 0.009%), whereas the number of CD34+ cells was higher (p = 0.012; median 0.3 vs. 0.095%). The calculated number of malignant cells per CD34+ cell was significantly lower in LP-CY as well (p = 0.017).

The transgene neoR was detectable by polymerase chain reaction assay in colonies from 14-day colony-forming unit (CFU) assays and in those derived from long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-ICs) assays. Although the overall levels of transduction efficiency were similar in cord blood and PBPCs from noninfected cancer donors (25-22%) when either LPONL(G) or LPONL(A) was used, they were significantly lower in HIV-1-infected donors compared with noninfected cancer donors when LPONL(G) was used (13 vs. 25%; p = 0.027), and when LPONL(A) was used (12 vs. 22%; p = 0.087).

The limits may, therefore, be reached only in rare, special cases. However, in principle, there might be cases in which the annual limit is continuously exhausted throughout a working life; a high total dose of 0.8 Sv could then be reached. In view of this possibility, there have been considerations of an added restriction by limiting the lifetime occupational dose to 0.4 Sv. The implications of such lifetime doses are considered, and it is shown that an exposure up to the maximum of 0.8 Sv will lead to the need for compensation, if a leukaemia were to occur in the exposed worker. A lifetime dose of 0.4 Sv equally spread over a working life will not lead to the critical value of the probability of causation in excess of 0.5. Nevertheless, it could cause such critical values when it is accumulated during shorter periods. More decisive than the probabilities of causation are, however, the absolute numbers of excess cases of leukaemia due to the occupational exposure. It is seen that less than one excess case would be expected if a group of 100 workers were all exposed to the maximum of 0.8 Sv.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether elevated levels of LPA are present in plasma from patients with ovarian cancer and other gynecologic malignancies compared with healthy controls and to evaluate whether an elevated LPA plasma level may be a biomarker for these diseases. DESIGN: A research assay was used to measure total LPA levels in plasma from healthy women and women with different diseases. All LPA assays and comparison of LPA levels and CA125 (an ovarian cancer biomarker) levels were performed by observers blinded to patient status or group. SETTING: The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 48 healthy control women, 48 women with ovarian cancer, 36 women with other gynecologic cancers, 17 women with benign gynecologic diseases, 11 women with breast cancer, and 5 women with leukemias. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total LPA levels in plasma samples from patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients in the ovarian cancer group had significantly higher plasma LPA levels (mean, 8.6 micromol/L; range, 1.0-43.1 micromol/L) compared with the healthy control group (mean, 0.6 micromol/L; range, <0.1-6.3 micromol/L) (P<.001). Elevated plasma LPA levels were detected in 9 of 10 patients with stage I ovarian cancer, 24 of 24 patients with stage II, III, and IV ovarian cancer, and 14 of 14 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Of 36 patients with other gynecologic cancers, 33 also showed higher LPA levels(mean, 14.9 micromol/L; range, <0.1-63.2 pmol/L), compared with healthy controls (P<.001). Elevated plasma LPA levels were detected in 5 of 48 controls and 4 of 17 patients with benign gynecologic diseases and in no women with breast cancer or leukemia. In comparison, among a subset of patients with ovarian cancer, 28 of 47 had elevated CA125 levels, including 2 of 9 patients with stage I disease. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma LPA levels may represent a potential biomarker for ovarian cancer and other gynecologic cancers.

In these mice, the transgenic HPV 16 genome cosegregated with the tumor phenotype. E6/E7 expression was observed in both carcinomas and T-cell lymphomas, while E2 expression was observed only in T-cell lymphomas.

To establish that this is the case, expression of genes downstream from E6/E7 and oncogenes involved in T-cell lymphoma formation were analyzed. p53 mutations were observed in two of five tumors that lacked E6 expression. High levels of c-myc gene expression were observed in five of six tumors with E7 expression, suggesting that a pathway involving E7, inactivation of Rb, and activation of c-myc is important in tumorigenesis of HPV 16 in these transgenic animals. High levels of expression of the c-Pim gene were also noted in two of three c-myc-expressing T-cell lymphomas, suggesting cooperation between these two proto-oncogenes.

Our previous results showed enhanced mortality after one injection of morphine in association with Friend leukaemia virus infection. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of some other opioids (pethidine and pentazocine) and an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine on the survival of animals under two conditions: (1) Friend leukaemia virus infection which mostly depressed immune functions, and (2) Toxoplasma gondii infection which in general enhanced the immune status. In contrast to our previous observation with morphine, the mortality induced by single doses of pethidine (150 mg/kg) or pentazocine (50-75 mg/kg) was unchanged during the Friend leukaemia virus infection. A single injection of neostigmine (0.42 or 0.56 mg/kg) was significantly more lethal in DBA-2 mice infected with Friend leukaemia virus. Neostigmine in doses of 0.33 and 0.4 mg/kg caused death in 46 % and 57 %, respectively, of animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii which was significantly higher in comparison with only 8 % and 12.5 % in control groups. Pethidine (150 mg/kg) killed 70 % of Toxoplasma gondii infected animals and even 90 % of non-infected mice.

The human cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay allows for the measurement of the concentration of normal as well as malignant stem cells, while their progeny can be measured in parallel long-term culture (LTC) in flasks. Using CAFC and LTC assays, we have examined direct effects of IFN-alpha (500; 5,000 IU/ml) on the maintenance and outgrowth of CD34-enriched normal and malignant stem cells, obtained from six patients with an established major cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha and from four nonresponding patients. CAFC concentrations were not affected by IFN-alpha. In contrast, IFN-alpha strongly inhibited the clonogenic output in flask LTC. Nucleated cells (NC) produced in LTC were evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation. After 8 wk of LTC, the percentage of Ph+ NCs produced was significantly more inhibited by IFN-alpha in responding patients than in nonresponders. Control LTC without IFN-alpha showed no significant differences of Ph+ NC production between responders and nonresponders.

We have now purified HS2NF5 to near-homogeneity from fetal bovine thymus. Two polypeptides of 56 and 61 kDa copurified with the DNA binding activity. The two proteins bound to the LCR recognition site with an affinity (3.1 nM) and specificity similar to mouse erythroleukemia cell HS2NF5. The amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of purified HS2NF5 revealed it to be identical to the murine homolog of the suppressor of hairless transcription factor, also known as recombination signal binding protein Jkappa or C promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1). The CBF1 site within HS2 resides near sites for hematopoietic regulators such as GATA-1, NF-E2, and TAL1. An additional conserved, high affinity CBF1 site was localized within HS4 of the LCR.

Evidence for time-dependent signal generation.,23830-6,"Neutrophils and transfected RBL-2H3 cells were used to investigate the mechanism of cross-regulation of the human interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 by chemoattractants. In neutrophils, Ca2+ mobilization by the CXCR2-specific chemokine, growth-related oncogene alpha (Groalpha), was desensitized by prior exposure to the chemoattractants N-formylated peptides (fMLP) or a complement cleavage product (C5a). In contrast, growth-related oncogene alpha did not desensitize the latter receptors. To investigate this phenomenon, CXCR2 was stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells and mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, chemotaxis, and secretion. In cells co-expressing CXCR2 and receptors for either C5a (C5aR) or fMLP (FR), CXCR2 was cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized by C5a and fMLP. However, neither C5aR nor FR was cross-phosphorylated or cross-desensitized by CXCR2 activation, although CXCR1 did mediate this process. Receptor internalization induced by IL-8 was more rapid and occurred at lower doses with CXCR2 than CXCR1, although both receptors mediated equipotent chemotaxis and exocytosis in RBL. Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of CXCR2 (331T) prolonged its signaling relative to CXCR2, increased its resistance to internalization, and induced phospholipase D activation. 331T was resistant to homologous phosphorylation and cross-phosphorylation but not cross-desensitization of its Ca2+ mobilization by fMLP or C5a, indicating an inhibitory site distal to receptor/G protein coupling. In contrast to CXCR2, stimulation of 331T cross-desensitized Ca2+ mobilization by both FR and C5aR. CXCR2 and the mutant 331T induced phospholipase C beta3 phosphorylation to an extent equivalent to that of CXCR1. Taken together, these results suggest that CXCR1 and CXCR2 bind IL-8 to produce a group of equipotent responses, but their ability to generate other signals, including receptor internalization, cross-desensitization, and phospholipase D activation, are very different. The latter phenomena apparently require prolonged receptor activation, which in the case of CXCR2 is precluded by rapid receptor phosphorylation and internalization. Thus, receptors coupling to identical G proteins may trigger different cellular responses dependent on the length of their signaling time, which can be regulated by receptor phosphorylation.",,"['Richardson, R M', 'Pridgen, B C', 'Haribabu, B', 'Ali, H', 'Snyderman, R']","['Richardson RM', 'Pridgen BC', 'Haribabu B', 'Ali H', 'Snyderman R']","['Department of Medicine, Duke university Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. richa021@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology/physiology', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/03 00:00,1998/09/03 00:01,['1998/09/03 00:00'],"['1998/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.37.23830 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)60212-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Sep 11;273(37):23830-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.37.23830.,"['AI-38910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-03738/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-54166/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,

We show here that RNA for this transcription factor did not alter during erythropoietin-induced differentiation of J2E cells; however, EKLF protein content decreased and was inversely related to globin production. This unexpected result was also observed during chemically induced maturation of two murine erythroleukemia cell lines. To explore the role of EKLF in erythroid terminal differentiation, an antisense EKLF construct was introduced into J2E cells. As a consequence EKLF RNA and protein levels fell by approximately 80%, and the cells were unable to manufacture hemoglobin in response to erythropoietin. The failure to produce hemoglobin was due to reduced transcription of not only globin genes but also key heme enzyme genes. However, numerous other genes, including several erythroid transcription factors, were unaffected by the decrease in EKLF. Although hemoglobin synthesis was severely impaired with depleted EKLF levels, morphological maturation in response to erythropoietin continued normally. Moreover, erythropoietin-induced proliferation and viability were unaffected by the decrease in EKLF levels.

In the present study, we attempted to identify biological significance of the corresponding molecules in human, using five myasthenic thymuses (three with hyperplasia and two with thymoma) that had been surgically removed for therapeutic purpose. With immunohistochemistry, many biglycan positive cells were detected in the germinal center of the three hyperplastic thymuses, but not in the two thymuses associated with lymphocytic thymoma. Biglycan purified from the hyperplastic thymuses by an immunoaffinity column was found as a monomer with apparent molecular size of 95-100 kDa and self associated oligomers of greater than 201 kDa. The purified biglycan markedly stimulated the growth and differentiation of monocytic cells from haemopoietic stem cells of the rat bone marrow.

DESIGN: A historical cohort study. SETTING: A university teaching hospital and tertiary referral center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 53 patients with neutropenia during chemotherapy and with first episodes of pulmonary infiltrates during a 4-year period were studied. Prognostic analysis included 38 variables. Multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression. RESULTS: The survival rate from pneumonia was 57% (30/53). The following eight parameters were significantly associated with death in univariate analysis: comorbidity present; development of ""late"" pulmonary infiltrates (> or = 14 days after hospital admission); heart rate > or = 100 beats/min; a ratio heart rate/systolic blood pressure (HR/SBP) > or = 1.2; urea nitrogen > 7 mmol/L; radiographic score > or = 3; neutropenia < 1.0x10(9)/L at the treatment end point; and failed complete remission. In a multivariate model including only parameters available at diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates, the presence of a ratio HR/SBP > or = 1.2 and of a radiographic score > or = 3 remained independently associated with death. In a second model also including the evolutionary parameter neutropenia < or = 1.0x10(9)/L at the treatment end point, both parameters remained significant together with neutropenia <1.0x 10(9)/L at the treatment end point. The presence of a ratio HR/SBP > or = 1.2 was a strong marker of early death. CONCLUSION: Both therapy- and malignancy-associated neutropenia as well as the severity of illness associated with pulmonary infiltrates are independent prognostic factors. Patients with a ratio HR/SBP > or = 1.2 at diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates suffer from potentially reversible acute illness, are at risk for early death and, therefore, may be appropriate candidates for treatment in an ICU.",,"['Ewig, S', 'Glasmacher, A', 'Ulrich, B', 'Wilhelm, K', 'Schafer, H', 'Nachtsheim, K H']","['Ewig S', 'Glasmacher A', 'Ulrich B', 'Wilhelm K', 'Schafer H', 'Nachtsheim KH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Blast Crisis/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/03 00:00,1998/09/03 00:01,['1998/09/03 00:00'],"['1998/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-3692(15)47724-4 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.114.2.444 [doi]']",ppublish,Chest. 1998 Aug;114(2):444-51. doi: 10.1378/chest.114.2.444.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,

This review showed toxicities to be fairly consistent across dosing schedules, although the severity and extent of diarrhea and neutropenia differed somewhat. The institution of intensive loperamide therapy and perhaps myeloid growth factors may have allowed for further dose escalation on some schedules, although it is unclear whether dosing intensity should be pursued without regard to dosing frequency. Preliminary antitumor activity of irinotecan noted in a study of leukemia and lymphoma supports the theory that the drug may exhibit schedule-dependent antitumor activity.

Sequenced PCR products for these deletions are consistent with a V(D)J recombinase-mediated mechanism underlying their genesis. Herein, we describe the isolation and characterization of an etoposide-induced mutant CEM cell line that is clonal for a V(D)J recombinase-mediated exon 2 + 3 deletion. Human CCRF-CEM cells were exposed to 5 muM etoposide for 4 h, selected in 6-thioguanine, and an exon 2 + 3 deletion mutant was isolated through serial limiting dilution, using a PCR-based assay for detection of the exon 2 + 3 deletion. Untreated CEM cells and cells treated with 6-thioguanine alone were similarly subcultured. The exon 2 + 3 deletion-containing line was termed SJCEM808 and had a slightly longer doubling time than the control lines, tended to clump in suspension, and was characterized by cell membrane blebbing. Compared to the parent line, SJCEM808 had similar cytogenetic abnormalities, lower CD2, CD1, and CD10 expression, and negligible RAG-1 expression. However, RAG-1 expression was down-regulated in some untreated parental subclones following similar subculturing. The sequence of the exon 2 + 3 deletion mutation exhibited nucleotide insertions, and the breakpoints were adjacent to heptamer signal recognition sequences in intact hprt, consistent with a V(D)J recombinase-mediated mechanism underlying its genesis. There were no MLL gene or interlocus T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements. These results indicate that non-homologous recombination following etoposide treatment is neither necessarily accompanied by other large DNA rearrangements nor simply a pre-lethal event, and this cell line may serve as a useful tool for studying illegitimate V(D)J recombinase-mediated deletions.",,"['Chen, C L', 'Woo, M H', 'Neale, G A', 'Goorha, R M', 'Fuscoe, J C', 'Behm, F G', 'Mathew, S', 'Relling, M V']","['Chen CL', 'Woo MH', 'Neale GA', 'Goorha RM', 'Fuscoe JC', 'Behm FG', 'Mathew S', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Exons', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, RAG-1', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1998/09/03 00:00,1998/09/03 00:01,['1998/09/03 00:00'],"['1998/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(98)00062-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0027-5107(98)00062-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1998 Jul 17;403(1-2):113-25. doi: 10.1016/s0027-5107(98)00062-1.,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",,,,,,,,,,

To date, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. We have previously demonstrated that the spontaneous somatic mutant frequency (Mf) at a reporter gene, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), from a normal population showed a strict age dependency with an exponential increase in Mf from birth to late adolescents with a subsequent linear 2-5% increase per year in adults. In this study, we compared HPRT Mf in children and adults with Down syndrome using the HPRT T-cell cloning assay. We determined the Mf at the HPRT locus in 27 subjects with Down syndrome from ages 6 months to 53.4 years. Results demonstrated that background somatic Mf at the HPRT locus in children and adults with Down syndrome are not dependent on age as seen in a normal control population. Results also show that adults with Down syndrome have a significantly lower Mf than normal adults, and that children with Down syndrome have a significantly higher Mf than normal children, although the latter appears to be due to a decreased cloning efficiency (CE). These observations demonstrate that the frequency of spontaneous somatic mutations in children and adults with Down syndrome are atypical compared to normal controls, and suggest that the genetic mechanisms associated with background somatic mutational events in children and adults with Down syndrome may be different.",,"['Finette, B A', 'Rood, B', 'Poseno, T', 'Vacek, P', 'Pueschel, S', 'Homans, A C']","['Finette BA', 'Rood B', 'Poseno T', 'Vacek P', 'Pueschel S', 'Homans AC']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont, Burlington 05401, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1998/09/03 00:00,1998/09/03 00:01,['1998/09/03 00:00'],"['1998/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(98)00024-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0027-5107(98)00024-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1998 Jul 17;403(1-2):35-43. doi: 10.1016/s0027-5107(98)00024-4.,['1K11HD01010/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)'],,,,,,,,,,

However, in a recent study with BALB/cJ mice, using optimum conditions as defined by Nomura, we were unable to confirm this. We have now repeated the investigation using a different inbred strain, C3H/HeH, with and without tumour promotion in the F1 by urethane, again using protocols defined by Nomura. In a series of replicate studies spanning over 2 years, males were exposed to single, acute doses of 0, 250 and 500 cGy X-rays and thereafter placed with two females each in each of two consecutive weeks. Half the offspring from each treatment group and each week of mating were given 5 mmol/kg body weight of the urethane, while the remainder remained untreated. Most of the offspring produced were killed and scored for lung tumours at 6 months of age, while the rest were examined at 12 months of age. The proportion of fertile females and litter size provided evidence of a dose-dependent mutational response to the paternal irradiation, but no trace of a radiation-enhanced lung tumour incidence was detected among the progeny, whether in the urethane or non-urethane groups at 6 or 12 months of age, and whether assessed by numbers of mice with tumours, clusters of tumours, or cluster size. As seen in the BALB/cJ study, significant differences among different replicates were found, again suggesting a cyclical or seasonal variation in tumour incidence, but the variations seen with the two strains were not the same. The need for concurrent controls for tumour work was, nevertheless, again indicated. The overall findings do not therefore accord with those of Nomura.

Its structure is based on the antifolate ICI 198583, but with a pyridine ring replacing the glutamate. Despite its structure, CB30865 does not act in vitro via inhibition of TS or, apparently, other known folate-dependent pathways, and extensive mechanistic studies suggest that it acts via a novel locus with respect to conventional antitumour agents. However, CB30865 is highly potent against a variety of human tumour cell lines (e.g., 50%-inhibitory concentration [IC50] values in the 1-10 nM range). Thus, the cell cycle effects of CB30865 were investigated. DNA histogram analysis of W1L2 human lymphoblastoid, L1210 murine leukaemia, and CH1 human ovarian cells (propidium iodide staining) has demonstrated that CB30865 does not cause a phase-specific arrest at concentrations that have been shown to inhibit colony formation. This is unexpected for an anticancer agent. In W1L2 cells, using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labelling and bivariate Hoechst/ propidium iodide staining, it was revealed that 0.003-0.15 microM CB30865 (1-50 x 72 h IC50) caused cells to arrest in all phases of the cell cycle simultaneously after 20-24 h exposure. This effect was also observed in CH1 and L1210 cells, though the arrest was at slightly different times. Thus, using this technique, it has been demonstrated that CB30865 induces an unusual and delayed cell cycle arrest, which provides further evidence for a novel locus of action for this compound.",,"['Skelton, L A', 'Ormerod, M G', 'Titley, J C', 'Jackman, A L']","['Skelton LA', 'Ormerod MG', 'Titley JC', 'Jackman AL']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics at the Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom. lskelton@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Animals', 'Bisbenzimidazole', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Propidium', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/02 05:29,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/02 05:29'],"['1998/09/02 05:29 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/02 05:29 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980901)33:1<56::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980901)33:1<56::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Sep 1;33(1):56-66. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980901)33:1<56::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-9.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'LHQ7J5KV9B (Bisbenzimidazole)', 'N8VP1Y24AU (ICI 198583)']",,,,,,,,,,

One myeloid cell line, HL-60, was MPO-positive, while the other myeloid cell lines (KG-1, K-562, and MEG-01) as well as lymphoid cell lines (KM-3, NALM-6, Raji, REH, and T-ALL-1) were MPO-negative as previously described. Among acute leukemias, MPO was detected in 23 of 26 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 7 of 23 cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 1 of 6 cases of T-lineage ALL (T-ALL), and 1 of 2 cases of acute unclassified leukemia (AUL). The intensity of MPO expression in 6 of 7 B-lineage ALL cases was weak compared with AML labeling. There was no detectable cytochemical MPO in the cells of ALL, AUL, or AML that stained negative for anti-MPO. No relationship between the expression of MPO and myeloid lineage surface antigens was observed in ALL.

AML1 up-regulates a number of target genes critical to normal hematopoiesis, whereas the AML1/ETO fusion interferes with this trans-activation. We discovered that the fusion partner ETO binds to the human homolog of the murine nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR). The interaction is mediated by two unusual zinc finger motifs present at the carboxyl terminus of ETO. Human N-CoR (HuN-CoR), which we cloned and sequenced in its entirety, encodes a 2,440-amino acid polypeptide and has a central domain that binds ETO. N-CoR, mammalian Sin3 (mSin3A and B), and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) form a complex that alters chromatin structure and mediates transcriptional repression by nuclear receptors and by a number of oncoregulatory proteins. We found that ETO, through its interaction with the N-CoR/mSin3/HDAC1 complex, is also a potent repressor of transcription.

The mechanisms that govern long-term patterns of gene expression are not well understood. In Drosophila, active and silent states of developmentally regulated loci are maintained by trithorax and Polycomb group. We have examined the developmental role of a mammalian homolog of trx and putative oncogene, Mll. Knockout mice reveal that Mll is required for maintenance of gene expression early in embryogenesis. Downstream targets of Mll including Hoxa7 are activated appropriately in the absence of Mll but require Mll for sustaining their expression. The Mll-/- phenotype manifests later in development and is characterized by branchial arch dysplasia and aberrant segmental boundaries of spinal ganglia and somites.

We previously have used Mu-mediated PCR to probe the nucleoprotein organization of Moloney murine leukemia virus preintegration complexes. A region of protection spans several hundred base pairs at each end of the viral DNA, and strong enhancements are present near the termini. Here, we show that these footprints reflect a specific association between integrase and the viral DNA ends in functional preintegration complexes. Barrier-to-autointegration factor, a cellular protein that blocks autointegration of Moloney murine leukemia virus DNA, also plays an indirect role in generating the footprints at the ends of the viral DNA. We have exploited Mu-mediated PCR to examine the effect of mutations at the viral DNA termini on complex formation. We find that a replication competent mutant with a deletion at one end of the viral DNA still exhibits a strong enhancement about 20 bp from the terminus of the mutant DNA end. The site of the enhancement therefore appears to be at a fixed distance from the ends of the viral DNA. We also find that a mutation at one end of the viral DNA, which renders the virus incompetent for replication, abolishes the enhancements and protection at both the U3 and U5 ends.

We studied one of these fragments containing two E-boxes, CAGATG and CAGGTC, followed by a GATA motif, and showed that TAL-1 binds to the CAGGTG E-box with an affinity modulated by the CAGATG or the GATA site, and that the CAGGTG-GATA motif exhibits positive transcriptional activity in MEL but not in HeLa cells. This immunoselected sequence is located within an intron of a new gene co-expressed with TAL-1 in endothelial and erythroid cells, but not expressed in fibroblasts or adult liver where no TAL-1 mRNA was detected. Finally, in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells towards the erythro/megakaryocytic pathways showed that the TAL-1 target gene expression followed TAL-1 and GATA-1 expression.

Moreover, 4HPR but not RA induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells. To investigate further the observed biological effects, cyclin D1 and cdk4 expression and the level of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein Rb were assessed. Cyclin D1 and cdk4 expression and Rb phosphorylation were significantly reduced, by 40-75%, after 24 hr of treatment with RA or 4HPR; these decreases were either transient, e.g., only at 24 hr for cdk4, or sustained for 72 hr. In general, more pronounced decreases were seen in the 4HPR-treated cells. Evidence for 4HPR-induced apoptosis comes from (1) cleavage of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to an 89-kDa truncated product, (2) appearance of DNA ladders on agarose gel electrophoresis, and (3) higher incorporation in situ of digoxigenin nucleotides into the free 3'-ends of DNA. Overnight pretreatment with 0.5-5.0 microM of the CPP32 inhibitor DEVD, but not the ICE inhibitor YVAD, significantly reduced the specific processing of PARP, suggesting that CPP32 is involved in the mechanism of action of 4HPR. Analysis of 2 lipid-derived second messengers, ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG), as a function of time of treatment with RA or 4HPR, showed ceramide but not DAG to be significantly albeit transiently increased 2-fold at 3 hr, by 4HPR. To test further whether ceramide may be involved in the signaling cascade that culminates in the induction of apoptosis in 4HPR-treated HL-60 cells, the effects of fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, were studied. Simultaneous treatment of cells with 4HPR and 25-100 microM fumonisin B1 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the elevation in ceramide, the extent of PARP cleavage, and induction of apoptosis. Pretreatment with DEVD or YVAD, on the other hand, had no effect on the 4HPR-induced increase in ceramide.",,"['DiPietrantonio, A M', 'Hsieh, T C', 'Olson, S C', 'Wu, J M']","['DiPietrantonio AM', 'Hsieh TC', 'Olson SC', 'Wu JM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carboxylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/pharmacology', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', '*Fumonisins', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",1998/09/02 05:27,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/02 05:27'],"['1998/09/02 05:27 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/02 05:27 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980925)78:1<53::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980925)78:1<53::aid-ijc10>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 Sep 25;78(1):53-61. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980925)78:1<53::aid-ijc10>3.0.co;2-6.,,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,

Following glucocorticoid treatment of 6TG1.1 cells, chromatin fragmentation was observed after a delay of 24 h. Fragmentation was not observed in ICR27TK.3 cells containing mutant glucocorticoid receptors (L753F) that are activation-deficient but retain the ability to repress AP-1 activity. Nor was fragmentation observed after treatment with RU38486, indicating that repression of AP-1 activity is not involved. As described in other systems, fragmentation required ongoing protein synthesis. However, inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide anytime during the first 18 h of steroid treatment was as effective in blocking chromatin fragmentation as inhibition for the entire period, suggesting that synthesis of a component with a rapid turnover rate is required. Dexamethasone treatment completely blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induction of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity and elicited an increase in the amount of immunoreactive IkappaB alpha in sensitive 6TG1.1 cells but not in resistant ICR27TK.3 cells. In addition, mild detergent treatment of cell extracts indicated that a substantial amount of cytoplasmic NF-kappaB is complexed with IkappaB alpha or some other inhibitory factor.

Extracellular ATP (EC50=146+/-57 microM) and various ATP analogues activated cyclic AMP production in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. 2. The order of agonist potency was: ATPgammaS (adenosine 5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate]) > or = BzATP (2'&3'O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine-5'-triphosphate) > or = dATP > ATP. The following agonists (in order of effectiveness at 1 mM) were all less effective than ATP at concentrations up to 1 mM: beta,gamma methylene ATP > or = 2-methylthioATP > ADP > or = Ap4A (P1, P4-di(adenosine-5') tetraphosphate) > or = Adenosine > UTP. The poor response to UTP indicates that P2Y2 receptors are not responsible for ATP-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase. 3. Several thiophosphorylated analogs of ATP were more potent activators of cyclic AMP production than ATP. Of these, ATPgammaS (EC50=30.4+/-6.9 microM) was a full agonist. However, adenosine 5'-O-[1-thiotriphosphate] (ATPalphaS; EC50=45+/-15 microM) and adenosine 5'-O-[2-thiodiphosphate] (ADPbetaS; EC50=33.3+/-5.0 microM) were partial agonists. 4. ADPbetaS (IC50=146+/-32 microM) and adenosine 5'-O-thiomonophosphate (AMPS; IC50=343+/-142 microM) inhibited cyclic AMP production by a submaximal concentration of ATP (100 microM). Consistent with its partial agonist activity, ADPbetaS was estimated to maximally suppress ATP-induced cyclic AMP production by about 65%. AMPS has not been previously reported to inhibit P2 receptors. 5. The broad spectrum P2 receptor antagonist, suramin (500 microM), abolished ATP-stimulated cyclic AMP production by HL-60 cells but the adenosine receptor antagonists xanthine amine congener (XAC; 20 microM) and 8-sulpho-phenyltheophylline (8-SPT; 100 microM) were without effect. 6. Extracellular ATP also activated protein kinase A (PK-A) consistent with previous findings that PK-A activation is involved in ATP-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells (Jiang et al., 1997). 7.

The authors reviewed their experience with FNA and flow cytometry (FC) to determine the usefulness and limitations of these techniques in the diagnosis of NHL. METHODS: Slides and reports from all lymph node and extranodal FNAs performed during the period July 1993 to January 1997 with a diagnosis of lymphoma or benign lymphoid process were reviewed. Clinical and biopsy follow-up data were recorded. Results were tabulated and the usefulness of cytology was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 100 adequate aspirates from 87 patients. These included 72 cases of NHL, 58 (80%) of which were diagnosed by FNA and FC without the need for histologic sampling (69% of the primary lymphomas and 88% of the recurrent lymphomas). There were 22 aspirates suspicious for lymphoma, 12 equivocal results, and 7 benign diagnoses. Eighty-six percent of malignant FNAs (50 of 58) had flow cytometry (FC) as compared with only 15% (5 of 34) of the suspicious or equivocal FNAs. CONCLUSIONS: FNA is a valuable method for diagnosing and subclassifying NHL, although immunophenotyping by FC is often an essential ancillary test. In our experience, correlating the FNA results with the FC results can eliminate the need for a more invasive surgical biopsy in many cases.",,"['Young, N A', 'Al-Saleem, T I', 'Ehya, H', 'Smith, M R']","['Young NA', 'Al-Saleem TI', 'Ehya H', 'Smith MR']","['Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['*Biopsy, Needle', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/09/02 05:26,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/02 05:26'],"['1998/09/02 05:26 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/02 05:26 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980825)84:4<252::AID-CNCR11>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Aug 25;84(4):252-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of Gaucher's disease was made in early childhood by bone marrow biopsy and was recently confirmed by biochemical demonstration of reduced leukocyte beta-glucocerebrosidase activity and the presence of Gaucher cells in a bone marrow aspirate. We analyzed the patient's genomic DNA for the underlying glucocerebrosidase mutations and have found homozygosity for a C-->T transition in cDNA nucleotide 593 (159 Pro-->Leu), presently an undescribed mutation. After initiation of replacement therapy with alglucerase we observed a significant increase of the platelet count in our patient. The diagnosis of CML was based on standard hematological parameters and the detection of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph).

At the single-cell level, the region of interest is normally set by a variable aperture placed within the microscope emission pathway. The present study reports an improved aperture controller which adjusts the area for fluorescence measurement, whilst allowing objects throughout the field of view to be continuously monitored using infra-red illumination. A rectangular aperture is selected by four 715-nm long-pass glass filters which block > 99.9% of the fluorescence emission at 480-600 nm. A 780-nm long-pass glass filter is used to provide infra-red illumination which does not interfere with the fluorescence signal, yet is detectable by a standard CCD camera. This allows detection of morphological events throughout the field of view and facilitates manipulation of extracellular pipettes, without interruption to a single-cell fluorescence recording. The infra-red light-transmitting controller is suitable for use with a range of other fluorescent indicators, including those routinely used to detect Ca2+, Cl-, Na+ and pH.

RESULTS: After addition of a purine nucleoside analogue, CdA-TP and F-Ara-ATP accumulate in cells while the levels of dCf-TP formed were not detectable by ultra-violet absorbance. In response to accumulating concentrations of drug triphosphate, the cellular levels of dNTPs initially decrease (0-4 h), then accumulate above their initial levels (4-10 h) before slowly declining beyond 10 h. NTPs also accumulate during the period 4-10 h before declining at later times. CONCLUSION: The temporal effects on the levels of dNTPs and NTPs of the 3 purine nucleoside analogues are similar against CCRF-CEM and Raji cells. However, CdA induces major depletions of dTTP, dGTP and dATP in CCRF-CEM cells and F-Ara-A induces a major accumulation of dATP in Raji cells.",,"['Wilson, P K', 'Szabados, E', 'Mulligan, S P', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Wilson PK', 'Szabados E', 'Mulligan SP', 'Christopherson RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cladribine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Pentostatin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",1998/09/02 00:00,1998/09/02 00:01,['1998/09/02 00:00'],"['1998/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1357272598000247 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00024-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1998 Jul;30(7):833-42. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00024-7.,,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,

With this system, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed a markedly positive response. Among the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, both fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN) markedly induced luciferase activity, but others did so but much lesser extent. Among the synthetic peptides having Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences, only FLEPP with multiple RGD significantly induced luciferase activity. Pretreatment of the cells with anti-integrin alpha 6, alpha M, beta 1 and beta 2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) significantly reduced the LPS-induced responses and anti-alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 3 mAbs to lesser extent, and anti-alpha 5, alpha 6, alpha M, beta 1 and beta 2 mAbs blocked the FN-induced response. In the cell-to-cell interactions, significantly positive increase was observed by direct contacting this cell line with a G-CSF-dependent promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, known to stimulate the induction of G-CSF to the stromal cells. Its effect was mostly blocked by pretreatment with anti-integrin alpha 5, alpha L, beta 1 and beta 2 and anti-ICAM-1 mAbs.

The prognosis of patients with GS is generally regarded as being less favorable than of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). GS occurs relatively commonly in Africa and has been reported to affect 10-25% of black children presenting with AML. We sought to establish the incidence of GS in our pediatric population, to determine whether an association with t(8;21) existed, and to report on the outcome of these cases in a single series. PROCEDURE: The records of consecutive pediatric patients treated for de novo AML in Johannesburg between January 1985-December 1995 were reviewed. Fifteen cases of GS among a total of 88 cases of AML presented to the Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Clinics of the Johannesburg and Baragwanath Hospitals. Fourteen (93%) of these patients were black male children. RESULTS: All 9 cases of orbital GS (60%) and almost all cases with concurrent AML M2 had t(8;21). This translocation was present in only 4 n(8.5%) of the remaining 47 AML cases without GS for which cytogenetic data were available. One case presented with a complex chromosomal translocation not previously associated with GS. The median disease-free survival of the GS patients, using conventional chemotherapy treatment protocols, was significantly better than for the patients with AML and no GS (P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a strong association between orbital GS, t(8;21), and AML M2 in the pediatric population. This entity occurred virtually exclusively in black male children at presentation. One third of these children who presented with AML had a GS. The favorable prognosis noted in our GS patients on standard induction and intensification therapy without local irradiation conflicts with some previous reports but is consistent with the favorable outcome documented in AML with t(8;21).",,"['Schwyzer, R', 'Sherman, G G', 'Cohn, R J', 'Poole, J E', 'Willem, P']","['Schwyzer R', 'Sherman GG', 'Cohn RJ', 'Poole JE', 'Willem P']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Blacks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'South Africa/ethnology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Whites']",1998/09/02 05:25,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/02 05:25'],"['1998/09/02 05:25 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/02 05:25 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199809)31:3<144::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199809)31:3<144::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1998 Sep;31(3):144-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199809)31:3<144::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have cloned human GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase cDNA, based on the sequence homology to cloned cDNA of mouse GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase. The predicted protein sequence of the human enzyme was highly homologous to that of the mouse enzyme; in the 363 amino acid stretch of the catalytic region, the two proteins were nearly identical except for conservative changes in 3 amino acid residues. The expressed enzyme transferred sulfate to GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Gl cNAc. Co-transfection of the enzyme cDNA and fucosyltransferase VII cDNA into COS-7 cells resulted in cell surface expression of 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X.

Although the exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to leukemogenesis is still unclear, the Tax protein is thought to play a major role in this process. This 40-kDa polypeptide is able to interact with the tumor suppressor p16(INK4A). Consequently, Tax can activate the signaling pathway that lead to the release of E2F that in turn induces expression of factors required for cell cycle progression. In this paper, we demonstrate that Tax can also activate E2F-mediated transcription independently of p16(INK4A). Indeed, when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells, which lack expression of p16(INK4A), it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites. This stimulation is abrogated by mutations affecting the E2F-binding sites. In addition, Tax also stimulates the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself. Using Tax mutants that fail to activate either ATF- or NF-kappaB-dependent promoters and different 5' truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter, we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the E2F1 gene involves, at least in part, the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter.",,"['Lemasson, I', 'Thebault, S', 'Sardet, C', 'Devaux, C', 'Mesnard, J M']","['Lemasson I', 'Thebault S', 'Sardet C', 'Devaux C', 'Mesnard JM']","['Laboratoire Infections Retrovirales et Signalisation Cellulaire, CRBM/CNRS UPR1086, Institut de Biologie, 4 Bd Henri IV, 34060 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cadmium Chloride/pharmacology', '*Carrier Proteins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Cyclin E/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.36.23598 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)75028-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Sep 4;273(36):23598-604. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.36.23598.,,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,

Despite the requirement in the pituitary for the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1/GHF-1 for PRL expression, the expression in non-pituitary cells occurs in the absence of Pit-1/GHF-1 and can be repressed by glucocorticoids. This prompted us to investigate the transcription factors in non-pituitary cells which are involved in controlling expression and glucocorticoid repression of a previously characterized negative glucocorticoid response element from the bovine prolactin gene (PRL3 nGRE). Here we have demonstrated that non-pituitary cells (COS-7 and mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells) conferred increased expression via the PRL3 nGRE mainly because of the binding of the ubiquitously expressed POU-homeodomain-containing octamer transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) to an AT-rich sequence present in the PRL3 sequence. However, full transcriptional activity required the binding of a second ubiquitously expressed homeodomain-containing protein, Pbx, previously shown to bind cooperatively with several homeotic selector proteins. The Pbx binding site in the PRL3 nGRE, located just upstream of the Oct-1 binding site, showed a strong sequence similarity with known Pbx binding sites and bound Pbx with an affinity similar to that of other established Pbx target sequences. Interestingly, both Oct-1 and Pbx binding to the PRL3 nGRE were found to be required for glucocorticoid repression. Addition of in vitro translated glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain to the nuclear extract prevented Oct-1 and Pbx from binding to the PRL element. The involvement of the homeobox protein Pbx in glucocorticoid repression via an nGRE identifies a new role for this protein.",,"['Subramaniam, N', 'Cairns, W', 'Okret, S']","['Subramaniam N', 'Cairns W', 'Okret S']","['Department of Medical Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge University Hospital, F60 Novum, S-141 86 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cattle', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Host Cell Factor C1', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1', 'Pituitary Gland/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Prolactin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.36.23567 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)75024-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Sep 4;273(36):23567-74. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.36.23567.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Hcfc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (POU1F1 protein, human)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Pit1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pou2f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",,,,,,,,,,

However, its simple presence within the erythroid lineage is not sufficient to activate the beta-globin promoter. One explanation that may account for this is that post-translational modification of EKLF differs within erythroid cell populations and regulates its activity. We have therefore addressed whether phosphorylation plays a role in modulating EKLF action. First, in vivo analyses implicate serine/threonine kinases as important players in the terminal differentiation of MEL cells, and demonstrate that EKLF is phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues within its transactivation region. Second, directed disruption of a protein kinase casein kinase (CK) II site, located within the EKLF interaction domain, abolishes EKLF transactivation and in vivo competition activity. Third, in vitro assays demonstrate that CKIIalpha interacts with EKLF, and that the EKLF interaction domain is phosphorylated by CKII only at Thr-41; however, the CKII-site mutant is not phosphorylated. Finally, the transactivation capability of EKLF is augmented by co-transfection of CKIIalpha. We conclude that EKLF is a phosphoprotein whose ability to transcriptionally activate an adjacent promoter is critically dependent on the phosphorylation status of a specific site located within the EKLF interaction domain, and that serine/threonine kinases play an important role in this process.",,"['Ouyang, L', 'Chen, X', 'Bieker, J J']","['Ouyang L', 'Chen X', 'Bieker JJ']","['Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Threonine/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.36.23019 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)74954-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Sep 4;273(36):23019-25. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.36.23019.,['DK46865/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise mechanism underlying the cooperative effects of IGF-I is unknown. In a human interleukin-3 or erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent cell line, F-36P, IGF-I alone failed to stimulate DNA synthesis but did augment the EPO-dependent DNA synthesis of F-36P cells. The treatment of F-36P cells with a combination of EPO and IGF-I (EPO/IGF-I) was found to enhance EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, whereas IGF-I alone did not. Furthermore, c-CIS mRNA expression, one of the target molecules of STAT5, was more effectively induced by EPO/IGF-I than by EPO alone. To examine the mechanisms of the EPO- and EPO/IGF-I-induced proliferation of F-36P cells, we expressed dominant negative (dn) mutants of STAT5 and Ras in an inducible system. The EPO-induced DNA synthesis and the cooperative effect of EPO/IGF-I were significantly inhibited by the inducible expression of dn-STAT5 or dn-Ras. In addition, the inducible expression of dn-Ras abolished the IGF-I-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. These results suggest that IGF-I may augment EPO-induced proliferation by enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 and raise the possibility that Ras may be involved in the augmentation of STAT5 tyrosyl phosphorylation.",,"['Okajima, Y', 'Matsumura, I', 'Nishiura, T', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Yoshida, H', 'Ishikawa, J', 'Wakao, H', 'Yoshimura, A', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Tomiyama, Y', 'Matsuzawa, Y']","['Okajima Y', 'Matsumura I', 'Nishiura T', 'Hashimoto K', 'Yoshida H', 'Ishikawa J', 'Wakao H', 'Yoshimura A', 'Kanakura Y', 'Tomiyama Y', 'Matsuzawa Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Osaka University Medical School, 2-2, Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.36.22877 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)74934-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Sep 4;273(36):22877-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.36.22877.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,

The method relied on PCR of IgH, TCRdelta and/or TCRgamma gene rearrangements followed by electrophoretic size resolution and allele-specific oligoprobing. Patients were similarly conditioned; 55 received marrow from unrelated donors and 16 from related donors. MRD was assessed at various time-points up to 24 months after BMT. Three children were not evaluable due to transplant-related mortality. MRD was detected in 28/32 patients (88%) who relapsed post-BMT; 16 were positive at all times and 12 were initially negative but became positive at a median of 3 months (range 1.5-11) prior to relapse. In contrast, only eight of 36 (22%) patients who remained in continuing complete remission (CCR) (median follow-up 43 months, range 20-94) showed MRD at any time after BMT (P<0.0001). In these eight patients MRD was found up to 9 months after transplant and at low levels (0.01-0.001%). All eight (median follow-up 39 months, range 24-87) had at least two MRD-negative samples tested subsequently and five of the eight had evidence of grade I-II acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), raising the possibility of a graft-versus-leukaemia effect.

Propidium iodide staining was used to assess cell cycle status of fresh cells or those stimulated with cytokines. Although the cell cycle status of fresh low-density cells from CML and normal BM was similar, a larger percentage of CML CD34+ cells were cycling than those from normal BM. The HLA-DR compartment of CML CD34+ cells, a fraction enriched for normal, non-leukaemic progenitors, contained a higher percentage of quiescent cells than the CD34+ HLA-DR+ fraction. When the activation of CD34+ cells was examined in response to SCF or IL-3 alone, or SCF+IL-3+IL-6, CML CD34+ cells exited GO/G1 more rapidly than normal CD34+ cells. Interestingly, although normal BM CD34+ cells failed to cycle in response to IL-6 alone, or in the absence of exogenous cytokines, 30% of CML cells cycled under these conditions. No differences in the degree of apoptosis were documented among CML and normal CD34+ cells in these cultures.

Multivariate analysis summarized the prognostic information in terms of four variables: age, gender, leucocytosis and cytogenetic features. Missing data had little influence on the results. However, despite their significance in the multivariate analysis, these four variables each had very low predictive power (1.1% for gender, 2.0% for age, 3.5% for leucocytosis, and 1.6% for cytogenetic features). Thus, the most significant prognostic factors in childhood ALL each explain no more than 4% of the variability in prognosis.

The development of leukaemia in the mice was monitored by taking weekly blood samples and measuring the cell content by flow cytometry. The median time to 50% human cells in the peripheral blood of mice treated with free vincristine was 41 d from the start of treatment compared with 49 d for mice treated with liposomal vincristine (P < 0.01). The median day of death for mice treated with free vincristine was 47 d from the start of treatment and 57 d for mice receiving liposomal vincristine (P<0.01), thus providing a 21% increase in lifespan for animals treated with the liposomal preparation. There was slightly greater weight loss in mice treated with free vincristine than those given liposomal vincristine. Measurement of in vitro colony forming bone marrow progenitor cells in similarly treated, tumour-free mice, showed no difference in progenitor cell survival between mice that received either type of vincristine.

A recurring translocation t(9;14)(p13;q32) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma moves the PAX5 on 9p13 within close proximity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH). KIS-1 cell line was established from a patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma of B-cell type carrying t(9;14). We analysed PAX5/BSAP expression by Northern and Western blotting in a panel of haematological tumour cell lines with other chromosome abnormalities in comparison with that of KIS-1. PAX5 mRNA and BSAP expression were detected in all B-cell lines tested, and the high level in KIS-1 was confirmed. However, a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line and an acute B-lymphoid/myeloid leukaemia cell line expressed the PAX5/BSAP at levels comparable with KIS-1. PAX5 transcripts were readily detectable in clinical materials with a wide variety of B-cell neoplasms by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thus, PAX5/BSAP activation in haematological tumour cells is not necessarily associated with t(9;14). Although binding sites for BSAP have been identified in the promoters of CD19, this study failed to find clear correlation between the level of PAX5/BSAP expression and that of CD19. In contrast to KIS-1 in which the E mu enhancer of IGH was juxtaposed to PAX5, cloning of t(9; 14) from another case by long-distance PCR revealed that the PAX5 promoter was linked to a Cgamma constant region in divergent orientation, suggesting that the mechanism of PAX5 activation through recombination with IGH varies among individual cases. Breakpoints on 9p13 of the two translocations were clustered upstream of PAX5, leaving the PAX5 coding region intact.",,"['Hamada, T', 'Yonetani, N', 'Ueda, C', 'Maesako, Y', 'Akasaka, H', 'Akasaka, T', 'Ohno, H', 'Kawakami, K', 'Amakawa, R', 'Okuma, M']","['Hamada T', 'Yonetani N', 'Ueda C', 'Maesako Y', 'Akasaka H', 'Akasaka T', 'Ohno H', 'Kawakami K', 'Amakawa R', 'Okuma M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00842.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Aug;102(3):691-700. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00842.x.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,

In line with this clinical observation, it was proposed that in the context of bone marrow transplantation, HLA-DP determinants did not function as transplantation antigens in the same way as HLA-A, -B or -DR. In contrast to the above conclusion, we recently demonstrated the presence of HLA-DPB1*0501 specific T cell clones in a skin biopsy of a patient who developed aGVHD after receiving a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in which the only mismatched allele in the GVHD direction was HLA-DPB1*0501. At that time, this case was unique and occurred in a relatively uncommon graft setting where the patient received purified CD34+ BM cells from an unrelated donor. In the present study, we analyzed the immunological events associated with an aGVHD which occurred in the context of a 'regular' allogeneic BMT involving a single HLA-DPB1*1001 mismatch between donor and recipient in the GVHD direction. To this end, we analyzed several amplified T cell subsets present within a T cell line derived from a skin biopsy performed at the onset of GVHD. Our results demonstrated that T cell populations belonging to the TCRBV2, TCRB6.7, TCRBV14 and TCRBV17 subsets were specific for the HLA-DPB1*1001 mismatched allele. These data strengthen and generalize our first conclusion that a single HLA-DP mismatch between donor and recipient can activate a strong T cell response in vivo and consequently challenge the notion that HLA-DP incompatibility should not be taken into account in the choice of BM donors. Moreover, they also underline the idea that HLA-DP antigens may represent an interesting immune target for future therapeutic approaches.",,"['Gaschet, J', 'Gallot, G', 'Ibisch, C', 'Lim, A', 'Even, J', 'Vivien, R', 'Hallet, M M', 'Milpied, N', 'Vie, H']","['Gaschet J', 'Gallot G', 'Ibisch C', 'Lim A', 'Even J', 'Vivien R', 'Hallet MM', 'Milpied N', 'Vie H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 463, Plateau Technique du CHR, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*analysis/immunology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701336 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Aug;22(4):385-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701336.,,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,['Bone Marrow Transplant 1999 Jun;23(12):1327-8'],,,

Additionally, samples derived from patients with CP-CML were injected s.c. into CB17-SCID mice treated with anti-Asialo GM1 (an anti-NK cell antibody) and NOD-SCID mice (absent NK cell activity) to study the potential role of NK cell-mediated anti-leukemic activity in preventing the propagation of CP-CML cells. We observed a significant differential growth pattern of CML cells in the mice such that BP-CML grew rapidly as s.c. tumors and disseminated, while AP-CML or CP-CML cells grew temporarily as small nodules that spontaneously regressed and did not disseminate. This differential growth pattern suggests possible important biological differences. Furthermore, no significant difference in s.c. growth or dissemination of CP-CML samples derived from newly diagnosed patients in untreated CB17-SCID mice and CB-17 SCID mice treated with Anti-Asialo GM1 and NOD-SCID mice occurred, suggesting that factors other than NK cell anti-leukemic activity may be important.",,"['McGuirk, J', 'Yan, Y', 'Childs, B', 'Fernandez, J', 'Barnett, L', 'Jagiello, C', 'Collins, N', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['McGuirk J', 'Yan Y', 'Childs B', 'Fernandez J', 'Barnett L', 'Jagiello C', 'Collins N', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701343 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Aug;22(4):367-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701343.,['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of patient characteristics on risk of gonadal dysfunction were analyzed by comparing the cumulative probability of developing gonadal dysfunction over time from BMT. Ninety-two percent of the males and 99% of the females developed evidence of gonadal dysfunction. Females were not only more likely to develop elevated gonadotrophin levels than males, but did so earlier after BMT. Odds ratios were calculated to determine potentially important prognostic factors for the development of an elevated gonadotrophin level. Older age at BMT was correlated with an increased risk in the development of elevated gonadotrophin levels. Individuals who received radiation were more likely to develop an elevated FSH level over time than those who had received no preparative radiation treatment.

The mean age of patients at the time of BMT was 39 years. Dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis included growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulations with measurements of serum growth hormone (GH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin (PRL) responses. Adrenal function was assessed with the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) test. Five patients (25%) had a subnormal GH response to GHRH stimulation, but all had a normal serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) value. There was an inverse nonlinear relationship between the body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and GH response but no relation between the GH response and total body irradiation (TBI), intrathecal treatment or occurrence of graft-versus-host disease. In females, serum FSH and LH basal levels and responses to GnRH, in spite of oestrogen substitution therapy in 9/10 patients, indicated ovarian failure and early menopause. Most responses to GnRH were delayed. All males had elevated serum basal FSH levels indicating damage in seminiferous tubulus and infertility. Serum basal LH was elevated only in four males but testosterone values were all within normal limits. However, the mean free androgen index (FAI) was in the low normal range, and two subjects had abnormally low FAI. Serum free thyroxine (fT4) levels were normal in all but one, but an exaggerated TSH response to TRH occurred in seven patients (35%). Four of them had received TBI and one total nodal irradiation suggesting radiation-induced damage to the thyroid gland. In 19 of the 20 patients, adrenal function judged with ACTH test was normal. We conclude that functional impairments of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad/thyroid axis are common while disturbances in GH, adrenal and prolactin occur less often in patients after intensive treatment and BMT. Typically, the target organ is more commonly affected than the hypothalamus-pituitary axis.

Superior survival following transplantation with matched unrelated donor grafts.,325-30,"Outcome of allogeneic BMT for childhood ALL performed at a national centre was evaluated for the period between 1985 and 1996. Sixty-seven patients representing all Danish children and adolescents (1-19 years) transplanted for ALL, were evaluated. Patients transplanted with a family donor (n = 51) had a 3-year probability of leukaemia-free survival (P-LFS) of 56% (95% confidence limits 41-69%) and patients receiving marrow from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n = 16) had a 3-year P-LFS of 67% (34-86%) (P = 0.38). Relapse was responsible for 48% of the deaths and occurred with increasing frequency among children transplanted with marrow from HLA-identical siblings. Patients transplanted with family donors from 1985-1989 had P-LFS of 72% (54-84%) compared to patients transplanted after 1990 who revealed a significantly reduced P-LFS of 28% (10-49%, P = 0.01). Furthermore, the risk of relapse was increased (65% (24-88%)) (P = 0.02) in the later period. In contrast, patients transplanted with marrow from a MUD (1990-1996) had a lower risk of relapse (11%, 5-20%) (P = 0.002) but a comparable risk of transplant-related mortality. Children who experience relapse after modern, intensive treatment for ALL may have an increased propensity for relapse even after BMT.

However, GC resistance often is seen in cells with demonstrable GRs; one such line is CEM-C1. We have tested the hypothesis that positive interactions between GC and cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulate GC actions in CEM clones. Treatment of both GC-resistant CEM-C1 [resistant to 1 microM dexamethasone (Dex)] and the sensitive sister clone, CEM-C7 (approximately 65% cell death with 20 nM Dex, approximately 99% death with 1 microM Dex), with a < or = 20 microM concentration of the protein kinase A activator, forskolin, had no significant effect on cell viability. Cotreatment with Dex and forskolin resulted in a strong synergistic death response, with only approximately 10% CEM-C1 cells surviving treatment with 1 microM Dex and 20 microM forskolin. This death was blocked by the GR antagonist RU 38486. However, the extent of apoptosis did not correlate with the amount of GR protein or binding activity in either C7 or C1 cells. As reported previously, Dex-evoked cell death was associated with suppression of c-Myc in C7 cells. In CEM-C1 cells, Dex alone did not affect c-Myc; however, Dex plus forskolin suppressed c-Myc levels. To evaluate mechanisms of Dex-forskolin synergism, fresh subclones of CEM-C7 (clone 14) and CEM-C1 (clone 15) were isolated, to ensure purity of phenotype. In these, forskolin (with or without Dex) caused a similar increase in cAMP (approximately 300-fold) and phospho-cAMP-responsive element binding protein (approximately 4-5-fold) levels, whereas total cAMP-responsive element binding protein expression was not affected. GR transcription function, as tested from a GR-responsive 330-bp mouse mammary tumor virus promoter-luciferase reporter construct, was induced 8- and 4-fold by 1 microM Dex treatment of CEM-C7-14 and CEM-C1-15 cells, respectively. Forskolin (10 microM) significantly potentiated Dex response in CEM-C1-15 cells (13.5-fold) but had only a modest effect (1.5-fold) in CEM-C7-14 cells. These studies suggest that sensitization of CEM-C1 cells by cross-talk between GR and protein kinase A pathways may occur via cooperative effects on GR-mediated gene transcription.",,"['Medh, R D', 'Saeed, M F', 'Johnson, B H', 'Thompson, E B']","['Medh RD', 'Saeed MF', 'Johnson BH', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, 77555-0645, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/08/29 00:00,1998/08/29 00:01,['1998/08/29 00:00'],"['1998/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Aug 15;58(16):3684-93.,"['R01 CA041407-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2RO1 CA41407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,

This is consistent with a threshold or non-linear dose-response at low-doses. Thresholds were added to the dose-response models and the range of possible thresholds is shown for both solid tumor cancers as well as the different leukemia types. This analysis suggests that the A-bomb cancer incidence data agree more with a threshold or non-linear dose-response model than a purely linear model although the linear model is statistically equivalent.

Despite of this success there is a subset of patients with high-risk features at diagnosis who are predisposed to a very high risk of relapse. Relapse of AML and early bone marrow relapse of ALL can not be cured by conventional chemotherapy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is therapeutic option in these children with very high-risk acute leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between XI/1989-XII/1996 33 children with acute leukemia (ALL: 22, AML: 11) underwent an allogeneic HSCT from HLA identical related donors (HLA-identical sibling: 30, twin: 1, other HLA-identical relative: 2) at the 2nd Dept. of Pediatrics, University Hospital Motol. Median age of our group was 9 years (1.5-19 y.), boys (n = 23) clearly dominated over the girls (n = 10). The resource of stem cells was bone marrow in 31 children, bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) and PBPC in one child respectively. Myeloablative conditioning regimen varied, consisting of total body irradiation and chemotherapy in 21 children and chemotherapy in 12 children. HSCT was performed in first complete remission of acute leukemia in 9 children (AML: 7, ALL: 2), in second remission in 14 children (AML: 2, ALL: 12), in third remission in 4 children (ALL: 4). Six children underwent HSCT in first partial remission (n = 1) and in second (n = 4) or third (n = 1) chemoresistant relapse. Seven (21%) children died due to post-transplant complications. Nine (28%) children suffered from clinically significant acute graft-versus-host reaction (GVH) and 15% (4/27) children who survived 100 days post-transplant suffered from chronic GVH disease. Relapse of leukemia was diagnosed in 39% (12/31) children. Fourteen (42%) children are alive and well in continuous remission with median follow-up 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic HSCT can cure children with very high-risk acute leukemia in the situations where conventional chemotherapy fails. Relapse of leukemia and GVH reaction are most important causes of post-transplant morbidity and mortality.",,"['Stary, J', 'Kobylka, P', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Komrska, V', 'Vavra, V', 'Syruckova, Z', 'Smisek, P', 'Hruba, A', 'Korinkova, P', 'Matejkova, E', 'Cukrova, V', 'Dolezalova, L', 'Loudova, M', 'Sejkorova, J', 'Kvech, J']","['Stary J', 'Kobylka P', 'Sedlacek P', 'Komrska V', 'Vavra V', 'Syruckova Z', 'Smisek P', 'Hruba A', 'Korinkova P', 'Matejkova E', 'Cukrova V', 'Dolezalova L', 'Loudova M', 'Sejkorova J', 'Kvech J']","['II. detska klinika 2.

The distinctive periportal distribution of transduced cells led us to investigate the ability of virus-sized particles to perfuse the liver adequately after growth factor treatment. We found that perfusion was adequate, and that transduction was limited to the periportal region because only those cells were stimulated to divide. Cells in this region also showed increased expression of Ram-1, the receptor for the murine Moloney leukemia virus (MoMLV) amphotropic envelope, after KGF treatment. In further studies we found that recombinant hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces a different population of hepatocytes to divide and upregulate Ram-1. The differential pattern of induction suggested that combining KGF and HGF would improve gene transfer efficiency further. Indeed, simultaneous delivery of both growth factors leads to an overall increase in the number of proliferating cells. Importantly, when coupled with MoMLV delivery, efficiency of gene transfer increased.

Protein kinase C activation after short exposure to 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased the intracellular cAMP level up to 3- to 5-fold after 30 min. Such enhancement was almost completely blocked by the selective protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (GF 109203X). In addition, PMA, but not 4-alpha-PMA, synergistically elevated cAMP levels when adenylyl cyclase was activated directly by forskolin or indirectly by G protein activation after cholera toxin treatment or guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) treatment in digitonin-permeabilized cells. The results indicate that protein kinase C directly increases adenylyl cyclase activity and synergistically enhances it, when it is simultaneously activated otherwise. On the other hand, a 10-min treatment with PMA cut the cAMP accumulation induced by histamine, prostaglandin E2, or isoproterenol by 50-70%. However, the binding affinity and total binding of [3H]histamine to membrane receptors was not effected by PMA, suggesting that the site of protein kinase C's action is not at the receptor level. Western blot analysis of protein kinase C isozymes revealed that PMA (100 nM) caused translocation of cytosolic protein kinase C such as alpha, beta and epsilon to the particulate/membrane fraction. Treatment with a lower concentration of PMA (10 nM) translocated the protein kinase C-epsilon within 2 min, while it had little effect on the translocation of protein kinase C-alpha and -beta up to 20 min. However, simultaneous treatment with 10 nM PMA plus histamine for 5 min significantly inhibited the histamine-mediated cAMP generation, indicating that the protein kinase C-epsilon could be involved in the inhibition of receptor-mediated cAMP generation. Taken together, we conclude that PMA, through the activation of protein kinase C, has two opposite effects on the cAMP signaling cascade in HL-60 cells: a direct activation of adenylyl cyclase and an inhibition of receptor-mediated signal transduction.",,"['Byung-Chang, S', 'Se-Young, C', 'Jang-Soo, C', 'Kyong-Tai, K']","['Byung-Chang S', 'Se-Young C', 'Jang-Soo C', 'Kyong-Tai K']","['Department of Life Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histamine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Histamine/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1998/08/28 00:00,1998/08/28 00:01,['1998/08/28 00:00'],"['1998/08/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(98)00387-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(98)00387-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1998 Jul 17;353(1):105-15. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(98)00387-2.,,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,

A previous study of patients treated in 1980-1987 showed similar leukemia-free survivals with these approaches. We re-examined this issue in more recently treated patients receiving different chemotherapy. Chemotherapy subjects (n = 76) participated in trial ALL-87 of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG). Transplant subjects (n = 214) were reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR).

However, its role in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is still not well defined. NVB is an antimicrotubule agent, but as yet, it is not known whether it induces apoptosis. By flow cytometry using nuclear staining (propidium iodide) and annexin V, we demonstrated that NVB and vincristine (VCR) induced both mitotic arrest and apoptosis in leukemia and lymphoma cells, in a drug exposure time dependent manner. Cell cycle kinetics in 3 different cell lines varied during vinca alkaloid treatment. The annexin V method showed that apoptosis, as opposed to necrosis, was the dominant mode of cell kill of chemosensitive leukemia and lymphoma cells. Phosphatidylserine expression on the cell surface was detectable as a hallmark of apoptosis at earlier drug exposure when compared to conventional flow cytometry with PI staining. By Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that CPP32 or caspase-3, a critical apoptosis inducer, and its active subunits p20 and p11 were upregulated in chemo- and apoptosis-sensitive lymphoma and leukemia cells treated with NVB. Our data contributes to the emerging hypothesis suggesting that widely divergent exogenous stimuli and chemotherapeutic agents can effect apoptosis in cancer cells via different pathways involving the caspases.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has recently been found to inhibit CLL B-cell function in vitro by inducing apoptosis and down-regulating expression of bcl-2. Here, we examined the effect of IL-10 on proliferation, RNA synthesis, immunoglobulin (IgM) secretion and viability of leukemic CD5+ B-cells induced by activation with the phorbol ester PMA, alone or in combination with anti-Ig. IL-10 reduced PMA and PMA/anti-Ig induced proliferation and RNA synthesis by 50-80% and 15-40% respectively. Although proliferation and RNA synthesis induced by PMA/anti-Ig could be enhanced by the addition of IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, the presence of these cytokines failed to abrogate the IL-10-mediated inhibition of leukemic CD5+ B-cell activation. In contrast to the effects on proliferation and RNA synthesis, IL-10 did not inhibit IgM secretion, and had only a minimal effect on the viability of activated cells.

This suggests that the cells are probably committed to the myeloid cell lineage and that CD7 is only transiently expressed in the early differentiation stage.

Two classes of nuclear RA receptors, termed retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors, have been identified. Each receptor class consists of three subtypes. We have used several synthetic retinoids to find which receptor subtypes are involved in the regulation of TM and TF expression in APL cells NB4, monoblastic leukemia cells U937 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Am80, which does not have a binding affinity to RARgamma, Ch55, which does not bind to cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP), and a specific RARalpha agonist Ro40-6055, have shown to upregulate TM and downregulate TF in NB4 and U937 cells similar to all-trans RA (ATRA). A specific RARalpha antagonist Ro41-5253 efficiently suppressed the upregulation of TM by ATRA and Am80 in NB4 cells, U937 cells and HUVECs. In contrast, only when both RARalpha and RARbeta antagonists were preincubated, downregulation of TF by the retinoids was suppressed in NB4 cells. These results indicate the mechanically distinct transactivation and transrepression functions of RARs, the major role of RARalpha in TM upregulation by retinoids in leukemic cells and HUVECs and the cooperative role of RARalpha and RARbeta in TF downregulation by retinoids. This implies that synthetic retinoids will provide a very useful means to control distinct targets, TM and TF genes, at the level of transcription.

Unfortunately, DFO suffers from a number of serious disadvantages, including its high cost, the need for prolonged subcutaneous infusion (12-24 h/day, 5-6 nights/week), and its poor intestinal absorption precluding oral administration. Hence, the development of more effective Fe chelators is necessary. The Fe chelator, pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH), was initially identified as a ligand that showed high activity at mobilizing Fe from cells. More recently, a range of PIH analogues have been examined for their anti-proliferative effect, with several classes of these compounds showing high activity at inhibiting tumor growth in vitro. In fact, some of these hydrazones, particularly those derived from 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde, showed comparable activity to the cytotoxic drugs cis-platin and bleomycin. In this review the role of Fe in cellular proliferation will be examined followed by a description of the most recent studies using the PIH analogues as effective anti-proliferative agents. Further studies in vivo with these Fe chelators are essential to determine their potential as chemotherapeutic agents.",,"['Richardson, D R']",['Richardson DR'],"['Department of Medicine, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Queensland, Australia.

Small concentrations of methionine were effective in restoring the growth rate in a dose-dependent fashion, confirming methionine deficiency as the cytotoxic principle. Cyanocobalamin [c-lactam] prevented utilization of the methyl group of methylfolate, but no evidence of folate deficiency developed in long-term culture. High concentrations of non-methylated folate were unable to reverse the cytotoxicity, excluding a methylfolate 'trap' as the cause. Low concentrations of serine in the medium induced transient biochemical megaloblastosis. Cyanocobalamin [c-lactam] caused this to occur earlier, and persist. In high concentrations of serine, the inhibitor caused only transient changes in deoxyuridine suppression. Homocysteine cannot be remethylated without vitamin B12, and condensation with serine is the only other excretory pathway for this toxic amino acid.

Micromolecular study disclosed quercetin-free, quercetin-glycosylated and proanthocyanidins corresponding to cyanidin monomers, which implies a particular metabolic pathway. Proteins present in L. cuneifolia extracts analyzed by SDS-PAGE presented multiple bands with molecular weights ranging from 14 to 90 kD. These features contribute to the characterization of the native mistletoe. As V. album is being used in cancer treatment due to its immunomodulatory and antitumoral activity, the action of aqueous L. cuneifolia extracts on murine lymphocytes was investigated. Culture of murine spleen cells alone or stimulated with Concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide in presence of L. cuneifolia extracts indicated a certain stimulation of splenocytes alone and an inhibition of splenocytes stimulated with Concanvalin A or lipopolysaccharide. An inhibitory effect was also observed on the proliferation of murine leukemia cells. In addition, aqueous extracts increased nitric oxide production by murine macrophages.

It is known that N-terminal two of these sequences participate in the induction of B cell activation when chimeric proteins in which cytoplasmic domain of CD8-alpha has been replaced with that of BLV gp30 are stimulated by anti-CD8-alpha antibody. In addition to such signal transduction activity, the two tyrosines in the YXXL sequences also appear to involve infection with high viral loads and their maintenance in the sheep experimentally infected with BLV. To analyze detailed biological relevance of these sequences in vitro, we constructed a full-length BLV-infectious molecular clone with two copies of long terminal repeats (LTRs), designated pBLV-IF, and then changed residues Y487, L490, Y498, L501 or Y487 plus Y498 in gp30 cytoplasmic tail to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Introduction of molecular clones of wild-type and mutants into COS-1 cells revealed that all mutated molecular clones synthesized matured envelope proteins and released virus particles into growth medium. Serial passages of transient transfectants with the molecular clones and cell-free inoculation resulted in the reduction of infectivity by mutation of Y498 and Y487 plus Y498. In viral penetration, but not specific virus-cell binding, mutations of Y498 and Y487 plus Y498 substantially reduced the potential. Mutations of Y487, Y498 and Y487 plus Y498 increased syncytium-forming potential with increasing expression of envelope proteins on cell surface. In contrast, mutations of L490 and L501 affected neither infectivity nor syncytium-formation.

In this study, the mechanism responsible for the resistance of cancer cells to fludarabine was examined using the 2-F-Ara-A-resistant sublines JOK-1/F-Ara-A and L1210/F-Ara-A from a human hairy leukemic cell line (JOK-1) and a mouse leukemic cell line (L1210) respectively, which were established by continuous treatment of the parental cell lines with 2-F-AraA. JOK-1/F-Ara-A and L1210/F-Ara-A cells were more than 55 and 29 times more resistant to 2-F-Ara-A than were their parent cell lines, and showed a high cross-resistance to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine but not to doxorubicin or vincristine. These resistant sublines intracellularly accumulated almost the same amount of 2-F-Ara-A as did their parent cell lines. However, the amount of 2-F-Ara-ATP, a cytotoxic metabolite of 2-F-Ara-A, decreased by 2.6% (JOK-1/F-Ara-A C3), 6% (L1210/F-Ara-A C1) and 3.7% (L1210/F-Ara-A C7) relative to the levels in the parent cell lines. Enzymatically, these resistant cells hardly activated deoxycytidine (dCyd) and 2-F-Ara-A. In addition, the abilities to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine were also decreased in the resistant cells in comparison with the parent cells. These findings suggest that the deficiency in activity of dCyd kinase may contribute to the resistance of 2-F-Ara-A.",,"['Bai, L', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Tatsumi, M', 'Kon, K', 'Brautigam, M']","['Bai L', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Tatsumi M', 'Kon K', 'Brautigam M']","['Research Department, Nihon Schering Co.

Many studies show modulation of anthracycline levels and cytotoxicity in MRP-overexpressing cells, but there is limited data on the modulation of etoposide levels and cytotoxicity in MRP-overexpressing or in P-glycoprotein-expressing cells. Etoposide accumulation was 50% reduced in both the CEM/E1000 MRP-overexpressing subline and the CEM/VLB100 P-glycoprotein-expressing subline compared to the parental CEM cells, correlating with similar resistance to etoposide (200-fold) of the two sublines.

For the CEM/E1000 subline, neither SDZ PSC 833 nor verapamil had any effect on etoposide accumulation. However, verapamil caused a 4-fold sensitization to etoposide in this subline, along with an 80% decrease in cellular glutathione (P < 0.05). Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which depletes glutathione, also caused a 2.5-fold sensitization to etoposide with no effect on accumulation in the CEM/E1000 subline. In contrast, SDZ PSC 833 was able to increase daunorubicin accumulation in the CEM/E1000 subline (P < 0.05), but had no effect on daunorubicin cytotoxicity, or cellular glutathione.

It appeared that astemizole (>15 microM), in contrast to norastemizole, showed a dual effect on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i): a rise in intracellular calcium concentration was induced, which originated in the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores, whereas Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels was inhibited. Ca2+ influx was further characterized using Ba2+ influx, whereas processes in the absence of Ca2+ influx were studied using Ni2+ or EGTA. It was concluded that the drugs most likely affect the store-operated Ca2+ channels in RBL cells directly.

We evaluated the relationship between the cytotoxic activity of VCR and the degree of VCR saturation of cellular drug binding sites, using the MOLT-3 ALL cell line. When MOLT-3 cells at a density of 1 x 10(6) or 1 x 10(8) cells/mL of pH-controlled medium were exposed to VCR for 1 hr, its cytotoxic activity on cells at high density was 10-fold less than on cells at low density (inoculum effect). The number of VCR binding sites measured by Scatchard analysis was 9.25 x 10(6)/cell. At high cell density, the saturation of VCR binding sites was one log order less than that at low density. Irrespective of cell density, curves of cell-kill versus the degree of VCR saturation of the cellular binding sites overlapped each other. Minimal cytotoxic activity was observed at 0.3% VCR saturation, and nearly maximal cytotoxic activity occurred at about 25% saturation, with the Ic50 at about 4% saturation. These data show that the VCR-induced cell-kill effect is dependent on the degree of saturation of VCR binding sites rather than on the extracellular VCR concentration. The lesser cell-kill on cells at high density can be explained by the lack of drug molecules to sufficiently saturate cellular binding sites. This phenomenon may be responsible, at least in part, for the poor chemotherapeutic outcome of ALL patients with high leukocyte counts at presentation.",,"['Kobayashi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Holland, J F', 'Ohnuma, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Holland JF', 'Ohnuma T']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1998/08/27 00:00,1998/08/27 00:01,['1998/08/27 00:00'],"['1998/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00615-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00615-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Apr 15;55(8):1229-34. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00615-1.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",,,,,,,,,,

However, peptide i-specific Th clones did not respond to either of the corresponding exogenous or endogenous peptides. One amino acid substitution in M-MuLV env452-469 (Asn to Tyr at position 465: N465Y) and three amino acids in AKV env453-470 (H460S, A466Y and Y468H) endowed both peptides with the reactivity to one of the Th clones, F5-5, almost to the same degree as peptide i. However, the other Th clones responded differently to each of the modified endogenous peptides substituted by one to three amino acids. The cells responsive to the cross-reactive peptides occupied only a minor portion, if any, of the bulk cultured lymph node cells from peptide i-immune mice, and in particular, no significant response to the modified endogenous peptides was observed in repeated experiments. The exchange of at least 3 residues was necessary for the endogenous peptide to acquire sufficient cross-reactivity to two of the three Th clones. However, it was noticeable that a single substitution of alanine by tyrosine at the dominant T-cell receptor (TCR) contact position of the peptide i(e) generated a weak but significant cross-reactivity to one of the three Th clones in this study.

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,1205-11,"BACKGROUND: Both total dose and dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy are postulated to be important variables in the outcome for patients with operable breast cancer. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 8541 examined the effects of adjuvant treatment using conventional-range dose and dose intensity in female patients with stage II (axillary lymph node-positive) breast cancer. METHODS: Within 6 weeks of surgery (radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, or lumpectomy), 1550 patients with unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: high-, moderate-, or low-dose intensity. The patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, with 5-fluorouracil administration repeated on day 8. The high-dose arm had twice the dose intensity and twice the drug dose as the low-dose arm. The moderate-dose arm had two thirds the dose intensity as the high-dose arm but the same total drug dose. Disease-free survival and overall survival were primary end points of the study. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9 years, disease-free survival and overall survival for patients on the moderate- and high-dose arms are superior to the corresponding survival measures for patients on the low-dose arm (two-sided P<.0001 and two-sided P = .004, respectively), with no difference in disease-free or overall survival between the moderate- and the high-dose arms. At 5 years, overall survival (average +/- standard error) is 79% +/- 2% for patients on the high-dose arm, 77% +/- 2% for the patients on the moderate-dose arm, and 72% +/- 2% for patients on the low-dose arm; disease-free survival is 66% +/- 2%, 61% +/- 2%, and 56% +/- 2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Within the conventional dose range for this chemotherapy regimen, a higher dose is associated with better disease-free survival and overall survival.",,"['Budman, D R', 'Berry, D A', 'Cirrincione, C T', 'Henderson, I C', 'Wood, W C', 'Weiss, R B', 'Ferree, C R', 'Muss, H B', 'Green, M R', 'Norton, L', 'Frei, E 3rd']","['Budman DR', 'Berry DA', 'Cirrincione CT', 'Henderson IC', 'Wood WC', 'Weiss RB', 'Ferree CR', 'Muss HB', 'Green MR', 'Norton L', 'Frei E 3rd']","['Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital-New York University School of Medicine, Manhasset 11030, USA. budman@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/08/27 02:03,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/08/27 02:03'],"['1998/08/27 02:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/08/27 02:03 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.16.1205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Aug 19;90(16):1205-11. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.16.1205.,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Feb 3;91(3):286-7.

Recurrent motifs have been recognized behind the great heterogeneity of genes involved in chromosomal translocations occurring in childhood ALL. The expression or activation of specific genes encoding for transcription factors have been recognized to be the most frequent recurring mechanism. In addition to the identification of genes involved in translocations, the analysis of deleted or mutated genes has provided new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of childhood ALL. The understanding of the genetic heterogeneity has turned out to have great impact on routine diagnosis and treatment. Molecular analysis has revealed that the t(12;21) translocation, barely detectable when searched for by conventional cytogenetic techniques, is the most frequent genetic lesion occurring in childhood ALL. Accumulating evidence clearly indicates that molecular characterisation at diagnosis represents the most relevant prognostic information for risk stratification of the patients at diagnosis. Several target genes are now available for the study of minimal residual disease and to evaluate its potential impact for tailoring treatment.

DESIGN AND METHODS: AML patients in first complete remission (CR) after doxorubicin-cytarabine-thioguanine (DoxAT) chemotherapy were scheduled to receive two identical early consolidation courses followed by HIDAC (1 g/m2/bd for 6 days), if aged > 50 years, or HiDAC plus total body irradiation (TBI) plus ABMT if aged < 50 years, the bone marrow being harvested prior to the HiDAC/TBI regimen and unpurged. Results were examined by treatment intention and in actual treatment groups, by selected pretreatment and therapy-related variables, and compared with age and disease matched historical patients treated with DoxAT consolidation without additional HIDAC or ABMT. RESULTS: One-hundred and eight (70%) of 153 patients achieved a response and were evaluable after a follow-up of 3.3-8.8 years. According to treatment intention, long-term relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly improved in both age groups compared with controls (< 50 years: 41% vs 15%, p < 0.05; > 50 years: 33% vs 22%, p < 0.005). Actually, 41 patients proceeded to ABMT and 24 to the HIDAC cycle (including 5 aged < 50 years), 23 had early consolidation only (1: refusal; 1: inadequate marrow harvest; 21: complications), 10 relapsed and 2 died very early into remission, 7 were submitted to an allogeneic BMT, and one denied any post-remission therapy. The long-term RFS rates for ABMT and HIDAC groups were 53% and 54% (47% for 19 patients aged > 50), respectively, significantly better than for historical patients or those unable to go beyond early consolidation (p < 0.005, adjusted for early adverse events). Overall 5-year survival rate was 40% (p < 0.0001), 54% for CR patients, 60% after ABMT, and 65% after HIDAC. Relative to the ABMT and HIDAC intensive treatment groups, only the presence of hepatosplenomegaly at diagnosis was associated with a significantly worse outcome like that of the control study. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This age-adapted double post-remission consolidation strategy with ABMT (allo-BMT) or HIDAC was applicable to only about two thirds of responders and was effective in about half these cases, regardless of patient age or specific treatment modality. While the loss of CR patients from treatment realization was unrelated to the study design and depended mainly on recurrence of AML and toxic complication, the exact place of ABMT vs HIDAC consolidation remains unsettled, calling for a new study in comparable patient and risk groups.",,"['Bassan, R', 'Raimondi, R', 'Lerede, T', ""D'emilio, A"", 'Buelli, M', 'Borleri, G', 'Personeni, A', 'Bellavita, P', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Raimondi R', 'Lerede T', ""D'emilio A"", 'Buelli M', 'Borleri G', 'Personeni A', 'Bellavita P', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/08/27 00:00,1998/08/27 00:01,['1998/08/27 00:00'],"['1998/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Jul;83(7):627-35.,,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,,,,,,

We try to assess: 1) whether CE could be a practical, non-isotopic method for direct detection of the presence of amplified bcr-abl obtained by a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (qualitative analysis) and 2) whether it is possible to quantify PCR products using a competitive RT-PCR measuring peak areas of CE electropherograms (quantitative analysis). DESIGN AND METHODS: The two types of bcr-abl chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) associated transcript products were generated by RT-PCR (qualitative analysis) from 1 microgram of total RNA extracted from bone marrow samples of 34 CML patients at diagnosis (median age 47.5; range 18-65; median Sokal's score 0.9; range 0.53-2.78). The PCR products were analyzed by SLAB-gel electrophoresis (SGE) on 2% agarose gels and by CE (128 runs; median 3.3 times for each sample). Furthermore, we assessed the amount of PCR product (quantitative analysis) by a competitive RT-PCR approach and by CE (bcr-abl transcripts were expressed as transcript per microgram of total RNA examined). RESULTS: CE separation of PCR products obtained by qualitative RT-PCR showed baseline resolution for the two peaks corresponding to the two types of bcr-abl junctions: the b2-a2 type (343 base pairs, 10 patients) was revealed at 9.33 min [standard deviation (SD) = 0.1] and the b3-a2 type (418 base pair, 24 patients) at 10.03 min (SD = 0.25). By quantitative analysis we found that there is great interpatient variability in bcr-abl expression at diagnosis: the median value of the amount of bcr-abl transcript was 78,000 bcr-abl transcript/microgram total RNA ranging from 17,300 to 750,000. The amount of bcr-abl transcript at diagnosis was related to the number of blast cells (mean value 128,859 vs. 331,722 in patients with 0% blast cells and > 1% blast cells, respectively; p = 0.004) and Sokal's score (mean value 156,865 vs. 408,800 in patients with Sokal's score < 0.8 and > 1.2, respectively; p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that CE analysis offers greater resolution and enhanced sensitivity for detection and quantification of bcr-abl PCR product in the study of this leukemia. Qualitative analysis by CE of bcr-abl product provides a rapid technique (less than 20 min) for the analysis of subnanogram amounts of DNA fragments. CE run times are short, the capillary can be re-used and full automation may be feasible with data acquisition by a computer-controlled step. Competitive/quantitative analysis of bcr-abl as analyzed by CE allowed fewer reactions and more precise quantification.",,"['Martinelli, G', 'Testoni, N', 'Montefusco, V', 'Amabile, M', 'Saglio, G', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Terragna, C', 'Bonifazzi, F', 'de Vivo, A', 'Pane, F', 'Rosti, G', 'Tura, S']","['Martinelli G', 'Testoni N', 'Montefusco V', 'Amabile M', 'Saglio G', 'Ottaviani E', 'Terragna C', 'Bonifazzi F', 'de Vivo A', 'Pane F', 'Rosti G', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Haematology & Medical Oncology, Seragnoli University of Bologna, Italy. seragnol@kaiser.alma.unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/08/27 00:00,1998/08/27 00:01,['1998/08/27 00:00'],"['1998/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Jul;83(7):593-601.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,

European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer--Childhood Leukemia Cooperative Group.,591-8,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The implications of the detection of residual disease after treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are unclear. We conducted a prospective study at 11 centers to determine the predictive value of the presence or absence of detectable residual disease at several points in time during the first six months after complete remission of childhood ALL had been induced. Junctional sequences of T-cell-receptor or immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were used as clonal markers of leukemic cells. Residual disease was quantitated with a competitive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Of 246 patients enrolled at diagnosis and treated with a uniform chemotherapy protocol, 178 were monitored for residual disease with one clone-specific probe (in 74 percent) or more than one probe (in 26 percent). The median follow-up period was 38 months. RESULTS: The presence or absence and level of residual leukemia were significantly correlated with the risk of early relapse at each of the times studied (P<0.001). PCR measurements identified patients at high risk for relapse after the completion of induction therapy (those with > or =10(-2) residual blasts) or at later time points (those with > or =10(-3) residual blasts). Multivariate analysis showed that as compared with immunophenotype, age, risk group (standard or very high risk), and white-cell count at diagnosis, the presence or absence and level of residual disease were the most powerful independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Residual leukemia after induction of a remission is a powerful prognostic factor in childhood ALL. Detection of residual disease by PCR should be used to identify patients at risk for relapse and should be taken into account in considering alternative treatment.",,"['Cave, H', 'van der Werff ten Bosch, J', 'Suciu, S', 'Guidal, C', 'Waterkeyn, C', 'Otten, J', 'Bakkus, M', 'Thielemans, K', 'Grandchamp, B', 'Vilmer, E']","['Cave H', 'van der Werff ten Bosch J', 'Suciu S', 'Guidal C', 'Waterkeyn C', 'Otten J', 'Bakkus M', 'Thielemans K', 'Grandchamp B', 'Vilmer E']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie Genetique, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'Remission Induction']",1998/08/27 00:00,1998/08/27 00:01,['1998/08/27 00:00'],"['1998/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199808273390904 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Aug 27;339(9):591-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199808273390904.,"['5U10-CA11488-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,"['N Engl J Med. 1998 Aug 27;339(9):627-9.

Subsequently, cytosine arabinoside was found to have activity in acute leukaemia, but, until recently, other significant developments have involved optimizing the efficacy of existing antimetabolites, including the use of leucovorin with methotrexate or 5-FU. Recently, new antimetabolites have become a fertile area for anti-cancer drug research. Gemcitabine (GEMZAR) has emerged as an important new agent in several tumour types, including pancreatic, non-small-cell lung, bladder, breast and ovarian cancers. Capecitabine is an intriguing new prodrug, offering tumour selectivity and prolonged tumour exposure to 5-FU. More potent thymidylate synthase inhibitors have also emerged; raltitrexed is now commercially available for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Patients were divided into three groups based on the level of RB protein expression (i.e., no or low, elevated, and maxphos) or into two groups on the basis of presumed RB function, altered function (AF-RB, low and maxphos RB), versus normal function (NF-RB, elevated RB). By combined results of Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis, 20%, 65%, and 15% of patients had low, elevated, and maxphos RB, respectively. Most patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with a French-American-British classification of M3 were in the low RB group, likely reflecting a lower proliferative rate of promyelocytes. Analysis was performed with and without these APL patients. The median survival was significantly shorter for both patients with low RB expression (48 weeks, P = 0.05, including APL patients; 34 weeks, corrected P = 0.008, with APL patients excluded) and maxphos RB expression (51 weeks, P = 0.007) compared to those with elevated RB expression (122 weeks including and 98 weeks excluding APL patients). Differences were greatest among patients with nonfavorable prognosis cytogenetics (median survival, 34 weeks versus 85 weeks; corrected P = 0.001 for AF-RB versus NF-RB). Remission duration was also significantly shorter for non-APL patients with AF-RB versus NF-RB (median survival, 36 weeks versus not reached; corrected P = 0.02). In multivariate analyses, including cytogenetics, performance status, age, antecedent hematological disorder, and RB status, with and without APL patients included, no/low and maxphos-RB protein expression were independent predictors for poorer survival. This prospective study confirms that the level of expression of RB is a strong prognostic factor in AML, with an inferior survival experience being associated with no/low RB and maxphos RB expression. Therefore, therapeutic decisions based on the level of RB expression may be indicated, and protocols to incorporate this are currently under development.",,"['Kornblau, S M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Hu, S X', 'Xu, H J', 'Patel, S', 'Theriault, A', 'Koller, C', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Estey, E', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Benedict, W F']","['Kornblau SM', 'Andreeff M', 'Hu SX', 'Xu HJ', 'Patel S', 'Theriault A', 'Koller C', 'Kantarjian H', 'Estey E', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Benedict WF']","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030-4095, USA. skornblau@mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Aug;4(8):1955-63.,['P01 55164-04/PHS HHS/United States'],['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)'],,,,,,,,,,

Because many cytotoxic drugs cause cell death by inducing apoptosis, an imbalance of apoptosis regulatory proteins may contribute to MM treatment resistance. We have previously shown reduced expression of Bcl-2 protein, a negative regulator of apoptosis, in MM as compared with benign nevi. It is hypothesized that other apoptosis regulators may be involved in survival of MM cells. We examined the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-X, and Mcl-1 in human benign nevi, primary MM, and metastatic MM using immunohistochemistry. Results were confirmed with Western blotting. The proapoptotic protein, Bax, was surprisingly overexpressed in all MM samples compared with benign nevi. Interestingly, in most MM samples there was overexpression of Mcl-1 or Bcl-XL, both negative regulators of apoptosis. Increased expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL was first observed in thin primary melanomas, suggesting that up-regulation of these proteins represents a relatively early event associated with malignant transformation in MM. As published previously, the majority of primary and metastatic MM exhibited reduced Bcl-2 levels.

Serum samples were obtained three times a week during 208 neutropenic episodes following cytotoxic chemotherapy. Fever of any cause developed during 104 out of 191 evaluable episodes. Serum levels of neither cytokine nor CRP were predictive of fever within more than 24 h before its onset. Unlike CRP, both IL-6 and IL-8 serum levels were significantly different between microbiologically documented infections and unexplained fevers. The highest values of IL-6 and IL-8 were observed in episodes of gram-negative bacteremia. Using receiver-operating-characteristic curves, the analysis of cytokine levels measured around the onset of fever indicated that IL-8 is potentially useful for predicting gram-negative bacteremia, with a high negative predictive value of > 90% and a moderate positive predictive value of 50% (sensitivity, 70%; specificity, 91%). In patients with persistent fever, predictions of further clinical complications, defined as prolonged fever of more than 7 days' duration, pneumonia, shock and/or death due to infection, were best predicted by IL-6. With an IL-6 cutoff value of 250 pg/ml in samples obtained 8 to 32 h after onset of fever, the positive predictive value was 92%, the negative predictive value 91% (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 95%). The positive predictive value of IL-6 in samples obtained another 24 h later from patients still febrile remained > 90%, but the negative predictive value dropped to 47%.

Clinically, they are relatively characteristic but often unsuspected. Histologically, MCC are often misdiagnosed as lymphoma, melanoma, or metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL). METHODS: We present clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical data on six eyelid cases (all females; age 63-102 years; one with concomitant CLL) from our files of 77 MCC with special respect to differential diagnosis. For comparison, 22 SCCL were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry was done with antibodies against pan-cytokeratin (pan-CK), cytokeratin-20 (CK-20), neurofilament protein (NF), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin (CHR), and S100 protein (S100). RESULTS: Morphologically, five of six MCC were prototypic, one was of the small cell variant. Immunohistochemically, dot-like positivities for pan-CK and CK-20 were seen in all six MCC, and for NF in five tumors. None of the 22 SCCL stained positively for CK-20 or NF but 21/22 cases were positive for pan-CK. Only 1/21 SCCL showed dot-like patterns for pan-CK; 20/21 reacted diffusely. All MCC and 13/22 SCCL displayed CHR-positive cells. All MCC and all SCCL were positive for NSE and negative for S100. CONCLUSIONS: Dot-like positivities for CK-20 or NF are important to prove MCC and to exclude SCCL in clinically and morphologically doubtful cases. Dot-like positivities for pan-CK favor MCC, but do not always exclude SCCL. NSE and CHR are of no value for the differential diagnosis of MCC and SCCL.

The differences in behavior of phenols, which run the gamut from aberrations in DNA/chromosomes to suppression of genotoxic activity of carcinogenic compounds, merit further attention. In this study, a through examination of the growth inhibition patterns of 37, simple 3- and 4-substituted phenols in mouse leukemia cells was carried out and the following quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was obtained for the 23 electron releasing substituents in X-phenols: log 1/IC50 = -1.58 sigma(+) +0.21 log P + 3.10. In this QSAR, IC50 is the concentration of phenol that induces 50% inhibition of growth. P is a measure of the hydrophobicity of each phenol and Brown's electronic parameter, sigma+, represents the electronic effect of the substituent. The negative dependence on sigma+ is strongly reminiscent of what is observed in the developmental toxicity of phenols on rat embryos as well as for the radical abstraction of a hydrogen atom from phenolic groups. The other 15 electron-attracting substituted X-phenols clearly show a linear dependence on hydrophobicity alone: Log 1/IC50 = 0.62 log P + 2.35. The bifurcation in mechanism of action of this large set of diverse phenols is novel and unusual. It suggests that two distinct processes are operative. In the case of electron releasing substituted phenols, the observations are not inconsistent with a radical mediated process while with electron attracting substituted phenols, non-specific toxicity as modulated by hydrophobicity, appears to predominate.",,"['Selassie, C D', 'DeSoyza, T V', 'Rosario, M', 'Gao, H', 'Hansch, C']","['Selassie CD', 'DeSoyza TV', 'Rosario M', 'Gao H', 'Hansch C']","['Chemistry Department, Pomona College, Claremont, CA 91711, USA. cselassie@pomona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Free Radicals', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenols/*toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279798000271 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(98)00027-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1998 Jun 5;113(3):175-90. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(98)00027-1.,['1 RO1 ES 07595-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Phenols)']",,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated its effects on cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and explored the mechanism whereby it exerted these effects. In vitro treatment of human PBL with IO4 augmented their cytotoxicity against K562 myelogenous leukemia cells. IO4 oxidative treatment increased the frequency of effector-to-target cell binding. It also increased cellular ATP levels in effector cells, suggesting that the post-binding cytolytic functions of these cells were also enhanced after treatment with IO4. Moreover, IO4 treatment significantly increased the protein kinase C (PKC) activity of effector cells and induced the translocation of activity in the membrane fraction from the cytosol. H-7, a potent PKC inhibitor, significantly reduced this enhancement of membrane-associated PKC activity at 10 microM and significantly reduced the enhanced cytotoxicity of PBL at the same concentration.

Between February 1994 and March 1997, 44 patients were enrolled in three sequential protocols. Although the duration of neutropenia after only cyclophosphamide mobilization was shorter, clinical morbidity for the intermediate and intensive priming protocols was similar. Cytogenetic responses in mobilized PB progenitors were similar after mobilization with either intermediate or intensive chemotherapy. The degree of Ph negativity in the mobilized product correlated with disease stage at the time of mobilization (early chronic phase [ECP] > late CP > accelerated phase). Cytogenetic responses after transplantation with mobilized progenitors obtained after the different regimens were similar. The cytogenetic status of the graft predicted the cytogenetic status of marrow obtained 3 weeks after transplantation whereas cytogenetic responses 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation correlated with the number of BCR/ABL-negative CD34(+)HLA-DR- cells, but not the number of Ph-negative metaphases in the graft. In patients with ECP CML, mobilized PB collections yielded significantly more CD34(+)HLA-DR- cells than from steady state or mobilized BM. CD34(+)HLA-DR- cells were Ph negative and polyclonal (X-chromosome inactivation) in the majority of ECP CML patients, before and after mobilization and irrespective of the mobilization regimen.

On the basis of this defect, anemic cancer patients, both adults and children, have been treated with recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO). To further elucidate the pathophysiology of anemia in children with cancer, we measured serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), a quantitative marker of erythropoiesis, and serum EPO at time of diagnosis and during chemotherapy in children suffering from solid tumor or leukemia. We determined serum EPO in 111 children (55 leukemia, 56 solid tumors) at time of diagnosis. In the last 44 patients (23 leukemia and 21 solid tumors), sTfR levels were also measured. Serum EPO together with sTfR levels were also determined in 60 children receiving chemotherapy (29 leukemia, 31 solid tumors). These results were compared with those obtained from appropriate control groups. In all patients, we found a highly significant correlation between the logarithm of EPO (log[EPO]) and the hemoglobin (Hb) level. In all subsets of patients, sTfR levels were inappropriately low for the degree of anemia. Neither leukemic nor solid tumor groups showed a significant inverse relationship between log(sTfR) and the Hb level as would be expected in anemic patients with appropriate marrow response. Thus, in children with cancer, anemia is associated with a decreased total bone marrow erythropoietic activity which, in contrast to what has been reported in anemic cancer adults, is not related to defective EPO production.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Corazza, F', 'Beguin, Y', 'Bergmann, P', 'Andre, M', 'Ferster, A', 'Devalck, C', 'Fondu, P', 'Buyse, M', 'Sariban, E']","['Corazza F', 'Beguin Y', 'Bergmann P', 'Andre M', 'Ferster A', 'Devalck C', 'Fondu P', 'Buyse M', 'Sariban E']","['Laboratory of Hematology and of Clinical Chemistry, Brugmann University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/blood/*etiology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/blood']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74135-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 1;92(5):1793-8.,,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,

We report here that bcl-2 is phosphorylated on serine in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) blasts exposed to all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Two-dimension gels (isoelectric focusing followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [SDS-PAGE]) disclosed a novel acidic isoform of bcl-2 in ATRA-treated blast cells from a continuous line and from two AML patients; when the cell lysates were digested with lambda-phosphatase, bcl-2 reverted to the control position, indicating that it was phosphorylated. Metabolic labeling experiments using 32Pi showed that, while control bcl-2 was labeled, incorporation was greatly increased when cells were treated with ATRA. A comparison of bcl-2 from blasts treated with ATRA or taxol showed that bcl-2 was phosphorylated on serine in cells treated with either agent; however, both qualitative and quantitative differences were seen. Qualitatively, the phosphorylated isoform from taxol-treated cells was slightly larger than the native isoform and could be distinguished on 10% to 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, while the phosphorylated bcl-2 after ATRA ran as a single band on gradient gels at the same position as control bcl-2. Quantitatively, all bcl-2 from ATRA-treated cells was in the phosphorylated isoform, while after taxol, both phosphorylated and native bcl-2 was present; incorporation of 32Pi into bcl-2 was stimulated to greater extent in ATRA-treated compared with taxol-treated cells. We used immunoprecipitation experiments to ask if bcl-2 phosphorylated after ATRA or taxol had altered capacity to dimerize with bax. No change in dimerization was demonstrated. We conclude that: bcl-2 is phosphorylated on serine after treatment of AML blasts with ATRA; bcl-2 phosphorylation after ATRA is different from that seen after taxol; bcl-2 phosphorylated after either agent retains capacity to dimerize with bax.

Clinically, patients respond to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) through complete remissions associated with myeloid maturation of leukemic cells. This clinical ATRA response of APL is linked to PML/RARalpha expression. Unfortunately, these remissions are transient and relapsed APL is often ATRA-resistant. The role PML/RARalpha plays in the growth and maturation of these APL cells with acquired ATRA resistance has not been fully explored. This study uses an ATRA-resistant NB4 cell line (NB4-R1) to investigate the contribution of PML/RARalpha expression to ATRA resistance. Targeting of PML/RARalpha in NB4-R1 cells was undertaken using two approaches: homologous recombination and hammerhead ribozyme-mediated cleavage. Reducing PML/RARalpha protein in NB4-R1 cells rendered these cells more sensitive to ATRA. These cells were growth-inhibited in ATRA, apoptosis was induced, and there was no apparent signaling of differentiation. Sequence analysis identified a mutation in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the RARalpha portion of PML/RARalpha. Results show that these retinoid-resistant NB4 cells require persistent PML/RARalpha expression for leukemic cell growth. Taken together, these findings can account for why these cells do not respond to ATRA and how reduction of PML/RARalpha abrogates the antiapoptotic effect it confers to these leukemic cells.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Allopenna, J', 'Begue, A', 'Stehelin, D', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Martin, P']","['Nason-Burchenal K', 'Allopenna J', 'Begue A', 'Stehelin D', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Martin P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. k-nason-burchenal@ski.mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Catalytic/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74131-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 1;92(5):1758-67.,"['F32 CA61646-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 29502-14A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA62275-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,

To identify the genes involved in this translocation, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to show that the chromosome 8 breakpoints fell within YAC 899e2 and that the chromosome 13 breakpoints are clustered in a region flanked by YACs 929f11 and 911h8. FISH using chromosome 13 PAC clones indicated that the t(8;13) is not simply a reciprocal translocation but also involves an inversion of 13q11-12. Exon trapping of a PAC that spanned the chromosome 13 translocation breakpoints led to the identification of a gene, ZNF198, that detected rearranged bands when used as a probe against Southern blots of patient DNA. Conceptual translation of the full-length ZNF198 cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 1377 amino acids that shows significant homology to the DXS6673E/KIAA0385 and KIAA0425 proteins. Alignment of these three proteins revealed a novel, conserved Zn-finger-related motif (MYM domain) of the general form CX2C19-22CX3CX13-19CX2CX19-25FCX3CX3F/Y that is repeated five times in each protein. To identify the translocation partner gene on chromosome 8, 5' and 3' RACE polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed on patient RNA with several combinations of ZNF198 primers. Clones were identified in which the ZNF198 was fused to exon 9 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), a gene known to map to 8p11. An identical ZNF198-FGFR1 fusion was detected in the three patients with a t(8;13) for whom RNA was available; reciprocal FGFR1-ZNF198 transcripts were not detected. Rearrangements of both ZNF198 and FGFR1 were found in two further patients by Southern blotting. ZNF198-FGFR1 includes the five MYM domains of ZNF198 and the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1.

It has been associated with trisomy of chromosome 11, but was also identified in AML patients with normal karyotypes. The current study was performed to investigate whether MLL duplications are restricted to AML, and hence whether they may also occur in normal hematopoietic cells. MLL-duplication transcripts were analyzed by nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in peripheral blood in two groups of 45 and 20 patients, respectively, as well as in two bone marrow samples from healthy volunteers. Duplications were detected in two independent nested RT-PCR experiments in the peripheral blood samples of 38 of 45 (84%) and 20 of 20 (100%) of the two groups and in both bone marrow samples. On this basis, MLL duplications seem to occur frequently in a subset of cells in normal hematopoiesis. The type of partially duplicated MLL transcripts varied substantially. Three transcripts were identical to those known from AML. In addition, four new transcripts were characterized. Three of these four were in frame and potentially translatable. MLL duplications were also detected by seminested genomic PCR with intron 9- and intron 1-specific primers in 20 of 20 peripheral blood samples studied, indicating that the duplications are genomically fixed at the DNA level and are not an RT-PCR artifact. In summary, MLL duplications are regularly generated by homologous ALU recombination in a small number of hematopoietic cells of most or even all healthy donors.

Furthermore, suppression of LMP-1 was associated with molecular and phenotypic effects that included downregulation of the LMP-1-inducible antiapoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of apoptosis, and enhancement of sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide.

Therefore, we investigated whether in vitro modifications could enhance the T-cell stimulatory properties of AML cells. AML cells were either cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or transfected with the CD80 (B7.1) gene and used as stimulator cells for primed and unprimed allogeneic T cells. Cytokine treatment increased HLA class I and II expression, but did not induce CD80 on AML cells. Cytokine-treated AML cells efficiently presented nominal and allo-antigens to primed T-cell clones, induced strong T-cell proliferation in HLA mismatched mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), but failed to induce primary T-cell responses from an HLA identical bone marrow donor in MLR. In contrast, CD80-transfected AML cells induced T-cell proliferation of HLA-identical bone marrow donor peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) in primary MLR, allowing the generation of leukemia reactive CD4(+) T-cell lines and clones. The majority of the generated oligoclonal (25 of 35) T-cell cultures showed patient specific reactivity that did not discriminate between patient's leukemic cells and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells (EBV-LCL). The remaining 10 oligoclonal T-cell cultures recognized only leukemic cells. One of these latter leukemia reactive oligoclonal T cells was cloned. The majority of the clones (25 of 29) reacted against both leukemic cells and patient's EBV-LCL. A minority of the T-cell clones with the CD4 phenotype (four of 29) showed strong HLA-DP restricted reactivity against leukemic cells, but not against patient's EBV-LCL or against HLA-matched nonleukemic cells, indicating that their target antigens are preferentially expressed by leukemic cells.

However, molecular mechanism of regulation of IFN signaling has not been fully understood. We have reported novel cytokine-inducible SH2 protein (CIS) and JAK binding protein (JAB) family genes that can potentially modulate cytokine signaling. Here we report that JAB is strongly induced by IFN-gamma but not by IFN-beta in mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. NIH-3T3 cells ectopically expressing JAB but not CIS3 lost responsiveness to the antiviral effect of IFN-beta and IFN-gamma. M1 leukemic cells stably expressing JAB were also resistant to IFN-gamma and IFN-beta-induced growth arrest. In both NIH-3T3 and M1 transformants expressing JAB, IFN-gamma did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT1. Moreover, IFN-gamma-induced activation of JAK1 and JAK2 and IFN-beta-induced JAK1 and Tyk2 activation were inhibited in NIH-3T3 JAB transformants. These results suggest that JAB inhibits IFN signaling by blocking JAK activity. We also found that IFN-resistant clones derived from LoVo cells and Daudi cells expressed high levels of JAB without stimulation. In IFN-resistant Daudi cells, IFN-induced STAT1 and JAK phosphorylation was partially reduced.

The Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.,1541-8,"Several prospective randomized studies have shown that the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) prolongs the survival by comparison with conventional chemotherapy. However, although IFN-alpha can induce cytogenetic responses, true complete remissions are rarely achieved and information on the long-term effects of IFN-alpha treatment is limited. For that purpose, we updated and analyzed a prospective comparative trial of IFN-alpha and conventional chemotherapy that was initiated in 1986. The first analysis of the trial was already published, and showed a survival advantage for IFN-alpha (N Engl J Med 12:820, 1994). The observation period of living patients now ranges between 95 and 129 months and we examined the long-term effects of IFN-alpha treatment, always by comparison with conventional chemotherapy and according to the intention-to-treat principle. The patients who were submitted to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in chronic phase (38 of 322 or 12%) were censored at the date of BMT. Seventy-three of the original 284 nontransplanted patients were alive, 56 (30%) in the IFN-alpha arm and 17 (18%) in the chemotherapy arm. Forty-one patients overall (14%) were still receiving IFN-alpha. In the IFN-alpha arm 9 patients were in continuous complete cytogenetic remission and 11 were in major or minor cytogenetic remission. Median and 10-year survival of low-risk patients were 104 months (95% CI, 85 to 127 months) and 47% (95% CI, 36% to 59%) in IFN-alpha arm versus 64 months (95% CI, 49 to 98 months) and 30% (95% CI, 16% to 44%) in chemotherapy arm (P = .03). Median and ten-year survival of non-low-risk patients were 69 months (95% CI, 56 to 76 months) and 16% (95% CI, 8% to 24%) in IFN-alpha arm versus 46 months (95% CI, 39 to 61 months) and 5% (95% CI, 0% to 11%) in chemotherapy arm (P = .006). A low Sokal's risk, hematologic response, and cytogenetic response were associated with a longer survival. No major or unusual side effects were recorded after the 5th year of IFN-alpha treatment. Fourteen patients died in chronic phase, 9 (4%) in IFN-alpha arm and 5 (5%) in chemotherapy arm, mainly of cardiovascular accidents (6 cases) and of other cancers (5 cases). We conclude that a policy of chronic treatment with IFN-alpha maintained a significant survival advantage over conventional chemotherapy on a long-term basis and irrespective of the risk. However, the great majority of the long-term survivors were in the low-risk group.

As2O3 has been proposed to principally target PML and PML-RARalpha proteins in APL cells. We investigated the activity of As2O3 and melarsoprol in a broader context encompassing various myeloid leukemia cell lines, including the APL cell line NB4-306 (a retinoic acid-resistant cell line derived from NB4 that no longer expresses the intact PML-RARalpha fusion protein), HL60, KG-1, and the myelomonocytic cell line U937. To examine the role of PML in mediating arsenical activity, we also tested these agents using murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and bone marrow (BM) progenitors in which the PML gene had been inactivated by homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, we found that both compounds inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis, and downregulated bcl-2 protein in all cell lines tested. Melarsoprol was more potent than As2O3 at equimolar concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L. As2O3 relocalized PML and PML-RARalpha onto nuclear bodies, which was followed by PML degradation in NB4 as well as in HL60 and U937 cell lines. Although melarsoprol was more potent in inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis, it did not affect PML and/or PML-RARalpha nuclear localization.

Several mechanisms have been evaluated and suggested to play roles in the regulation of apoptosis, including the activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), usually measured as release of 3H-labelled arachidonic acid (AA) from prelabelled cells. The current study was aimed at examining the role of PLA2 in regulating apoptosis in response to several inducers (such as vincristine and etoposide) in lymphoid cell lines. Cells were labelled with [3H]fatty acids and the released radioactivity was characterized. These studies indicated that the AA release assay did not reflect release of non-esterified fatty acid via activation of the PLA2 pathway. Rather, studies using TLC and electron microscopy showed that AA release reflected a previously unsuspected shedding of a heterogeneous population of membrane vesicles and fragments, probably as components of apoptotic bodies. Further studies demonstrated that this process is an integral part of apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or the addition of caspase peptide inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethane prevented the characteristic morphological changes of cell death, and completely inhibited the release of membrane vesicles and fragments. On the other hand, release of membrane vesicles and fragments was caused by various inducers of apoptosis, as measured by release of either 3H-labelled AA or palmitic acid. Thus the present study demonstrates that the release of membrane lipids during apoptosis defines a new assay for apoptosis and has allowed the investigation of the mechanisms regulating formation of apoptotic bodies.",,"['Zhang, J', 'Driscoll, T A', 'Hannun, Y A', 'Obeid, L M']","['Zhang J', 'Driscoll TA', 'Hannun YA', 'Obeid LM']","['Veterans Administration Geriatrics Research Foundation and Clinical Center, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Palmitic Acid/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Preleukemia', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3340479 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1998 Sep 1;334 ( Pt 2):479-85. doi: 10.1042/bj3340479.,['GM 43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,PMC1219712,,,,,,

These so-called IL-6-type cytokines play an important role in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as gene activation, proliferation and differentiation. The current knowledge on the signal-transduction mechanisms of these cytokines from the plasma membrane to the nucleus is reviewed. In particular, we focus on the assembly of receptor complexes after ligand binding, the activation of receptor-associated kinases of the Janus family, and the recruitment and phosphorylation of transcription factors of the STAT family, which dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to enhancer elements of respective target genes leading to transcriptional activation. The important players in the signalling pathway, namely the cytokines and the receptor components, the Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2 and Tyk2, the signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT1 and STAT3 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 [SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase] are introduced and their structural/functional properties are discussed. Furthermore, we review various mechanisms involved in the termination of the IL-6-type cytokine signalling, namely the action of tyrosine phosphatases, proteasome, Jak kinase inhibitors SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signalling), protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS), and internalization of the cytokine receptors via gp130. Although all IL-6-type cytokines signal through the gp130/Jak/STAT pathway, the comparison of their physiological properties shows that they elicit not only similar, but also distinct, biological responses.

Here we report that among the Bcl-2 family of proteins tested (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bax, Bad, and Bak), Bcl-XL was unique in that its protein levels were tightly regulated by hemopoietins in both immortal and primary myeloid progenitors. Investigating signaling pathways utilized by cytokine receptors established that the regulation of Bcl-XL protein levels is mediated by the Jak kinase pathway and is independent of other signaling effectors including STATs, PI-3' kinase, and Ras. Moreover, we provide the first direct evidence that Bcl-X is altered in cancer, because bcl-X expression was activated selectively by retroviral insertions in murine myeloid and T-cell hemopoietic malignancies. Tumors harboring bcl-X insertions had altered bcl-X RNAs, expressed elevated levels of Bcl-XL protein, and lacked the requirements for cytokines normally essential for cell survival. Finally, overexpression of Bcl-XL effectively protected IL-3-dependent myeloid cells from apoptosis following removal of trophic factors.

Polyploid cells represent a useful model for examining S- and M-phase control, because their cell cycle machinery must be modulated to retain high levels of DNA content (ploidy) within a single nucleus. To evaluate the mechanisms of S-phase control during the process of polyploidization, we investigated the modulations that occur in cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes during the induction of megakaryocyte differentiation in human erythroleukemia cells. We report that during polyploidization, megakaryocytic human erythroleukemia cells undergo a dramatic modulation in the subunit composition of G1-associated and S phase-associated CDK complexes and a marked increase in their specific activities. This, in turn, is facilitated by a differential loss of the p21 or p27 CDK-inhibitory protein/kinase-inhibitory proteins (CIP/KIP) bound to specific cyclin/CDK complexes. The data show that the loss of S- and M-phase control in polyploid cells occurs within the context of an up-regulated function in those CDK complexes associated with both G1-S-phase transit and S-phase progression. Additional studies regarding the regulation of these complex CDK interactions will be important to understand cell cycle control in such diverse processes as megakaryocyte differentiation or the types of genomic instability that occur in cancer cells.",,"['Datta, N S', 'Williams, J L', 'Long, M W']","['Datta NS', 'Williams JL', 'Long MW']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin A/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin E/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', '*G1 Phase', 'Half-Life', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Phosphorylation', '*Polyploidy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1998 Aug;9(8):639-50.,['HL51459/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,

This appears to be because human cytokines, adhesion molecules and extracellular matrices which support differentiation and growth of human hematopoietic cells differ from those in animals. To improve this animal model, we attempted to produce transgenic (Tg) mice producing human interleukin 3 (hIL-3) and human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) with the homozygote of the scid gene. We established two Tg mouse lines, one releasing both 0.5-1 ng/ml of hIL-3 and 0.05-0.2 ng/ml of hGM-CSF in their sera and another releasing only high (2-10 ng/ml) levels of hGM-CSF. When human cytokine-dependent myeloid cell line, TF-1, was subcutaneously transplanted into these two Tg-SCID mouse lines, TF-1 could be successfully engrafted and grew in all lines of Tg-SCID mice but not in control mice. We also observed that TF-1 grows in GM-CSF Tg-SCID mice in a dose dependent manner in vivo and IL-3 shows an additive effect on its growth.

TF-1a cells formed aggregates which increased markedly in size and in number upon TGFbeta1 treatment and showed a diminished TGFbeta-mediated growth inhibition. TF-1a, but not TF-1 cells, formed colonies in soft agar culture in the absence of any added growth factors, and developed the capacity to generate an invasive tumor(s) in nude mice. There was a constitutive activation of MAPK and MEK in TF-1a but not in TF-1 cells, which may be one of the mechanisms leading to factor-independent growth of TF-1a cells. Phenotypically, TF-1 cells were CD34+ /CD38+, whereas TF-1a cells were CD34+ /CD38-. This suggests that TF-1a may represent a less mature hematopoietic cell than TF-1.

The panel of 92 cell lines analyzed comprised seven B-cell precursor, ten B-cell, six plasma cell, 13 T-cell, four natural killer (NK) cell, 16 myelocytic, 12 monocytic, 13 erythroid-megakaryocytic and 11 Hodgkin-anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) lines. In total 64 (70%) were RT-PCR-positive for HGF and 43 (47%) for c-met. The highest percentages of expression were found for HGF in the plasma cell (100%), NK (100%) and myeloid (75-92%) cell line categories, whereas c-met was found predominantly in plasma cell (100%) and Hodgkin-ALCL (91%) cell lines. The concomitant expression of HGF and c-met in plasma cell lines (100%) and Hodgkin-ALCL (73%) cell lines should be noted. The high HGF expression in myelocytic-monocytic cell lines (75 and 92%) contrasts with the low c-met expression (18 and 8%) in these cell lineages. In 50 cell lines, mRNA expression of these two genes was also examined at the Northern blot level: 12/50 (24%) and 4/48 (8%) were positive for HGF and c-met mRNA expression, respectively. Of note, three of the four c-met + lines belonged to the category Hodgkin-ALCL; the Hodgkin cell line SUP-HD-1 showed both HGF and c-met mRNA bands suggesting the possibility of an autocrine loop. In conclusion, we detected HGF expression in various types of leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, particularly in plasma cell and myeloid malignancies; c-met expression was found in plasma cell and Hodgkin-ALCL cell lines. Further detailed analysis of the role of this ligand-receptor pair in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic neoplasms is indicated; to this end the HGF + and c-met + cell lines described here represent exquisite model systems.",,"['Pons, E', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Pons E', 'Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S014521269800071X [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00071-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Sep;22(9):797-804. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00071-x.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",,,,,,,,,,

In the past few years several groups have reported deletion of the RB1 gene or altered pRB expression in certain hematologic malignancies, suggesting a possible role of RB1 gene inactivation in the process of leukemogenesis. Most studies regarding structural abnormalities of the RB1 gene indicate that gross deletions or rearrangements are present in a small percentage of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as is the case with retinoblastoma, where the majority of RB1 gene abnormalities are attributed to point mutations. To investigate if such point mutations in the RB1 gene may have a role in leukemogenesis in AML, we screened the RB1 gene of 36 AML patients using conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE). No point mutations were found in the 27 exons, their flanking intron regions or in the promoter region in any of the 36 patients. Thus, according to our findings, the susceptibility in these patients for developing AML does not appear to be related to point mutations in the RB1 gene.

At a median follow-up of 73 months, the median survival was 71 months in the IFN-alpha group and 55 months in the busulfan group (P=0.0563), and the median time of remaining in chronic phase was 58 months in the IFN-alpha group and 39 months in the busulfan group (P=0.4676). Landmark analysis showed a significant advantage in survival (P=0.009) and duration of chronic phase (P=0.0001) in patients with any cytogenetic response among the IFN-alpha group. About half patients were discontinued IFN-alpha administration in spite of cytogenetic response in this study. It appears that continuation of IFN-alpha might possibly confer a survival advantage. Pretreatment factors associated with cytogenetic response included high hemoglobin level, low percentage of peripheral basophils and low leukocyte counts.

To investigate whether bcl-2 plays a role in the increase of myeloblasts in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and their progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we studied bcl-2 expression in initial (pre-therapy) bone marrow biopsies from MDS at early (refractory anemia, RA, with or without ring sideroblasts) and advanced stages (RA with excess blasts, and in transformation). Sequential biopsies were also studied to evaluate the effect of time or disease progression, including evolution to AML, or therapy with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Early myeloid precursors (EMPs), predominantly myeloblasts, were identified in paraffin sections after immunostaining; bcl-2-positive EMPs were enumerated as a percentage of all EMPs (Bcl-2%), and by their absolute frequency per x 900 microscopic field (Bcl-2 index). FINDINGS: in initial biopsies, the Bcl-2% and Bcl-2 index in early MDS (9.9+/-2.6 and 1.4+/-0.6, respectively; mean+/-S.E.) were significantly lower than in advanced MDS (26.4+/-3.6, 4.6+/-1.4), but similar to controls (8.1+/-0.3 and 0.8+/-0.1). The Bcl-2% and Bcl-2 index in three patients with AML evolved from MDS (57.4+/-17.9 and 85.1+/-62.4) were similar to values for seven patients with de novo AML (63.0+/-10.0, 98.4+/-29.8) and significantly higher than values for other groups. Bcl-2% showed relative increments with time or disease progression (range, 21-273%; 11 of 18 sequential biopsies from six of ten MDS patients), which was not clearly altered by G-CSF therapy (four of six patients with, two of four patients without treatment). CONCLUSIONS: bcl-2 expression by EMPs (in both proportion and absolute number) correlated with initial MDS stage, progressed over time independent of G-CSF therapy, and was associated with evolution to AML. These data provide support for the hypothesis that MDS progression is related to accumulation of immature myeloid cells with increased bcl-2 expression and decreased apoptosis.",,"['Davis, R E', 'Greenberg, P L']","['Davis RE', 'Greenberg PL']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center and VA Palo Alto Health Care System, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biopsy', 'Disease Progression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698000514 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00051-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Sep;22(9):767-77. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00051-4.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,

The PEBP2 beta/CBF beta portion of the chimeric polypeptide harbors most of the amino acid sequence of the PEBP2 beta/CBF beta protein, the non-DNA binding subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor, PEBP2/CBF, whereas the SMMHC portion of the chimera consists of the rod domain of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain molecule. In this study we examined the subcellular localization of the chimeric protein and its effect both on stress fibers and transcriptional activation by transfecting cDNA into tissue culture cells. The localization of the chimera was investigated by immunocytochemical staining of cells and was found to be both cytoplasmic and nuclear. One aspect of the effect of expression of the chimera was a drastic alteration of cell morphology. The cells appeared elongated and possessed long cytoplasmic processes. Double fluorescent labeling revealed disorganization of the stress fibers and an altered F-actin staining pattern in the transfected cells. Studies using a deletion mutant showed that both the PEBP2 beta/CBF beta and SMMHC domains are necessary for the induction of the morphological alteration. A significant proportion of the chimeric protein was retained in the cytoskeleton after detergent extraction of the cells and could be recuperated as a membrane fraction, suggesting that this is one of the probable sites of action of the PEBP2 beta/CBF beta-SMMHC protein. Another effect of the chimeric protein was inhibition of transcriptional activation dependent on the PEBP2/CBF binding DNA sequence. However, deregulation of PEBP2/CBF site dependent transcription by itself was not sufficient to induce cell morphological changes. Taken together, these results indicate that the PEBP2 beta/CBF beta-SMMHC chimeric protein acts at two levels, at the level of stress fiber organization and at the level of transcriptional activation. We suggest that the action of PEBP2 beta/CBF beta-SMMHC depends to a great extent on whether it is located in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus.",,"['Tanaka, Y', 'Fujii, M', 'Hayashi, K', 'Chiba, N', 'Akaishi, T', 'Shineha, R', 'Nishihira, T', 'Satomi, S', 'Ito, Y', 'Watanabe, T', 'Satake, M']","['Tanaka Y', 'Fujii M', 'Hayashi K', 'Chiba N', 'Akaishi T', 'Shineha R', 'Nishihira T', 'Satomi S', 'Ito Y', 'Watanabe T', 'Satake M']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Size', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit', 'Cytoskeleton/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201985 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Aug 13;17(6):699-708. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201985.,,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,

Because uPAR is inducibly shed into culture supernatants and human body fluids, we tested the hypothesis that soluble uPAR (suPAR) can bind to the plasma membrane of hematopoietic cells where it might modulate their invasive phenotype. As measured by flow cytometry, recombinant biotinylated-suPAR (B-suPAR) bound in a specific fashion to THP-1 leukemia cells and blood PMNs and monocytes (but not to lymphocytes). B-suPAR also demonstrated specific binding to a variety of leukemic lines, including cells that are positive or negative for membrane uPAR expression. Binding of B-suPAR to THP-1 cells was enhanced four- to sevenfold by 24-h exposure of cells to PMA or by co-incubation with uPA ligand (but not its isolated catalytic and binding fragments). Conversely, binding of B-suPAR to PMNs was unaffected by brief exposure to fMLP, and was inhibited by co-incubation with uPA. B-suPAR biding to PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells in the presence of uPA was further enhanced by acid washing (removing endogenous uPA) but was partially inhibited by treatment of cells with trypsin. Pretreatment of PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and unstimulated PMNs with soluble sugars, calcium chelators, and antibodies specific for integrins or extracellular matrix proteins failed to consistently block the binding of B-suPAR. Whereas the binding of suPAR did not measurably affect cell-associated plasmin activation, suPAR did competitively inhibit the binding of exogenous uPA to membrane-associated uPAR. These observations support the hypothesis that suPAR can bind specifically to trypsin-sensitive receptors expressed by certain normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells where its binding is variably influenced by uPA ligand.",,"['Mizukami, I F', 'Todd, R F 3rd']","['Mizukami IF', 'Todd RF 3rd']","['University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Biotin', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carbohydrates/pharmacology', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix/immunology/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysin/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Monocytes/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1998/08/26 02:25,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/08/26 02:25'],"['1998/08/26 02:25 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 02:25 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.64.2.203 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1998 Aug;64(2):203-13. doi: 10.1002/jlb.64.2.203.,"['AR20557/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,

For absolute quantification of IL-6R transcript numbers, we established a quantitative IL-6R reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method with an internal RNA standard. In the present work, two types of AML blast cells were investigated, namely autonomously growing cell line cells (n = 8) and non cultured native blast cells (n = 20), including those from which the cell lines originate. The native blast cells expressed an average of 2.8 x 10(7) +/- 1.9 x 10(7) IL-6R transcripts in one microgram of total cellular RNA, whereas the expression by the cell line cells was significantly more abundant, the value being 8.3 x 10(7) +/- 2.8 X 10(7) (P < 0.001). The proliferation responses were evaluated by exposing the cells to IL-6 (1000 U/ml) in a clonogenic cell culture assay and, in the case of the cell line cells, in a long-term suspension culture assay as well. None of the autonomously growing cell lines responded to exogenous IL-6, whereas the native blast cell showed either stimulatory, inhibitory or neutral responses. Thus, the IL-6R expression level did not predict whether the cells proliferated in response to exogenous IL-6, which shows that IL-6R quantification cannot be used as a screening test prior to possibly applying this cytokine to clinical use in AML therapy.",,"['Saily, M', 'Koistinen, P', 'Savolainen, M', 'Rantala, M', 'Savolainen, E R']","['Saily M', 'Koistinen P', 'Savolainen M', 'Rantala M', 'Savolainen ER']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/analysis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08977199809017481 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 1998;15(4):243-57. doi: 10.3109/08977199809017481.,,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,

Growth factor independence, neoplastic transformation and differentiation of mast cells were found in association with c-kit activating mutations in both murine and human mastocytoma and mast cell diseases. We have identified a novel c-kit mutation (D816Y) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with AML (M2), massive presence of mast cells in bone marrow and rapid progression of the disease. The mutation, a G-->T transversion at nt 2467 of the c-kit gene resulting in Asp816-->Tyr substitution, corresponds to the D814Y and D817Y mutations identified and characterized in the murine P815 mastocytoma and the rat RBL-2H3 mast cell leukemia cell lines. The absence of SCF transcripts that we found by RTPCR in the patient's blasts indicates that, also in humans, this activating mutation leads to SCF independent growth. The expression of the mutant allele on Kit signaling may be further enhanced by trisomy of chromosome 4 (carrying the c-kit gene) in the patient's blasts. From these findings it is concluded that mast cells could be generated from a leukemic CD34/CD117-positive clone, that combines the antigenic expression of mast cell precursor to the growth and differentiation factor-independence which was derived by the c-kit D816Y mutation.",,"['Beghini, A', 'Cairoli, R', 'Morra, E', 'Larizza, L']","['Beghini A', 'Cairoli R', 'Morra E', 'Larizza L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics, Medical Faculty, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Alleles', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*cytology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(98)90191-7 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1998.0191 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1998 Jun;24(2):262-70. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1998.0191.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,

However, changes in other enzyme(s) which may detoxify the drug or produce anti-alkylating agent(s), have not been examined. The human leukemia cell line, K562, was made 30-fold resistant against 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC) by exposing the cells to increasing concentrations of the drug. Resistance against cisplatin was also increased by about 3-fold. Activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and ALDH1 were elevated more than 7-fold in the resistant cells. The mRNA level of the two enzymes was also proportionally elevated. The concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) was higher in the resistant cells (i.e., 21.1 versus 4.68 nmole per 10(6) cells), while activities of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase, and the expressions of other human ALDH genes were not increased in the resistant cells. These findings suggest that the acquired resistance against 4HC is a consequence of transcriptional activation of two genes, i.e., one encoding the G6PD, a major enzyme regenerating anti-alkylating GSH, and the other encoding ALDH1, which has a high activity for oxidation of aldophosphamide derived from 4HC.",,"['Tsukamoto, N', 'Chen, J', 'Yoshida, A']","['Tsukamoto N', 'Chen J', 'Yoshida A']","['Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(98)90188-7 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1998.0188 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1998 Jun;24(2):231-8. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1998.0188.,['HL-29515/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '7AM2ILM9FI (aldophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed by flow cytometry cell surface expression of CD66c on bone marrow cells from 4 healthy subjects and on bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from 127 patients with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies: 70 de novo acute myeloid leukemias (AML), 6 refractory anemias with excess of blasts in transformation, 3 myeloid and 3 lymphoid blastic phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia, 33 B-lineage and 6 T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B- and T-ALL), and 3 B-cell and 3 T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the leukemic phase. We found that in normal bone marrow CD66c expression was myeloid restricted, reaching its highest level on promyelocytes. As for de novo AML, slight expression of CD66c was found on 6/25 (24%) AML-M4 and only occasionally in other subgroups. In 9 out of 10 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia, CD66c was totally absent, but antigen expression was easily detectable following in vitro exposure to all-trans retinoic acid.

Finally, dual staining with CD66c and CD10 proved to be a suitable tool for distinguishing even low percentages of residual leukemic cells (CD10+/CD66c+) from normal regenerating early-B cells (CD10+/CD66c ) in CD10+ early-B-ALL induced into remission.",,"['Boccuni, P', 'Di Noto, R', 'Lo Pardo, C', 'Villa, M R', 'Ferrara, F', 'Rotoli, B', 'Del Vecchio, L']","['Boccuni P', 'Di Noto R', 'Lo Pardo C', 'Villa MR', 'Ferrara F', 'Rotoli B', 'Del Vecchio L']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Universita Frederico II, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Leukopoiesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Neprilysin/*immunology']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1998.tb03017.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1998 Jul;52(1):1-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1998.tb03017.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CEACAM6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,

GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) and c-Fes tyrosine kinase were also activated upon GM-CSF stimulation. Furthermore, c-Fes formed a complex with STAT3. Experiments using a c-Fes mutant that lacked tyrosine kinase activity revealed that the activation of STAT3 is kinase-dependent, but that the c-Fes-STAT3 interaction is not affected by c-Fes tyrosine kinase activity.

CP is a mitotic inhibitor, causing cells to accumulate in mitosis with the disappearance of intracellular microtubules. In this report, we studied the interaction and uptake of a new synthetic CP analog, CP-52, with 2 human tumor cell lines, THP-1 and H-125. In vitro colony-forming assay showed that CP-52 has antiproliferative activity against THP-1 and H-125 cell lines with IC50 of 0.1 ng/ml and 20 microg/ml, respectively; i.e., THP-1 cells are 200,000 times more sensitive to CP-52 than H-125 cells. The uptake of CP-52 by the target cells was carried out using tritiated CP-52 (3H-CP-52). The uptake of 3H-CP-52 by both THP-1 and H-125 cells was rapid, reaching a maximum within 20 min. Dissociation experiments showed that CP-52 interacts with the target cells irreversibly, presumably by binding to specific cellular sites with high affinity. With increasing doses of 3H-CP-52, the uptake was found to be saturable, reaching a steady state as the concentrations of 3H-CP-52 were raised to about 20 microg/ml. Under this condition, the maximal values of CP-52 uptake by THP-1 and H-125 cells was estimated to be 27 and 136 ng/10(5) cells, respectively. The uptake and accumulation of 3H-CP-52 with the target cells was effectively inhibited by prior treatment with unlabeled CP-52 and, to a lesser extent, vinblastine and taxol but not adriamycin, colchicine or mitomycin. In addition, the binding of 3H-CP-52 to purified tubulin was inhibited by vinblastine but not taxol. This finding suggested that CP-52 and taxol interact and bind to distinct regions of tubulin molecules. Further, it suggests that, in addition to tubulin, other intracellular and/or membrane components are involved in mediating the binding of CP-52.",,"['Chen, B D', 'Nakeff, A', 'Valeriote, F']","['Chen BD', 'Nakeff A', 'Valeriote F']","['Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. chenb@kci.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism', 'Depsipeptides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1998/08/26 02:24,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/08/26 02:24'],"['1998/08/26 02:24 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/08/26 02:24 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980911)77:6<869::AID-IJC12>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980911)77:6<869::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 Sep 11;77(6):869-73. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980911)77:6<869::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Tubulin)', '124689-65-2 (cryptophycin)']",,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, multidrug resistance can be mediated by P-glycoprotein (PGY1), a cell surface phosphoglycoprotein that acts to efflux natural products from cells. PGY1 is encoded by the MDR1 gene located at 7q21.1. Overexpression of MDR1 has been demonstrated in many cancers, both in patient tumors and in cell lines selected with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Recent studies in drug-selected cell lines and patients samples have identified hybrid mRNAs comprised of an active, but apparently random, gene fused 5' to MDR1. This observation indicates that random chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations and inversions, leading to ""capture"" of MDR1 by constitutively expressed genes may be a mechanism for activation of this gene following drug exposure. In this study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using whole chromosome paints (WCP) and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-derived probes showed structural rearrangements involving 7q in metaphase and interphase cells, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed high levels of amplification at chromosomal breakpoints. In an adriamycin-selected resistant colon cancer line (S48-3s/Adr), WCP4/WCP7 revealed t(4;7)(q31;q21) and BAC-derived probes demonstrated that the breakpoint lay between MDR1 and sequences 500-1000 KB telomeric to it. Similarly, in a subline isolated following exposure to actinomycin D (S48-3s/ActD), a hybrid MDR1 gene composed of heme oxygenase-2 sequences (at 16p13) fused to MDR1 was identified and a rearrangement confirmed with WCP7 and a subtelomeric 16p probe. Likewise, in a paclitaxel-selected MCF-7 subline where CASP sequences (at 7q22) were shown to be fused to MDR1, WCP7 showed an elongated chromosome 7 with a homogeneously staining regions (hsr); BAC-derived probes demonstrated that the hsr was composed of highly amplified MDR1 and CASP sequences. In all three selected cell lines, CGH demonstrated amplification at breakpoints involving MDR1 (at 7q21) and genes fused to MDR1 at 4q31, 7q22, and 16p13.3.

While their normal counterparts display high levels of PgP and Rho123 efflux, we investigated the MDR status of marked T/NK proliferations. When diagnosed according to natural killer (NK) markers (CD16, CD56, CD57) 8 of nine NK lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) were markedly positive (3 NK non Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), 1 NK lymphoproliferative disease of large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and 5 T/NK LGL). These results are in accordance with the observed response to chemotherapy in the treated cases. Mature T LPD (prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), and NHL) cells gave varying results, as did cells from Sezary syndromes. Marked Rho123 efflux was detected in the two cases of T-PLL suggesting the expression of MRP as previously described. Immature T-lymphomas or leukemias (6 cases) were all negative. These data should be considered in relation to NK proliferations which clearly display an MDR phenotype and therefore raise the question, of the relevance of this phenotype in normal cells, and secondly of the negativity of immature T-LPD. The latter could indicate that MDR inhibitors may be superfluous in the initial treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

The bcr-abl fusion gene, the H-ras gene and the c-myb gene were universally expressed. In comparison with the chronic phase (CP) of the disease, an increase in the levels of bcr-abl-, c-myb- and H-ras-related transcripts was found in three, two and three AP samples, respectively. Elevation of the bcr-abl-related message was associated with duplication of the Ph chromosome and amplification of the bcr-abl fusion gene in one AP sample. No CP samples were positive for c-myc or c-sis expression. On the contrary, c-myc and c-sis were expressed in three and four AP samples, respectively. The presence of c-myc-related transcript was associated with trisomy 8 with or without amplification of the c-myc oncogene in leukemia cells of two patients with CGL in AP.

We and other investigators have found that TPO also stimulates normal marrow colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) growth. In contrast to its effect on normal marrow precursors, TPO stimulates acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) progenitor proliferation in only 25% of the cases. Because the hematopoietic cells in Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) originate from both the normal and leukemic clones, we hypothesized that TPO may be a useful therapeutic agent for MDS. To test this hypothesis, we used fresh marrow samples taken from 14 MDS patients. We found that in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) and erythropoietin (EPO) TPO (5 to 40 ng/ml) MDS CFU-GM and BFU-E colony-forming cell proliferation were stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion by up to 103% and 93% respectively. This effect was similar to the stimulation obtained with optimal concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), or interleukin-3 (IL-3). Furthermore, TPO increased the colony-stimulatory effects of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and stem cell factor (SCF) on MDS marrow cells. However, depletion of either T lymphocytes or adherent cells abrogated the effect of TPO, suggesting that the effect is not a direct one but is mediated through interaction with cytokines produced by accessory cells.

We have demonstrated previously that growth of B-lineage leukemic cells in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) was a significant prognostic factor for children with high risk ALL. We now have examined the significance of this prognostic variable for 13 infants with newly diagnosed ALL treated at participating institutions of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG). Chromosomal translocations were detected in 10/12 evaluated cases, including five with t(4;11), one each with t(7;9) and t(7;11), t(1;19), and t(9;22), and two with t(11;19). Twelve of the thirteen infants with ALL achieved remissions following induction chemotherapy. Primary leukemic cells from 8 of the 13 infants caused overt leukemia in SCID mice. Among these 8 SCID+ infants, 7 were CD10- and seven had cytogenetic or molecular evidence of an 11q23 rearrangement. Six of the 8 SCID+ infants have relapsed; only 2 remain in remission following chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant. However, among the 5 SCID- infants there were also two relapses. These data are suggestive of a poorer outcome for SCID+ infants, but larger numbers of patients must be analyzed to assess their statistical significance. In summary, we have established a SCID mouse model for human infant ALL that will be useful for 1) predicting short-term and long-term outcome of patients, 2) testing pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity of new agents, and 3) elucidating the in vivo mechanisms of chemotherapeutic drug resistance in infant ALL.",,"['Uckun, F M', 'Waurzyniak, B J', 'Sensel, M G', 'Chelstrom, L', 'Crotty, M L', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Reaman, G H']","['Uckun FM', 'Waurzyniak BJ', 'Sensel MG', 'Chelstrom L', 'Crotty ML', 'Gaynon PS', 'Reaman GH']","[""Children's Cancer Group ALL Biology Reference Lab, and Wayne Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057540 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Jul;30(3-4):269-77. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057540.,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, B-CLL cells are CD5 positive and most of them also express CD6, surface receptors that are present in just a small subset of normal B-cells. When exploring CD6 function, we found out that cross-linking of CD6 protected B-CLL from anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. CD6 activation blocked anti-IgM- induced Bax(alpha) up-regulation and, by doing so, corrected an imbalance in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio that accompanies apoptosis.

These latter changes result in abnormally high levels of mature myeloid elements circulating in the systemic circulation of CML patients.

Recently, a specific site within the 8.3 kb MLL break-point cluster region that is cleaved during the early stages of apoptosis has been identified. Because MLL gene rearrangements are used to identify patients with high risk leukaemia, it was the aim of this study to determine whether this DNA cleavage event could be triggered in diagnostic bone marrow samples solely through ex vivo incubation at room temperature. METHODS: Pretreatment bone marrow samples were collected from six paediatric leukaemia patients. Genomic DNA for Southern blot analysis of MLL gene rearrangements was isolated immediately after samples were obtained and compared to genomic DNA isolated after incubation of specimens for 24-60 hours at room temperature, simulating delays in processing that might occur when samples are delivered to reference laboratories. In addition, cryopreserved samples from 70 paediatric leukaemia patients were screened for evidence of site specific MLL cleavage. RESULTS: After ex vivo incubation of bone marrow samples, site specific MLL cleavage resulting in a pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene was detected in two of six patients. In addition, a third patient with a similar MLL pseudo-rearrangement in cryopreserved cells was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudo-rearrangement of the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was caused by ex vivo incubation of bone marrow samples. This novel phenomenon, which could lead to misclassification of leukaemia patients, might also be of importance for genotype analysis by Southern blotting at other loci.",,"['Stanulla, M', 'Schunemann, H J', 'Thandla, S', 'Brecher, M L', 'Aplan, P D']","['Stanulla M', 'Schunemann HJ', 'Thandla S', 'Brecher ML', 'Aplan PD']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cryopreservation', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Specimen Handling', '*Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/mp.51.2.85 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pathol. 1998 Apr;51(2):85-9. doi: 10.1136/mp.51.2.85.,"['CA16056-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73773-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,PMC395615,,,,,,

DESIGN: Height and weight were measured in all subjects and the heights of the patients at XRT were obtained from their case notes. Each patient and control underwent two provocative tests of growth hormone (GH) secretion using insulin (0.2 IU/kg body weight) and arginine (20 g/m2). Basal serum insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGFBP-3 (binding protein-3) concentrations were also measured. RESULTS: The patient group had a significantly lower peak GH response to both provocative tests (P < 0.01), and lower IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels compared with the normal controls (P < 0.01). Nine of the patient group were severely GH deficient (peak GH response < 9 mU/l to both provocative agents) and a further 12 patients were GH insufficient (peak GH response < 20 mU/l to both tests with at least one peak GH response > 9 mU/l). Overall a significant median change in height from XRT to final height of -0.5 SDS was found which was even greater in the severely GH deficient group (median change in height of -2.1 SDS). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a significant proportion of adults treated with cranial XRT in childhood with irradiation doses between 18-25 Gy, as part of their treatment for ALL, are severely GH deficient now and should be considered for GH replacement. Changes in GH secretion evolve with time following irradiation-induced damage to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis; therefore long-term surveillance will be required in those remaining patients, in whom GH status is considered currently to be insufficient or even normal.",,"['Brennan, B M', 'Rahim, A', 'Mackie, E M', 'Eden, O B', 'Shalet, S M']","['Brennan BM', 'Rahim A', 'Mackie EM', 'Eden OB', 'Shalet SM']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arginine', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/blood/*etiology', 'Growth Hormone/*blood/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Male', 'Pituitary Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*radiotherapy']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2265.1998.00438.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1998 Jun;48(6):777-83. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1998.00438.x.,,"['0 (Insulin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",,,,,,,,,,

Certain cytokines might be capable of bypassing this process and here we report on the in vitro effects of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha, (TNF) on a MDR variant (FLC/DOX) of Friend leukemia. Drug resistance of FLC/DOX is associated with at least two mechanisms, i.e. overexpression of P-glycoprotein and increase in glutathione-related detoxifying activities. Nevertheless, TNF exerts more cytotoxicity in FLC/DOX than in its parental, drug-sensitive, counterpart and this effect is related to the induction of apoptosis. In contrast, Doxorubicin (DOX) never induces apoptosis in FLC/DOX, even when applied at high, fully cytotoxic, concentrations. We have tried to elucidate TNF signaling in FLC/DOX. The results have indicated that in this cell line TNF-triggered apoptosis exhibits some distinct features. It occurs mostly through type I (p55) TNF receptors, probably involves a calphostin-C sensitive protein kinase C activity and requires synthesis of proteins (it is inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide) and of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (it is inhibited by NG-methyl-L-arginine or aminoguanidine). Further, it is not influenced by agents which increase or decrease cell sulfhydryl groups, such as N-acetylcysteine or buthionine sulfoximine, respectively. These steps appeared to be either not or dissimilarly involved in the resistance to DOX of the same cells. In particular, DOX activity was stimulated by calphostin C and buthionine sulfoximine, and reduced by N-acetyl-cysteine. These findings illustrate that TNF may activate fresh cytotoxic pathways in tumor cells which are multidrug resistant, also owing to multifactorial causes.",,"[""D'Alessandro, N"", 'Flugy, A', 'Tolomeo, M', 'Dusonchet, L']","[""D'Alessandro N"", 'Flugy A', 'Tolomeo M', 'Dusonchet L']","['Institute of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Palermo, Italy. nadales@tin.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Jul-Aug;18(4C):3065-72.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,

The antibodies used were UIC2 for PGP, MRPm6 for MRP and LRP56 for LRP. They were revealed by Fab'2 coupled with Fluoresceine-isothiocyanate, Phycoerythrin or Tricolor with isotype specificity. Cells were fixed and permeabilized after PGP labelling because MRPm6 and LRP56 recognize intracellular epitopes. PGP and LRP were easily detected. MRP is expressed at relatively low levels and was more difficult to detect because in the triple labelling the non specific staining was higher than in a single labelling. Despite the increased background in the triple labelling we were able to detect coexpression of PGP, MRP, LRP by flow cytometry.

This study has shown that seven PUFAs all inhibited the growth in vitro of three pancreatic cancer cell lines and the HL-60 leukaemic cell line. Five PUFAs induced cell death within 20-30 h, but two less potent PUFAs induced death between 50 and 75 h. Apoptosis was demonstrated to be the mode of cell death by light, UV fluorescence, and electron microscopy, together with studies of DNA fragmentation. In a time-course study of PUFA-treated Mia-Pa-Ca-2 cells, apoptosis accounted for an average of 80 per cent of the loss of viability, with 'secondary necrosis', a feature of late apoptosis, apparently accounting for the remainder. Correlations were found between the number of fatty acid double bonds and the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis induced in both Mia-Pa-Ca-2 cells (R = 0.88, P = 0.0001) and HL-60 cells (R = 0.85, P = 0.0001) and inversely with the micromolar concentrations of PUFAs required for 50 per cent inhibition of growth (IC50) of Mia-Pa-Ca-2 cells (R = -0.73, P = 0.05). Cell death was preceded by progressively increasing lipid peroxidation.

This study explores the pattern of morbidity within a population of 290 adult survivors of cancer in childhood assessed at a median of over 15 years from diagnosis. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (33%) and Hodgkin's disease (15%) were the most common primary diagnoses represented. 85% of the whole group had received treatment with chemotherapy, 81% with radiotherapy, 48% with significant surgery and 28% with all three modalities. Overall, 58% of the survivors had at least one 'chronic medical problem' and 32%, two or more. Infertility (14%), nephrectomy (11%), thyroid hormone deficiency (9%), visual handicap (9%), sex hormone (7%) and growth hormone (7%) replacement therapy were the most common problems. Compliance with long term follow-up was good and an audit of an unselected sub group of all the survivors in the study showed that 84% had attended for surveillance over a period of 1 year, accounting for 222 visits of follow up clinics: 15% were also attending other specialist follow-up including psychiatry, orthopaedic, endocrine, dental and cardiac clinics.

In addition to its role in the generation of high affinity receptors, gp130 is required for signal transduction by these cytokines. In the present study we have examined the role of the N-terminal located, extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module of gp130 in signal transduction by IL-6 and LIF. We have expressed wild-type human gp130 or three mutants in murine myeloid M1-UR21 cells that lack functional endogenous gp130 but express the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and the LIF receptor (LIFR). By measuring cellular responses, such as morphological changes upon differentiation, soft agar colony formation, and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT3, we show that signaling by IL-6, but not LIF, is significantly reduced by mutations in the Ig-like module of gp130. However, the binding of 125I-labeled IL-6 or LIF is not affected by these mutations. We also present evidence that the Ig-like module forms part of the epitope of an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the bioactivity of IL-6, but not of LIF or OSM. The data suggest that gp130-activation by IL-6 and LIF requires different regions of gp130, that the Ig-like module of gp130 may be required for IL-6-induced gp130 dimerization, and that the stoichiometry of the high affinity IL-6 receptor-complex differs from those of the receptor-complexes for LIF and OSM.",,"['Hammacher, A', 'Richardson, R T', 'Layton, J E', 'Smith, D K', 'Angus, L J', 'Hilton, D J', 'Nicola, N A', 'Wijdenes, J', 'Simpson, R J']","['Hammacher A', 'Richardson RT', 'Layton JE', 'Smith DK', 'Angus LJ', 'Hilton DJ', 'Nicola NA', 'Wijdenes J', 'Simpson RJ']","['Joint Protein Structure Laboratory, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch) and The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia. hammacher@ludwig.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA Primers', 'Epitopes/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Signal Transduction']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.35.22701 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)48777-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Aug 28;273(35):22701-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.35.22701.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I induces transcription of FasL gene through the viral transactivator Tax, although the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we have analyzed both the cis-activating element and transactivating factors involved in Tax activation of the FasL promoter. We show that the 486-base pair upstream region of the human FasL gene is sufficient for Tax-mediated transactivation in Jurkat T-cells. Interestingly, a palindromic DNA sequence (GGAAACTTCC) covering the consensus NF-ATp binding site (GGAAA), is required for Tax activation of FasL promoter. The involvement of NF-AT in this transactivation event is suggested by the finding that Tax fails to activate the FasL promoter in a Jurkat T-cell line defective in capacitative calcium entry, a signaling mechanism involved in NF-AT activation. Furthermore, activation of FasL promoter by Tax is largely attenuated in the nonlymphoid F9 embryonal and COS kidney cells deficient in NF-ATp expression. DNA-protein interaction assays reveal that the NF-AT-like motif in the FasL promoter is bound by both NF-ATp and NF-AT4 in Jurkat T-cells expressing Tax. The binding of NF-ATp, although not NF-AT4, to this enhancer also occurs along with HTLV-I-mediated infection of human peripheral blood T-cells.

The human MmTRA1b cDNA predicts a peptide containing 318 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 35,047 Da. The predicted human MmTRA1b protein sequence shared 78% amino acid identity with the mouse counterpart (328 amino acids). Both the human homologue and mouse MmTRA1b protein but not MmTRA1a protein possess a proline-rich domain at the N-terminal end. The human MmTRA1b gene was mapped to chromosome 3q23. Expression of the human homologue was increased during differentiation of U937 cells induced by most typical differentiation inducers. Moreover, predicted amino acid sequence analysis of human MmTRA1b cDNA revealed perfect identity with the human plasma membrane phospholipid scramblase that is required for transbilayer movement of membrane phospholipids.

However, although the survival of mature human neutrophils can be prolonged by a variety of factors, no anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues have previously been identified. Human A1 is a Bcl-2 homologue previously shown to be present in endothelial cells and to convey anti-apoptotic function in vitro.

Eurocord Transplant Group.,S63-5,"Over the past decade, allogeneic cord blood transplantation (CBT) has been widely used for treating patients with malignant disorders. However, the reported low incidence of GVHD observed after allogeneic CBT might be a major drawback in leukemic recipients and at present it is not clear whether CBT really predisposes patients to an increased risk of leukemia relapse. In order to further elucidate the role of CBT in children with hematological malignancies, 54 patients with ALL or AML given either a related (31 cases) or an unrelated (23 cases) CBT in 25 centers participating in the Eurocord Registry were analyzed. Overall survival of related and unrelated CBT recipients was substantially similar, the most important factor influencing patients' outcome being disease state at time of transplantation. In fact, due to a markedly increased relapse rate, poor-risk children (ie patients transplanted in more advanced disease) experienced a significantly worse EFS than those given CBT in a more favorable disease phase (ie CR1 or CR2).

Forty-six patients had a malignant disease: 32 acute leukemia (AL), six chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), four myelodysplastic syndrome, two neuroblastoma and two non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Thirty-two patients were transplanted for non-malignant diseases including 17 bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS), three sickle cell anemia, five thalassemia and seven inborn errors. The donor was an HLA-identical sibling in 60 cases and an HLA-mismatched donor in 18 cases. As conditioning, 36 patients received irradiation and 40 patients received associated busulfan-containing regimens. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA alone in 36 cases, CsA associated with prednisone in eight cases, CsA, methotrexate (Mtx) with or without prednisone in 28 cases and CsA with monoclonal antibody or ATG in four cases. The median number of nucleated cells (NC) infused/kg was 3.9 x 10(7) (0.7-15). One-year survival was 63 +/- 6%.

Balb/c mice received cells of the syngeneic B-lymphatic leukemia A20 2 days prior to TBI (7.5 Gy) and the respective graft. The recipients received allogeneic bone marrow grafts or allogeneic peripheral progenitor cells obtained after mobilization of the donors (DBA/2) with either G-CSF in a dose of 250 microg/kg/day for 5 days. In some experiments T lymphocytes were removed by immunomagnetic depletion with CD3-coated beads. An additional group received T cell-depleted and IL-2/IL12-activated PBPCT grafts. The antileukemic activity of an allogeneic PBPCT graft was significantly greater than the antileukemic activity of an allogeneic BMT graft of the same size. Relapse rates were 80% in syngeneic PBPCT, 60% after allogeneic BMT and 34% after allogeneic PBPCT. This rise in antileukemic activity is not accompanied by a rise in GVHD mortality. Depletion of T lymphocytes by CD3-coated beads resulted in a nearly complete loss of the GVL activity with a relapse rate of 75%. Incubation of the T-depleted graft with IL-2 and IL-12 to enhance NK-based GVL activity has only limited success after MHC-matched transplantation with a relapse rate of 55%. Allogeneic PBPC exert a pronounced antileukemic effect. After MHC-matched PBPCT, this GVL effect resides mostly on the T cells of the graft.

METHODS: LNCaP cells were used for the in vitro quantification of RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed on the peripheral blood of 105 control subjects and 63 patients with prostate cancer (32 who eventually underwent radical prostatectomy and 31 with clinical stage D2 cancer). RESULTS: The nested RT-PCR for the PSA and PSM primers was able to detect 1 LNCaP cell per 10(6) leukemia (K562) cells. None of the control subjects was found positive for the presence of prostate cancer cells by nested RT-PCR. In the 32-patient surgery group, the results of nested RT-PCR were significantly correlated with the pathologic stage of the cancer when using PSM primers (P=2.00 x 10(-3) by Kendall's correlation test) but not when using PSA primers (P=0.06). Extraprostatic extension was significantly more closely correlated with positive PSM nested RT-PCR results (P=0.012 by Fisher's exact probability test) than with positive results of PSA, nested RT-PCR, digital rectal examination, CT imaging, level of serum PSA or Gleason score. In the untreated stage D2 patients, the positive result rate of PSM nested RT-PCR was significantly higher than that of PSA nested RT-PCR (P=0.025 by McNemar test).

However, the pathophysiology of this disorder, including the mechanisms responsible for enhanced apoptosis, are poorly understood. Bcl-2 is a cellular protein known to inhibit apoptosis in a variety of human tissues. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of Bcl-2 in colonic GVHD and to determine its relationship to cell proliferation and apoptosis in this disease. Routinely processed colonic mucosal biopsy specimens from 47 allogeneic BMT patients with diarrhea were evaluated histologically for the grade of GVHD (0-4) and for the degree of apoptosis (apoptosis index). Immunohistochemical staining for Bcl-2 and MIB-1, a cell proliferation marker, was performed, and the results were correlated with the histological findings and with each other. Normal-appearing colonic mucosal biopsy specimens from 10 age-matched patients with noncolonic diarrhea served as controls. Also evaluated were 13 colonic biopsy specimens from 13 patients with chronic ulcerative colitis (three inactive, four mild chronic-active, six moderately severe chronic active) to test the specificity of our findings. When compared with controls, a slight trend toward increased Bcl-2 expression was noted in patients with high-grade GVHD (grade 3 or 4) (P=.09). However, Bcl-2 expression did not correlate with the degree of apoptosis in these patients. In contrast, the degree of Bcl-2 staining correlated positively with the crypt proliferative rate (P=.04). Furthermore, crypt proliferation was significantly higher in the GVHD patients in comparison with controls (MIB-1 index, 27.7+/-17.1 v 15.6+/-11.4, =.02), and increased progressively with each successively higher grade of GVHD, and with the degree of apoptosis. Similar to GVHD, Bcl-2 expression was increased in biopsy specimens of CUC patients with higher grades of active injury and epithelial regeneration. This immunohistochemical study does not provide support for Bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of GVHD-induced apoptosis in the colon, but instead, indicates that this protein may play a nonspecific role in the generalized response to cellular injury in GVHD.",,"['Kraus, M D', 'Shahsafaei, A', 'Antin, J', 'Odze, R D']","['Kraus MD', 'Shahsafaei A', 'Antin J', 'Odze RD']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Nuclear', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cell Division', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/*pathology', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(98)90459-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(98)90459-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1998 Aug;29(8):869-75. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(98)90459-2.,,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,,,,,

Although, because of methodological implications, balanced aberrations are not detected by CGH, the technique has uncovered a variety of new and interesting imbalanced karyotype changes. However, only a few studies deal with its application to hematologic disorders, although this is a main topic of cytogenetics. The aim of our study was, therefore, to evaluate the usefulness of CGH in the examination of hematologic neoplasms. For this purpose, bone marrow aspirates of 33 patients with different hematologic disorders were examined with CGH and the results compared with conventional cytogenetics (CC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CGH showed chromosome changes in 8 of 33 cases. CC found balanced aberrations in 4 of 33 and unbalanced changes in 9 of 33 samples. Differences between CGH and CC in unbalanced aberrations were seen in four cases. In these samples, either the number of aberrant cells found by CC was low and, therefore, difficult to detect by CGH, or complex aberrations in different cell clones as seen in CC were lumped together as one karyotype by CGH. In one sample, CC was not capable of giving any results at all, whereas CGH showed trisomy 8. CGH was also helpful in defining the bands involved in the structural aberrations, which was difficult by CC in some cases because of the low quality of metaphase spreads. All results obtained by CGH were confirmed by FISH, whereas CC and FISH were discordant in one case. Although CGH was not able to detect all aberrations, it gave important additional information for the correct localization of the aberrations found in CC, and it was most helpful in samples not processed successfully in CC.

Whether LIF plays a role in termination of embryonic diapause and initiation of implantation in carnivores, especially in species with obligate delayed implantation such as the mink, is not known. The objectives of this study were to clone the LIF coding sequence in the mink and determine its mRNA abundance in the uterus through embryonic diapause, implantation, and early postimplantation. We show that the mink LIF cDNA contains 609 nt encoding a deduced protein of 203 amino acids. The homologies are 80.6, 90, 88.2, 87.6, and 86.8% in coding sequence and 79.2, 90.1, 91, 90.1 and 85.4% in amino acid sequence with mouse, human, pig, cow, and sheep respectively. Glycosylation sites and disulfide bonds present in other species are generally conserved in the mink LIF sequence. Quantitation by polymerase chain reaction amplification indicates that LIF mRNA is expressed in mink uterus just prior to implantation and during the first two days after implantation, but not during diapause or later after implantation pregnancy. The abundance of LIF mRNA was significantly higher in the uterus at the embryo expansion stage (P < 0.05) than at days 1-2 of postimplantation. By immunohistochemical localization it was shown that LIF is expressed in the uterine epithelial glands at time of embryonic expansion and in early postimplantation. The coincidence of LIF expression with implantation in this species suggests that LIF is involved in the implantation process, and may be a maternal signal which terminates obligate embryonic diapause.",,"['Song, J H', 'Houde, A', 'Murphy, B D']","['Song JH', 'Houde A', 'Murphy BD']","['Centre de Recherche en Reproduction Animale, Faculte de Medicine Veterinaire, Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Embryo Implantation', '*Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pregnancy', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Uterus/embryology/*metabolism']",1998/08/26 02:22,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/08/26 02:22'],"['1998/08/26 02:22 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/08/26 02:22 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199809)51:1<13::AID-MRD2>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199809)51:1<13::AID-MRD2>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 1998 Sep;51(1):13-21. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199809)51:1<13::AID-MRD2>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,

The activation of gp130 in cardiac myocytes was reported to induce myocardial hypertrophy. The downstream side of gp130 consists of two distinct pathways in cardiac myocytes, one a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, the other a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In the present study, we examined whether the JAK/STAT pathway, especially the STAT3-mediated pathway, plays a critical role in gp130-dependent myocardial hypertrophy by transfecting wild-type and mutated-type STAT3 cDNA to cardiac myocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We constructed three kinds of replication-defective adenovirus vectors carrying wild-type (AD/WT) or mutated-type (AD/DN) STAT3 cDNA or adenovirus vector itself (AD). Cultured murine cardiac myocytes infected with adenovirus were stimulated with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and the expression of c-fos and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRNAs and [3H]leucine incorporation were examined. There were no significant differences in MAPK activity among the three groups. Compared with AD-transfected cardiac myocytes, induction of c-fos and ANF mRNAs and protein synthesis after LIF stimulation were significantly augmented in AD/WT-transfected cells. In contrast, induction of c-fos and ANF mRNA expression and protein synthesis were attenuated after LIF stimulation in cardiac myocytes transfected with AD/DN. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the STAT3-dependent signaling pathway downstream of gp 130 promotes cardiac myocyte hypertrophy under stimulation with LIF.",,"['Kunisada, K', 'Tone, E', 'Fujio, Y', 'Matsui, H', 'Yamauchi-Takihara, K', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Kunisada K', 'Tone E', 'Fujio Y', 'Matsui H', 'Yamauchi-Takihara K', 'Kishimoto T']","['Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/genetics', 'Cardiomegaly/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myocardium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.cir.98.4.346 [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 1998 Jul 28;98(4):346-52. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.98.4.346.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,,,,,,,,,

ATRA is capable of inducing complete remission in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients, whereas IFNalpha is successfully used in the treatment of the stable phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. ATRA and IFNs have shown synergistic interactions in various experimental conditions and represent a potentially useful therapeutic combination in the treatment of various types of leukemias and solid tumors. The molecular basis of these interactions are poorly understood and need to be elucidated. In this review, we summarize a series of recent observations concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between the intracellular pathways activated by ATRA and IFNs in APL cells. In APL blasts, IFNs regulate the expression of retinoic acid receptors, and ATRA, in turn, modulates the levels and the state of activation of members of the Jak-STAT second messenger pathway. This demonstrates a two-way interaction between ATRA and IFNs, which leads to cross-modulation of genes normally under the control of the retinoid and the cytokine. These data may be relevant in the context of a rational use of the combination between ATRA and IFNs in the clinical management of myeloid leukemias.",,"['Garattini, E', 'Mologni, L', 'Ponzanelli, I', 'Terao, M']","['Garattini E', 'Mologni L', 'Ponzanelli I', 'Terao M']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy. egarattini@irfmn.mnegri.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Forecasting', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057559 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Aug;30(5-6):467-75. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057559.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",55,,,,,,,,,

Among normal BM cells, CD117 expression has been found in about half of the CD34+ precursors including progenitors committed to the erythroid, granulo-monocytic, and megakaryocytic cell lineages. In addition, strong CD117 expression is detected in bone marrow mast cells as well as in a small subset of NK cells displaying strong reactivity for CD56, and in a relatively important proportion of CD3 /CD4 /CD8 prothymocytes. These results suggest that CD117 expression can be detected in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages although for the lymphoid lineage it would be restricted to a small NK-cell subset and early T-cell precursors. In acute leukemias CD117 expression was initially associated with AML. Nevertheless, at present it is well established that CD 117 expression may also be found in a relatively important proportion of T-ALL while it is usually absent in B-lineage ALL. Moreover, recent studies have shown that in about one-third of multiple myeloma cases and patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance plasma cells display reactivity for CD1117. The prognostic influence of CD117 expression has not yet been clearly established. The analysis of this marker may also be of value for the investigation of minimal residual disease (MRD).

Early G-CSF signaling events in myeloid cells involves activation of STATs, proteins that serve the dual function of signal transduction and activation of transcription, especially the activation of Stat3. A dominant-negative mutant construct of Stat3 inhibited G-CSF-mediated neutrophilic differentiation indicating that Stat3 is a essential component for driving the G-CSF-mediated differentiation program in myeloid cells. Three isoforms of Stat3 have been identified, alpha(p92), beta(p83) and gamma(p72) each derived from a single gene. Stat3alpha is the predominant isoform expressed in most cells. Stat3beta is derived from Stat3alpha by alternative RNA splicing. Stat3gamma is derived from Stat3alpha by limited proteolysis. Mapping of Stat3alpha and Stat3beta activation in M1 murine myeloid leukemia cells revealed that their optimal activation required G-CSFR constructs containing both Y704 and Y744. These amino acid residues has previously been demonstrated to be essential for G-CSF-induced differentiation in this cells. Phosphopeptide affinity and phosphopeptide inhibition studies indicate that Stat3alpha and Stat3beta are recruited to the G-CSF receptor complex through their interaction with the receptor at phosphotyrosines Y704 and Y744. Y744 is followed at the +3 position by Cys (C). This sequence YXXC, represents a novel motif implicated in the recruitment and activation of Stat3alpha, Stat3beta and Stat3gamma by the hG-CSFR. Structurally, Stat3alpha, Stat3beta and Stat3gamma differ from each other in their C-terminal transactivation domain. In the beta isoform, the Stat3alpha transactivation domain is replaced by 7 amino acid residues which enable Stat3beta to interact with c-Jun. In the gamma isoform, the Stat3alpha transactivation domain is removed by limited proteolysis creating a dominant negative isoform. In immature human myeloid cells capable of differentiating into neutrophils in response to G-CSF, G-CSF did not activate Stat3alpha; rather. it activated predominantly Stat3beta. These findings combined with recent reports linking Stat3alpha with proliferation and transformation suggest that the beta isoform of Stat3 may be more critical for G-CSF-mediated differentiation. Activation of Stat3gamma occurred predominantly in terminally differentiated neutrophils suggesting that it may be part of a controlled proteolytic mechanism modulating pro-proliferative protein(s) in mature myeloid cells.",,"['Chakraborty, A', 'Tweardy, D J']","['Chakraborty A', 'Tweardy DJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/classification/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/classification/*physiology']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057555 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Aug;30(5-6):433-42. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057555.,['CA 72261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",60,,,,,,,,,

MGDF stimulates platelet production and maturation both in vitro and in vivo. MGDF may thus have a role in attenuating the thrombocytopenia associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its therapy. However, there is concern that MGDF might induce AML blast proliferation and thereby increase the risk of treatment failure. To address this concern, we studied the expression of c-mpl mRNA and c-Mpl protein by blasts from AML patients. In addition we examined the in vitro effect of MGDF as well as the combined effect of MGDF and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or stem cell factor (SCF) on leukemic blast proliferation, recruitment into S-phase, induction of programmed cell death and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. Our results demonstrate that blasts from a substantial proportion of cases of AML express the receptor at either the mRNA or protein level. Moreover, the function of the MGDF receptor was demonstrated by activation of STAT proteins following exposure to MGDF. Nevertheless, blast proliferation in response to MGDF was rare, and the proliferative effect of MGDF was less than that of G-CSF or SCF. Furthermore, MGDF did not prevent programmed cell death induced by cytarabine. Finally, there appeared to be no correlation between receptor expression by AML blasts and functional response to MGDF. Based on these data, it would appear that clinical trials of MGDF may be undertaken safely in patients with AML.",,"['Wetzler, M', 'Bernstein, S H', 'Baumann, H', 'Fries, K M', 'Stewart, C', 'Blumenson, L', 'Baer, M R', 'Herzig, G P', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Slack, J L']","['Wetzler M', 'Bernstein SH', 'Baumann H', 'Fries KM', 'Stewart C', 'Blumenson L', 'Baer MR', 'Herzig GP', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Slack JL']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809057554 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Aug;30(5-6):415-31. doi: 10.3109/10428199809057554.,['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,

A generalized rash had been noted 5 days after onset of symptoms. His 2-year-old son had fallen ill with measles a few days earlier. The patient had reportedly had measles as a child. On admission a generalized rash was found, he had a fever of 40.5 degrees C, tachypnoea, conjunctivitis and possible meningismus. INVESTIGATIONS: Lactate dehydrogenase activity was raised to 458 U/ml, and C-reactive protein to 240 mg/ml. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 8/3 cells and protein of 269 mg/l. The chest radiogram revealed opacification in the left upper lobe. Computed tomography of the skull demonstrated a pansinusitis. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: As measles encephalitis seemed unlikely he was treated for the measles superinfection of bacterial pneumonitis (measles RNA in the bronchoalveolar lavage) and the sinusitis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After initial improvement artificial ventilation had to be be gun on day 3 because of an acute respiratory distress syndrome, diagnosed both clinically and radiologically.

The distinction between eosinophilia and hypereosinophilic syndrome is clearly defined. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: The 2 cases of hypereosinophilic syndrome demonstrate the difficulty to decide whether they represent the idiopathic or the reactive type of hypereosinophilic syndrome. If the assumption is made in favor of the reactive type of hypereosinophilic syndrome the assumed prognosis could eventually be too promising. In case of an assumed idiopathic type of hypereosinophilic syndrome the search for causing factors like allergens could be left out. The decision concerning the type of hypereosinophilic syndrome of the 2 cases reported was made with high probability. In the case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, eosinophilic leukemia was excluded by bone marrow biopsy. CONCLUSION: In order to be able to make a diagnosis it is necessary to search carefully for causing and influencing factors of the hypereosinophilic syndrome such as allergens or medicaments and to eliminate them.

The first human lymphoma cell line Raji was established in 1963; since then several hundred leukemia-lymphoma cell lines spanning almost the whole spectrum of hematopoietic cell lineages (except for dendritric cells) have been described. The cardinal features of leukemia-lymphoma cell lines are their monoclonal origin, arrest of differentiation, and (growth factor-independent or -dependent) unlimited proliferation. Categorization of cell lines usually follows the physiological stages of hematopoietic differentiation in the various cell lineages. For an adequate classification, a detailed characterization of both primary and cultured cells in absolutely necessary. New cell lines, in particular, must be adequately, characterized; while cell culture data and immunological and cytogenetic features are essential, cell lines should be described in as much detail as possible. In addition to this recommended multiparameter characterization and the obligatory immortality of the culture, authentication of the true origin of the cells, novelty, scientific significance and availability of the cell line for other investigators are of utmost importance. It is still extremely difficult to establish new leukemia-lymphoma cell lines (except for some subtypes), and most attempts fail. Paramount to the lack of our understanding as to why certain cells start to proliferate in culture and others do not (thus implying a random process), is probably the difficulty of mimicking in vitro the physiological in vivo microenvironment. Attempts to improve the efficiency of cell line establishment should focus on examining the appropriateness of the in vitro culture conditions; these conditions should emulate as closely as possible the in vivo situation. In summary, leukemia-lymphoma cell lines have the potential to greatly facilitate diverse studies of normal and malignant hematopoiesis; to that end, these cell lines must be extensively characterized and adequately described.",,"['Drexler, H G', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Matsuo Y', 'Minowada J']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures Dept. of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. <hdr@gbf.de>']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hum Cell. 1998 Mar;11(1):51-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the role of PLZF in myeloid development, we engineered expression of PLZF in murine 32Dcl3 cells. Expression of PLZF had a dramatic growth-suppressive effect accompanied by accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 compartment of the cell cycle and an increased incidence of apoptosis. PLZF-expressing pools also secreted a growth-inhibitory factor, which could explain the severe growth suppression of PLZF-expressing pools that occurred despite the fact that only half of the cells expressed high levels of PLZF. PLZF overexpression inhibited myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells in response to granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors. Furthermore, cells that expressed PLZF appeared immature as demonstrated by morphology, increased expression of Sca-1, and decreased expression of Gr-1.

We have determined the DNA sequence of a small portion (approximately 16.1 kb) of this region and have identified a cluster of three new retrotransposon-like elements as well as degenerate fragments from the 3' end of Tad, a previously identified LINE-like retrotransposon. This region contains a novel full-length but nonmobile copia-like element, designated Tcen, that is only associated with centromere regions. Adjacent DNA contains portions of a gypsy-like element designated Tgl1. A third new element, Tgl2, shows similarity to the Ty3 transposon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All three of these elements appear to be degenerate, containing predominantly transition mutations suggestive of the repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) process. Three new simple DNA repeats have also been identified in the LG VII centromere region. While Tcen elements map exclusively to centromere regions by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, the defective Tad elements appear to occur most frequently within centromeres but are also found at other loci including telomeres. The characteristics and arrangement of these elements are similar to those seen in the Drosophila centromere, but the relative abundance of each class of repeats, as well as the sequence degeneracy of the transposon-like elements, is unique to Neurospora. These results suggest that the Neurospora centromere is heterochromatic and regional in character, more similar to centromeres of Drosophila than to those of most single-cell yeasts.",,"['Cambareri, E B', 'Aisner, R', 'Carbon, J']","['Cambareri EB', 'Aisner R', 'Carbon J']","['Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA. cambarer@lifesci.ucsb.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Centromere/chemistry/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Fungal', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA, Fungal/chemistry/genetics', 'Drosophila/genetics', 'Endopeptidases/chemistry/genetics', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neurospora crassa/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroelements', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Telomere/chemistry/genetics']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.9.5465 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Sep;18(9):5465-77. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.9.5465.,"['CA-11034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM17371/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",,,,PMC109131,['GENBANK/AF079510'],,,,,

Tax expression promotes N-terminal phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB alpha, a principal cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Our studies now demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax activates the recently identified cellular kinases IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and IKKbeta, which normally phosphorylate IkappaB alpha on both of its N-terminal regulatory serines in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation. In contrast, a mutant of Tax termed M22, which does not induce NF-kappaB, fails to activate either IKKalpha or IKKbeta. Furthermore, endogenous IKK enzymatic activity was significantly elevated in HTLV-1-infected and Tax-expressing T-cell lines. Transfection of kinase-deficient mutants of IKKalpha and IKKbeta into either human Jurkat T or 293 cells also inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression induced by Tax. Similarly, a kinase-deficient mutant of NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase), which represents an upstream kinase in the TNF-alpha and IL-1 signaling pathways leading to IKKalpha and IKKbeta activation, blocks Tax induction of NF-kappaB. However, plasma membrane-proximal elements in these proinflammatory cytokine pathways are apparently not involved since dominant negative mutants of the TRAF2 and TRAF6 adaptors, which effectively block signaling through the cytoplasmic tails of the TNF-alpha and IL-1 receptors, respectively, do not inhibit Tax induction of NF-kappaB. Together, these studies demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax exploits a distal part of the proinflammatory cytokine signaling cascade leading to induction of NF-kappaB. The pathological alteration of this cytokine pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation by Tax may play a central role in HTLV-1-mediated transformation of human T cells, clinically manifested as the adult T-cell leukemia.",,"['Geleziunas, R', 'Ferrell, S', 'Lin, X', 'Mu, Y', 'Cunningham, E T Jr', 'Grant, M', 'Connelly, M A', 'Hambor, J E', 'Marcu, K B', 'Greene, W C']","['Geleziunas R', 'Ferrell S', 'Lin X', 'Mu Y', 'Cunningham ET Jr', 'Grant M', 'Connelly MA', 'Hambor JE', 'Marcu KB', 'Greene WC']","['Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, Microbiology, and Immunology University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94141-9100, USA.

Distinct from HSF1, which is expressed ubiquitously and activated by heat shock and other stresses that result in the appearance of nonnative proteins, the stress signal for HSF2 has not been identified. HSF2 activity has been associated with development and differentiation, and the activation properties of HSF2 have been characterized in hemin-treated human K562 erythroleukemia cells. Here, we demonstrate that a stress signal for HSF2 activation occurs when the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is inhibited. HSF2 DNA-binding activity is induced upon exposure of mammalian cells to the proteasome inhibitors hemin, MG132, and lactacystin, and in the mouse ts85 cell line, which carries a temperature sensitivity mutation in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature. HSF2 is labile, and its activation requires both continued protein synthesis and reduced degradation. The downstream effect of HSF2 activation by proteasome inhibitors is the induction of the same set of heat shock genes that are induced during heat shock by HSF1, thus revealing that HSF2 affords the cell with a novel heat shock gene-regulatory mechanism to respond to changes in the protein-degradative machinery.",,"['Mathew, A', 'Mathur, S K', 'Morimoto, R I']","['Mathew A', 'Mathur SK', 'Morimoto RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology, Rice Institute for Biomedical Research, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.9.5091 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Sep;18(9):5091-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.9.5091.,,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '142297-91-4 (HSF2 protein, human)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,PMC109094,,,,,,

Replating CFU-GM colonies and observing secondary colony formation provides a measure of CFU-GM amplification. Amplification of CML, but not normal, CFU-GM in vitro was significantly inhibited by IFN-alpha (P = 0.02). In 5 out of 15 CML cases studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization, in vitro treatment with IFN-alpha increased the proportion of CFU-GM, which lacked BCR-ABL. The ability of patients' CFU-GM to amplify, and suppression of this ability by IFN-alpha, predicted responsiveness to IFN-alpha therapy in 86% of cases. Investigation of patients on treatment with IFN-alpha showed a threefold reduction in CFU-GM amplification in responders (P = 0.03) but no significant change in nonresponders (P = 0.8).

As a consequence, morbidity and mortality due to opportunistic infections have become a major challenge. The provision of adequate doses of viable granulocytes has thus become an important approach for circumventing the problem. A schedule for collecting therapeutic numbers of cells with minimal donor toxicity has yet to be established. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An investigation of three mobilization schedules for the collection of granulocytes for transfusion--granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 micrograms per kg daily; G-CSF 5 micrograms per kg every other day, and prednisone 60 mg given orally (20 mg doses at 17 hours, 12 hours, and 2 hours before the collection). RESULTS: A total of 464 apheresis procedures involving 163 healthy donors were analyzed. Prednisone caused a small increase in the white cell (WBC) counts over the collection days, while G-CSF every other day and daily schedules improved WBC counts to 145 and 160 percent, respectively (p = 0.004). Similarly, administration of G-CSF daily and every other day mobilized higher yields of granulocytes over the collection days, compared to the prednisone schedule (170% and 180% vs. 105%; p = 0.02).

METHODS: The authors evaluated the clinical and pathologic findings in 60 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 2 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the prostate. A variety of clinical and histologic findings were considered as factors predictive of patient outcome. RESULTS: Lymphoma tended to occur in elderly men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 62 years (range, 5-89 years), although 6 patients were age < 40 years (ages 5, 19, 30, 32, 38, and 38 years, respectively). Clinical signs and symptoms were due to lower urinary tract obstruction. Twenty-two patients (35%) presented with primary extranodal lymphoma of the prostate with a variety of histologic subtypes, including small lymphocytic (4 patients); follicular center cell, diffuse, small cell (2 patients); follicular center cell, Grade 1 (according to the revised European-American classification (small cleaved) (1 patient); Grade 2 (mixed) (1 patient); diffuse large B-cell (12 patients); and high grade B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like (2 patients). At the time of presentation, none of these patients had hepatosplenomegaly, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or an abnormal complete blood count. Thirty other patients (48%) with previously documented lymphoma at other sites developed prostatic involvement; these secondary prostatic lymphomas displayed a variety of subtypes, including small lymphocytic (8 patients, all with concomitant leukemia); follicular center cell lymphoma, diffuse, small cell (2 patients); follicular center, Grade 1 (small cell) (1 patient); follicular center, Grade 2 (1 patient); diffuse large B-cell (11 patients); peripheral T-cell lymphoma (2 patients); high grade B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like (1 patient); Burkitt's lymphoma (1 patient); Hodgkin's lymphoma (nodular sclerosing [1 patient] and mixed cellularity [1 patient]); and unknown (1 patient). Ten cases were not classifiable as primary or secondary lymphomas. Twenty-five patients died of malignant lymphoma, 14 died of unknown or other causes, 18 patients were alive 12-20 months after diagnosis (8 primary and 10 secondary tumors; 3 had persistent lymphoma; all treated since 1981), and 5 were lost to follow-up. Lymphoma specific survival was 64% at 1 year (95% confidence interval [CI], 51-80%), 50% at 2 years (95% CI, 36-68%), 33% at 5 years, 33% at 10 years, and 16% at 15 years.

In this retrospective study, the authors compared the incidence of infection from the day of transplantation to 28 days posttransplantation between two groups of previously studied patients who underwent ABMT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. A control group that received no cytokine was compared with a study group that received rhGM-CSF while participating in phase I, II, or III trials.

However, this therapy might cause severe complications, including depletion of normal hematopoietic progenitors as a long-term toxicity. Thus, we conducted a pilot study of this strategy. Twenty-six acute myeloid leukemia patients in a first complete remission (CR) were treated with two courses of consolidation chemotherapy (10-day BHAC-DMP, consisting of behenoyl cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, 6-mercaptopurine and prednisolone) and repeated maintenance-intensification therapy including eight cycles of six-day BHAC-DMP. G-CSF (filgrastim) was administered concurrently with these BHAC-DMP therapies. Toxicity during the therapeutic period was not significant in the study group compared with the historical control, treated with the same regimen without G-CSF. Neutrophil recovery after the consolidation therapy was more rapid in the study group than in the historical control (p = 0.066 and 0.024 for the first and second consolidation courses, respectively). Long-term toxicity, such as cytopenia, has not been seen in eight patients who have remained in CR for a long period (range: 39-58 months).

METHODS: Peripheral blood cells from 70 patients with B cell disorders and 17 healthy donors were analysed by quantitative flow cytometry. Direct immunofluorescence staining was performed with phycoerythrin conjugated CD19 and CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Standard microbeads with different capacities to bind mouse immunoglobulins were used to convert the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values into number of antigen molecules/cell, expressed as antibody binding capacity (ABC). RESULTS: CD19 and CD20 ABC values in leukaemic B cells differed from those of normal blood B lymphocytes. The results identified distinct profiles of CD19 and CD20 expression in the various types of B cell leukaemias. In all leukaemias studied except hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), CD19 expression was significantly lower than the mean (SD) value in normal B cells (22 (7) x 10(3) molecules/cell), as follows: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 13 (7) x 10(3); B prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL), 16 (9) x 10(3); splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), 15 (11) x 10(3); mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 10 (7) x 10(3).

This is despite a large number of patients being diagnosed and treated at various cancer centres all over the country. We, therefore, analysed the available data of the Bombay Cancer Registry to ascertain the epidemiological characteristics of leukaemias in India. METHODS: The incidence and mortality rates of leukaemias by cell type and sex were obtained for the most recent 5 years (1989-93). The data of the past 30 years were used to study the time trends using a linear regression model based on the logarithms of the incidence rates. RESULTS: Leukaemias constituted 3.9% of all registered cancer cases and 5.4% of all registered deaths in Greater Mumbai. Males were affected more frequently than females. Myeloid leukaemias were the commonest. A bimodal age incidence was observed with the first peak in childhood, a trough between 15 to 19 years of age and a slow rise thereafter. Among the various religious groups Hindus had the highest rate. An increasing trend in the incidence of all types of leukaemias was also observed. CONCLUSION: The incidence of leukaemias in Greater Mumbai is comparable to world rates. There is a male preponderance in all cell types and an increase in incidence was observed over the last 30 years. The higher incidence of myeloid leukaemias observed by us might be related to under-reporting of chronic lymphatic leukaemia.",,"['Yeole, B B', 'Jussawalla, D J', 'Advani, S H']","['Yeole BB', 'Jussawalla DJ', 'Advani SH']","['Bombay Cancer Registry, Indian Cancer Society, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 1998 May-Jun;11(3):116-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we constructed a series of modified retroviral vectors and showed that they function significantly better than MoMuLV-based vectors in vitro. To test the efficacy of the modified vectors in hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, we examined gene expression and proviral methylation in differentiated hematopoietic colonies formed in the spleens of mice after serial transplantation with transduced bone marrow (2 degreesCFU-S). We found a significant increase in the frequency of expression with our modified vectors (>90% expression in vector DNA containing 2 degreesCFU-S) over the frequency observed with the standard MoMuLV-based vector (28% expression in vector containing 2 degreesCFU-S). Expression from the modified vectors was highly consistent, with expression in >50% of the vector-containing 2 degreesCFU-S from all 20 transplant recipients analyzed, whereas expression from the standard MoMuLV-based vector was inconsistent, with expression in 0-10% of the vector containing 2 degreesCFU-S from 8 recipients and expression in >50% of the vector-containing 2 degreesCFU-S from 4 other recipients.

Effector cells were mononuclear cells, which were used in a limiting dilution analysis to measure the frequencies of CML progenitor cell-inhibitory lymphocyte precursors (PCILp) in peripheral blood of seven patients before and after DLI for relapsed CML. In the six patients who entered complete remission, a 5- to 100-fold increase of PCILp was found during the clinical response. In the patient with resistant relapse the frequency of PCILp was <10 per ml before and after DLI. Leukemia-reactive helper T lymphocyte precursor frequencies remained unchanged after DLI.

Angioimmunoblastic lymphoma is characterized by prominent vascular and stromal proliferations. Using a panel of antibodies, we investigated the nature of the stromal component in 15 cases of AIL as compared with 40 cases of nodal-based peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) of other types. As has been previously noted, extrafollicular proliferations of follicular dendritic cells (detected by CD21 and low molecular-weight nerve growth factor receptor staining) were highly associated with AIL and were only rarely seen in other lesions. Unexpectedly, large networks of desmin-positive reticulum cells also were noted in all cases of AIL evaluated. These cells with characteristic long cytoplasmic processes were present in much smaller numbers or only rarely in other types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. This population of nodal stromal cells, a subset of the fibroblastic reticulum cells detected by vimentin immunostaining, may be responsible for the prominent reticulum deposition seen in AIL. No association of AIL with proliferations of other types of reticulum cells (e.g., interdigitating dendritic cells or histiocytes) was noted.

DESIGN: Analysis of the 14,088 cases of cancer in this age group, accessioned by the California Cancer Registry from 1988 through 1993, and comparison with those less than age 90. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence rates and numbers and percents of cases with various features (gender, ethnicity, site of tumor, stage, causes of death). RESULTS: The peak age-specific incidence (ASI) of cancer is in the group 80 to 84 years of age. Those 90 to 94 years of age had a higher ASI than any group except those ages 75 to 89. There are ethnic variations in the sites of cancer in people aged 90 or older. Colorectal cancer accounts for more than one-fifth of the new cases of cancer in people 90 or older. In women aged 90 or older, the most common sites of cancers are colorectal, breast, and lymphoma/leukemia. In men of the same age, prostate, colorectal, and lung/bronchus are the most common sites. As age increases, fewer people have their cancers staged, and for lung/bronchus, prostate, and breast, more cancers are first diagnosed in the distant stage in people aged 90 and older. Of the people with cancer who die, the proportion dying of cancer decreases as age increases.

Immunophenotyping of the large blasts revealed surface markers suggestive of an early stem cell differentiation arrest resulting in undifferentiated polyclonal myelopoiesis. The fetal heart tracing showed minimal beat-to-beat variability in the presence of high leukocyte counts. Serial fetal blood sampling showed decreasing blast cells in the peripheral blood and normalization of white blood cell counts. Although there was increasing hydrops, this period was marked by improvement of the fetal heart rate pattern. Finally the fetus developed pancytopenia with increasing hydrops, AV-valvular insufficiency and venous Doppler studies indicative of cardiac decompensation prior to intra-uterine death at 31 + 5 weeks' gestation. Post-mortem examination revealed marked liver and splenic necrosis without evidence of residual leukaemic infiltration in any organ. Fetal hydrops and hepatosplenomegaly may indicate an underlying haematopoietic disorder warranting further investigation.

This disease is characterized by progressive motor neurons loss and severe gliosis within specific target areas of the central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism(s) of this neurodegeneration is unknown. In the neonatal infection of the CNS, the MoMuLV-ts1 virus was reported to replicate within the endothelial, ependymal, astrocytes and microglial cells. Since no virus or viral products were recognized in the degenerating neurons, it is postulated that an indirect mechanism(s) caused the loss of neurons in the neonatally infected mice. This study was undertaken to investigate the possible pathogenic role of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) such as glutamate and other nonneurotransmitters amino acids (NAAs) in this animal model. The free amino acids concentration was analysed by a fluorometric HPLC method. The temporal measurements of the free amino acids concentration, glutamate, glutamine and arginine from the brain stem and spinal cord of MoMuLV-ts1-infected mice was significantly decreased when compared with the control non-infected mice. The concentration of EAAs during the course of this infection indicated a sharp decline in glutamate and its precursor, glutamine with early infection (10 days post infection-dpi). This deficiency persisted (20 and 30 dpi) in the spinal cord, where the neuronal loss was most severe, but not in the brain stem. A similar pattern occurs with the amino acid arginine. These observations suggest that an astrocyte-induced metabolic disturbance of glutamate and arginine in the CNS of developing mice, could be, in part responsible for the loss of motor neurons observed in this model.",,"['Stoica, G', 'Barker, R', 'Wu, G', 'Lynn, W S', 'Wong, P K']","['Stoica G', 'Barker R', 'Wu G', 'Lynn WS', 'Wong PK']","['Texas A and M University, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College Station 77843-4467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain Stem/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/pathology', 'Spinal Cord/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism/pathology']",1998/08/26 00:00,1998/08/26 00:01,['1998/08/26 00:00'],"['1998/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1998 Jul-Aug;12(4):395-401.,"['AI 28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Amino Acids)'],,,,,,,,,,

The activity and protein levels of DNA methyltransferase in the nuclei were kept constant in proliferating mouse erythroleukemia cells, and increased about twofold after 6 h incubation in the presence of aphidicolin. This increase of DNA methyltransferase levels by aphidicolin treatment was positively correlated with the cell population at S phase. De novo synthesis of DNA methyltransferase protein was increased by the treatment. In addition, the relative half life of pulse labeled DNA methyltransferase was prolonged by aphidicolin treatment. Both increase in synthesis and prolongation of half life of DNA methyltransferase in S phase contributed to the increase of the activity and the protein levels by aphidicolin treatment.

The MRP14 gene was not expressed in monoblastic ML-1 cells, promonocytic U-937 cells, or promyelocytic HL-60 cells. On the other hand, the gene was expressed in monocytic THP-1 cells and in the HL-60 cells treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). The level of MRP14 in VD3-treated HL-60 cells was two-fold higher than that in THP-1 cells. Among several known transcription factor binding motifs, nuclear protein(s) of VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells bound to the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-binding motif that was located in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene (-81), as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility-shift assay. An antibody for C/EBP alpha super-shifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP-1 cells but not in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells, whereas an antibody for C/EBP beta blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL-60 cells but not with that of THP-1 cells. An anti-C/EBP delta antibody had no effect on the complex in either cell. Thus, it was concluded that C/EBP alpha and -beta were able to bind to the C/EBP motif, and that C/EBP alpha bound to the motif in THP-1 cells and C/EBP beta bound to that in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells. Furthermore, to examine the transcriptional activity of the C/EBP motif, we transfected several constructed luciferase reporter DNAs into HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells. The luciferase activity of the C/EBP motif in HL-60 cells was increased by VD3 treatment. The C/EBP motif in the MRP14 gene was confirmed to function as a regulatory region in VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells by the assay.

Marek's disease, being horizontally transmitted, is controlled through biosecurity measures and vaccination. Prevention of early exposure before vaccine immunity is established is most important. Some multi-house growing farms have converted to all single-age placements to break the ongoing cycle of transmission. Vaccination against MD involves either in ovo or day-old administration of live vaccine, including single or multiple serotype products. Field viruses appear to adapt over time and become resistant to the prevalent vaccine. The Rispens vaccine (CVI-988) has shown good efficacy against recently emerging very virulent MD strains in the U.S. Genetic resistance of the host to MD and control of other immunosuppressive diseases also affects MD susceptibility.

The ALSV can be classified as slowly transforming viruses, which lack a viral oncogene, and acutely transforming viruses, which possess a viral oncogene. Slowly transforming viruses induce late onset leukoses of the B cell lymphoid, erythroid, and myeloid cell lineages, and other tumors, by viral promoter insertion into the genome of a host cell and activation of a cellular protooncogene. The various acutely transforming leukemia and sarcoma viruses induce leukotic or other tumors rapidly and carry one or anther (sometimes two) viral oncogenes, of which some 15 have been identified. The ALSV fall into six envelope subgroups, A through E, and the recently recognized J subgroup, which induces myeloid leukosis. With the exception of Subgroup E viruses, these viruses spread vertically and horizontally as infectious virions, and are termed exogenous viruses. Subgroup E viruses are usually spread genetically as DNA proviruses (often defective) in host germ cell genome, and are termed endogenous viruses. Several other families of endogenous viruses also exist, one of which, endogenous avian retrovirus (EAV), is related to Subgroup J ALV. Exogenous viruses, and sometimes endogenous viruses, can have detrimental effects on commercially important production traits. Exogenous viruses are currently controlled by virus eradication schemes. Reticuloendotheliosis virus, which lacks a viral oncogene, causes chronic B cell and T-cell lymphomas in chickens, and also chronic lymphomas in turkeys and other species of birds. An acutely transforming variant of REV, Strain T, carries a viral oncogene, and induces reticuloendotheliosis within a few days. In chickens and turkeys, REV spreads vertically and horizontally. No commercial control schemes are operated.

When TNF-sensitive murine L929 fibroblasts were stably transfected with TIF2 cDNA, these cells significantly resisted TNF killing. In contrast, L929 cells, which stably expressed the TIF2 antisense mRNA, acquired enhanced TNF susceptibility. Calculated EC50 values, i.e., the amount of TNF needed for killing 50% cells, are 10, 55, and 1.5 ng/ml, respectively, for vector control, sense transfectant, and antisense transfectant.

During the initial chronic phase of CML the primitive multipotent leukaemic progenitor cells remain growth factor dependent and are capable of producing terminally differentiated cells. Although the available evidence suggests that Bcr-Abl directly affects signalling pathways involved in controlling the development of primitive haemopoietic progenitors the identification of the specific biological consequences of Bcr-Abl activity in these progenitors has been hampered by the lack of suitable systems modelling CML. By transfecting the multipotent haemopoietic cell line FDCP-Mix with a temperature sensitive mutant of Bcr-Abl we have developed the first working model that mirrors the chronic phase of CML. FDCP-Mix cells expressing Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity remain growth factor dependent and retain their ability to differentiate. Normal neutrophilic cells are formed in response to G-CSF and GM-CSF. In addition, the transfected FDCP-Mix cells grown at the permissive temperature for Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity display enhanced survival and proliferation in low concentrations of growth factor. These findings are consistent with the initial subtle changes seen in CML progenitor cells during the chronic phase and confirm that Bcr-Abl effects are context specific, i.e. they depend on the origin and developmental potential of the transfected cells.

As a tumor promoter, heptachlor induces human myeloblastic leukemia cells to differentiate, and also down-regulates the tumor suppressor gene p53 in human immune cells. In this study, the heptachlor signaling pathway in human lymphocytes was studied. Addition of heptachlor to human CEM x174 lymphocytic cells reduced the cellular levels of MAP kinase (MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade proteins, including ERK1 (a 44-kDa MAPK), ERK2 (a 42-kDa MAPK), a 85-kDa and a 54-kDa MAP kinase, MEK1 (a 45-kDa ERK kinase) and MEKK (a 78-kDa MEK kinase). However, heptachlor treatment caused a marked increase in the expression of the activated (Thr- and Tyr-dually phosphorylated) ERK1 and ERK2 in the cells. These studies indicate that mitogen-activated protein kinases are important intermediates in the signal transduction pathway of immune cells upon heptachlor exposure, and the observation of stimulation of activated MAP kinases without a simultaneous accumulation of basal enzymes may suggest the involvement of a negative feedback control mechanism in the pathway.",,"['Chuang, L F', 'Chuang, R Y']","['Chuang LF', 'Chuang RY']","['Department of Medical Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Heptachlor/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Immunoblotting', 'Insecticides/*toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-483X(98)00042-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-483x(98)00042-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1998 Jun 26;128(1):17-23. doi: 10.1016/s0300-483x(98)00042-0.,,"['0 (Insecticides)', '7GLS9ACN3L (Heptachlor)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All eligible patients aged 1 to less than 22 years, registered between February 1986 and September 1994 in two B-precursor ALL studies from the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), were included in the analysis. Cutpoints for age (3.0, 5.0, and 10.0 years), WBC count (10, 50, and 100 x 10(9)/L), and DNA index (DI; 1.16) were defined. Four time periods after diagnosis (years 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 5 combined) were selected for the study of prognostic significance over time. The cut-off date for analysis was April 1996. RESULTS: A total of 3,717 children (2,010 boys and 1,707 girls) were included in the outcome analysis. No major differences between the sexes were observed in age, duration of symptoms before registration, WBC count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, ploidy, presence of CNS disease at diagnosis, or induction failure rate. Event-free survival (EFS) differences between sexes became significantly different from 2 years following diagnosis. At 5 years, in all subsets analyzed, boys fared worse than girls, although not all differences were statistically significant. Major sex differences in EFS were observed in older children (10 to 22 years), in patients with intermediate WBC counts (10 to 50 x 10(9)/ L), and in children who fit both of these subgroups, in whom the 2-year EFS was almost 20% higher in girls than in boys, reaching a 38% difference at 5 years. CONCLUSION: This study shows an outcome interaction among sex, time, and commonly used prognostic variables. The important sex difference observed at 2 and 5 years suggests that more intensive consolidation and/or maintenance therapy in some boys with B-precursor ALL should be investigated.",,"['Shuster, J J', 'Wacker, P', 'Pullen, J', 'Humbert, J', 'Land, V J', 'Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Lauer, S', 'Look, A T', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Carroll, A J', 'Camitta, B']","['Shuster JJ', 'Wacker P', 'Pullen J', 'Humbert J', 'Land VJ', 'Mahoney DH Jr', 'Lauer S', 'Look AT', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll AJ', 'Camitta B']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Geneva, Switzerland. jon@pog.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sex Factors']",1998/08/15 02:14,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/08/15 02:14'],"['1998/08/15 02:14 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 02:14 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.8.2854 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Aug;16(8):2854-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.8.2854.,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the incidence and type of SMN diagnosed before leukemic relapse in a large series of patients with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the outcome of all patients treated for childhood ALL between 1972 and 1995 on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and DFCI ALL Consortium protocols. The follow-up time from diagnosis of ALL to induction failure, relapse, remission death, or SMN, whichever occurred first, ranged from 0 to 24.0 years (median, 7.6 years; mean, 6.7 years). RESULTS: Thirteen SMNs were diagnosed among 1,597 patients. Eight tumors occurred in a radiation field (five in the CNS and three in the head and neck), two occurred outside of a radiation field (one adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon and one epithelioid sarcoma of the chest wall), and three were hematopoietic malignancies. The median time to occurrence was 6.7 years (range, 1.0 to 17.2 years) and the cumulative incidence of second malignancy before another first event was 2.7% (95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 4.7). The risk of a first event, which included induction failure, relapse, or remission death, was 31.0% (95% confidence interval, 28.5 to 33.5). CONCLUSION: We found a more than 10-fold risk of other first events when compared with SMN. Thus, we conclude that SMN before first relapse is a relatively uncommon occurrence among survivors of childhood ALL.

Seven hundred sixteen patients attained a complete remission (CR) after induction therapy. Of these, 114 patients were randomized to a different regimen and were the subject of a separate report. Six hundred two patients were randomized to receive one the following regimens: intermediate-dose methotrexate (IDMTX) with leucovorin rescue on weeks 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22 (regimen A); regimen A plus asparaginase (ASP) administered intramuscularly (i.m.) weekly for 24 weeks (regimen B); or regimen A plus a 24-hour infusion of cytarabine (AraC) with each IDMTX (regimen C).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients were studied. Six patients were in advanced refractory relapse, and induction therapy had failed in two patients. Patients with CLL or low-grade lymphoma received fludarabine 90 to 150 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 900 to 2,000 mg/m2. Patients with intermediate-grade lymphoma or in Richter's transformation received cisplatin 25 mg/m2 daily for 4 days; fludarabine 30 mg/m2; and cytarabine 500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days. Chemotherapy was followed by allogeneic stem-cell infusion from HLA-identical siblings. Patients with residual malignant cells or mixed chimerism could receive a donor lymphocyte infusion of 0.5 to 2 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg 2 to 3 months posttransplantation if graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was not present. RESULTS: Eleven patients had engraftment of donor cells, and the remaining four patients promptly recovered autologous hematopoiesis. Eight of 11 patients achieved a complete response (CR). Five of six patients (83.3%) with chemosensitive disease continue to be alive compared with two of nine patients (22.2%) who had refractory or untested disease at the time of study entry (P = .04). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate the feasibility of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation with a nonablative preparative regimen to produce engraftment and GVL against lymphoid malignancies. The ability to induce remissions with donor lymphocyte infusion in patients with CLL, Richter's, and low-grade and intermediate-grade lymphoma is direct evidence of GVL activity against these diseases.

Cord blood transplants have been performed either with related or unrelated cord blood. Several cord blood banks established a group called Netcord whose goal is the standardization of the procedures, the organization of internal audits for accreditation and qualification, and the communication and exchange by internet of donor search on an international basis. More than 15,000 units of frozen cord blood are currently available and this number is increasing rapidly worldwide. Analysis of the clinical results has shown that related cord blood transplants give better results than unrelated cord blood transplants. Factors associated with better survival in related and unrelated cord blood transplants were lower age, diagnosis, with better results in inborn errors and in good risk children with acute leukemia. A larger number of nucleated cells in the transplant and the recipient being negative for CMV serology were also favourable risk factors for survival. Engraftment was improved with higher numbers of cells and HLA identity. Graft versus Host disease was reduced when compared to transplants of adult allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells. HLA disparities did not influence GVH; the only factor associated with increased GVH was positive CMV serology in the recipient. This study shows that cord blood is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplantation in children and in some adults. HLA disparity is not a limiting factor but the number of cells infused is important; currently the use of a number of nucleated cells inferior to 1 x 10(7)/kg is not recommended. Several questions remain including the criteria of choice of the donor, the indications in children and in adults, the comparison of cord blood transplants to other sources of hematopoietic stem cells and the role of growth factors and expansion for improving the speed of engraftment.",,"['Gluckman, E', 'Rocha, V', 'Chastang, C']","['Gluckman E', 'Rocha V', 'Chastang C']","['Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France. eliane.gluckman@chu-stlouis.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Banks/statistics & numerical data', 'Blood Donors', '*Blood Preservation', 'Child', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infection Control', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Registries', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1423-0410.1998.tb05403.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vox Sang. 1998;74 Suppl 2:95-101. doi: 10.1111/j.1423-0410.1998.tb05403.x.,,,13,,,,,,,,,

Over a period of 10 years two cases of TB among 120 allogeneic and 65 autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood SCT were encountered. The first patient was a 42-year-old male with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) who underwent allogenic SCT from his HLA-identical sister in first remission. His early post transplant period was unremarkable and showed no clinical acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). His chest X-ray and CT scan revealed alveolar infiltrate of the left apical lobe one year after the procedure and sputum showed acid-fast bacilli, later identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He was put on combination chemotherapy. He is now well and disease-free 30 months after transplant with no complaints of pulmonary TB. The second patient with chronic phase CML underwent allogeneic peripheral SCT from his HLA-identical sister. He suffered from grade II acute and extensive chronic GVHD partially treated with immunosuppressive therapy. He showed pulmonary TB 15 months after transplantation. He is still on combination chemotherapy. Although our numbers are small, the annual incidence of TB after SCT is 1.1% (2/185) which is nearly 30 to 40 times higher than the incidence of TB in the general Turkish population. In other words, an immunosuppressive state after allogenic SCT seems to increase the risk of TB in Turkey. In conclusion, TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained infections after SCT, especially in countries, where the disease is endemic.",,"['Arslan, O', 'Gurman, G', 'Dilek, I', 'Ozcan, M', 'Koc, H', 'Ilhan, O', 'Akan, H', 'Konuk, N', 'Uysal, A', 'Beksac, M']","['Arslan O', 'Gurman G', 'Dilek I', 'Ozcan M', 'Koc H', 'Ilhan O', 'Akan H', 'Konuk N', 'Uysal A', 'Beksac M']","['Hematology-Oncology Department, Ibni-Sina Hospital, Ankara University, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tuberculosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1998;29(1):59-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most FAAH blockers developed to date also inhibit cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and/or bind to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor subtype. Here we report the finding of four novel FAAH inhibitors, two of which, malhamensilipin A and grenadadiene, were screened out of a series of thirty-two different algal natural products, and two others, arachidonoylethylene glycol (AEG) and arachidonoyl-serotonin (AA-5-HT) were selected out of five artificially functionalized polyunsaturated fatty acids. When using FAAH preparations from mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells and [14C]anandamide as a substrate, the IC50s for these compounds ranged from 12.0 to 26 microM, the most active compound being AA-5-HT. This substance was also active on FAAH from rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells (IC50 = 5.6 microM), and inhibited [14C]anandamide hydrolysis by both N18TG2 and RBL-2H3 intact cells without affecting [14C]anandamide uptake. While AEG behaved as a competitive inhibitor and was hydrolyzed to arachidonic acid (AA) by FAAH preparations, AA-5-HT was resistant to FAAH-catalyzed hydrolysis and behaved as a tight-binding, albeit non-covalent, mixed inhibitor. AA-5-HT did not interfere with cPLA2-mediated, ionomycin or antigen-induced release of [3H]AA from RBL-2H3 cells, nor with cPLA2 activity in cell-free experiments. Finally, AA-5-HT did not activate CB1 cannabinoid receptors since it acted as a very weak ligand in in vitro binding assays, and, at 10-15 mg/kg body weight, it was not active in the 'open field', 'hot plate' and rectal hypothermia tests carried out in mice. Conversely AEG behaved as a cannabimimetic substance in these tests as well as in the 'ring' immobility test where AA-5-HT was also active. AA-5-HT is the first FAAH inhibitor reported to date which is inactive both against cPLA2 and at CB1 receptors, whereas AEG represents a new type of cannabinoid receptor agonist.",,"['Bisogno, T', 'Melck, D', 'De Petrocellis, L', 'Bobrov MYu', 'Gretskaya, N M', 'Bezuglov, V V', 'Sitachitta, N', 'Gerwick, W H', 'Di Marzo, V']","['Bisogno T', 'Melck D', 'De Petrocellis L', 'Bobrov MYu', 'Gretskaya NM', 'Bezuglov VV', 'Sitachitta N', 'Gerwick WH', 'Di Marzo V']","['Istituto per la Chimica di Molecole di Interesse Biologico, C.N.R., Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Amidohydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cyclopropanes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Esters/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Ethylene Glycols/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lipids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X9898874X [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.8874 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1998 Jul 30;248(3):515-22. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.8874.,['CA 52955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cyclopropanes)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Ethylene Glycols)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (arachidonoylethylene glycol)', '0 (arachidonoylserotonin)', '0 (grenadadiene)', '156281-16-2 (malhamensilipin A)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",,,,,,,,,,

Unlike other anticancer drugs, IPCAR showed a potent and broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity in vitro coupled with low cytotoxicity for resting PBL and CFU-GM. IPCAR proved fully inhibitory against human nasopharyngeal carcinoma KB cells expressing the MDR phenotype, whereas IPCAR-resistant renal adenocarcinoma ACHN/R1 cells were fully susceptible to inhibition by a number of anticancer drugs, with the exception of 6TG, 6MP and 5FU towards which they showed a partial cross-resistance. In combinations studies, IPCAR proved synergistic with 6MP, 6TG, 5FU and ribavirin, and additive with ara-A, MTX, doxorubicin, taxol and tiazofurin. Antagonistic effects were never observed. Although the precise molecular target of IPCAR remains to be identified, the data presented herein suggest that, unlike ribavirin and tiazofurin, this drug inhibits a step of the de novo purine biosynthesis different from the conversion of IMP into GMP.

Drug doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg on a day-1, -3 and -5 dosing schedule increased the life span (ILS) relative to untreated control mice of 36.4 and 68.2%, respectively, whereas administration of 500 mg/kg on days 1 and 3 resulted in a ILS of 86.4% and also increased the 30-day survival rate (25% of the mice).",,"['Pani, A', 'Marongiu, M E', 'Pinna, E', 'Scintu, F', 'Perra, G', 'Montis, A D', 'Manfredini, S', 'La Colla, P']","['Pani A', 'Marongiu ME', 'Pinna E', 'Scintu F', 'Perra G', 'Montis AD', 'Manfredini S', 'La Colla P']","['Dipartimento di Biologia Sperimentale, Universita di Cagliari, Italy. pania@vaxcal.unica.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleosides/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Ribonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Jul-Aug;18(4A):2623-30.,,"['0 (4-iodo-1-ribofuranosyl-3-carboxymethyl pyrazole)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Direct antitumour activity of ST-421 was evaluated using dimeric Le(a) positive cell lines Colo 205, Colo 201, HT-29 and WiDr; and negative cell lines MX-1 and K562. RESULTS: While time- and concentration-dependent antitumour activity was observed against Colo 205 and Colo 201, no antitumour activity was detected against the other cell lines tested in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. When ST-421 was administered intraperitoneally daily for 2 weeks to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with tumour xenografts, inhibition of tumour growth was observed against Colo 205, and to a lesser extent HT-29 and WiDr. Anti-asialo GM1 antibody did not block this antitumour activity, suggesting ST-421 has a direct cytotoxic effect.

Their transcription is regulated by metals, glucocorticoids and cytokines, and in certain tissues it is a highly specialized phenomenon. Although their physiological function is not entirely understood, hMTs induction has been observed to be associated with protection from heavy metal toxicity and cellular resistance to cytotoxic anticancer drugs. However, the main problem in the investigation of the physiological function of hMTs is the absence of any known specific inhibitor, as well as the fact that many genes constitute the hMTs family. As the identification of genes preventing apoptosis is of great interest, we attempted to examine the role of hMTs in the apoptotic process by inhibiting their expression in the immature T cell line CCRF-CEM with antisense sequence-specific phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). In the experimental procedure the cells were activated and cultured in medium containing 20% FBS instead of 10%, during maintenance. We found that the inhibition of hMTs synthesis, induced by the incubation of the cells for 24 hours with ODNs, stimulated the apoptotic process, as confirmed by the characteristic morphological alterations and DNA fragmentation. Quantitative analysis of apoptosis has shown that inhibition of hMTs expression results in a dose-dependent and ODNs sequence-specific induction of apoptosis. Immunocyto-chemical detection of hMTs followed by Tunel assay showed that all the Tunel positive cells were hMTs negative, suggesting that hMTs expression prevents apoptosis. As hMTs induction is rapid and transient in response to stress and/or environmental stimuli, these results indicate that hMTs constitute a cellular protective mechanism, neutralizing external apoptotic signals.",,"['Tsangaris, G T', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, F']","['Tsangaris GT', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F']","[""First Department of Paediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Greece.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Metallothionein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Jul-Aug;18(4A):2423-33.,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)']",,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of FS in the PBL of the patients was significantly higher than in the controls and this increase was independent of any abnormality detected in the malignant cells of the BM. However, patients with an abnormal BM karyotype displayed increased frequency of FS induction as compared to patients with a normal karyotype. In three cases the heritable FS was found to be at or near the breakpoints of the chromosomal rearrangements detected in the malignant cells.

Similarly, nucleoside analog drugs followed by mitotic inhibitors also have a synergistic effect. Sequence specific combinations of F-araA followed by ara-C and Taxotere (docetaxel) in CEM/0 cells showed a 2- to 3-fold synergism over the two drug (F-araA + ara-C) combinations and 2- to 4-fold synergism over Taxotere alone. This synergism was evident due to enhanced cellular apoptosis. In the CEM/ara-C/7A cell line, which is partially resistant to ara-C, the synergy observed with the triple drug combination was 9-fold greater than the F-araA plus araC combination, and 3-fold greater than Taxotere alone, making this three-drug regimen collaterally sensitive to ara-C. This study describes the mechanisms of the synergistic effect in regards to apoptosis achieved by three-drug regimens comprised of two nucleoside analog drugs and a mitotic inhibitor in comparison with the combination of two nucleotide analog drugs. The study also demonstrates that the possible biochemical mechanism of cellular toxicity and drug synergism is attributed to induction of apoptosis following drug treatment and the onset of the apoptotic cascade is primarily regulated by p21/WAF-I, which is transcriptionally activated by p53 following DNA damage. The anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2, seemed to have no effect in inhibiting apoptosis following treatment with the two or three drug regimens in this in vitro leukemia model. The three-drug combination induced greater cellular apoptosis than the two-drug combination or Taxotere monotherapy. We conclude that the greater drug synergism observed in human leukemic cells, sensitive or resistant to ara-C, by Fludarabine + ara-C + Taxotere can be explained by the greater oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation indicative of increased cellular apoptosis. The mechanism of this increased cytotoxic action is due to the upregulation of p53 and p21/WAF-1 with a down regulation of bcl-2. These studies are encouraging, and testing this three drug regimen in a clinical setting may result in improved antileukemic therapies.",,"['Avramis, V I', 'Nandy, P', 'Kwock, R', 'Solorzano, M M', 'Mukherjee, S K', 'Danenberg, P', 'Cohen, L J']","['Avramis VI', 'Nandy P', 'Kwock R', 'Solorzano MM', 'Mukherjee SK', 'Danenberg P', 'Cohen LJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. vavramis%smtpgate@chlais.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Mathematics', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Paclitaxel/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', '*Taxoids', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Jul-Aug;18(4A):2327-38.,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,

Major research efforts focussed on the accurate determination of the chimaerism and the immunological recovery of the graft recipient, and on the immunological interactions between donor and host cells. The results of our investigations and those of other groups in the field of bone marrow transplantation provided a lot of information on these topics, offering possibilities for improving the outcome of the patients by changing transplant procedures and developing novel preventive and therapeutic interventions. As was formerly shown in animal experiments, the conditioning of the graft recipient had to be tailored for the purposes of the bone marrow transplantation. It had to be either immunosuppressive, or space creating, or tumor eradicating, or a combination of these, in accordance with the original disease of the patient. It also became evident that the numbers of functional T lymphocytes remaining in the host and present in the graft had reciprocal effects on graft rejection (host-versus-graft) and graft-versus-host disease. Modification of the composition of the graft, e.g. by T-cell depletion, resulted in an increased rejection rate unless extra-immunosuppression was administered to the host. Vice versa, the occurrence and severity of graft-versus-host disease was very much dependent on HLA-matching between donor and recipient and on numbers of T cells in the graft. With regard to immune recovery after bone marrow transplantation, it was shown that the pretreatment of the host had to be adjusted to obtain engraftment of those cell lineages which were relevant for an adequate and complete immune competence of the host after bone marrow transplantation. This could nicely be illustrated by the relationship between B-cell engraftment and recovery of humoral immunity after HLA-haplo-identical bone marrow transplantation of young children, suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency disease. In later experiments our group showed that is was feasible to transfer specific immunological ""memory"" to vaccine antigens from donor to host by mature T cells in the graft and following priming of donor and host with the antigen prior to transplantation. Reversely, when T cells were taken out of the graft, reactivations of DNA-viruses such as CMV and EBV could be observed, frequently resulting in lethal infections. Also there was an increase of the frequency of leukaemia relapse after T-cell depleted bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia. In order to prevent these severe complications donor T-cell infusions have been tried with success, although also with an increase in occurrence and severity of graft-versus-host disease. Recent developments on the production ex vivo of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells and the transfer of these cells to the host, early after bone marrow transplantation, resulted in remarkable clinical effects. These observations open the way for further research, development and trials of adoptive immunotherapy for the prevention of leukaemia relapse after bone marrow transplantation of leukaemia patients. Also recently attention has been paid to the induction of microchimaerism with donor haemopoietic cells, following a relatively non-toxic one-day conditioning of the host, in order to attain a state of tolerance against a solid organ transplant. This possibly promising application of the presence of a blood cell chimaerism is at present under study in animal models.",,"['Vossen, J']",['Vossen J'],"['Department of Paediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Belgium,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg,Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van Belgie,0413210,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Host vs Graft Reaction', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/immunology/therapy', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/08/15 00:00,1998/08/15 00:01,['1998/08/15 00:00'],"['1998/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg. 1998;60(2):111-43; discussion 143-5.,,,101,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia is the most common cancer in children. The causes of leukemia in adults and children are largely unknown, but occupational and environmental factors are strongly suspected. Genetic predisposition may also play a major role. Our aim is to use molecular epidemiology and toxicology to find the cause of leukemia and develop biomarkers of leukemia risk. We have studied benzene as a model chemical leukemogen, and we have identified risk factors for susceptibility to benzene toxicity. Numerous studies have associated exposure to benzene with increased levels of chromosome aberrations in circulating lymphocytes of exposed workers. Increased levels of chromosome aberrations have, in turn, been correlated with a heightened risk of cancer, especially for hematologic malignancy, in two recent cohort studies in Europe. Conventional chromosome analysis is laborious, however, and requires highly trained personnel. Further, it lacks statistical power, as only a small number of cells can be examined. The recently developed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies have allowed the detection of specific chromosome aberrations. These techniques are far less time consuming and are more sensitive than classical chromosomal analysis. Because leukemias commonly show a variety of specific chromosome aberrations, detection of these aberrations by FISH and PCR in peripheral blood may provide improved biomarkers of leukemia risk.",,"['Smith, M T', 'Zhang, L']","['Smith MT', 'Zhang L']","['School of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health Sciences, University of California, Berkeley 94720-7360, USA. martynts@uclink4.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors']",1998/08/14 00:00,1998/08/14 00:01,['1998/08/14 00:00'],"['1998/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.98106s4937 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1998 Aug;106 Suppl 4:937-46. doi: 10.1289/ehp.98106s4937.,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Biomarkers)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,PMC1533331,,,,,,

The effect of FK317 was found to be stronger than that of mitomycin C (MMC), adriamycin (ADR) or cisplatin (CDDP). Alkaline elution analysis indicated that FK317 formed interstrand DNA-DNA and DNA-protein cross-links in cells. On the other hand, no DNA single-strand breaks were observed in the cells treated with FK317. In a cell-free system the deacetylated metabolites produced cross-linked DNA under reductive conditions, though FK317 itself did not form DNA-DNA cross-links. In order to elucidate the metabolic activation mechanisms, we established an FK317-resistant subline from human non-small cell lung cancer cells (Lu99) by stepwise and brief exposure (1 h) to FK317. The resistant subline (Lu99/317) showed cross-resistance to MMC and carboquone (CQ), but not to ADR or CDDP. DT-diaphorase, which is one of the activation enzymes of MMC and CQ, was deficient in Lu99/317 cells as determined by enzyme activity assay. However, the levels of NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase, which is another activation enzyme for MMC and CQ, were comparable in resistant and parent cell lines. Treatment of the cells with dicumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, reduced the cytotoxicity of FK317 to Lu99 cells, but not to Lu99/317 cells. These results indicate that deacetylation of FK317 is necessary for its reductive activation, and deacetylated FK317 is reduced by DT-diaphorase to form an active metabolite, which produces DNA-DNA interstrand and DNA-protein cross-links that lead to cell death.",,"['Naoe, Y', 'Inami, M', 'Kawamura, I', 'Nishigaki, F', 'Tsujimoto, S', 'Matsumoto, S', 'Manda, T', 'Shimomura, K']","['Naoe Y', 'Inami M', 'Kawamura I', 'Nishigaki F', 'Tsujimoto S', 'Matsumoto S', 'Manda T', 'Shimomura K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacological Research Laboratories, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Oxazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/14 00:00,1998/08/14 00:01,['1998/08/14 00:00'],"['1998/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505098800306 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb03269.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1998 Jun;89(6):666-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb03269.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Oxazines)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', '85J6JHT779 (FK 317 dihydrobenzoxazine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,PMC5921879,,,,,,

Disease activities were assessed and graded 0 to 4 according to the evaluation system. Recurrence of the disease during the follow-up period was diagnosed ophthalmologically. The provirus load was significantly higher in the HU patients after Graves' disease (GD) than in those without GD (P<0.05). It correlated with disease activities assessed in terms of vitreous inflammation and interval to recurrence (both P<0.05). In the HU patients without GD, it correlated with the serum levels of soluble IL-2 receptor (P<0.01), and nearly with those of HTLV-1 antibody (P=0.063).

Whereas in the absence of added ligands VBL transport was described by a hyperbolic function of vinblastine concentration, in the presence of 2-chlorpromazine vinblastine transport was a sigmoidal function. 2-Chlorpromazine was shown previously [Syed SK, Christopherson RI and Roufogalis BD (1996) Biochem Mol Biol Int 39: 687-696] to be actively transported into vesicles from multidrug-resistant cells. Colchicine (10 microM) and phenoxybenzamine (10 microM) blocked vinblastine transport but had no effect on 2-chlorpromazine transport into vesicles. The results were consistent with a two-state concerted model in which P-glycoprotein exists in two conformational states, P(A) and P(B), where 2-chlorpromazine is transported by the conformer, P(A), and vinblastine by the conformer, P(B). In the presence of 2-chlorpromazine, the conformer P(A) predominates and vinblastine transport is inhibited. Addition of 2-chlorpromazine during the steady state of vinblastine accumulation blocked uptake and resulted in enhanced vinblastine efflux from the vesicles. The findings were similar when vinblastine was added at the steady state of 2-chlorpromazine transport. We propose a minimal kinetic model whereby in these preloaded vesicles the complex VV.P(A).CC is formed, where two internal binding sites of P-glycoprotein (P(A)) are occupied by vinblastine (V) and the two external sites are occupied by 2-chlorpromazine (C). When the two binding sites on both the inside and outside of P-glycoprotein are saturated with ligands vinblastine is effluxed at a very rapid rate, and vice versa when vesicles are preloaded with 2-chlorpromazine and vinblastine is added outside. These unexpected observations and the concerted model developed provide an alternative mechanism of action for reversal agents that sensitize multidrug-resistant cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs.",,"['Syed, S K', 'Christopherson, R I', 'Roufogalis, B D']","['Syed SK', 'Christopherson RI', 'Roufogalis BD']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chlorpromazine/*pharmacology', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Phenoxybenzamine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*metabolism']",1998/08/14 00:00,1998/08/14 00:01,['1998/08/14 00:00'],"['1998/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.493 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Aug;78(3):321-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.493.,,"['0TTZ664R7Z (Phenoxybenzamine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",,,,PMC2063016,,,,,,

The lineage of the leukemia can be predicted based on characteristic morphologic and cytogenetic findings of the marrow and peripheral blood. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 3-year-old boy had refractory anemia with excess blasts and abnormalities suggestive of pre-AML with highly unusual cytogenetic changes. ALL of pre-B phenotype developed. RESULTS: Leukoerythroblastic anemia, pseudo Pelger-Huet neutrophils, and dysmyelopoietic hyperplasia of the marrow suggested likely early progression to AML. Complex cytogenetic abnormalities (monosomy 17 and 20, ring chromosome 11 with deletion of bands q23, and a derivative dicentric chromosome 12) were present in both the myelodysplastic marrow and the subsequent ALL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 33 pediatric patients with hematopoietic malignancies undergoing TBI in preparation for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the Children's Medical Center of Dallas between February 1992 and June 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Seventeen children received TBI in an outpatient setting, including 7 patients younger than 8 years of age. All patients had a good performance status (Karnofsky index > 90%) and lived or were housed within a 50-mile radius of the hospital. Patients received 1200 cGy or 1350 cGy in 8 or 9 fractions twice daily over 4 to 5 days and were admitted for high-dose chemotherapy after the last TBI fraction. Mean age was 9 years (range 13 months to 16 years). Close contact was maintained with the BMT staff during outpatient TBI. RESULTS: Eleven patients (65%) received oral ondansetron for nausea and vomiting, 6 received promethazine and ondansetron, and 3 required dexamethasone. Only 2 of the 17 children (12%) required admission during TBI for persistent vomiting and poor oral intake. Two other children (12%) required outpatient administration of intravenous fluids. The other 13 patients (76%) tolerated the outpatient TBI regimen well. Taking into account hospitalization and ambulance transport charges, outpatient TBI represented a savings of approximately $3250 per patient compared with inpatient TBI.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Criteria for inclusion were karyotypic or molecular rearrangement of chromosome band 11q23. Of the 40 cases, 31 occurred in infants. Twenty cases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 17 were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 3 were biphenotypic. RESULTS: Karyotype identified 27 cases with translocation of chromosome band 11q23 and 2 with abnormalities of band 11q13 but not 11q23. Southern blot analysis showed rearrangement within the MLL genomic bcr in 38 of the 40 cases. In these 38, additional probe-restriction digest combinations localized MLL genomic breakpoints to the 5' portion of the bcr in 14 cases and to the 3' portion in 18; material was insufficient for further localization to 5' or 3' within the bcr in 6 cases. In the two remaining cases, both with t(4;11)(q21;q23), one breakpoint mapped 5' of the bcr between intron 3 and exon 5, whereas the other breakpoint was neither within nor 5' of the MLL genomic bcr. CONCLUSIONS: Suggested trends warranting investigation in more patients were breakpoint sites in the 3' bcr in AML and in patients older than 12 months.

We investigated whether the T cell defect was qualitative in nature and associated with abnormalities of the early events occurring during cell activation. The proliferative response of lymphocytes from DS individuals after CD3 cross-linking was clearly depressed, as already reported. In contrast, phorbol ester and ionomycin were able to induce cell cycle progression in DS, suggesting a defect in the early stages of the signal transduction through a T cell receptor/CD3 (TCR/CD3) complex upstream of protein kinase C activation. The functional impairment in DS was not related either to a decrease of circulating mature-type CD3+ cells, which express high levels of surface of CD3 molecules, or to a decrease of the CD4+ subpopulation. The analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins after the cross-linking of CD3 molecules in DS lymphocytes revealed a partial signaling, characterized by increased phosphorylation of proteins of 42-44 kD, comparable to that observed in control subjects, but not of proteins of 70 and 21 kD. Moreover, although the ""anti-anergic"" gamma element of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 receptors was normally tyrosine-phosphorylated during cell activation, the CD3 zeta-associated protein kinase (ZAP-70) was not. Our results indicate that in DS there is a T cell activation defect, characterized by partial signal transduction through a TCR/CD3 complex, and associated with a selective failure of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation.",,"['Scotese, I', 'Gaetaniello, L', 'Matarese, G', 'Lecora, M', 'Racioppi, L', 'Pignata, C']","['Scotese I', 'Gaetaniello L', 'Matarese G', 'Lecora M', 'Racioppi L', 'Pignata C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Adolescent', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/enzymology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",1998/08/14 00:00,1998/08/14 00:01,['1998/08/14 00:00'],"['1998/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199808000-00019 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1998 Aug;44(2):252-8. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199808000-00019.,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,

IST-1 cells phenotypically resembled the implantation site intermediate trophoblastic cells in situ and expressed Mel-CAM (MUC 18 or CD146). Mel-CAM is a cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. It is involved in heterophilic cell-cell adhesion and plays a role in several biological processes including tumor progression. We have previously shown that Mel-CAM was highly expressed in the intermediate (extravillous) trophoblast in the human implantation site. In this study we determined the function of Mel-CAM in the interaction of trophoblast and uterine smooth muscle in the implantation site. IST-1 cells failed to adhere to immobilized recombinant Mel-CAM in solid phase whereas the uterine smooth muscle cells did. The presence of the putative Mel-CAM ligand in smooth muscle cells was further supported by the finding that Mel-CAM-transfected but not the mock-transfected U937 leukemia cells bind to the confluent monolayer of uterine smooth muscle cells. IST-1 cells attached efficiently to the monolayer of the uterine smooth muscle cells and acquired a spindle-shaped morphology simulating smooth muscle cells. The cell binding was only marginally affected by Mel-CAM blocking antibodies. However, Mel-CAM blocking antibodies and recombinant Mel-CAM promoted cell migration from IST-1 cell spheroids on the smooth muscle monolayer. Taken together, our results suggest that IST-1 cells express Mel-CAM but not the putative Mel-CAM ligand. In contrast, the uterine smooth muscle cells express the putative Mel-CAM ligand which binds to Mel-CAM on the surface of the IST-1 cells. The interaction between Mel-CAM and its putative ligand confers a stationary phenotype for trophoblastic cells. These observations are consistent with an important role for Mel-CAM in limiting trophoblastic migration within the myometrium in the implantation site.",,"['Shih, I', 'Wang, T', 'Wu, T', 'Kurman, R J', 'Gearhart, J D']","['Shih I', 'Wang T', 'Wu T', 'Kurman RJ', 'Gearhart JD']","['Department of Pathology, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. ishih@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Surface/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'CD146 Antigen', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryonic Development/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Muscle, Smooth/*cytology/physiology', '*Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterus/*cytology']",1998/08/14 00:00,1998/08/14 00:01,['1998/08/14 00:00'],"['1998/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1998 Sep;111 ( Pt 17):2655-64.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD146 Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MCAM protein, human)', '0 (Mcam protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",,,,,,,,,,

The pathophysiology of DIC is so varied that treatment with medications other than anticoagulants may be useful. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which is used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), improves DIC in APL. In vitro studies have reported that ATRA caused downregulation of tissue factor and upregulation of thrombomodulin (TM) on endothelial cells as well as APL cells. We examined the effect of ATRA in an endotoxin-induced rat DIC model. DIC was induced in male Wistar rats with a 4-h sustained infusion of endotoxin at a dose of 30 mg/kg. ATRA (20 mg/day) was given every day for 1 week before the injection of endotoxin. ATRA improved the increase in thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complex and D-dimer in this model.

Two classes of nuclear RA receptors, termed retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors, have already been identified. Each receptor class consists of three subtypes. We have used several synthetic retinoids to find which receptor subtypes are involved in the regulation of TM and TF expression in APL cells NB4, monoblastic leukemia cells U937, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Am80, which does not have a binding affinity to RARgamma; Ch55, which does not bind to cytoplasmic retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP); and a specific RARalpha agonist, Ro40-6055, have been shown to upregulate TM and downregulate TF in NB4 and U937 cells similar to all-trans RA (ATRA). A specific RARalpha antagonist, Ro41-5253, efficiently suppressed the upregulation of TM by ATRA and Am80 in NB4 cells, U937 cells and HUVECs. In contrast, only when both RARalpha and RARbeta antagonists were preincubated, downregulation of TF by the retinoids was suppressed in NB4 cells. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown to have anticoagulant effects on several monocytic leukemia cells and monocytes similar to RAs. These results indicate the mechanically distinct transactivation and transrepression functions of RARs, the major role of RARalpha in TM upregulation by retinoids in leukemic cells and HUVECs, and the cooperative role of RARalpha and RARbeta in TF downregulation by retinoids. It is also implied that synthetic retinoids and vitamin D derivatives will provide very useful means to control distinct targets--TM and TF genes--at the level of transcription. Synthetic retinoids and vitamin D derivatives may develop as new types of antithrombotic and antiatherosclerotic agents which change the character of cells as well as malignant cell differentiation inducers.",,"['Koyama, T', 'Hirosawa, S']","['Koyama T', 'Hirosawa S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,IM,"['Anticoagulants/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thrombomodulin/*metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/agonists/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1998/08/13 00:00,1998/08/13 00:01,['1998/08/13 00:00'],"['1998/08/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-995845 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 1998;24(3):217-26. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-995845.,,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,

The potential difficulty in recognizing the microgranular variant of APL (M3v) stems from the morphological characteristics of APL leukemic cells, which resemble monocytes. From 109 newly diagnosed acute leukemic patients, 48 were classified as AML and 16 of these patients (33%) had APL Mononuclear cells (MNC) of all APL patients were analyzed by flow cytometry for immunophenotypic features and forward and right angle scatter (FW-SC/RT-SC) light characteristics. Two clearly different FW-SC/RT-SC distribution patterns were recognized and defined as hypergranular (mature cells) and hypogranular (immature cells). Correlation between FW-SC/RT-SC patterns and the FAB system was poor: from eight patients classified as M3, six had the hypergranular pattern and two had the hypogranular pattern; from eight cases with M3, five and three patients had hypogranular and hypergranular patterns, respectively. The most relevant cellular immunophenotypic feature was the high frequency of CD34+ cases (5/7) recorded exclusively in patients with the hypogranular pattern. An interesting finding was that MNCs of all APL patients changed color from beige to green in the course of 3-4 h, whereas none of the 93 specimens of non-M3 acute leukemia cases showed this phenomenon.

These divergent results prompted us to conduct a retrospective analysis of two randomized clinical trials conducted at our center to determine the effect of i.v.Ig infusions on the development and severity of VOD. Patients were randomized to receive (n=318) or not to receive (n=315) i.v.Ig prophylaxis after human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling (n=414), mismatched or unrelated (n=178), or autologous or syngeneic (n=41) marrow transplantation. To determine the relationship of i.v.Ig to the development and severity of VOD, a single observer reviewed data displays created for each patient for grading VOD without knowledge of patient i.v.Ig use. In this analysis, VOD was defined as hyperbilirubinemia > or =2.0 mg/dL before day 20 and abrupt weight gain > or =2% before day 14 posttransplant in the absence of other causes of liver disease. Hepatic VOD developed in 235 (37%) of the 633 randomized patients. No evidence for VOD was found in 230 (36%) patients. The remaining 168 (27%) patients were classified as having liver disease of uncertain etiology. Hepatic VOD was judged to be severe in 63 (10%) and mild or moderate in 172 (27%) patients. The number of patients developing any VOD or severe VOD was similar between those randomized to i.v.Ig prophylaxis and untreated controls (115 vs. 120 and 32 vs. 31, respectively). Logistic regression models identified several covariates as significant (p < 0.01) factors associated with the development of severe VOD. Increased risk occurred with elevated pretransplant serum aspartate aminotransferase (odds ratio [OR] = 2.64) and earlier year of transplant (OR = 3.73); decreased risk occurred with autologous or twin donors (OR = 0.09) and acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 0.39).

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of unrelated marrow transplantation in older CML patients using a regimen designed to minimize the severity of GVHD. Thirty-one consecutive patients over the age of 40 with CML received unrelated marrow transplants between January 1988 and June 1997. Twenty-one patients were transplanted in chronic phase while ten were transplanted in the accelerated phase of their disease. Fifteen patients received transplants from phenotypically matched donors while 16 received marrow grafts from donors who were mismatched at one HLA locus. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of ex vivo T cell depletion of the donor marrow graft plus posttransplant cyclosporine administration. Durable engraftment was achieved in 29 of 31 patients (94%). The probability of developing grades II-IV or severe grades III-IV acute GVHD was 39.2 and 7.1%, respectively. There was no difference in the incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD between patients transplanted with marrow grafts from phenotypically matched (38.1%) vs. those transplanted from mismatched unrelated donors (40%, p = 0.99). The 2-year probability of relapse for the entire population was 29.4%. Relapse was significantly higher for patients transplanted in accelerated phase (60%) than for those in chronic phase (13.8%, p = 0.027). The 2-year probability of overall survival and disease-free survival for the entire cohort was 56 and 45%, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival or disease-free survival for patients receiving phenotypically matched vs. mismatched marrow grafts. Immunological reconstitution for this cohort was compared with a younger (<40 years) patient population that had been similarly transplanted over the same time period. Immune function as assessed by total T cell, B cell, NK cell, and T cell subset reconstitution posttransplant was quantitatively equivalent in the two groups with most parameters normalizing within 18 months of transplant. We conclude that CML patients over the age of 40 who have either phenotypically matched or one antigen-mismatched unrelated donors can successfully undergo allogeneic marrow transplantation.

To examine whether any of several proline-rich (PR) stretches of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail are necessary for ITK activation we introduced wild-type and mutated versions of rat CD2, each missing at least one PR stretch of the tail, into human Jurkat T leukemia cells. The influence of cytoplasmic tail mutations was then studied following stimulation of transfectants with the rat CD2 mAb pair, OX54/OX55. As predicted, wild-type rat CD2 was able to activate ITK in Jurkat cells. In addition, a truncation mutant, lacking the most membrane-distal PR stretch, PR6, was able to activate ITK. By contrast, all other studied truncation mutants, each of which is missing at least PR4-PR6, were unable to induce ITK activation. Of deletion mutants, deletion of the membrane-proximal PR stretches, PR1-PR3, did not impair rat CD2-mediated ITK activation. However, additional deletion of PR4 from a tail missing PR1 and PR2, deletion of PR2 and PR4, and deletion of PR4 alone from rat CD2 abrogated an ability to activate ITK. Thus, these results identify PR4 as an element of the CD2 tail that is required for activation of ITK. Furthermore, we show that, unlike wild-type rat CD2, PR4-deleted rat CD2 is unable to induce IL-2 secretion from Jurkat cells.

The percentage and number of BCHN at the diagnosis of AML were significant factors for the achievement of CR and for the prediction of long-term outcome.

All three N276 compounds almost completely reversed the acquired resistance to vincristine (VCR), vinblastine (VBL), and doxorubicin (DXR) in MDR1-overexpressing human cancer cell lines (KB/VJ300 and T24/VCR). Their reversal effect against acquired resistance to VCR, DXR, and etoposide (VP16) was partial but clearly observed in the cell line expressing MRP (KB/VP4). All three N276 compounds enhanced the intracellular accumulation of [3H]VCR in MDR1-overexpressing KB/VJ300 cells through the inhibition of the increased efflux of the drug.

All the N276 compounds also remarkably enhanced the sensitivity to VBL and DXR in both MDR1- and MRP-overexpressing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell line (NKK1), whereas they showed no potentiation of these anticancer agents in an RCC cell line (KPK1) expressing neither MDR1 nor MRP. The combination chemotherapy of VCR or VP16 with N276-12 significantly increased the life span of mice inoculated i.p. or i.v. with drug-resistant P388/VCR cells without any significant side effects, whereas chemotherapy with the anticancer agent alone did not increase the life span at all.

Peroneal nerves injected 5-8 days before with native or heated CSF of patients, besides extensive demyelination, presented proliferation of myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells, axonal sprouting, fine fibres with a few turns of myelin, disarray of nonmedullated bundles, desmosome-like junctions, and coated pits and vesicles in Schwann cells and axons. The normal CSF was innocuous to the nerve in its native form, but after heating, it induced a neuropathy in all, similar to that elicited by the CSF of patients.

Since the cloning of the A-T gene, ATM, in 1995, research on this pleiotropic disease and its molecular basis has expanded tremendously. ATM is a large protein kinase that appears to be one of the primary sensors of DNA strand-break damage. The vast majority of mutations in ATM result in truncation and destabilization of the protein, but certain missense and splicing errors have been shown to result in a less severe phenotype. A-T heterozygotes have been shown to have a slightly increased risk of cancer, but their increased in vitro radiosensitivity does not seem to result in any in vivo sensitivity. ATM does seem to act as a classic tumor suppressor gene in T-prolymphocytic leukemia, and LOH at the ATM locus is a common event in some tumor types, suggesting a general role for ATM in cancer. Recent work has shown the interaction of ATM with proteins involved in cell cycle control, and the direct phosphorylation of some of these interactors by ATM. ATM knockout mice have been created by several groups, and recapitulate the immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, cancer risk, and fertility defects of A-T, although the effect on the cerebellum is slight.

Analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 that have greater potency may become adjuvant therapy for breast and prostate cancers, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia in remission and other cell types, especially in the setting of low disease burden. A new class of analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 has been synthesized that has a novel 19-nor motif, as well as incorporating many structural elements previously shown to increase potency. These analogs were examined for their effects on prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, LNCaP, and DU 145), a human breast cell line (MCF-7), and an acute myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60). Dose-response clonogenic studies showed that each of these analogs had more potent antiproliferative activities against the cancer cells than 1,25(OH)2D3, and 1,25-(OH)2-16,23Z-diene-26,27-bishomo-19-nor-D3 (Ro 27-2014) was the most potent analog [10-fold increased activity compared to 1,25(OH)2D3]. Further studies were performed using Ro 27-2014. Pulse-exposure studies showed that a 5-day pulse-exposure to Ro 27-2014 (10(-7) M) in liquid culture was adequate to achieve a 50% inhibition of MCF-7 clonal growth in soft agar in the absence of the analog, suggesting that the growth inhibition mediated by the analog was irreversible. Cell cycle analyses using MCF-7 cells showed that Ro 27-2014 (10(-7) M for 4 days) induced a significant increase in the number of cells in G0-G1 (72.8+/-8.9% versus 49.9+/-3.5% in control cells), with a concomitant decrease in the percent of cells in S phase (13.1+/-6.2% versus 35.8+/-3.5% in control cells). The chief toxicity of vitamin D3 compounds is hypercalcemia, and therefore, we examined calcemic activity of Ro 27-2014 in mice and found it not to induce hypercalcemia at doses of 0.05 microg i.p. three times per week. In contrast, the same dose of a 19-nor vitamin D3 compound with 6 fluorines on the side chain (1,25-(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-26,27-F6-19-nor-D3), although also having potent anticancer activity, caused severe hypercalcemia (18 mg/dl). In summary, 19-nor vitamin D3 compounds with desaturation and lengthening of their side chains result in a series of compounds with a good therapeutic index, having potent anticancer activity and low toxicity.",,"['Kubota, T', 'Koshizuka, K', 'Koike, M', 'Uskokovic, M', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kubota T', 'Koshizuka K', 'Koike M', 'Uskokovic M', 'Miyoshi I', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/12 00:00,1998/08/12 00:01,['1998/08/12 00:00'],"['1998/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Aug 1;58(15):3370-5.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,

In vitro DNA binding site selection experiments have previously identified the preferred binding site for TAL1 heterodimers as AACAGATGGT. TAL1 homodimers do not bind DNA with significant affinity. A subset of other E-box sequences is also bound by TAL1 heterodimers. Here, we present an analysis of TAL1 heterodimer DNA binding specificity, using E-boxes derived from genomic clones, which were isolated by immunoadsorption of K562 erythroleukemia cell chromatin with a TAL1 antibody. We show that TAL1 heterodimer binding to a CAGATG E-box is strongly modulated by nucleotides flanking the E-box. A 10 base pair element consisting of the CAGATG E-box and two flanking nucleotides in both the 5' and 3' direction is sufficient for high-affinity binding. Certain mutations of nucleotides in either the 5' (-1 and -2) or 3' (+1 and +2) direction strongly inhibit binding. The importance of flanking nucleotides also exists in the context of nonpreferred E-boxes recognized by TAL1 heterodimers. Although there are no known target genes for TAL1, the regulatory regions of several genes involved in hematopoiesis contain the preferred E-box CAGATG. However, based on our results, the E-boxes in these potential target genes contain flanking sequences that would be expected to significantly reduce TAL1 heterodimer binding in vitro. Thus, additional stabilizing forces, such as protein-protein interactions between TAL1 heterodimers and accessory factors, may be required to confer high-affinity TAL1 heterodimer binding to such sequences.",,"['Gould, K A', 'Bresnick, E H']","['Gould KA', 'Bresnick EH']","['University of Wisconsin Medical School, Department of Pharmacology, Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gene Expr,Gene expression,9200651,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunosorbents', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/12 00:00,1998/08/12 00:01,['1998/08/12 00:00'],"['1998/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Expr. 1998;7(2):87-101.,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunosorbents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,PMC6190197,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that Tax stimulates HTLV-I transcription through recruitment of the cellular coactivator protein CBP to the HTLV-I promoter, promoting high-level viral replication via the transcriptional activation properties associated with CBP. Tax directly contacts the KIX domain of CBP to stably anchor the coactivator to nucleoprotein complexes at the promoter. Here, we identify KIX amino acid residues 588 to 683 as the minimal region sufficient for interaction with Tax. This region is similar to the minimal KIX amino acid residues necessary for strong interaction with phosphorylated CREB, and is composed of a structural domain that forms an extensive hydrophobic core. We further show that a double point mutation in KIX differentially affects the binding of Tax and phosphorylated CREB, suggesting that these transcription factors may recognize unique amino acid residues within the KIX domain. These observations suggest that Tax directly contacts the hydrophobic core of KIX, and provides a structural framework to further define the molecular interactions between Tax and CBP.",['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],"['Yan, J P', 'Garrus, J E', 'Giebler, H A', 'Stargell, L A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Yan JP', 'Garrus JE', 'Giebler HA', 'Stargell LA', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology']",1998/08/12 00:00,1998/08/12 00:01,['1998/08/12 00:00'],"['1998/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(98)91951-9 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1998.1951 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1998 Aug 21;281(3):395-400. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1998.1951.,"['CA-55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-56884/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,

It demonstrated that widely disseminated cancers can be eradicated with cytotoxic drugs, and it illustrated the power of systematic laboratory studies and randomized clinical trials applied to a single disease. As ALL cure rates edge towards 80%, several key challenges are apparent. First, it will be important to devise more effective therapies for the high-risk patients who continue to relapse on contemporary protocols. Second, better methods of disease assessment and treatment are needed to avoid relapses that still occur in so-called low- and intermediate-risk groups. Third, the persistence of late adverse effects due to radiation and certain genotoxic agents, such as the anthracycline compounds and the epipodophyllotoxins, mandates the development of alternative therapies that are both safe and effective in children. The International Childhood ALL Workshop, held 3-4 December 1997, at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, brought together leading experts in leukemia therapy to discuss progress in meeting these and other challenges, and to suggest directions for future studies.

In this study we present a simple modification of competitive Q-RT-PCR using natural competitors from cell lines K562 and BV173. The competitors were used in the form of unpurified RNA in cell lysates which ensured their high stability. Mixing competitors and samples before RNA extraction eliminated problems with quantification of cDNA or RNA entering the competitive reaction and with checking for the RNA quality and reverse transcription (RT) efficiency. The bulk of the malignant clone was expressed as the number of leukemic cells in 10(6) leukocytes when the overproduction of the BCR/ABL mRNA in the cell lines we used as competitors was taken into account. It was found to be 82-fold and 14-fold in K562 and BV173, respectively, in comparison with 100% Ph-positive CML standard. The assay reliability was verified by comparison of results with the mathematical model of competitive PCR. The assay is highly reproducible and sensitive (10(-5)). Its accuracy was proved to be excellent in a wide range of malignant cell concentrations. The method is demonstrated on three CML patients suffering from MRD after BMT. In conclusion, this method fulfills all criteria of competitive Q-RT-PCR.

B-lymphocytes having immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements identical to those of the malignant clone (clonally related B-lymphocytes) may function as malignant plasma cell precursors. We and others proposed the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies to isolate and study clonally related B-lymphocytes. This strategy failed until now because anti-idiotypic antibodies raised by conventional hybridoma techniques proved to react frequently with epitopes shared by different idiotypes. Recently, we succeeded in selecting specific single chain Fv antibodies from phage libraries. To select single chain Fv bearing phages specifically directed against the immunoglobulin idiotype expressed by myeloma tumor cells we panned a semisynthetic phage library against purified myeloma paraprotein Fab fragments. The selection was performed in the presence of soluble polyclonal immunoglobulin as a competitor. Three independent selections for three myeloma patients yielded 10-26 clones. Between two and seven of the selected clones were reactive with patient Fab and not with polyclonal immunoglobulin in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Five out of six anti-idiotypic single chain Fvs were able to specifically stain fixed monoclonal plasma cells in myeloma bone marrow. Idiotype specificity of these single chain Fvs was confirmed by flow cytometry since they did not react with monoclonal plasma cells of other patients, a panel of nine myeloma cell lines, isolated polyclonal bone marrow plasma cells and cultured B-lymphocytes. Using these anti-idiotypic reagents we were able to detect 25 myeloma plasma cells in a background of 50000 immunoglobulin isotype-matched cells of the myeloma cell line UM-1 or 50000 donor bone marrow cells (sensitivity 0.05%).

The lymphoma cells contained the monoclonal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) determined by the analysis of terminal repeat of EBV genome and expressed EBV nuclear antigen 2 and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). He received antineoplastic chemotherapy and was induced to complete remission (CR). After 19 months of CR, the lymphoma developed again in the thoracic wall. Histopathology and immunohistochemical phenotypes of recurrent tumor were almost the same as those of the primary tumor with the exception of a little more frequent expression of LMP1. The EBV genome in lymphoma cells was monoclonal, however, the clone was different from that of the primary tumor. After antineoplastic chemotherapy, minor EBV-positive clones in primary lymphoma might survive and develop into recurrent tumor.

We have addressed the participation of one of these inhibitors, p27Kip1, in the induction of differentiation and the subsequent G1 block induced in HL60 cells by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3). First, it was noted that sublines of HL60 cells able to grow rapidly in the presence of 1,25D3 have protein levels of p27Kip1 lower than the levels in cells subjected to 1,25D3-induced growth inhibition, but higher than in untreated parental cells. In contrast, there was no discernible relationship between the levels of p27Kip1 and the expression of differentiation markers. Further, HL60 cells treated with 1,25D3 and an oligonucleotide antisense, but not mismatched, to p27Kip1 showed an almost complete elimination of the 1,25D3-induced G1 block, but no decrease in the expression of differentiation markers. Similar results were obtained following transient transfection with an expression vector bearing the entire p27Kip1 coding sequence in the anti-sense orientation.

Medical Research Council Childhood Leukaemia Working Party.,1249-55,"Despite many years of meticulous immunophenotyping of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases the prognostic significance of some subtypes remains unclear. The Medical Research Council UKALLXI trial (1990-1996) in which uniform treatment has been given to 2090 children with ALL below the age of 18 years and above the age of 1 year, has afforded the opportunity to review these issues. Children with ALL of mature B cell type were not entered into this trial. Immunophenotype analysis was performed in each individual trial centre, but results were centrally reviewed in all cases, and were both available and considered adequate in 1934 (93%) of the first 2090 patients entered. The main diagnostic categories were early pre-B or null reported in 60 cases (3.1%), common ALL in 1242 (64.2%), pre-B in 252 (13.0%), 'common' or pre-B in 172 (8.9%) and T cell in 207 (10.7%) cases. Children with T cell disease were significantly more likely to be over the age of 10 years, with central nervous system disease at diagnosis and to be CD34 negative. They also had a higher incidence of high white cell count and were more likely to be of the French-American-British (FAB) L2 morphological subtype. Patients with 'null' cell disease tended to be less than 2 years or greater than 10 years of age, and CD13 and CD33 positive. CD10 was associated with lower white cell count (WBC) at diagnosis, younger age and FAB L1 morphological subtype. The presence of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin in pre-B cells was not associated with any specific clinical or laboratory features. CD34 positivity was less common in T cell patients and was associated with low WBC. Disease-free survival (DFS) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) at 5 years from diagnosis was 52% (95% CI: 44-59%) for T cell disease, 58% (95% CI: 43-73%) for early pre-B (or null cell) disease and 65% (95% CI: 62-68%) for common or pre-B disease; there being no significant difference between common and pre-B disease with regard to disease outcome. Patients with T cell disease had a worse prognosis than any other immunophenotype group (P < 0.00005). However this worse outcome was no longer significant after allowing for the other principal prognostic factors of age, gender and white cell count at diagnosis except for the very small number with WBC <20 x 10(9)/l and T cell disease. Those with CD10-positive leukaemia did better than those who were CD10 negative (P < 0.00005), with DFS at 5 years 64% (95% CI: 62-67%) for positive vs 56% (95% CI: 49-62%) for CD10 negative.

The present study was aimed to reveal mechanisms by which onconase perturbs the cell cycle progression. Human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells were treated with onconase and expression of cyclins D3 and E, as well as of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p16INK4A, p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 (all detected immunocytochemically) was measured by multiparameter flow cytometry, in relation to the cell cycle position. Also monitored was the status of phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by a novel method utilizing mAb which specifically detects underphosphorylated pRb in individual cells. Cell incubation with 170 nM onconase for 24 h and longer led to their arrest in G1 which was accompanied by a decrease in expression of cyclin D3, no change in cyclin E, and enhanced expression of all three CKIs. pRb was underphosphorylated in the onconase arrested G1 cells but was phosphorylated in the cells that were still progressing through S and G2/M in the presence of onconase. The cytostatic effect of onconase thus appears to be mediated by downregulation of cyclin D3 combined with upregulation of p27KIP1, p16INK4A and p21WAF1/CIP1, the events which may prevent phosphorylation of pRb during G0/1 and result in cell arrest at the restriction point controlled by Cdk4/6 and D type cyclins.",,"['Juan, G', 'Ardelt, B', 'Li, X', 'Mikulski, S M', 'Shogen, K', 'Ardelt, W', 'Mittelman, A', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Juan G', 'Ardelt B', 'Li X', 'Mikulski SM', 'Shogen K', 'Ardelt W', 'Mittelman A', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Egg Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/08/11 00:00,1998/08/11 00:01,['1998/08/11 00:00'],"['1998/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401100 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Aug;12(8):1241-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401100.,['CA RO1 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Egg Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'ZE15FIT23E (ranpirnase)']",,,,,,,,,,

Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an effective downmodulator of Pgp-related MDR in vitro and has already been tested for that purpose in vivo also. Since Pgp is expressed in several normal cells and tissues, the modulation of Pgp can also modify total body exposure to antileukemic drugs and can alter and increase the toxicity of the antileukemic treatment. We report here the results of a study where 46 consecutive adult patients with ANLL were assigned to receive the same standard chemotherapy regimen of arabinosyl cytosine and idarubicin (IDA) for remission induction or consolidation, without or with CsA. Twenty-eight patients received 36 courses of chemotherapy without CsA and 18 patients received 32 courses of chemotherapy with CsA. CsA dose was 10-12.5 mg/kg/day and was given as a continuous i.v. infusion for 72 h. Whole blood CsA steady-state concentration ranged between 0.61 and 1.14 microM. The IDA area-under-the-curve was about twice as high in the cases that received CsA than in the other cases. CsA had no detectable effects on renal function and fluid balance, but significantly increased systemic blood diastolic pressure and conjugated bilirubine concentration. Furthermore, CsA-treated patients had greater, and more severe, oral and intestinal mucosal toxicity, with more severe adverse events, including more cases of gram-negative bacteremia, and with a delayed hemopoietic recovery. In conclusion, this study showed that an attempt at an effective downmodulation of Pgp-mediated MDR would substantially increase the hemopoietic and mucosal toxicity of antileukemic treatment and that the increase is accounted for, at least in part, by an increase of total body exposure to IDA.",,"['Damiani, D', 'Michieli, M', 'Ermacora, A', 'Russo, D', 'Fanin, R', 'Zaja, F', 'Baraldo, M', 'Pea, F', 'Furlanut, M', 'Baccarani, M']","['Damiani D', 'Michieli M', 'Ermacora A', 'Russo D', 'Fanin R', 'Zaja F', 'Baraldo M', 'Pea F', 'Furlanut M', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Clinical and Morphologic Research, Udine University Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/08/11 00:00,1998/08/11 00:01,['1998/08/11 00:00'],"['1998/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401092 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Aug;12(8):1236-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401092.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of exogenous cytokines, umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) efficiently support proliferation of hematopoietic cells and generation of colony-forming cells (CFC). Cytokines (IL-6, LIF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, but not IL-1, IL-3, IL-7) were detected in HUVEC coculture supernatants. Neutralization of these cytokines profoundly inhibited the ability of EC supernatants to support the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors and led to an accumulation of immature cells. Contact cocultures were significantly more efficient than non-contact cocultures. The expanded cell population essentially belonged to the myeloid and monocytic lineages. Contact cocultures generated cells expressing the CD61 or CD41 antigens. Interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) augmented EC capacity to support hematopoiesis, this property resulting from the upregulation of cytokine expression. Glucocorticoids (GC) reduced this capacity by downregulating the biosynthesis of cytokines by EC and not by a direct effect on the progenitor cells.

The ability to enhance lysis of AML cells without the toxicity of IL-2 would be a significant improvement in the use of biologics against AML. Recent interest in IL-12 suggested that this cytokine might meet these criteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of IL-12 to enhance the in vitro lysis of the non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines in a standard 51Chromium release assay. Effector cells from normal volunteers were incubated with varying concentrations of IL-12 or IL-2 for 18-20 h, then the 51Cr-labeled target cells from five different cell lines of AML origin were added for 4 h. Percent lysis was determined and plotted over four effector:target (E:T) ratios. Our results indicated that IL-12 was able to enhance lysis of all cell lines tested at > or =5 units/ml. When IL-2 was added to the culture at a low dose along with IL-12, there appeared to be a synergistic effect. Although anti-gamma interferon was able to inhibit the cytolytic potential of effectors activated by IL-12, the lysis could not be completely blocked. Thus, it appears that IL-12 has the ability to stimulate NK lysis indirectly through the induction of gamma interferon as well as an alternate mechanism not related to gamma interferon.

Recently, a role has been assigned to HGF/SF and its receptor, c-MET, in both normal and malignant hemopoiesis. We investigated the function of HGF/SF on hemopoietic mononuclear cells (MNC) from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with circulating blasts. In contrast to results with normal MNC, HGF/SF alone stimulated the proliferation and colony formation of MNC from these patients. MNC from some (4/13) of the AML patients also produced HGF/SF (0.1-0.2 ng/ml/day), while we could not detect HGF/SF in cultures from normal MNC. Furthermore, it appeared that HGF/SF induced migration of leukemic cells in Boyden using KG1a cells as a model for leukemic blasts. The membranes dividing the two compartments of the Boyden chambers were coated with fibronectin. HGF/SF significantly promoted migration in 3/5 samples of MDS patients and in 5/7 samples of AML patients. Supernatant of human BM stromal cells, which is chemoattractive for normal human hemopoietic progenitor cells, also promoted migration of MNC from 4/5 MDS patients and 6/7 AML patients. Since HGF/SF is one of the growth factors produced by BM stromal cells, a neutralizing antibody directed against HGF/SF was added to the BM stroma supernatant, which reduced migration significantly in 2/3 MDS and in 3/6 AML responders to BM stroma supernatant. In conclusion, HGF/SF promotes proliferation and migration of hemopoietic cells from AML and MDS patients in vitro and may therefore contribute to the malignant potential of these cells.",,"['Weimar, I S', 'Voermans, C', 'Bourhis, J H', 'Miranda, N', 'van den Berk, P C', 'Nakamura, T', 'de Gast, G C', 'Gerritsen, W R']","['Weimar IS', 'Voermans C', 'Bourhis JH', 'Miranda N', 'van den Berk PC', 'Nakamura T', 'de Gast GC', 'Gerritsen WR']","['Division of Immunology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",1998/08/11 00:00,1998/08/11 00:01,['1998/08/11 00:00'],"['1998/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401080 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Aug;12(8):1195-203. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401080.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of an empty bone marrow, clinical distinction from aplastic anemia may be difficult. The hypoplastic marrow morphology seen in some cases of MDS raises questions about etiologic and pathophysiologic relationships between aplastic anemia and MDS. The goal of our study was to compare the degree of the hematopoietic failure in these diseases at the level of the most immature progenitor and stem cells that can be measured in vitro. In a systemic, prospective fashion, we have studied bone marrow (n = 45) and peripheral blood (n = 33) of patients with MDS for the number of long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) in comparison to 17 normal controls and patients with new, untreated aplastic anemia (46 marrow; 62 blood samples). Due to the low numbers of cells available for the analysis, formal limiting dilution analysis could not be performed, instead secondary colony-forming cells (CFC) after 5 weeks of LTBMC were measured. As the number of these cells is proportional to the input number of LTC-IC, the number of secondary CFC per 10(6) mononuclear cells (MNC) initiating the LTBMC can be used as a measure of the content of immature stem cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood. The MDS group consisted of 34 RA, three RARS, eight RAEB and two RAEB-T patients with mean absolute neutrophil values of 1992, 1413, 1441, and 380 per mm3, respectively. The diagnosis was established based on bone marrow morphology and results of cytogenetic studies. In comparison to controls (147 +/- 38/10(6) MNC), significantly decreased numbers of bone marrow secondary CFC were found in MDS: in patients with RA and RARS, 21 +/- 7 secondary CFC per 10(6) bone marrow MNC (P < 0.001); patients with RAEB and RAEB-T: 39 +/- 12 CFC per 10(6) marrow MNC (P < 0.001). In all groups tested, the decrease in peripheral blood secondary CFC numbers was consistently less pronounced. In MDS patients with hypocellular bone marrow, secondary CFC were lower but not significantly different in comparison to MDS with hypercellular marrow (18 +/- 6 vs 35 +/- 11; NS; hypoplastic bone marrow also was not associated with significantly lower neutrophil counts). However, in 24% of patients with MDS, bone marrow secondary CFC were within the normal range, while in the aplastic anemia group only one of the patients showed secondary CFC number within normal range. Bone marrow and blood secondary CFC numbers in hypoplastic RA were significantly higher than those in severe aplastic anemia 919 +/- 5 in bone marrow, P < 0.01; 7 +/- 2 in blood, P < 0.05). This trend was even more pronounced in hypoplastic RA with chromosomal abnormalities. However, no significant differences were found between the secondary CFC numbers in hypoplastic RA and moderate aplastic anemia. We concluded that, although the deficiency in the stem cell compartment is less severe in MDS than in aplastic anemia, depletion of early hematopoietic cells is an essential part of the pathophysiology in both diseases.",,"['Sato, T', 'Kim, S', 'Selleri, C', 'Young, N S', 'Maciejewski, J P']","['Sato T', 'Kim S', 'Selleri C', 'Young NS', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/complications/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Methylcellulose', 'Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1998/08/11 00:00,1998/08/11 00:01,['1998/08/11 00:00'],"['1998/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401084 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Aug;12(8):1187-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401084.,,['9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)'],,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that they lack type-II binding receptors (T beta RII) and in this respect resemble the inner cell mass and ectoderm cells of mouse embryos 4.5-7.5 days post coitum (dpc); they do however express type-I (alk-5) signalling receptors. Here we show that in contrast to several tumour cell lines, stable transfection of wtT beta RII is not sufficient for ES cells to become biologically sensitive to TGF beta. We analysed the expression of several down-stream molecules known to be involved in TGF beta signalling (Smads) and TGF beta-mediated cell cycle regulation (cyclins D) during the differentiation of control and wtT beta RII-expressing ES cells and showed that upregulation of these molecules correlated with (i) an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) synthesis and (ii) growth inhibition, following addition of TGF beta 1. These TGF beta responses were reduced in an ES cell line expressing a dominant negative (truncated) T beta RII (delta T beta RII). The differentiation pattern of control and wtT beta RII-expressing ES cells was indistinguishable in monolayer culture and as embryoid bodies, but in delta T beta RII ES cells, the capacity to form mesodermal derivatives in monolayer cultures in response to the addition of retinoic acid (RA) and removal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was lost, and only endoderm-like cells formed. The T beta RII and delta T beta RII ES cells were, however, both distinguishable from control ES cells when allowed to differentiate in chimaeric embryos following aggregation with morula-stage hosts. Conceptuses containing mutant cells, recovered from pseudopregnant females at the equivalent of 9.5 dpc, exhibited highly defective yolk sac development; most strikingly, no blood vessels were present and in addition the yolk sacs with derivatives of ES cells containing wtT beta RII were blistered and lacked haematopoietic cells.

To determine whether their envelope glycoproteins function similarly and to define the molecular determinants of HTLV-2 envelope-mediated functions, we have used pseudotyped viruses and have introduced mutations into regions of the HTLV-2 glycoproteins homologous to those known to be important for HTLV-1 glycoprotein functions. The envelopes of the two viruses could be exchanged with no loss of infectivity, suggesting that the glycoproteins function in broadly similar ways. However, comparative analysis of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 glycoproteins showed subtle differences in the structure-function relationships of the two surface glycoprotein (SU) subunits, even though they recognize the same receptor. Indeed, mutations introduced at equivalent positions in the two SU glycoproteins resulted in different phenotypes in the two viruses. The scenario is the opposite for the transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) subunits, in which the functional domains of the two viruses are strictly conserved, confirming the involvement of the TM ectodomain in postfusion events required for full infectivity of the HTLVs. Thus, although they recognize the same receptor, the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 SU subunits have slightly different ways of transducing the conformational information that primes a common fusion mechanism effected by similar TM subunits.",,"['Rosenberg, A R', 'Delamarre, L', 'Preira, A', 'Dokhelar, M C']","['Rosenberg AR', 'Delamarre L', 'Preira A', 'Dokhelar MC']","['INSERM U332, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, 22 rue Mechain, 75014 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.9.7609-7614.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Sep;72(9):7609-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.9.7609-7614.1998.,,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', '0 (human T-cell leukemia virus type-II protein gp21)']",,,,PMC110017,,,,,,

Long PCR with primers located in long terminal repeats clearly demonstrated that almost the complete provirus was retained in all of 27 cattle with lymphomas and in 19 infected but healthy cattle.

These results provide direct evidence for how FeLV-B species evolve in vivo from FeLV-A and present a new experimental approach for efficient induction of thymic tumors in cats, which should be useful for the study of retroviral lymphomagenesis in this outbred species.",,"['Chen, H', 'Bechtel, M K', 'Shi, Y', 'Phipps, A', 'Mathes, L E', 'Hayes, K A', 'Roy-Burman, P']","['Chen H', 'Bechtel MK', 'Shi Y', 'Phipps A', 'Mathes LE', 'Hayes KA', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', '*DNA, Viral', 'Dogs', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.9.7048-7056.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Sep;72(9):7048-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.9.7048-7056.1998.,"['R01 CA051485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)']",,,,PMC109925,['GENBANK/AF052723'],,,,,

By a forced recombination approach based on the transduction of Akv murine leukemia virus vectors harboring a primer binding site knockout mutation and the entire 5' untranslated region, we studied recombination between two closely related naturally occurring retroviral sequences. On the basis of 24 independent template switching events within a 481-nucleotide target sequence containing multiple sequence identity windows, we found that shifting from vector RNA to an endogenous retroviral RNA template during minus-strand DNA synthesis occurred within defined areas of the genome and did not lead to misincorporations at the crossover site. The nonrandom distribution of recombination sites did not reflect a bias for specific sites due to selection at the level of marker gene expression. We address whether template switching is affected by the length of sequence identity, by palindromic sequences, and/or by putative stem-loop structures. Sixteen of 24 sites of recombination colocalized with the kissing-loop dimerization region, and we propose that RNA-RNA interactions between palindromic sequences facilitate template switching. We discuss the putative role of the dimerization domain in the overall structure of the reverse-transcribed RNA dimer and note that related mechanisms of template switching may be found in remote RNA viruses.",,"['Mikkelsen, J G', 'Lund, A H', 'Duch, M', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Mikkelsen JG', 'Lund AH', 'Duch M', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA, Viral', 'Dimerization', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Kanamycin Kinase/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*RNA, Messenger', '*RNA, Viral', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.9.6967-6978.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Sep;72(9):6967-78. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.9.6967-6978.1998.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",,,,PMC109916,['GENBANK/AF041383'],,,,,

Besides differences in the effects on Fc epsilonRI receptor-stimulated exocytosis, changes were also observed in Ca2+ influx and in the perturbation of the cell membrane. A strong correlation was found between the effects on antigen- and thapsigargin-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, the inhibition of 45Ca2+ influx was correlated with the inhibition of beta-hexosaminidase release and membrane stabilization. It is concluded that the astemizole analogues are capable of inhibiting mast cell beta-hexosaminidase release through inhibition of Ca2+-store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC). Compounds with high lipophilicity also released Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Lowering of the hydrophobicity by introduction of nitrogens or truncation at different sites in the astemizole structure decreased inhibitory activity on SOC channels. The inhibition of SOC channels cannot completely be ascribed to non-specific membrane effects. The piperidinyl-benzimidazole moiety was found to be important for inhibition of SOC channels. The observed differences in activity possibly depend on the way the compounds penetrate the membrane bilayer.

The experiments were designed as a complete factorial combination of treatments and used chemiluminescence as a marker of cell oxidative burst (level of differentiation). It was clearly demonstrated that two structurally different inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase metabolism, i.e., 3-[1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-3-t-butyl-thio-5-isopropylindol-2-yl]-2,2-di methyl propanoic acid (MK-886) and esculetin, significantly potentiated the HL-60 cell differentiation induced by retinoic acid or DMSO. Detailed mathematical evaluation of the results revealed the synergistic character of the interaction. The most significant effects were achieved with a combination of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and low doses of retinoic acid. These results were confirmed by analysis of cell morphology and expression of cell surface antigen CD11b after treatment of the cells with selected concentrations of agents. In contrast to those on differentiation, no additional effects of MK-886 or esculetin on cell proliferation (cell number and cell cycle parameters) and apoptosis were observed. An inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, indomethacin, affected neither cell proliferation nor differentiation of cells.

Diagnosis is best established by the demonstration of malignant cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, in patients with known cancer, MR scan with gadolinium may be diagnostic when subarachnoid nodules can be demonstrated in the head or spine. Therapy usually involves radiotherapy to symptomatic sites, often followed by intrathecal chemotherapy. Intrathecal chemotherapy is best delivered by an intraventricular reservoir system but can also be delivered by repeated lumbar puncture. Methotrexate, cytarabine and thiotepa are the most common agents instilled into the subarachnoid space. Their limited efficacy can be explained by their restricted spectrum of antitumor activity. Patients with leptomeningeal metastasis from leukemia, lymphoma or breast cancer tend to respond best and this may, in part, be attributed to the relative sensitivity of these primary tumor types to the agents administered intrathecally. Systemic chemotherapy may prove a more attractive alternative to intrathecal drugs since it can penetrate into bulky disease, reach all areas of the subarachnoid space, and not be restricted by CSF bulk flow.

Selection of MAbs was based on immunoreactivity with patients' tumour and lack of binding to normal central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Following full clinical assessment and neuro-imaging which included isotope flow study of CSF pathways, (131)I-MAb was administered via a ventricular access device, lumbar catheter or both. Radioisotope activity varied from 25 mCi to 160 mCi in adults. Dose escalation was carried out and some patients received multiple doses. Distribution of (131)I-MAb and clearance kinetics were derived from serial scintigraphy and CSF/blood sampling. Evidence of localisation to tumour was frequently observed. Toxicity was minimal and easily treated, although one death occurred, possibly due to a seizure. The best results were obtained in primitive neuroectodermal tumour (n=22), where 53% of evaluable cases had responses and 11% had stable disease, adults responding better than children. Three exceptional survivals have been recorded; one patient leads a normal life at 10 years 11 months, one case is alive and normal at 3 years, 2 months.

CSF therapy with (131)I-MAb appears to be valuable as a single agent or when used in combination with other modalities.

At the time of diagnosis meningeosis leukaemica is present in about 6% (1-10%) of the adult ALL patients with a higher incidence in ALL subgroups T-ALL (8%) and B-ALL (13 %). With the invention of early additional CNS directed therapy it no longer represents an unfavourable prognostic factor. In the absence of prophylaxis meningeal relapses occur in approximately one third of adults with ALL. A literature review including more than 4000 adult ALL patients showed for the different prophylactic treatment approaches the following CNS relapse rates: intrathecal therapy alone 13% (8-19%), intrathecal therapy and CNS irradiation 15% (6-22%), high dose chemotherapy 14% (10-16%), high dose chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy 8% (2-16%) and high dose chemotherapy, intrathecal therapy together with CNS irradiation 5% (1-12%). It became obvious that the early onset of intrathecal therapy and CNS irradiation and the continuation of intrathecal administrations throughout maintenance are essential. The most favourable results where achieved with high dose chemotherapy combined with intrathecal therapy and/or CNS irradiation.

Especially due to the long-term toxicity of CRT, reduction or elimination of radiotherapy appeared mandatory after cure rates of more than 70% had been achieved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several large clinical trials of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) Study Group with more than 3500 patients since 1981 have demonstrated that intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy without or with limited CRT can efficiently prevent central nervous system (CNS) relapses in a large percentage of patients. However, only in low-risk patients prophylactic radiotherapy can be completely and safely replaced by conventional doses of methotrexate. In addition, reduction of chemotherapy in low-risk ALL increased the rate of relapses with CNS involvement. Thus, only a combination of multidrug induction, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) consolidation, and reintensification allowed safe elimination of CRT in low-risk ALL. This approach combined with CRT with 12Gy and 18 Gy in medium and high risk ALL, respectively, reduced the incidence of relapses with CNS involvement to less than 5% (trial ALL-BFM 86). Patients with inadequate response to therapy, or with T-cell ALL, or with overt CNS disease are at particularly high risk for relapse with CNS involvement, and require more systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy combined with cranial irradiation. In B-cell ALL, short intensive chemotherapy pulses including HD-MTX could completely replace radiotherapy. In AML, post-consolidation CRT appears to be advantageous with regard to control of extramedullary as well as systemic relapses.",,"['Schrappe, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Riehm, H']","['Schrappe M', 'Reiter A', 'Riehm H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1005903414734 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 1998 Jun-Jul;38(2-3):159-65. doi: 10.1023/a:1005903414734.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,

After more than ten years experience, the combination of MRI with the administration of a paramagnetic contrast medium is now accepted as the method of choice for the sensitive detection of meningeal diseases and for monitoring their treatment. The almost uniform character of leptomeningeal or pachymeningeal enhancement in the presence of infective, inflammatory, neoplastic, vascular or reactive changes is the reason for the restricted specificity of MRI, so that with the imaging process alone only very limited information about the etiology is available. Clinical data, laboratory findings, examination of the CSF and histopathological examination are therefore essential for interpreting the meningeal changes and making a differential diagnosis. Various pathophysiological processes can lead to a single meningeal enhancement visualizable with MRI: 1. a genuine disturbance of the blood-brain barrier is found in the presence of infection or inflammation, 2. leptomeningeal structures can be directly infiltrated by sheets or nodules of tumors, the blood vessels of which possess no intact blood-brain barrier, 3. physical or chemical irritants may produce of local inflammatory reaction with vascular proliferation and its corresponding enhancement, a 4. a pseudoenhancement may follow reactive dilatation of the vessels.

To surpass the embryonic lethality in dissecting the Shp-2 function in cell growth and differentiation, we established homozygous Shp-2 mutant embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. Our previous data showed a severe suppression of hematopoietic cell differentiation from Shp-2 mutant ES cells. Here we demonstrate that development of cardiac muscle cells was dramatically delayed and impaired in embryoid bodies (EBs) of Shp-2 mutant origin. Shp-2 mutant ES cells failed to differentiate into epithelial and fibroblast cells in vitro. However, higher efficiency of secondary EB formation was observed from the mutant than the wild-type ES cells. Further, mutant ES cells were more sensitive than wild-type cells to the differentiation suppressing effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In addition, mutant ES cells showed a reduced growth rate compared to wild-type cells.

The effect of the drug was measured by subsequent colony formation of surviving HL60 cells in vitro and flow cytometry. The number of clonogenic HL60 cells was reduced in the bone marrow of mice that received simvastatin compared with control mice by 65% and 68% in two separate experiments. The number of clonogenic, normal, murine, bone marrow progenitor cells concomitantly exposed to simvastatin in vivo, was not affected in either experiment. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow and spleen cells confirmed these results by showing that simvastatin had reduced the percentage of human leukaemia cells in these tissues by 70% and 88% respectively. The data show that the reported selective effect of simvastatin against acute myeloid leukaemia cells in vitro, can be extended to this in vivo model. HL60 bears an N-ras mutation. In further in vitro studies, ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis post farnesyl pyrophosphate synthesis, had a similar effect to simvastatin on HL60 colony development. Furthermore, the clonogenicity of a population of N-ras mutated, primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells was no more sensitive to simvastatin than a population without the mutation.

All patients, except one with RA, had predominance of a single clone in their granulocytes and monocytes. The same clonal pattern was found in CD34+ progenitor cells. In contrast, CD3+ T lymphocytes were polyclonal or oligoclonal in 14/18 patients. X-chromosome inactivation patterns of CD19+ B cells were highly concordant with CD3+ T cells except for two patients (one RA, one CMML) with monoclonal B and polyclonal T lymphocytes, therefore suggesting a clonal mutation in a progenitor common to the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages or the coexistence of MDS and a B-cell disorder in these particular patients. After high-dose non-myeloablative chemotherapy, polyclonal haemopoiesis was reinstalled in the mature myeloid cells and immature and committed marrow progenitors in three of four patients achieving complete haematological remission.

Its expression in factor-dependent murine haemopoietic precursor cells efficiently converted these cells to factor independence for both survival and growth. These cells continued to express high levels of myc mRNA after growth factor depletion. We also demonstrated that type A TEL/ABL self-associated in stably expressing haemopoietic cells.

Here we have investigated how the development and progression of this leukaemia affect oxygenation, pH and proliferation of normal and leukaemic cells in vivo. Bone marrow pH was measured by a needle electrode. Nitroimidazol-theophylline (NITP) was used to identify hypoxic cells, and we applied bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) to identify DNA replicating cells. The leukaemia progressed slowly until day 27 after which a rapid deterioration could be observed leading to severe changes over the following 5 d. In whole blood there was evidence of progressing metabolic acidosis. In bone marrow the fraction of leukaemic cells increased to > 90% and the pH dropped to about 6.5. The fraction of NITP+ cells increased to > 80% in bone marrow and to about 40% in blood. The fraction of BrdUrd+ cells was unchanged in blood, but decreased in bone marrow both for normal cells (from about 20% to 5%), and for leukaemic cells (from about 45% to 25%), evidently as a result of the severely changed microenvironment.

It has been suggested that TAL1 transcription occurs in approximately 50% of a T-ALLs without apparent rearrangement. SIL-TAL1 was positive in 15/60 (25%) of T-ALL, whereas wild-type TAL1 transcripts were detected in all 13 SIL-TAL1 and in 19/43 (44%) T-ALL without SIL-TAL1. To investigate the cellular origin of TAL1 we exploited the fact that GATA1 and TAL1 are co-ordinately expressed in non-lymphoid haemopoietic cells, whereas only the latter is found in T-ALL. GATA1 was detected in 10/23 (43%) TAL1-negative T-ALLs but in 17/19 (89%) 'unexplained' TAL1-positive cases, suggesting a common non-lymphoid cellular origin.

In the remaining cases TAL1 expression was restricted to a minor population (< 5%) of larger, strongly TAL1-positive cells which comprised erythroid cells, CD34+ CD3- precursors and an unidentified TAL1+ CD45- population which morphologically resembled monocytes/macrophages.

We assessed drug tolerance based on haematological toxicity and measured erythrocyte (RBC) concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides (TGN). The median tolerated dose of TG was 30 mg/m2 compared to 55 mg/m2 for MP. There was no difference in the pattern of anaemia or neutropenia between the two groups, but dose-limiting thrombocytopenia was more evident in the TG children (P< 0.001), four of whom had a decrease in platelet count to <20 x 10(9)/l compared to only one on MP. The median RBC TGN concentration for those on 40 mg/m2 TG was 1726 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs compared with 308 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs for those on 75 mg/m2 MP (P< 0.0001). There was an inverse correlation between RBC TGNs and neutrophil count in the MP group but not in those on TG. No correlation between metabolite concentration and thrombocytopenia was found in either group. These results provide further evidence that TG has a selective effect on platelets. They also showed that RBC TGN were, on average, 5-fold higher in those taking TG but did not obviously relate to myelotoxicity as found in children on MP. The higher concentrations seen may partly reflect the erythrocyte's ability to metabolize TG directly to TGN by pathways not open to MP.",,"['Lancaster, D L', 'Lennard, L', 'Rowland, K', 'Vora, A J', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Lancaster DL', 'Lennard L', 'Rowland K', 'Vora AJ', 'Lilleyman JS']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Neutrophils', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00812.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Jul;102(2):439-43. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00812.x.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,

In this case, the long-term administration of G-CSF may have played an important role in the transformation of MDS into AML. It may be difficult to strictly distinguish AA from hypoplastic MDS with slight dysplastic features, as in this case, because we have no established criteria. Recently the incidence of MDS/AML in AA patients undergoing G-CSF treatment has become a concern.

A volume of 50-141 ml of cord blood containing 27-197 x 10(7) nucleated cells was collected from sibling infants soon after delivery. HLA antigens were identical in 14 and one to three antigens mismatched in four. Engraftment of donor cord blood was achieved in 17 cases. Autologous hematopoiesis was recovered in one case. Days of engraftment were 13-29 days (median 19 days) for neutrophils (500/microliter), 18-67 days (median 30 days) for reticulocytes (2%) and 21-96 days (median 46 days) for platelets (50 x 10(3)/microliter). Acute GVHD was grade 0 in seven cases, grade I in five cases and grade II in one case in HLA-identical pairs, but became grade II in two cases and grade III in two cases in HLA-mismatched pairs. Chronic GVHD of limited type developed in two out of 17 evaluable cases, however both responded to immunosuppressive therapy. Altogether, 14 out of 18 patients are currently surviving 4-27 months following transplantation. Probabilities of overall survival and disease free survival were estimated to be 77.0 and 71.8% using Kaplan-Meier tests.

The study of antibody binding capacity, which was calculated by the mean fluorescence intensity of the test sample on the basis of a calibration curve using standard beads, showed that cases with more than 150 sites/cell could be positive.

Simultaneous expression of transcriptional factors, GATA-2 and SCL, was frequently detected in the Thy-1+ cases. bcr-abl and GATA-2 are thought to play important roles in the proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells. Indeed, cell-cycle analysis showed that the cell population in the S/G2/M phase of the present Thy-1+ cases was less than that in the Thy-1- cases (p = 0.001770).

Some homeobox genes, located in four clusters are designated HOX A through D, while others are known as divergent homeobox genes. Many researchers have demonstrated that hematopoietic cells express many homeobox genes. Induced over- and under-expression of these genes has been used to demonstrate their affect on some aspects of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Recently, knock-out mice of homeobox genes by targeted disruption have also been used to examine their hematological effect. There are examples of the aberrant expression of a homeobox gene causing leukemias in humans.

In T-cell ALL with t(10;14) translocation, the HOX 11 gene is deregulated. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(7;11) translocation, the HOX A9 gene is rearranged. In this review article, many functions of homeobox genes both at the early stem cell level as well as at the later stages of hematopoietic differentiation, and the leukemogenic effect of altered homeobox genes are discussed.",,"['Shimamoto, T', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Toyama, K', 'Takeshita, K']","['Shimamoto T', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Toyama K', 'Takeshita K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan. takashis@cb3.so-net.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Species Specificity', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571098000243 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00024-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1998 Jun;67(4):339-50. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00024-3.,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",113,,,,,,,,,

In the case of fever > 38 degrees C 48 h after initiation of the antibiotic therapy, vancomycin 500 mg every 6 h i.v. was added. The study population was at serious risk of a poor outcome, since 67% of the patients had leukemia or lymphoma, 19% of the febrile events occurred after autologous bone marrow or blood stem cell transplantation, the median total duration of neutropenia was 16 days, and the median neutrophil count at study inclusion was 0.09 x 10(9)/1. The two patient groups were comparable in terms of risk factors. Bacteremia was found in 37%, other microscopically documented infections in 16%, and clinically documented infections in 26% of the febrile episodes. Most (96) febrile episodes were evaluable for response. No significant difference was found between piperacillin/ tazobactam and ceftazidime plus amikacin in terms of success rate (81% versus 83%), empirical addition of vancomycin (42% versus 38%), median time to fever defervescence (3.3 versus 2.9 days) or median duration of antibiotic therapy (7.2 versus 7.4 days). No patient died from the infection. Both antibiotic regimens were well tolerated, the study treatment being stopped only in 1 patient because of toxicity (cutaneous allergy to piperacillin/tazobactam). On the basis of the 107 febrile events encountered, we conclude that piperacillin/tazobactam is a safe and effective monotherapy.

Caspase 3 activation is primarily the result of the direct action of granzyme B.,21261-6,"Cytototoxic T lymphocyte-induced apoptosis can occur either through the directed exocytosis of granzyme B and perforin or via ligation of Fas. Both pathways involve the activation of a family of cysteine proteinases, the caspases, that cleave substrates at aspartic acid and are themselves activated by cleavage at internal aspartate residues. Fas recruits caspase 8, which initiates the death program through the subsequent activation of caspase 3. Granzyme B can process both caspase 8 and 3 in vitro, suggesting that both Fas and granzyme B access the apoptotic program in the same way. Here we demonstrate that although the two mechanisms are similar, the events that lead to activation of caspase 3 can be distinguished in vivo on the basis of their sensitivities to both pharmacological and virus-encoded caspase inhibitors. In cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated death the initial cleavage event on caspase 3 is insensitive to benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) inhibition in both mouse and human systems. During Fas-mediated death, however, activation of caspase 3 is completely inhibited to zVAD-fmk. In addition, the viral serpin SPI-2, a homologue of cytokine response modifier A (crmA), is an effective inhibitor of the Fas but not the granzyme pathway. Our results demonstrate that whereas Fas-mediated activation of caspase 3 requires an upstream caspase activity that is zVAD-fmk-sensitive, the initial cleavage of caspase 3 during granule-mediated cell death is insensitive to zVAD-fmk, suggesting that caspase 3 is cleaved directly by granzyme B in vivo.",,"['Atkinson, E A', 'Barry, M', 'Darmon, A J', 'Shostak, I', 'Turner, P C', 'Moyer, R W', 'Bleackley, R C']","['Atkinson EA', 'Barry M', 'Darmon AJ', 'Shostak I', 'Turner PC', 'Moyer RW', 'Bleackley RC']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2H7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.33.21261 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)48978-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Aug 14;273(33):21261-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.33.21261.,['AI 25722/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,

Receptor-like PTP PTP-U2 is expressed during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of monoblastoid leukemia U937 cells. We found that the shorter isoform, PTP-U2S, was expressed at an earlier phase in the course of differentiation and the longer isoform, PTP-U2L, was induced at a later phase. In the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, ectopic expression of PTP-U2L in U937 cells enhanced several characteristics of terminally differentiated cells. Most striking was that PTP-U2L enhanced apoptosis of the differentiated cells, which was only partially inhibited by caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-CH2-DCB. The catalytically inactive mutant PTP-U2L(C --> S) still retained the ability to enhance the differentiation but retained the ability to enhance the following apoptosis of the cells to a lesser extent.

These receptors bind glycosylated LIF produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO LIF) (Kd = 6.9 nM) but not Escherichia coli-derived LIF or CHO LIF treated with endoglycosidase F. CHO LIF binding to these receptors is neither affected by anti-gp190 mAbs nor by anti-gp130 mAbs and is specifically inhibited by low concentrations of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) (IC50 = 40 microM), suggesting that they could be related to Man-6-P receptors.

By gene targeting in mice, we previously showed that TEL-/- mice are embryonic lethal because of a yolk sac angiogenic defect. TEL also appears essential for the survival of selected neural and mesenchymal populations within the embryo proper. Here, we have generated mouse chimeras with TEL-/- ES cells to examine a possible requirement in adult hematopoiesis. Although not required for the intrinsic proliferation and/or differentiation of adult-type hematopoietic lineages in the yolk sac and fetal liver, TEL function is essential for the establishment of hematopoiesis of all lineages in the bone marrow. This defect is manifest within the first week of postnatal life. Our data pinpoint a critical role for TEL in the normal transition of hematopoietic activity from fetal liver to bone marrow. This might reflect an inability of TEL-/- hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors to migrate or home to the bone marrow or, more likely, the failure of these cells to respond appropriately and/or survive within the bone marrow microenvironment.

DESIGN: Single centre stratified, randomised non-blinded phase II study. SETTING: University hospital providing tertiary clinical care. SUBJECTS: 51 neutropenic patients (leukaemia (35), lymphoma (11), solid tumours (5)) with refractory fever of unknown origin (24) or pneumonia (27). INTERVENTIONS: Amphotericin B 0.75 mg/kg/day in 250 ml glucose 5% solution or mixed with 250 ml intralipid 20%, given on eight consecutive days then alternate days, as a 1-4 hour infusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility of treatment, subjective tolerance (questionnaire), and objective toxicity (common toxicity criteria of the National Cancer Institute). RESULTS: Study arms were balanced for age, sex, underlying malignancy, renal and liver function, and pre- and concomitant treatment with antibiotics and nephrotoxic agents. No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences were found between the treatment groups for: daily or cumulative dose and duration of treatment with amphotericin B; incidence and time of dose modifications or infusion duration changes related to toxicity; dose or duration of symptomatic support with opiates, antipyretics, or antihistamines; renal function; subjective tolerance; most common toxicity scores; course of infection; and incidence of treatment failures. Patients treated with amphotericin B in intralipid were given fewer diuretics (P<0.05) and therefore had more peripheral oedema (P<0.01) and needed less potassium supplementation (P<0.05) than patients given amphotericin in glucose. Acute respiratory events were more common in the intralipid arm (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B 0.75 mg/kg/day in intralipid given on eight consecutive days then alternate days provides no benefit and is associated with potential pulmonary side effects possibly because of fat overload or an incompatibility of the two drugs.",,"['Schoffski, P', 'Freund, M', 'Wunder, R', 'Petersen, D', 'Kohne, C H', 'Hecker, H', 'Schubert, U', 'Ganser, A']","['Schoffski P', 'Freund M', 'Wunder R', 'Petersen D', 'Kohne CH', 'Hecker H', 'Schubert U', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, Hanover University Medical School, D-30625 Hanover, Germany.

Given the lack of data supporting this dose, we prospectively studied the dose response to platelet transfusions in adults and children with hematologic malignancies. Each patient received, in similar clinical conditions, a medium, high, and very high dose of fresh (< 24 hours old) ABO-compatible platelets, in the form of apheresis platelet concentrates (APC). For the adults, the medium dose was defined as APC containing between 4 and 6 x 10(11) platelets, the high dose between 6 and 8 x 10(11), and the very high dose > 8 x 10(11); for the children, the three doses corresponded to 2 to 4, 4 to 6, and > 6 x 10(11) platelets. The end points were the platelet increment, platelet recovery, and the transfusion interval, and the results were compared with a paired t-test. Sixty-nine adults and 13 children could be assessed. Recoveries in the adults were similar with the three doses (from 28% to 30%), but the high and very high doses led to a significantly better platelet increment (52 and 61 x 10(9)/L, respectively) than the medium dose (33 x 10(9)/L, P < .01). The main difference was in the transfusion interval, which increased with the dose of platelets transfused, from 2.6 days with the medium dose to 3.3 and 4.1 days with the high and very high doses, respectively (P < .01). The positive effect of the high dose was observed regardless of pretransfusional clinical status, but was more marked in patients with no clinical factors known to impair platelet recovery. In these patients, a platelet dose of 0.07 x 10(11) per kg of body weight led to a transfusion interval of more than 2 days in 95% of cases. In patients with clinical factors favoring platelet consumption, the proportion of transfusions yielding an optimal platelet increment and transfusion interval increased with the dose of platelets. The platelet dose-effect was also significant in the children, in whom the high and very high doses led to 1.5-fold to twofold higher posttransfusion platelet counts and transfusion intervals. We conclude that transfusion of high platelet doses can reduce the number of platelet concentrates required by thrombocytopenic patients and significantly reduce donor exposure.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Norol, F', 'Bierling, P', 'Roudot-Thoraval, F', 'Le Coeur, F F', 'Rieux, C', 'Lavaux, A', 'Kuentz, M', 'Duedari, N']","['Norol F', 'Bierling P', 'Roudot-Thoraval F', 'Le Coeur FF', 'Rieux C', 'Lavaux A', 'Kuentz M', 'Duedari N']","['ETS Sud-Est Francilien, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil; Unite Evaluation Etude, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55202-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 15;92(4):1448-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,

After processing, including removal of an amino-terminal propeptide from the catalytically inactive proform, the active protease acquires a mature conformation and is stored in azurophil granules. To investigate the importance of the proform-conformation for targeting to granules, a cDNA encoding a double-mutant form of human preprocathepsin G lacking functional catalytic site and amino-terminal prodipeptide (CatG/Gly201/triangle upGly19Glu20) was constructed, because we were not able to stably express a mutant lacking only the propeptide. Transfection of the cDNA to the rat basophilic leukemia RBL-1 and the murine myeloblast-like 32D cl3 cell lines resulted in stable, protein-expressing clones. In contrast to wild-type proenzyme, CatG/Gly201/triangle upGly19Glu20 adopted a mature conformation cotranslationally, as judged by the early acquisition of affinity to the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin, appearing before the carboxyl-terminal processing and also in the presence of the Golgi-disrupting agent brefeldin A. The presence of a mature amino-terminus was confirmed by amino-terminal radiosequencing. As with wild-type proenzyme, CatG/Gly201/triangle upGly19Glu20 was proteolytically processed carboxyl-terminally and glycosylated with asparagine-linked carbohydrates that were converted into complex forms. Furthermore, it was targeted to granules, as determined by subcellular fractionation.

Aspirin induced a decrease in cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The mean IC50 for cells from 5 patients was 5.9 +/- 1.13 mmol/L (range, 4.4 to 7.3 mmol/L). In some cases, 2.5 mmol/L aspirin produced an important cytotoxic effect after 4 days of incubation. No effect was observed with other NSAIDs, at concentrations that inhibit cyclooxygenase, such as ketorolac (10 micromol/mL), NS-398 (100 micromol/mL), or indomethacin (20 micromol/mL), thus suggesting the involvement of cyclooxygenase-independent mechanisms in aspirin-induced cytotoxicity. Salicylate also produced dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on B-CLL cells and the mean IC50 for cells from 5 patients was 6.96 +/- 1.13 mmol/L (range, 5 to 7.8 mmol/L). Both aspirin and salicylate induced DNA fragmentation and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP(adenosine 5'-diphosphate)-ribose) polymerase (PARP), demonstrating that both compounds induce apoptosis of B-CLL cells. Finally, inhibition of caspases by Z-VAD.fmk blocked proteolytic cleavage of PARP, DNA fragmentation, and cytotoxicity induced by aspirin. Mononuclear cells from normal donors showed a lower sensitivity than cells from B-CLL patients to aspirin as determined by analysis of cell viability. B and T lymphocytes from normal donors and T lymphocytes from CLL patients are more resistant to aspirin-induced apoptosis, as determined by analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure.

Experimentally, E2A-HLF prevents apoptosis due to growth factor deprivation or gamma-irradiation in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cells. To directly test the chimeric protein's ability to abrogate p53-mediated cell death, we used mouse myeloid leukemia cells (M1p53tsval) that constitutively express a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant p53 gene and undergo apoptosis when p53 assumes an active wild-type configuration. This effect is blocked by treatment with IL-6, which allows the cells to survive in culture despite wild-type p53 activation. We introduced E2A-HLF into M1p53tsval cells and found that they were resistant to p53-mediated apoptosis and that E2A-HLF effectively substituted for the survival functions of IL-6. The expression of p53-responsive genes such as p21 and Bax was upregulated normally, suggesting that E2A-HLF acts downstream of p53 to block execution of the p53-induced apoptotic program. NFIL3, a growth factor-regulated bZIP protein that binds to the same DNA-consensus site as E2A-HLF, delays apoptosis in IL-3-dependent pro-B cells deprived of growth factor. By contrast, in the present study, enforced expression of NFIL3 failed to protect M1p53tsval cells from p53-dependent apoptosis and actively antagonized the ability of IL-6 to rescue cells from that fate, consistent with its role as either a transcriptional repressor or activator, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. We conclude that the E2A-HLF chimera abrogates p53-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells, possibly through the transcriptional modulation of cell death pathways that are activated by p53 in response to DNA damage.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Altura, R A', 'Inukai, T', 'Ashmun, R A', 'Zambetti, G P', 'Roussel, M F', 'Look, A T']","['Altura RA', 'Inukai T', 'Ashmun RA', 'Zambetti GP', 'Roussel MF', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'G-Box Binding Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p53', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Temperature', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55196-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 15;92(4):1397-405.,"['CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 70089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nfil3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,

Transplantation of human CML cells into non-obese diabetic mice with severe immunodeficiency disease (NOD/SCID mice) may therefore be a useful model. A CML cell line (BV173) and peripheral blood cells collected from CML patients in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), or blastic phase (BP) were injected into preirradiated NOD/SCID mice. Animals were killed at serial intervals; cell suspensions and/or tissue sections from different organs were studied by immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry using antihuman CD45 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the BCR-ABL fusion gene. One hour after injection, cells were sequestered in the lungs and liver, but 2 weeks later they were no longer detectable in either site. Similar short-term kinetics were observed using 51Cr-labeled cells. The first signs of engraftment for BV173, AP, and BP cells were detected in the bone marrow (BM) at 4 weeks. At 8 weeks the median percentages of human cells in murine marrow were 4% (range, 1 to 9) for CP, 11% (range, 5 to 36) for AP, 38.5% (range, 18 to 79) for BP, and 54% (range, 31 to 69) for BV173. CP cells progressively infiltrated BM (21%) and spleen (6%) by 18 to 20 weeks; no animals injected with the cell line or BP cells survived beyond 12 weeks. The rate of increase in human cell numbers was higher for BP (7.3%/week) as compared with CP (0.9%/week) and AP (0. 5%/week). FISH analysis with BCR and ABL probes showed that some of the human cells engrafting after injection of CP cells lacked a BCR-ABL gene and were presumably normal.

Recently, constitutively activated Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 were identified in nuclear extracts of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, suggesting involvement of constitutive Stat activity in the events of leukemogenesis. In the present study, blasts of nine AML cases were investigated for the constitutive binding activity of the recently identified transcription factor LIL-Stat (LPS- and IL-1-inducible Stat). Band-shift assays were performed using the LPS-and IL-1-responsive element (LILRE) oligonucleotide, a gamma interferon activation site-like site that is present in the human IL-1beta promoter. Constitutive LIL-Stat binding activity was observed in three leukemic cell lines and in seven out of nine AML cases. Transient transfection studies with a reporter plasmid containing three sequential LIL-Stat binding sites showed distinct transcriptional activity of LIL-Stat only in those AML blasts that constitutively expressed LIL-Stat. In CD34+ cells LIL-Stat also constitutively bound to its consensus sequence. However, when these cells were cultured in the presence of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) for differentiation along the monocytic lineage, the LIL-Stat binding activity disappeared totally. In agreement with these findings neither mature monocytes nor granulocytes showed constitutive or inducible LIL-Stat binding activity.

Despite its known involvement in a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a detailed examination of BSAP expression in NHL has not been previously reported. In this study, we analyzed normal and malignant lymphoid tissues and cell lines, including 102 cases of B-cell NHL, 23 cases of T- and null-cell NHL, and 18 cases of Hodgkin's disease. Normal lymphoid tissues showed strong nuclear BSAP expression in mantle zone B cells, less intense reactivity in follicular center B cells, and no expression in cells of the T-cell-rich zones. Monocytoid B cells showed weak expression, whereas plasma cells and extrafollicular large transformed B cells were negative. Of the 102 B-cell NHLs, 83 (81%) demonstrated BSAP expression. All of the 13 (100%) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLLs), 21 of (100%) mantle cells (MCLs), and 20 of 21 (95%) follicular lymphomas (FLs) were positive. Moderate staining intensities were found in most B-CLL and FL cases, whereas most MCLs showed strong reactions, paralleling the strong reactivity of nonmalignant mantle cells. Eight of 12 (67%) marginal zone lymphoma cases showed negative or low BSAP levels, and 17 of 24 (71%) large B-cell lymphomas displayed moderate to strong expression. None of the 23 T- and null-cell lymphomas reacted with the BSAP antisera, whereas in Hodgkin's disease, 2 of 4 (50%) nodular lymphocytic predominance and 5 of 14 (36%) classical cases showed weak nuclear or nucleolar BSAP reactions in a fraction of the tumor cells. Western blot analysis showed a 52-kD BSAP band in B-cell lines, but not in non-B-cell or plasma cell lines. We conclude that BSAP expression is largely restricted to lymphomas of B-cell lineage and that BSAP expression varies in B-cell subsets and subtypes of B-cell NHL.

After 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment, the cells adhered to the culture plate and underwent megakaryocytic differentiation with expression of alphaIIbbeta3. Binding of soluble fibrinogen to the cells via alphaIIbbeta3 was dependent on cell adhesion. Cell detaching reduced the affinity of this integrin for soluble fibrinogen, although its surface expression was almost unchanged. In contrast, detached cells became tightly adherent to the fibrinogen-coated plate (solid-phase fibrinogen). The same ligand, fibrinogen, present either in soluble or solid-phase form, triggered differential signaling pathways mediated by alphaIIbbeta3. By the stimulation with soluble fibrinogen, Syk was tyrosine-phosphorylated but FAK was dephosphorylated, whereas solid-phase fibrinogen promptly caused tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK followed by delayed phosphorylation of Syk. In addition, the binding of soluble fibrinogen to the cells adherent to fibrinogen-coated plate resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin beta3 and a complex formation of integrin beta3 with Syk.

Its extracellular domain binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin, while its intracellular domain associates tightly with the cytoskeleton through the actin-binding protein (ABP)-280, also known as filamin. In the present study, a full-length cDNA coding for a human ABP homologue has been cloned and sequenced. This protein was identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening procedure via its interaction with the intracellular domain of GPIbalpha. Initially, a 1.3-kb partial cDNA was isolated from a megakaryocyte-like cell line (K562) cDNA library followed by a full-length cDNA of 9.4 kb that was identified in a human placenta library. The full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 2,578 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 276 kD (ABP-276). The amino terminal 248 amino acids contained an apparent actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats each containing about 96 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the protein shared a high degree of homology with human endothelial ABP-280 (70% identity) and chicken filamin (83% identity). However, the 32 amino acid Hinge I region in ABP-280 that contains a calpain cleavage site conferring flexibility on the molecule, was absent in the homologue. An isoform containing a 24 amino acid insertion with a unique sequence at the missing Hinge I region was also identified (ABP-278). This isoform resulted from alternative RNA splicing.

To establish whether cytochrome c can primarily induce apoptosis in intact cells, we used direct electroporation of cytochrome c into murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cells. Electroporation of micromolar external concentrations of cytochrome c rapidly induced apoptosis (2 to 4 hours) that was concentration-dependent, did not affect mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and was independent of cell growth. Only certain isoforms of cytochrome c were apoptogenic; yeast cytochrome c and other redox proteins were inactive. Cytochrome c-induced apoptosis was dependent on heme attachment to the apo-enzyme and was completely abolished by caspase inhibitors. Nonapoptogenic isoforms of cytochrome c did not compete for apoptogenic cytochrome c. Although apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal was inhibited by bcl-2 overexpression and expression of an activated MAP-kinase-kinase (MAP-KK), cytochrome c induced apoptosis in the presence of IL-3 signaling, bcl-2 over-expression, expression of activated MAP-KK, and the combined antiapoptotic action of all three. Cytochrome c also induced apoptosis in the leukemic cell line WEHI 3b. However, human HL60 and CEM cells were resistant to cytochrome c-induced apoptosis. HL60 cells did not electroporate, but CEM cells were efficiently electroporated. Our studies with IL-3-dependent cells confirm that the apoptogenic attributes of cytochrome c are identical in intact cells to those in cell extracts. We conclude that cytochrome c can be a prime initiator of apoptosis in intact growing cells and acts downstream of bcl-2 and mitochondria, but that other cells are resistant to its apoptogenic activity. The system described offers a novel, simple approach for investigating regulation of apoptosis by cytochrome c and provides a model linking growth factor signaling to metabolism, survival, and apoptosis control.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Garland, J M', 'Rudin, C']","['Garland JM', 'Rudin C']","['Institute for Clinical Science, Exeter University, Noy Scott House, Wonford, Exeter, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Cytochrome c Group/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Models, Biological', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55179-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 15;92(4):1235-46.,,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,

It shares structural similarities with and is a member of the IkappaB family of proteins. In this report, involvement of Bcl-3 in hematopoietic growth factor-stimulated erythroid proliferation and differentiation was examined. In TF-1 cells, an erythroleukemia cell line, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (Epo) greatly enhanced Bcl-3 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in association with stimulation of proliferation. Bcl-3 protein was also highly expressed in early burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E)-derived erythroid precursors (day 7) and decreased during maturation (days 10 and 14), suggesting that Bcl-3 is involved in normal erythroid proliferation. In these hematopoietic cells, Bcl-3 was hyperphosphorylated. GM-CSF and Epo modulated the subcellular localization of Bcl-3. Upon stimulation of TF-1 cells with GM-CSF or Epo, the nuclear translocation of Bcl-3 was dramatically enhanced. Overexpression of Bcl-3 in TF-1 cells by transient transfection along with the NF-kappaB factors p50 or p52 resulted in significant induction of an human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) kappaB-TATA-luceriferase reporter plasmid, demonstrating that Bcl-3 has a positive role in transactivation of kappaB-containing genes in erythroid cells. Stimulation with GM-CSF enhanced c-myb mRNA expression in these cells. Bcl-3 in nuclear extracts of TF-1 cells bound to a kappaB enhancer in the c-myb promoter together with NF-kappaB2/p52 and this binding activity was enhanced by GM-CSF stimulation. Furthermore, cotransfection of Bcl-3 with p52 or p50 in TF-1 cells resulted in significant activation of a c-myb kappaB-TATA-luceriferase reporter plasmid. These findings suggest that Bcl-3 may participate in the transcriptional regulation of certain kappaB-containing genes involved in hematopoiesis, including c-myb.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Zhang, M Y', 'Harhaj, E W', 'Bell, L', 'Sun, S C', 'Miller, B A']","['Zhang MY', 'Harhaj EW', 'Bell L', 'Sun SC', 'Miller BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, The Milton S.

We studied matched pretreatment and relapse specimens from 12 patients who received variable amounts of RA, primarily in nonconcurrent combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) protocol E2491, and from 8 patients who received DA only on protocol E2491. Of 10 RA-treated patients evaluable for a change in APL cell sensitivity to RA-induced differentiation in vitro, 8 showed diminished sensitivity at relapse, whereas, of 6 evaluable patients treated with DA alone, only 1 had marginally reduced sensitivity. From analysis of sequences encoding the principal functional domains of the PML and RARalpha portions of PML-RARalpha, we found missense mutations in relapse specimens from 3 of 12 RA-treated patients and 0 of 8 DA-treated patients. All 3 mutations were located in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the RARalpha region of PML-RARalpha. Relative to normal RARalpha1, the mutations were Leu290Val, Arg394Trp, and Met413Thr. All pretreatment analyses were normal except for a C to T base change in the 3'-untranslated (UT) region of 1 patient that was also present after relapse from DA therapy. No mutations were detected in the corresponding sequences of the normal RARalpha or PML (partial) alleles. Minor additional PML-RARalpha isoforms encoding truncated PML proteins were detected in 2 cases.

Potential effects of type of treatment and duration of follow-up and the site distribution of cancer were also examined. Between 1976 and 1996, 117 patients were diagnosed with HCL in British Columbia who were referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) for treatment. All additional malignancies were traced using a provincial population-based cancer registry and follow-up records from the BCCA. There were 90 men and 27 women. Median age at diagnosis was 53 years. The median follow-up time was 68 months. Twenty-three patients underwent primary splenectomy, 65 received interferon alpha, 24 deoxycoformycin, and 67 cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine). Thirty-six patients had an additional malignancy (30.7%) with a total of 44 tumors. Six patients (5.1%) had two or more malignancies. Twenty-five patients had malignancies diagnosed after HCL (21.3%), three concurrent with HCL (2.6%), and 12 preceding HCL (10.2%). Second tumors (n = 28 tumors) occurred at a median of 40 months after HCL (range, 3 to 167). The relative rate (RR) of second malignancy among men and women was 2.91 (P < .001) and 1.65 (P = .23), respectively, compared with age and secular trend-matched controls. There were eight prostate cancers, nine nonmelanoma skin cancers, two lung cancers, and four gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. The RR (90% confidence interval [CI]) in the various treatment groups were: splenectomy (RR = 0.21 to 3.81), purine analogues (RR = 0.60 to 5.69), interferon then purine analogues (RR = 1.60 to 4.31), interferon alone (RR = 1. 57 to 8.40). Cancer risk peaked at 2 years after HCL (RR = 4.13) and fell steadily afterwards, reaching a RR of 1.82 at 6 years. Twenty patients died, six due to HCL, 10 due to second malignancies, and four of unrelated causes. HCL patients appear to be inherently prone to malignancies. This appears to be more related to HCL tumor burden than to genetic predisposition or treatment effect. RR tends to fall with time after effective treatment.

Recently, two types of chimeric transcripts, MLL-AF10 in t(10;11)(p12;q23) and CALM-AF10 in t(10;11)(p13;q14), were isolated. t(10;11) is strongly associated with complex translocations, including invins(10;11) and inv(11)t(10;11), because the direction of transcription of AF10 is telomere to centromere. We analyzed a patient of AML with t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) and identified ABI-1 on chromosome 10p11.2, a human homolog to mouse Abl-interactor 1 (Abi-1), fused with MLL. Whereas the ABI-1 gene bears no homology with the partner genes of MLL previously described, the ABI-1 protein exhibits sequence similarity to protein of homeotic genes, contains several polyproline stretches, and includes a src homology 3 (SH3) domain at the C-terminus that is required for binding to Abl proteins in mouse Abi-1 protein. Recently, e3B1, an eps8 SH3 binding protein 1, was also isolated as a human homolog to mouse Abi-1. Three types of transcripts of ABI-1 gene were expressed in normal peripheral blood. Although e3B1 was considered to be a full-length ABI-1, the MLL-ABI-1 fusion transcript in this patient was formed by an alternatively spliced ABI-1. Others have shown that mouse Abi-1 suppresses v-ABL transforming activity and that e3B1, full-length ABI-1, regulates cell growth. In-frame MLL-ABI-1 fusion transcripts combine the MLL AT-hook motifs and DNA methyltransferase homology region with the homeodomain homologous region, polyproline stretches, and SH3 domain of alternatively spliced transcript of ABI-1.

In chimeric mice, gene disruption experiments have demonstrated a critical role for Epo signaling in development beyond the erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU-e) stage. However, whether this might include the possible Epo-specific induction of red blood cell differentiation events is largely unresolved. To address this issue, mechanisms of induced globin expression in Epo-responsive SKT6 cells have been investigated. Chimeric receptors containing an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor extracellular domain and varied Epo receptor cytoplasmic domains first were expressed stably at physiological levels in SKT6 cells, and their activities in mediating induced hemoglobinization were assayed. While activity was exerted by a full-length chimera (EE483), truncation to remove 7 of 8 carboxyl-terminal tyrosine sites (EE372) markedly enhanced differentiation signaling. Moreover, mutation of a STAT5 binding site in this construct (EE372-Y343F) inhibited induced globin expression and SKT6 cell hemoglobinization, as did the ectopic expression of dominant-negative forms of STAT5 in parental SKT6 cells. As in normal CFU-e, SKT6 cells also were shown to express functional receptors for stem cell factor (SCF). To further define possible specific requirements for differentiation signaling, effects of SCF on SKT6 cell hemoglobinization were tested. Interestingly, SCF not only failed to promote globin expression but inhibited this Epo-induced event in a dose-dependent, STAT5-independent fashion. Thus, effects of Epo on globin expression may depend specifically on STAT5-dependent events, and SCF normally may function to attenuate terminal differentiation while promoting CFU-e expansion.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gregory, R C', 'Jiang, N', 'Todokoro, K', 'Crouse, J', 'Pacifici, R E', 'Wojchowski, D M']","['Gregory RC', 'Jiang N', 'Todokoro K', 'Crouse J', 'Pacifici RE', 'Wojchowski DM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the Center for Gene Regulation, The Pennsylvania State Univeristy, University Park, PA 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/08 00:00,1998/08/08 00:01,['1998/08/08 00:00'],"['1998/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55164-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 15;92(4):1104-18.,"['HL44491/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RCDA HL 03042/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,

PAP has heterogenous etiologies that may be genetic or aquired. Some cases of PAP have been reported to be associated with hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In mice, the PAP phenotype was generated by targeted deletion of the gene for betac and can be treated by transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into betac -/- mice. Thus, our findings in betac -/- mice provide evidence for a causal relationship between the lung disease and the hematopoietic system. We describe here expression defects of betac or betac plus GM-CSF receptor alpha chain (GM-CSFR alpha) in 3 pediatric patients with AML and PAP symptoms. All of the patients' leukemic cells failed to express normal levels of betac. The leukemic cells of patients no. 2 and 3 additionally lacked the expression of GM-CSFR alpha, as shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of betac was demonstrated in clonogenic progenitor assays with absent colony-forming unit (CFU) growth after GM-CSF or IL-3 stimulation. The response to growth factors acting via a growth factor receptor distinct from the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 system (recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [rhG-CSF]) was normal. After antileukemic treatment, the pulmonary symptoms resolved and betac or betac plus GM-CSFR alpha expression was normal.

Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules are expressed throughout B lymphocyte ontogeny (except the plasmocytes), are responsible for antigen presentation, and can also transmit signals. Cord blood B stimulate an allogeneic response, and this property is believed to indicate the presence of a class II-associated peptide. In this study we examined the capacity of cord blood B to transmit signals via HLA-DR. Activation and relocalization of protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes alpha and betaII was detected along with tyrosine kinase activation and proliferation. However, in contrast to resting adult B, generation of an intracellular calcium ([Ca++]i) flux and rapid aggregation were not detected. To address the question of whether or not HLA-DR signals throughout B lymphocyte ontogeny, we extended this study to include malignant adult B (B chronic lymphocytic leukemia [B-CLL], B mantle cell lymphoma, and B large cell leukemia).

High titers of the LISN retrovirus were produced by the amphotropic packaging cell line GP+envAM12. LISN is able to infect three human hematopoietic and leukemic cell lines: K562, LAMA-84, and TF-1. G418-resistant cells were detected in a similar proportion after infection with either the LISN retroviral vector or the LnLSN retroviral vector (encoding the nlsLacZ gene instead of hIFN-alpha2), suggesting that hIFN-alpha2 does not inhibit (or only partially inhibits) the production of retroviral particles by the packaging cell line and the infection of human cells. LISN-infected cells express and secrete hIFN-alpha2 as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA, detection of the intracellular protein by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and detection of secreted hIFN-alpha in cell supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Retrovirally produced hIFN-alpha2 is biologically active, as demonstrated by the partial inhibition of the growth of K562 and TF-1, the modulation of the expression of cell surface antigens, the induction of the (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase, and, for LAMA-84, the down-modulation of the BCR-ABL protein. We conclude that the infection of human leukemic cell lines with a retroviral vector encoding hIFN-alpha2 is feasible and induces the expected biological effects. This experimental model will be useful in investigating the possibility of transducing normal and leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors and in determining the consequences of the autocrine production of hIFN-alpha2 on the behavior of these cells.",,"['Austruy, E', 'Bagnis, C', 'Carbuccia, N', 'Maroc, C', 'Birg, F', 'Dubreuil, P', 'Mannoni, P', 'Chabannon, C']","['Austruy E', 'Bagnis C', 'Carbuccia N', 'Maroc C', 'Birg F', 'Dubreuil P', 'Mannoni P', 'Chabannon C']","['Departement de Therapie Genique, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/virology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poly A', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",1998/08/07 00:00,1998/08/07 00:01,['1998/08/07 00:00'],"['1998/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1998 Jul-Aug;5(4):247-56.,,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,['GENBANK/Y11834'],,,,,

Retroviral transfer of the gene for such a variant DHFR into hematopoietic cells might permit selection of modified cells in vivo by antifolate administration or alleviate antifolate-induced myelosuppression in patients receiving antifolate therapy. We examined protection of cells of the human lymphoblastoid line, CCRF-CEM, transduced with variants of mouse DHFR. In transduced cells selected with G418 but not with antifolate, the variant that had arginine substituted for leucine 22 did not protect against either methotrexate or trimetrexate; however, four other variants did offer protection, with the best having leucine 22 changed to tyrosine. Polyclonal cultures transduced with the different variants express DHFR at about the same level, but clones within each polyclonal population differ in DHFR expression levels and in resistance. These differences in expression were shown to reflect different integration sites for proviral DNA. Exposure to trimetrexate selects highly resistant clones, with high expression due to both high copy number and integration sites that are favorable for expression. Differences in the resistance of cultures expressing different variants at the same level are due to differences in the catalytic activity of the expressed DHFR, its affinity for antifolates, and its stability.",,"['Mareya, S M', 'Sorrentino, B P', 'Blakley, R L']","['Mareya SM', 'Sorrentino BP', 'Blakley RL']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Stability/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Trimetrexate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/07 00:00,1998/08/07 00:01,['1998/08/07 00:00'],"['1998/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1998 Jul-Aug;5(4):225-35.,"['P01 HL 53749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 31922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,

Upon addition of 1 mM Mn2+, or activating antibody 9EG7, binding affinity for both laminin-5 and invasin increased by about 10-fold, whereas the affinity decreased upon addition of 2 mM Ca2+. Thus, functional regulation of the purified soluble integrin alpha 3 beta 1 ectodomain heterodimer resembles that of wild-type membrane-anchored beta 1 integrins. The integrin alpha 3 subunit was entirely cleaved into disulfide-linked heavy and light chains, at a newly defined cleavage site located C-terminal of a tetrabasic RRRR motif. Within the alpha 3 light chain, all potential N-glycosylation sites bear N-linked mannose-rich carbohydrate chains, suggesting an important structural role of these sugar residues in the stalk-like region of the integrin heterodimer. In conclusion, studies of our recombinant alpha 3 beta 1 integrin have provided new insights into alpha 3 beta1 structure, ligand binding function, specificity, and regulation.",,"['Eble, J A', 'Wucherpfennig, K W', 'Gauthier, L', 'Dersch, P', 'Krukonis, E', 'Isberg, R R', 'Hemler, M E']","['Eble JA', 'Wucherpfennig KW', 'Gauthier L', 'Dersch P', 'Krukonis E', 'Isberg RR', 'Hemler ME']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. eble@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['*Adhesins, Bacterial', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Drosophila', 'Genetic Vectors/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha3beta1', 'Integrins/*genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Titrimetry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Yersinia/physiology']",1998/08/07 00:00,1998/08/07 00:01,['1998/08/07 00:00'],"['1998/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi980175+ [doi]', 'bi980175+ [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Aug 4;37(31):10945-55. doi: 10.1021/bi980175+.,['CA42368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Adhesins, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrin alpha3beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (kalinin)', '114073-91-5 (invasin, Yersinia)']",,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we show that the transforming capacity of these two HOX proteins depends on their conserved tetrapeptide and homeodomain regions which mediate binding to PBX and DNA, respectively.

METHODS: We studied 48 cases from Cancer and Leukemia Group B thoracic surgeons. Of 21 men and 27 women, aged 41 +/- 16 years, 22 patients were asymptomatic. In the others, 92% of tumor-related symptoms improved or resolved after treatment. Five tumors involved the anterior compartment, 19 the middle, and 24 the posterior compartment. Diagnoses were typical for each compartment but also included uncommon problems such as superior vena cava hemangioma and a histoplasmosis cyst causing hoarseness. Of the lesions, a biopsy of 12 was done without excision and the rest were excised completely. Fifteen were cystic and 10 were malignant (8 biopsy only). Maximal dimensions were 5.2 +/- 3.3 cm. RESULTS: Operations were briefer for 24 posterior (93 +/- 41 min) than 5 anterior (195 +/- 46 min, p < 0.01) or 19 middle mediastinal tumors (170 +/- 78 min, p < 0.01). Although 96% had vital mediastinal relations, only six open conversions were performed because of bleeding (n = 3), large size, impaired exposure, or rib attachments, and no patient had morbidity beyond that expected for the thoracotomy. Postoperative stay was shorter for the nonconversion group (3.2 +/- 2.8 versus 5.5 +/- 2.1 days, p = 0.05), as was chest tube duration (1.7 +/- 1.4 days versus 3.2 +/- 1.9 days, p = 0.03). There were no postoperative deaths or major complications, but 7 patients had minor complications. During a mean of 20 months of surveillance (range, 1 to 52 months), one cyst recurred (asymptomatic) as did one sarcoma that was excised.

The biologic and clinical significance of this finding is not clearly established. In this retrospective study of patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia, we have identified CD7 expression and analyzed its association with markers expressed early in hemopoietic ontogeny and clinical parameters. Among 60 consecutive AML patients, we found six (10%) expressing CD7 on leukemic cells. There were five males and one female and the mean age was 59.6 years (age range: 32-76 years) with no demographic peculiarities. The FAB subtypes were: M0 (2), M1 (1), M2 (1), and M4 (2). CD7 expression was associated with immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and antigen receptor gene rearrangements (rearrangements of T-cell receptor gamma chain in 6/6 and immunoglobulin heavy chain in 2/6). Hepatomegaly was present in three and this was associated with splenomegaly with lymphadenopathy in one patient. Mediastinal or central nervous system involvement was absent. Complete remission was achieved in two patients with standard chemotherapy; one of these is in remission and alive (5 years later), while one died following relapse 9 months later. Three patients had significantly lower response to standard therapeutic regimen (two died during induction and one died 7 months later without ever achieving complete remission). One patient has been excluded in determining the prognostic significance of CD7 due to early death. Our results suggest origin of CD7+ AML from early hemopoietic precursors and indicate biologic aggressiveness in a significant proportion of patients.

We examined heterozygosity of the STR on HUMARA in 110 Japanese females and found heterozygosity in 74 of 110 (67%). To examine for hematologic clonality in females with HUMARA homozygosity, we used a primer specific for a novel polymorphic STR site between DXS15 and DXS134 (DXS15-134) on Xq28. Heterozygosity for this site was found in 50 of 110 females (46%). Clonality of the hematopoietic cells was detected in 91 of 110 females (83%) using PCR of either the STR sites on HUMARA or DXS15-134. The X-inactivation patterns using PCR of DXS15-134 corresponded exactly with those obtained using PCR of HUMARA in 18 females who were heterozygous for both DXS15-134 and HUMARA. Using PCR of DXS15-134, we examined the clonality of bone marrow cells separated by flow cytometry in a patient with erythroleukemia (M6).

Results of cytogenetic analyses of Estonian workers by fluorescence in situ hybridization.,237-49,"Studies of workers who were sent to Chernobyl after the 1986 reactor accident are being conducted to provide a better understanding of the effects of chronic low-dose radiation exposures. A crucial component to these investigations is an accurate assessment of the radiation doses received during the cleanup activities. To provide information on biological measurements of dose, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole-chromosome painting probes has been applied to quantify stable chromosome aberrations (translocations and insertions) among a defined cohort of 4,833 cleanup workers from Estonia. Cytogenetic analysis of 48-h lymphocyte cultures from 118 Estonian cleanup workers (10.3 cGy mean recorded dose; 25 cGy maximum), 29 Estonian population controls and 21 American controls was conducted by three laboratories. More than 258,000 painted metaphases were evaluated. Overall, we observed lower translocation frequencies than has been reported in previous studies using FISH among Chernobyl cleanup workers. In our data, a clear association with increased levels of translocations was seen with increasing age at blood drawing. There was no correlation, however, between aberration frequency and recorded measurements of physical dose or any category of potential high-dose and high-dose-rate exposure such as being sent to Chernobyl in 1986, working on the roof near the damaged nuclear reactor, working in special zones or having multiple tours. In fact, the translocation frequency was lower among the exposed workers than the controls, though not significantly so. To estimate the level of effect that would have been expected in a population of men having an average dose of approximately 10 cGy, blood from six donors was exposed to low-LET radiation, and more than 32,000 metaphases were scored to estimate dose-response coefficients for radiation-induced translocations in chromosome pairs 1, 2 and 4. Based on these results, we estimate that had this group of 118 men received an average whole-body dose of 10-11 cGy, as chronic or acute exposures, an increase in the mean frequency of chromosome translocations of more than 40-65% would have been observed in their lymphocytes compared to findings in nonirradiated controls. In spite of evaluating more than a quarter of a million metaphases, we were unable to detect any increase in the mean, median or range in chromosome aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from a group of Estonian men who took part in the cleanup of the Chernobyl nuclear power site and those who did not. We conclude that it is likely that recorded doses for these cleanup workers overestimate their average bone marrow doses, perhaps substantially. These results are consistent with several negative studies of cancer incidence in Chernobyl cleanup workers and, if borne out, suggest that future studies may not be sufficiently powerful to detect increases in leukemia or cancer, much less distinguish differences between the effects of chronic compared to brief radiation exposures.",,"['Littlefield, L G', 'McFee, A F', 'Salomaa, S I', 'Tucker, J D', 'Inskip, P D', 'Sayer, A M', 'Lindholm, C', 'Makinen, S', 'Mustonen, R', 'Sorensen, K', 'Tekkel, M', 'Veidebaum, T', 'Auvinen, A', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Littlefield LG', 'McFee AF', 'Salomaa SI', 'Tucker JD', 'Inskip PD', 'Sayer AM', 'Lindholm C', 'Makinen S', 'Mustonen R', 'Sorensen K', 'Tekkel M', 'Veidebaum T', 'Auvinen A', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Tennessee 37830, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Adult', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Estonia/ethnology', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Power Plants', '*Radiation Dosage', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Regression Analysis', 'Smoking', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Ukraine']",1998/08/06 02:03,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/08/06 02:03'],"['1998/08/06 02:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/08/06 02:03 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1998 Aug;150(2):237-49.,"['N01-CP-50520/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-85638-03/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Y01-CP4-0599/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

As helical cytokines with a four helix bundled type topology, they were classified into long chain and short chain groups by Sprang and Bazan. Normal mode calculations were also carried out with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and growth hormone (GH) as members of the long chain group and GCSF and IL-2 and IL-4 as members of the short chain group. For the GCSF families it was found that the fluctuations in the helical region are smaller than in the loop region, and it is clear that on the whole the smaller fluctuation residues belong to a large hydrophobic core region.

It was suggested that the differences in the cytotoxicity might be due to the molecular size of the inhibitors. The succinylation of lysine residue(s) of EBI led to about 50% loss of the trypsin inhibitory activity as compared with the authentic EBI.

Carboxyamidated gastrins bind to the cell surface gastrin/cholecystokinin B (CCK-B) receptor which can be expressed as either a normal or a truncated isoform (delta CCK-B). AIMS: To compare gastrin gene expression with delta CCK-B and total CCK-B (both isoforms) gene expression in both GI and non-GI tract derived human tumour cell lines. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted and gene expression was assayed by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern blotting and hybridisation with specific oligo probes. RESULTS: Gastrin was expressed by 5/5 gastric and 7/8 colorectal cell lines. Coexpression of gastrin CCK-B isoform was found in 80% of gastric and 75% of colorectal cell lines. Non-GI cell lines, with the exception of a lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line, showed no coexpression. The truncated receptor, delta CCK-B, was shown in 3/5 gastric and 5/8 colorectal cell lines and was always coexpressed with gastrin. CONCLUSIONS: The truncated gastrin receptor, delta CCK-B, is coexpressed with gastrin in 8/13 GI tumour cell lines.

Other enzyme activities which were marginally reduced were DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleoside reductase, dihydrofolate reductase, t-RNA polymerase, and nucleoside kinases. Pyrimidine nucleotide pools were not reduced but DNA strand scission occurred after 24 h incubation with the agents. The amine-carboxyboranes were not DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors at 100 microM. The agents did not cause DNA protein linked breaks themselves; nevertheless, VP-16 [etoposide] induced DNA protein linked breaks were increased two fold in the presence of the agents suggesting synergistic effects. The amine-carboxyboranes decreased protein kinase C mediated phosphorylation of L1210 topoisomerase II protein, potentially decreasing its enzymatic catalytic activity. Thus, the amine-carboxyboranes did not function like VP-16 in affording cleavable products but were synergistic with VP-16 in causing DNA fragmentation.

We studied 8 Japanese JCML patients without NF1 for mutations in exons 21-36 of the NF1 gene by using polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.

Mice carrying a targeted mutation of their G-CSFR that reproduces the mutation found in a patient with SCN and AML have been generated. The mutant G-CSFR allele is expressed in a myeloid-specific fashion at levels comparable to the wild-type allele. Mice heterozygous or homozygous for this mutation have normal levels of circulating neutrophils and no evidence for a block in myeloid maturation, indicating that resting granulopoiesis is normal. However, in response to G-CSF treatment, these mice demonstrate a significantly greater fold increase in the level of circulating neutrophils. This effect appears to be due to increased neutrophil production as the absolute number of G-CSF-responsive progenitors in the bone marrow and their proliferation in response to G-CSF is increased. Furthermore, the in vitro survival and G-CSF-dependent suppression of apoptosis of mutant neutrophils are normal. Despite this evidence for a hyperproliferative response to G-CSF, no cases of AML have been detected to date.

Recognition of these physical late effects raises the issue of related problems in psychological, educational, and behavioural functioning. There is considerable evidence to suggest that children who are younger on diagnosis are more at risk in terms of cognitive and behavioural late effects compared with those who are diagnosed later. Cancer remains a rare disease in children and consequently only those professionals attached to centres specialising in the care of children with cancer are likely to receive a significant number of referrals.

The authors analyzed MIN in de novo acute leukemia and its association with expression of the human MSH3 (hMSH3) gene and point mutations of the N-ras gene. The relation between MIN and disease free survival also was examined. METHODS: The authors studied 43 cases of de novo acute leukemia for MIN at 5 loci. They also examined expression of the hMSH3 gene using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. DNA taken from 36 cases at diagnosis was examined for N-ras mutations. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients' disease free survival. RESULTS: MIN at 1 locus was found in 7 of the 43 cases (16%) (MIN positive [MIN+] group). There was no correlation between MIN+ and decreased hMSH3 gene expression. Four of the 7 MIN+ cases (57%) had a mutation of the N-ras gene compared with only 1 of the 29 MIN- cases (3%). A correlation between N-ras mutations and MIN was detected (P < 0.003). The MIN+ patients had a shorter disease free survival than the MIN- patients (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: MIN may be associated with N-ras mutation in some cases of de novo acute leukemia and influence the duration of disease free survival.,,"['Tanosaki, S', 'Inokuchi, K', 'Shimada, T', 'Dan, K']","['Tanosaki S', 'Inokuchi K', 'Shimada T', 'Dan K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation']",1998/08/05 02:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/08/05 02:04'],"['1998/08/05 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/08/05 02:04 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980801)83:3<475::AID-CNCR16>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Aug 1;83(3):475-81.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,

However, their exact mode of action at the cellular and molecular level is not completely understood. We have shown earlier that the quinone 3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DZQ) leads to the increased expression of p21waf1/cip1/sdi1 protein, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Because p21 has been established as an important negative regulator of the cell cycle, we further investigated the molecular basis of p21 induction by DZQ. Here we report that the induction of p21 by DZQ is regulated at the transcriptional level, and requires the activation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein. In cells that lack functional p53 protein, DZQ-mediated p21 induction is greatly diminished. However, the introduction of a wild type p53 gene into p53-negative cells restores the strong DZQ-inducibility of p21. Restoration of wild type p53 status in HL60 myeloid leukemia cells significantly increases the cells' sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of DZQ. Thus, our results indicate that the p53-p21 pathway may play a central role in mediating the gene-regulatory and cytotoxic effects of aziridinylbenzoquinones.",,"['Wu, R C', 'Hohenstein, A', 'Park, J M', 'Qiu, X', 'Mueller, S', 'Cadenas, E', 'Schonthal, A H']","['Wu RC', 'Hohenstein A', 'Park JM', 'Qiu X', 'Mueller S', 'Cadenas E', 'Schonthal AH']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine and K Norris Jr. Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aziridines/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",1998/08/05 00:00,1998/08/05 00:01,['1998/08/05 00:00'],"['1998/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201930 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Jul 23;17(3):357-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201930.,"['R01HL53467/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29CA74278-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '526-62-5 (ethylenimine quinone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,,,,,,,

The 3'-->5' exonuclease activity of p53 has recently been recognized as a novel biochemical function of this molecule, but the biological significance of this activity remains elusive. Using an in vitro DNA replication assay with purified human DNA polymerases, p53 protein, and defined DNA primer/templates, we demonstrated that the wild-type (wt) p53 protein, but not the mutant p53 protein, specifically enhanced the DNA replication fidelity of polymerase (pol) alpha, an enzyme that lacks 3'-->5' exonuclease activity. The misincorporation of non-complementary deoxynucleotides into DNA by pol alpha was substantially decreased by p53. In contrast, wt p53 showed no significant effect on replication fidelity or the rates of DNA synthesis by human pol epsilon or the bacterial enzyme pol I. Inhibition of 3'-->5' exonuclease activity by guanosine monophosphate (GMP) abolished the ability of p53 to enhance the replication fidelity of pol alpha. Quantitative analyses revealed that the 3'-->5' exonuclease activity of p53 effectively removed mismatched nucleotides from DNA in preference over matched nucleotides. Furthermore, study in intact cells revealed that the wt p53 protein was co-localized with DNA synthesis activity in S phase cells. These results suggest a possibility that the 3'-->5' exonuclease of the wt p53 protein might provide the proof-reading function for DNA pol alpha. The preferential excision of mismatched nucleotides from the replicating DNA strand appears to be a potential biochemical mechanism by which p53 enhances DNA replication fidelity and thereby helps to maintain genomic integrity.",,"['Huang, P']",['Huang P'],"['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase I/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA Replication', 'Exodeoxyribonuclease V', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mutation', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/08/05 00:00,1998/08/05 00:01,['1998/08/05 00:00'],"['1998/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201946 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Jul 23;17(3):261-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201946.,"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.11.5 (Exodeoxyribonuclease V)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",,,,,,,,,,

The impact of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) activity and lipolysis on LDL composition, particularly the changes during hemodialysis, was investigated. METHODS: Blood was drawn from 15 normotriglyceridemic (NTG) and 15 hypertriglyceridemic patients [HTG; triglycerides (TG) < 2.2 mmol/liter] before hemodialysis, during (1.5 hr after the beginning of anticoagulation) and at the end of treatment. In each sample, lipid values and CETP activity were measured. LDL was prepared and characterized by its components and diameters (2 to 16% PAGGE). To investigate the functional properties of LDL, fractions obtained from NTG and HTG patients were incubated with human skin fibroblasts and a cell line of murine macrophages (P388), and cholesterol ester formation rates were measured. RESULTS: In comparison to LDL from NTG patients at baseline, HTG-LDL were enriched in triglycerides (P < 0.02), depleted in cholesterol proportion (P < 0.01) and small in size (P < 0.001). These LDL induced the cholesterol esterification rates (50 micrograms/mL LDL-protein) in a twofold greater unsaturation in macrophages when compared to LDL from NTG patients (P < 0.04). The rates in fibroblasts were reduced by approximately half (P < 0.05). During hemodialysis, LDL were decreased in size (P < 0.001) and depleted in TG (P < 0.01), particularly in the hypertriglyceridemic state. Although CETP activity increased during hemodialysis (P < 0.001), the cholesterol content remained unchanged. When HTG-LDL obtained during hemodialysis were incubated with cells, esterification rates particularly in macrophages were markedly accelerated in comparison to the unmodified lipoprotein at baseline (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LDL from HTG patients with ESRD was TG-enriched, CH-depleted and smaller in size. As the intracellular esterification rates induced by LDL were related to the cellular uptake, these LDL were a superior substrate for murine macrophages with the tendency of intracellular accumulation, and an inferior substrate for fibroblasts suggesting a decreased uptake by the specific receptor pathway. TG-depletion of LDL during hemodialysis, particularly in HTG patients due to a lipase-mediated TG-hydrolysis, increased these effects in macrophages. We suggest that the alterations of LDL that occur during repeated hemodialysis in vivo could contribute to the high prevalence of premature atherosclerosis found in HTG patients with ESRD.",,"['Ambrosch, A', 'Domroese, U', 'Westphal, S', 'Dierkes, J', 'Augustin, W', 'Neumann, K H', 'Luley, C']","['Ambrosch A', 'Domroese U', 'Westphal S', 'Dierkes J', 'Augustin W', 'Neumann KH', 'Luley C']","['Department of Pathobiochemistry, University Hospital of Magdeburg, Germany. andreas.ambrosch@medizin.uni-magdeburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins', 'Cholesterol Esters/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/blood', 'Female', '*Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*analysis/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', '*Renal Dialysis', 'Triglycerides/blood']",1998/08/05 00:00,1998/08/05 00:01,['1998/08/05 00:00'],"['1998/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.00024.x [doi]', 'S0085-2538(15)30677-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 1998 Aug;54(2):608-17. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.00024.x.,,"['0 (CETP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Triglycerides)']",,,,,,,,,,

The use of growth factors as therapeutic agents to accelerate renal regeneration in this setting stems from this observation. In animal models of acute renal injury, administration of epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) accelerates restoration of kidney function and normalization of histology post-acute renal injury and reduces mortality. IGF-I has been safely administered to humans and protects against post-surgical renal dysfunction. Renal cellular apoptosis occurs in a predictable pattern during recovery from acute ischemic injury. Renal apoptosis is regulated by agents both intrinsic and extrinsic to the kidney cell. The protooncogene, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia gene product-2 (bcl-2), is an important intrinsic factor. The growth factor, EGF, is an important extrinsic regulator.

This was evidenced by the increase in Vmax for [3H]MTX (methotrexate) influx and a commensurate increase in the amount of the 46 kilodalton (kDa) transport protein and reduced folate carrier (RFC-1) mRNA. The variant is resistant to lipophilic antifolates, but shows collateral sensitivity to classical folate analogues. Karyotype analysis of L1210/R83 cells revealed the presence of several new chromosome abnormalities. One of these was a large, submetacentric marker chromosome comprising a normal #10 and a longer, abnormally banded arm of uncertain origin which exhibited an interstitial, palely staining, HSR-like segment. The results of Southern and Northern blotting showed that the RFC-1 gene copy number and RNA transcript level were markedly increased (30-35 fold) in L1210/R83 cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the HSR-like segment in these cells was the site of amplified RFC-1 genes. Independent revertant subclones, obtained following growth in the absence of selection pressure, showed four- to 12-fold decreases in [3H]MTX influx Vmax and in amount of NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide)-[3H]MTX affinity labeled one-carbon, reduced folate transporter compared to L1210/R83 cells. RFC-1 gene copy number also decreased, and the mean length of the HSR in these revertants declined 1.6- to 5-fold. Based upon genomic nucleotide sequencing, the RFC-1 gene in the normal mouse genome was localized to chromosome 10 in close association with the alpha 1 (Col18a1) collagen gene at 10B3(locus 41cM).

The presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-12 in human follicular fluid obtained at different stages of maturation was investigated. METHOD OF STUDY: Follicular fluids and granulosa cells were obtained from preovulatory and immature follicles. Follicular fluids from both groups were assayed for IL-12 and LIF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Granulosa cells from preovulatory and immature follicles were treated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in vitro and subsequent LIF and IL-12 production were measured. RESULTS: The average concentration of LIF was significantly higher in preovulatory follicles (7.6 +/- 1.3 pg/ml, n = 24) than in immature follicles (2.0 +/- 1.3 pg/ml, n = 6). The concentration of IL-12 was significantly higher in follicular fluid obtained from immature follicles (10.9 +/- 5.0 pg/ml) than in preovulatory follicles (1.3 +/- 0.4 pg/ml). hCG only stimulated LIF production from mature granulosa cells; it had no effect on IL-12 production.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes expressed both caspase-3 and apoptotic protease activating factor 1. Incubation of the lymphocytes with 2CdA induced caspase-3 activation prior to DNA degradation and cell death.

The factors screened for in this preliminary investigation, namely platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have each been identified to impact on early embryo development or are secreted by embryos themselves, suggesting an autocrine regulatory role. Vero cell culture supernatants were collected at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days after seeding. Samples were assessed by enzyme-linked immunoassay for growth factor/cytokine secretion at each designated time interval. Conditioned medium from all days contained IL-6, PDGF and LIF. The concentration of IL-6 increased from 294 pg/well on day 2 to almost 1600 pg/well on day 6.

Retrospective evaluation of medium supernatants collected at the time of transfer from co-cultures from 11 randomly selected patients showed considerable patient-to-patient variation in concentrations of secreted growth factors and cytokines. These findings indicate that during the co-culture interval embryos are exposed to a dynamic environment, with increasing concentrations of growth factors and cytokines.

Cytotoxic efficacy was measured by the MTT cell survival assay. All cell lines were found to be sensitive, except the multipotential CML-derived K-562 cell line. Flow cytometry of HL-60 cells showed a significant decrease of cells in S phase and the formation of a sub-G fraction. DNA fragmentation typical for programmed cell death was detected by DNA gel electrophoresis in these cells but not in any of the other leukemic lines. At concentrations below the cytotoxic range, mitogenic effects were seen in HL-60 cells after 14-hr exposure. Colony formation by K-562 cells revealed an augmented clonogenicity after exposure to APC with a short alkyl chain. In contrast, cells of lymphoid origin did not undergo DNA fragmentation or show mitogenic stimulation after exposure to APC. Normal bone marrow cells were also investigated for mitogenic and genotoxic effects.

This study investigates the efficacy of combinations of interleukin-12 with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, cisplatin or doxorubicin in the murine L1210 leukemia model. Mice inoculated i.p. with 1 x 10(3) or 1 x 10(5) leukemia cells were treated with interleukin-12 and/or chemotherapeutics, and were observed daily for survival. Immunosuppression with X-irradiation or macrophage depletion with injections of silica were used to examine the dependence of the therapeutic effects on the efficiency of the immune system. Treatment with interleukin-12 or one of the studied chemotherapeutics given alone resulted in moderate antileukemic effects. Combination of interleukin-12 with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel produced no augmentation of anti-leukemic effects in comparison with these agents given alone. Combination of interleukin-12 with cisplatin resulted in prolongation of the survival time; however, in the experiment with mice inoculated with 1 x 10(5) leukemia cells, no long-term survivors (>60 days) were observed; on the contrary, combination of interleukin-12 with doxorubicin resulted in 100% long-term survivors. This effect was completely abrogated either by X-irradiation of mice or by macrophage depletion. We also found that doxorubicin augments IL-12-stimulated production of interferon-gamma in vivo. Our observations demonstrating potentiation of the antileukemic effects of the IL-12 and doxorubicin combination suggest that the combined use of these 2 agents could be beneficial in leukemia therapy.",,"['Zagozdzon, R', 'Golab, J', 'Stoklosa, T', 'Giermasz, A', 'Nowicka, D', 'Feleszko, W', 'Lasek, W', 'Jakobisiak, M']","['Zagozdzon R', 'Golab J', 'Stoklosa T', 'Giermasz A', 'Nowicka D', 'Feleszko W', 'Lasek W', 'Jakobisiak M']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Biostructure, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. rzagozd@ib.amwaw.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-12/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Paclitaxel/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/08/04 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/08/04 02:03'],"['1998/08/04 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/08/04 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980831)77:5<720::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980831)77:5<720::aid-ijc10>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 Aug 31;77(5):720-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980831)77:5<720::aid-ijc10>3.0.co;2-5.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four patients were untreated and 29 were studied at 2 months from the last course of fludarabine or chlorambucil; 6 patients, studied after fludarabine therapy, were further evaluated after mobilization with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF. PB of untreated patients showed a median number of CD34+ cells, CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM/10(5) seeded cells and per litre of PB similar to those of normal controls. No differences were also found in the number of clonogenic progenitors/10(5) cells in patients studied before and after therapy, while significantly fewer BFU-E/l of PB were found after fludarabine. The number of circulating CD34+ cells/l of PB was significantly lower in patients treated with fludarabine or chlorambucil compared to untreated patients. BM growth was significantly reduced in untreated CLL patients compared to healthy donors. Treatment with fludarabine or chlorambucil restored BM progenitors at levels similar to those of normal controls; this effect did not occur for CFU-GM in patients treated with fludarabine. Three-colour fluorescence analysis demonstrated a differentiation pattern of CD34+ cells, with a greater expression of CD13 and CD33 after treatment with fludarabine compared to untreated patients and normal controls. In 4 patients previously treated with fludarabine who underwent a successful cyclophosphamide and G-CSF mobilization therapy, 4x10(6) CD34+ cells/kg were collected.

Archetypes include classic neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. This review traces the history of the principal types of dysontogenetic neoplasms and the primitive round cell tumors, Ewing's sarcoma, and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms' tumor were first described in the 19th century but with several different appellations than those we use today. Although some progress was made in the surgical management of Wilms' tumor during the 1940s and 1950s, most of these unique solid neoplasms of childhood were seen as essentially untreatable and inevitably fatal; surgery and perhaps irradiation were the principal therapeutic offerings. The folic acid analogue, aminopterin, was reported in 1948 as inducing the first complete but temporary remission in acute childhood leukemia. The chemotherapeutic era began shortly thereafter with effective chemotherapy in the management of Wilms' tumor with the introduction of dactinomycin. Pathologists were no longer restricted to being purveyors of the death sentence; they were now responsible for differentiating one type of primitive and embryonic neoplasm from another by using a variety of ancillary techniques, including tissue culture, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics. Favorable or unfavorable morphologic types and subtypes of tumors were defined and, together with the pathologic staging, became incorporated into the therapeutic plan and prognostic assessment. During the past 40 years, these tumors progressed from being virtually treatment resistant to having an overall 5-year survival of 70% or greater. Through the cooperative efforts of pediatric hematologists/oncologists, pediatric surgeons, radiation therapists, and pathologists, the primitive and embryonic neoplasms of childhood are now viewed as some of the most treatable and curable of cancers.",,"['Dehner, L P']",['Dehner LP'],"[""Lauren V.

We investigated possible relationship between percentage of expression of HLA-DR, CD38 and CD71 and proliferation rate by DNA analysis of the cell cycle. In a group of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, there was no significant increase of proliferation index of malignant cells compared with control.

To address the possibility that SCL may function upstream of c-kit, we sought to modulate endogenous SCL function in the CD34(+) hemopoietic cell line TF-1, which requires SF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or interleukin 3 for survival. Ectopic expression of an antisense SCL cDNA (as-SCL) or a dominant negative SCL (dn-SCL) in these cells impaired SCL DNA binding activity, and prevented the suppression of apoptosis by SF only, indicating that SCL is required for c-Kit-dependent cell survival. Consistent with the lack of response to SF, the level of c-kit mRNA and c-Kit protein was significantly and specifically reduced in as-SCL- or dn-SCL- expressing cells. c-kit mRNA, c-kit promoter activity, and the response to SF were rescued by SCL overexpression in the antisense or dn-SCL transfectants. Furthermore, ectopic c-kit expression in as-SCL transfectants is sufficient to restore cell survival in response to SF. Finally, enforced SCL in the pro-B cell line Ba/F3, which is both SCL and c-kit negative is sufficient to induce c-Kit and SF responsiveness. Together, these results indicate that c-kit, a gene that is essential for the survival of primitive hemopoietic cells, is a downstream target of the transcription factor SCL.",,"['Krosl, G', 'He, G', 'Lefrancois, M', 'Charron, F', 'Romeo, P H', 'Jolicoeur, P', 'Kirsch, I R', 'Nemer, M', 'Hoang, T']","['Krosl G', 'He G', 'Lefrancois M', 'Charron F', 'Romeo PH', 'Jolicoeur P', 'Kirsch IR', 'Nemer M', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H2W 1R7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/04 00:00,1998/08/04 00:01,['1998/08/04 00:00'],"['1998/08/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.188.3.439 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1998 Aug 3;188(3):439-50. doi: 10.1084/jem.188.3.439.,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,PMC2212476,,,,,,

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blot analyses with a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a zinc finger consensus sequence, we identified a 68 kDa DNA-binding protein specifically induced by BCR/ABL. The peptide sequence of the affinity-purified protein was identical to that of the RNA-binding protein FUS (also called TLS). Binding activity of FUS required a functional BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase necessary to induce PKCbetaII-dependent FUS phosphorylation. Moreover, suppression of PKCbetaII activity in BCR/ABL-expressing cells by treatment with the PKCbetaII inhibitor CGP53353, or by expression of a dominant-negative PKCbetaII, markedly impaired the ability of FUS to bind DNA. Suppression of FUS expression in myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells transfected with a FUS antisense construct was associated with upregulation of the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) and downregulation of interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3R) beta-chain expression, and accelerated G-CSF-stimulated differentiation. Downregulation of FUS expression in BCR/ABL-expressing 32Dcl3 cells was associated with suppression of growth factor-independent colony formation, restoration of G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation and reduced tumorigenic potential in vivo.

The results suggest that the pathogenesis of isolated testicular relapse (T) and testicular relapse with a concurrent bone marrow relapse (T + BM) is likely to be similar. Isolated and non-isolated testicular relapses appeared late after the achievement of remission (T 34 +/- 16 months, T + BM 32 +/- 15 months) in ALL compared to relapses in other locations (CNS 23 +/- 11 months, BM 25 +/- 19 months). The better prognosis after testicular relapses (estimated second event free survival probability, 2-EFS: T 0.63, T + BM 0.32) compared to bone marrow relapse (2-EFS: BM 0.13) further suggests that testicular relapse with a concurrent bone marrow relapse possibly originates from the isolated testicular relapse, and that the isolated testicular relapse is a separate entity and not a manifestation of systemic recurrence. Higher frequencies of isolated and non-isolated testicular relapses (T 9%, T + BM 5%) were observed among boys with onset of ALL in early puberty (10-12 y) compared to those among younger (T 4%, T + BM 2%) and older (T 0%, T + BM 0%) boys.

Rhesus monkey cells infected with HTLV-I were treated with different concentrations of indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, or nelfinavir. The effect of these inhibitors was monitored through their effect on the processing efficiency of the viral Gag protein in cells, the natural substrate for the viral protease. These inhibitors failed to block processing of HTLV-I Gag. To confirm these findings, human cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding infectious copies of HIV-1 and HTLV-I, and the cells were subsequently treated with these same HIV-1 protease inhibitors. At concentrations between 5 and 50 times the IC50 for inhibition of HIV-1 replication, inhibition of HIV-1 Gag cleavage was apparent. In contrast, no effect on HTLV-I Gag processing was seen. At higher concentrations, HIV-1 Gag processing was essentially completely inhibited whereas HTLV-I Gag cleavage was still unaffected. Thus, these inhibitors are not effective inhibitors of HTLV-I Gag processing.

Mononuclear phagocytes are exposed to fibrinous provisional matrix throughout migration into inflammatory foci, so this study was undertaken to determine whether fibrinogen triggers activation of NF-kappa B transcription factors. U937 cells differentiated with PMA in nonadherent culture were shown to express two fibrinogen-binding integrins, predominately CD11b/CD18, and to a lesser extent, CD11c/CD18. Cells stimulated with fibrinogen (10-100 microg/ml)/Mn2+ (50 microM) for 2 h were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NF-kappa B activation, minimal in unstimulated cells, was substantially up-regulated by fibrinogen. Fibrinogen also caused activation of AP-1, but not SP1 or cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) factors. Blocking mAbs against CD18 and CD11b abrogated fibrinogen-induced NF-kappa B activation. To determine the effects on transcriptional regulation, U937 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV-1 enhancer (bearing two NF-kappa B sites) coupled to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 1) PMA for 24 h, inducing CAT activity by 2.6-fold, 2) fibrinogen/Mn2+ for 2 h, inducing CAT activity by 3.2-fold, or 3) costimulation with fibrinogen and PMA, inducing 5.7-fold the CAT activity induced by PMA alone.

Both PMA and the cell-permeable ceramide, C2-ceramide, caused differentiation of U937 cells, but with distinct cell morphology and CD11b/CD14 surface expression. While PMA activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a downstream kinase of Raf-MEK signaling, C2-ceramide activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), an anchor kinase of stress-induced signaling. Furthermore, only C2-ceramide stimulated an induction of cell cycle arrest that was associated with stable expression of p21CIP1 and retinoblastoma nuclear phosphoprotein dephosphorylation. Expression of p21CIP1 and JNK activation were also observed in sphingosine-treated cells, whereas sphingosine did not induce detectable differentiation. Concomitant stimulation with C2-ceramide and PMA resulted in the PMA phenotype, and cell cycle arrest was absent. ERK activation was enhanced by C2-ceramide plus PMA stimulation, whereas the activation of JNK was aborted. Strikingly, the inhibition of MEK with PD98059 altered the phenotype of C2-ceramide- and PMA-stimulated U937 cells to that of cells treated with C2-ceramide alone. Thus, ERK and JNK pathways deliver distinct signals, and the ERK pathway is dominant to the JNK cascade. Furthermore, differentiation and cell cycle arrest caused by C2-ceramide rely on independent signaling pathways, and JNK is an unlikely signaling element for this differentiation.

Some studies have indicated at etiologic role for type 2 cytokines, while others have emphasized the importance of type 1 cytokines. We have used mice deficient in expression of IL-4, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-10, IFN-gamma, or ICSBP-a transcriptional protein involved in IFN signaling-to examine their contributions to this disorder. Our results demonstrate that expression of type 2 cytokines is an epiphenomenon of infection and that IFN-gamma is a driving force in disease progression. In addition, exogenously administered IL-12 prevents many manifestations of disease while blocking retrovirus expression. Interruption of the IFN signaling pathways in ICSBP-/- mice blocks induction of MAIDS. Predictably, ICSBP-deficient mice exhibit impaired responses to challenge with several other viruses. This immunodeficiency is associated with impaired production of IFN-gamma and IL-12. Unexpectedly, however, the ICSBP-/- mice also develop a syndrome with many similarities to chronic myelogenous leukemia in humans. The chronic phase of this disease is followed by a fatal blast crisis characterized by clonal expansions of undifferentiated cells.

However, we were concerned that sphingosine might also interfere with anti-tumor cells of the immune system. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of sphingosine on activation of human monocytes by interleukin-2 (IL-2) for killing of leukemic cells. Monocytes, purified by elutriation and adherence, were activated with IL-2 or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the presence or absence of sphingosine or another inhibitor for 18 h. Then the monocytes were washed and the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium to remove the sphingosine. HL- 60 and K562 leukemic cells were added to the monocyte cultures. Over the next 48 h, the cytotoxic activity of the monocytes towards the leukemic cells was assessed by means of an 111-indium-releasing assay. IL-2-activated monocytes lysed 48 +/- 3% of HL-60 cells and 44 +/- 3% of K562 cells. Sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, and the PKC inhibitor H7 inhibited the activation of monocytes by IL-2, blocking cytotoxic activity against the leukemic cells by approximately 75%. These inhibitors were not toxic to monocytes at the concentrations used. In a PKC assay, sphingosine and H7 inhibited PKC activity in IL-2-treated monocytes.

For this purpose, we measured the occurrence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in nine patients with acute B-lineage leukaemia (ALL) and one with undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL). Eight leukaemias exhibited a diploid karyotype. For each patient, PCR products of 130 polymorphic microsatellite markers, located in subtelomeric areas of every autosomal chromosome arm were analysed to visualize LOH events resulting from reduplication of a single mutated chromosome or from mitotic recombination. These kinds of LOH events contribute most to LOH in model systems but cannot be detected by classical cytogenetic techniques. By comparing allelic PCR products in tumour cells with those in normal cells, LOH was found in tumour cells of one ALL patient at 9p which harbours the known p16INK4A tumour suppressor gene. In the AUL patient, however, LOH was detected at the telomeres of 4q and 21q, suggesting that these sites may contain novel tumour suppressor genes specifically involved in this form of leukaemia. In the DNA of tumour cells from eight out of 10 patients no LOH was detected. This is in contrast with the general assumption that LOH is a frequent phenomenon in ALL. However, some markers at telomeric regions of chromosomes were already homozygous in the control T-cells of several patients. For instance, we found in the DNA of control cells from one patient five consecutive microsatellites on 9p up to 9p43 which were homozygous and in three other patients homozygosity was observed in band 8q24, which includes the MYC gene. These observations indicate that LOH events already are present in non-cancerous putative stem cells and that mitotic recombination may be a very early event in leukaemogenesis.",['Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

We have identified a human gene, named HEX1 forhumanexonuclease 1, by searching the EST database for cDNAs that encode a homolog to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae EXO1 gene product. Based on its homology to this and other DNA repair proteins of the Rad2 family, most notably Schizosaccharomyces pombe exonuclease 1 (Exo1), Hex1 presumably functions as a nuclease in aspects of recombination or mismatch repair. Similar to the yeast proteins, recombinant Hex1 exhibits a 5'-->3' exonuclease activity. Northern blot analysis revealed that HEX1 expression is highest in fetal liver and adult bone marrow, suggesting that the encoded protein may operate prominently in processes specific to hemopoietic stem cell development. HEX1 gene equivalents were found in all vertebrates examined.

Previous studies using two domain switch PKC chimera revealed that the catalytic domains of PKC alpha and betaII contain molecular determinants important for isozyme-specific function (Walker, S. D., Murray, N. R., Burns, D. J., and Fields, A. P. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92, 9156-9160). We have now analyzed a panel of PKC chimeras to determine the specific region within the catalytic domain important for PKC betaII function. A cellular assay for PKC betaII function was devised based on the finding that PKC betaII selectively translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates nuclear lamin B in response to the PKC activator bryostatin. This response is strictly dependent upon expression of PKC betaII or a PKC chimera that functions like PKC betaII. We demonstrate that a PKC alpha/betaII chimera containing only the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids from PKC betaII (betaII V5) is capable of nuclear translocation and lamin B phosphorylation. These results are consistent with our recent observation that the PKC betaII V5 region binds to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a potent and selective PKC betaII activator present in the nuclear membrane (Murray, N. R., and Fields, A. P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11514-11520). Soluble betaII V5 peptide selectively inhibits PG-stimulated PKC betaII activity in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating that PG-mediated activation of PKC betaII involves interactions with the betaII V5 region of the enzyme. We conclude that betaII V5 is a major determinant for PKC betaII nuclear function and suggest a model in which binding of PG to the betaII V5 region stimulates nuclear PKC betaII activity during G2 phase of the cell cycle.",,"['Gokmen-Polar, Y', 'Fields, A P']","['Gokmen-Polar Y', 'Fields AP']","['Sealy Center for Oncology and Hematology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-1048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*chemistry', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylglycerols/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/*chemistry', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/08/01 00:00,1998/08/01 00:01,['1998/08/01 00:00'],"['1998/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.32.20261 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)49054-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Aug 7;273(32):20261-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.32.20261.,['CA56869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphatidylglycerols)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,

The most active compound (ED50 = 8.3 x 10(-9) M) of the 2-pyrazinylcarboxamidobenzoates is 4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8, 8-tetramethylquinoxalyl)carboxamido]benzoic acid (9u), while the most active analogue of the beta-ionylideneacetamidobenzoates is 4-[3-methyl-5-(2',6',6'-trimethyl-1'-cyclohexen-1'-yl)-(2E, 4E)-pentadienamido]benzoic acid (10a, ED50 = 3.2 x 10(-8) M). Our studies identify an absolute requirement for the carboxylic acid moiety on the aromatic ring to be para relative to the amide linkage for activity. Benzoate substitutions in the ortho position relative to the terminal carboxylate (9d,k,r) are well-tolerated; however, a methoxy substituent meta relative to the terminal carboxylate gives rise to only weakly active analogues (9x). Conformational studies (NMR, X-ray crystallography) of the 2-pyrazinylcarboxamidobenzoates indicate that the preferred conformation exhibits a trans-amide bond and an internal hydrogen bond between the quinoxaline N1 and HN amide which locks the torsional angle between C2 and CO in the s-trans conformation. N-Methylation (9y) results in loss of activity. Studies indicate that there is now a cis-amide bond present which redirects the carboxylate toward the pharmacophoric gem-dimethyl groups. The distance between the gem-dimethyl group and the terminal carboxylate appears to be too short to activate the retinoid receptor.

Two forms of recombinant TPO have been developed for clinical use.

Both of these forms have been evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials. Administration of either of these agents elicits an increase in circulating platelet counts by several-fold in patients who have normal hematopoiesis before chemotherapy. The response in platelets is accompanied by a significant increase in bone marrow megakaryocytes, an increase in frequency and the number of bone marrow progenitor cells of multiple cell lineages, and a marked mobilization of progenitor cells into the peripheral blood. The results of early trials suggest that TPO attenuates thrombocytopenia and enhances platelet recovery after chemotherapy. Several clinical trials are investigating the potential of this cytokine to enhance platelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy with or without progenitor cell support, bone marrow transplantation, and leukemia treatment, and for increasing the apheresis yield of platelets in normal donors and cancer patients.

Engineering of cell lines expressing c-mpl provided a sensitive tool for detecting the ligand of Mpl, and led to the molecular cloning of TPO, the long sought proliferation and differentiation factor for the megakaryocytic lineage. Afterwards, signal transduction by Mpl was studied, and the functional elements of the cytoplasmic domain responsible for cell proliferation and differentiation were identified. When studied in various human hematologic malignancies, Mpl expression was shown to be increased in 50% of the patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). In vitro treatment of AML cells by TPO led to proliferation, suggesting that TPO could contribute, at least in part, to abnormal growth of AML cells.

These cytokines exhibit pleiotropic biological activities in, for instance, immune, hematopoietic, and neural systems, and function in a redundant manner owing to the shared usage of gp130. Thrombopoiesis is regulated by a variety of polypeptide factors including some from the IL-6 family. A polypeptide that has the most potent thrombopoietic activity among the thus far identified molecules is thrombopoietin (TPO). TPO exerts its biological functions through its cognate receptor, c-MPL, that interestingly is classified into the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family in which gp130 also belongs. Although each member of the IL-6 family as well as TPO signals through the distinct receptor complex, the underlying signaling mechanism is similar in each case: the first event after cytokine stimulation is dimerization of a respective set of receptor components, and activation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases in the janus kinase (JAK) family then follows. Activation of JAK kinases is the pivotal step to initiate downstream cytoplasmic signaling cascades involving signal transducer and activator of transcription transcription factors and mitogen activated protein kinase.

Current therapeutic results are mostly unsatisfactory and studies reporting high rates of complete remission are probably influenced by selection biases as suggested by the low rate of elderly patients inclusion into cooperative trials. Availability of intensive support including hematopoietic growth factors could stimulate clinicians to manage an increasing number of elderly patients with AML with aggressive programs. However, chemotherapy in the elderly is difficult, costly and usually associated with high morbidity and mortality rate. Therefore, all efforts should be made to identify those subset of elderly patients in whom aggressive treatment may result in a true improvement of disease free and overall survival. The critical analysis of our five years experience, as reported here, seems to suggest that older AML patients displaying unfavourable prognostic factors at diagnosis (i.e., adverse karyotype and high serum LDH levels), but clinically eligible for intensive chemotherapy, do not actually benefit from an aggressive approach. A blind attempt to treat these patients aggressively may be associated with a life threatening toxicity not counterbalanced by an actual survival advantage. We suggest therefore that aggressive treatment should be reserved for elderly AML cases in whom the presence of good prognostic factors at diagnosis predicts that the loss of some patients due to toxicity may be balanced by the achievement of a substantial proportion of long term survivors. Finally, given the biological and clinical heterogeneity of elderly AML patients, a more precise prognostic categorization of these patients would be particularly useful in interpreting future therapeutic results.",,"['Ferrara, F', 'Mirto, S', 'Zagonel, V', 'Pinto, A']","['Ferrara F', 'Mirto S', 'Zagonel V', 'Pinto A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Cardarelli, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/07/31 00:00,1998/07/31 00:01,['1998/07/31 00:00'],"['1998/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809068573 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Apr;29(3-4):375-82. doi: 10.3109/10428199809068573.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,

This report demonstrates the in vitro and in vivo binding of mouse Ig to the surface of malignant B-cells from a patient with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL). In vitro studies showed that K121, a mouse monoclonal antibody, bound to the B-PLL cells via the same low-affinity binding interaction demonstrated to occur between mouse Ig and surface IgM expressed by B-CLL cells rather than in the conventional sense against a specific antigen via its antigen-binding site. With the view to using this phenomenon to target malignant B-cells, it was important to determine whether the low-affinity interaction also occurred in vivo. Infusions of K121 totalling 286 mg were administered to a B-PLL patient over 7 days. Binding of K121 to circulating B-PLL cells was demonstrable after the administration of 36 mg of antibody and was preceded by the appearance of free antibody in the serum. Throughout the period of the infusion, the rapid rise in the peripheral blood white cell count normally observed after leukopheresis was abrogated. However, the count rose markedly after cessation of the antibody infusion in parallel with a decrease in both free and cell-bound K121. There were no observable side effects and no host immune response to either species specific or idiotypic determinants on the mouse Ig was detected. The in vivo binding of mouse Ig together with the previous in vitro data suggest the potential for a novel targeting mechanism using a region of the mouse Ig molecule to target polyreactive Ig expressed by malignant cells in B-CLL and B-PLL.",,"['Weston, K M', 'Mulligan, S P', 'Raison, R L']","['Weston KM', 'Mulligan SP', 'Raison RL']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia. kath.weston@uts.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/immunology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",1998/07/31 00:00,1998/07/31 00:01,['1998/07/31 00:00'],"['1998/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809068572 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Apr;29(3-4):361-73. doi: 10.3109/10428199809068572.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",,,,,,,,,,

Aberrations have been proved to be of diagnostic value and might enhance the pathophysiological insight into the origin of the disease. However, quantitation of protein phosphorylation is currently not feasible in a clinical situation. We developed a flow cytometric methodology which enables for direct investigation of protein phosphorylation in cell populations defined by multi-color flow cytometry. This assay does not only overcome drawbacks of traditional methodologies (e.g. Western blotting) but also allows quantitative analyses even in rare cell populations. We accurately examined phosphorylation levels in different cell populations of hematological interest and especially analyzed CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. CD34+ cells in bone marrow and in cord blood contained similar, low levels of phosphotyrosine. Circulating pheripheral blood system cells PBSC in patients exposed to G-CSF for stem cell mobilization exhibited significantly increased levels of phosphotyrosine. In vitro exposure of CD34+ progenitors to growth factors (G-CSF, IL-3, SCF) raised the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in bone marrow and cord blood. Effects were dose and time dependent. Interestingly, in vivo stimulated CD34+ PBSC could not be further stimulated in vitro. In conclusion, we present a new powerful methodology for analysis of protein phosphorylation in hematological specimens.

Durable complete remission can be achieved at the molecular level for a majority (more than 70%) of patients with CML, when treated at early relapse. Results are less favourable for acute leukemias, although useful responses have been reported. Data are scarce though promising for myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma. Major treatment-associated toxicities are GVHD and bone marrow aplasia. The latter complication can be predicted by evaluating the level of residual donor-derived hematopoiesis. Modification of infused cells (CD8 negative selection or transduction with a suicide gene), addition of peripheral blood stem cells, and early implementation of escalating doses may counteract the complications and increase the response rate. Response rate is variably influenced by the presence of chronic GVHD after initial BMT, T-cell depleted BMT, underlying disease and stage at relapse, and the level of mixed chimerism. DLI is a direct demonstration of the graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). Because GVL after BMT is sometimes the predominant cause of cure, it may be advisable in such situations to redirect the conditioning regimens for BMT towards engraftment and less immediate cytotoxicity.",,"['Helg, C', 'Starobinski, M', 'Jeannet, M', 'Chapuis, B']","['Helg C', 'Starobinski M', 'Jeannet M', 'Chapuis B']","[""Division d'Oncologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/07/31 00:00,1998/07/31 00:01,['1998/07/31 00:00'],"['1998/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809068567 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Apr;29(3-4):301-13. doi: 10.3109/10428199809068567.,,,116,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We extracted usual occupation and cause of death from 88,090 Iowa death certificates for White males aged 20 and older for the years 1987-93. Proportional mortality ratios (PMR), adjusted for age, and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using deaths among nonfarmers to generate expected numbers. We compared lifestyle profiles for farmers and nonfarmers using male controls (n = 1,596) from a population-based case-control study conducted in Iowa from 1986-89. RESULTS: Iowa farmers had deficit PMRs for all-cause cancer mortality (PMR = 0.92, CI = 0.90-0.94) and for lung (PMR = 0.70, CI = 0.66-0.73), liver (PMR = 0.65, CI = 0.50-0.86), and other cancer sites strongly related to smoking and alcohol use.

Younger farmers (aged 20 to 64 years) had excess deaths for colon cancer (PMR = 1.52, CI =1.26-1.85) and skin melanoma (PMR = 1.60, CI = 1.07-2.38), while older farmers (aged 65+ years) had excess deaths for cancers of the pancreas (PMR = 1.18, CI = 1.04-1.34), lip (PMR = 1.58, CI = 0.59-4.21), and leukemia (PMR = 1.26, CI = 1.09-1.46). Since the 1970s, the PMR for stomach cancer has declined to expected values, while the PMRs for prostate, large intestine, pancreas, and Hodgkin's disease have increased; PMRs for other sites are consistent with earlier data. A survey from 1986-89 showed that farmers, compared with nonfarmers, smoked less, used less alcohol, had less formal education, and consumed more total calories, and calories from protein, fat, and meat while consuming fewer calories from fruits and vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: Iowa farmers continue to be at elevated risk of mortality due to certain cancers, and, of particular interest, the risk for prostate and colon cancer appears to be increasing since 1970.",,"['Cerhan, J R', 'Cantor, K P', 'Williamson, K', 'Lynch, C F', 'Torner, J C', 'Burmeister, L F']","['Cerhan JR', 'Cantor KP', 'Williamson K', 'Lynch CF', 'Torner JC', 'Burmeister LF']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Environmental Health, The University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242-1008, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Agriculture', 'Cause of Death', 'Colonic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Humans', 'Iowa/epidemiology', '*Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",1998/07/31 00:00,1998/07/31 00:01,['1998/07/31 00:00'],"['1998/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1008877204830 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1998 May;9(3):311-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1008877204830.,"['N01-CP-51206/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-85614/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA/ES69838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in New Zealand. Cases (aged from zero to 14 years) were ascertained from national databases including the New Zealand Cancer Registry; 303 took part (participation rate, 88 percent). The 303 age- and gender-matched controls were selected randomly from birth records (participation, 69 percent). Mothers were interviewed about appliance exposures (all cases and controls), and 24-hour residential measurements of EMFs were made (leukemia cases and matched controls). RESULTS: For the various appliance exposures, there were some odds ratios (OR) above 1.0 and others below 1.0. For electric blanket use by the child before diagnosis, the adjusted ORs were: leukemia, 2.2 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.7-6.4); central nervous system cancers, ORs = 1.6 (CI = 0.4-7.1); and other solid cancers, OR = 2.4 (CI = 1.0-6.1). Leukemia risk was increased for the highest category of the mean measured bedroom magnetic field (> or = 0.2microT cf < 0.1 microT), with an adjusted OR of 15.5 (CI = 1.1-224). A gradient in OR with exposure was not shown (middle category: OR 1.4, CI = 0.3-7.6), and there was no association with exposure categorized into thirds based on controls' exposure. The adjusted OR for leukemia in relation to the measured daytime room magnetic field (> or = 0.2 microT cf < 0.1 microT) was 5.2 (CI = 0.9-30.8).

We sought to assess the relation of childhood ALL with hygiene conditions, an aspect of socioeconomic development affecting rates of exposure to infectious agents. METHODS: Infection patterns for hepatitis A virus (HAV), an agent with a fecal-oral route of transmission, were used to indicate hygiene conditions in different populations, with emphasis on instructive United States and Japanese data. A catalytic model was fit to these data, estimating the HAV force of infection and age-specific seroprevalence rates over time. These analyses were used to assess the temporal relationship of changes in HAV infection rates to changes in childhood leukemia mortality and incidence rates. RESULTS: We observed an inverse relationship between HAV infection prevalence and rates of childhood leukemia. Further, decreases in the HAV force of infection in the United States and Japan appear to have preceded increases in childhood leukemia rates. We describe a model based on a putative leukemia-inducing agent with a change in infection rate over time correlated with that of HAV that describes well the temporal trends in childhood leukemia rates for White children in the US and for Japanese children. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that improved public hygiene conditions, as measured by decreased prevalence of HAV infection, are associated with higher childhood ALL incidence rates. The model that we present supports the plausibility of the hypothesis that decreased childhood exposure to a leukemia-inducing agent associated with hygiene conditions leads to higher rates of ALL in children by increasing the frequency of in utero transmission caused by primary infection during pregnancy (or by increasing the number of individuals infected in early infancy because of lack of protective maternal antibodies).",,"['Smith, M A', 'Simon, R', 'Strickler, H D', 'McQuillan, G', 'Ries, L A', 'Linet, M S']","['Smith MA', 'Simon R', 'Strickler HD', 'McQuillan G', 'Ries LA', 'Linet MS']","['National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Hepatitis A/*epidemiology', 'Hepatovirus/pathogenicity', 'Humans', '*Hygiene', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/07/31 00:00,1998/07/31 00:01,['1998/07/31 00:00'],"['1998/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1008873103921 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1998 May;9(3):285-98. doi: 10.1023/a:1008873103921.,,,,['Cancer Causes Control. 1998 May;9(3):237-9.

Overall the risks to health appear to be small but a more accurate exposure assessment technique would help evaluate the true extent of any health effects. In this pilot study we aimed to identify and evaluate personal, work and environmental factors and their influence on measured exposure levels with a view to developing a method of reconstructing exposure. Office workers and power utility workers were studied using personal dosimeters to measure magnetic field exposure, along with frequent observation or measurement of factors related to exposure. Factors such as average and closest distance to source, time at position and current flow were combined in a series of metrics to investigate simple models of personal exposure. The results indicate that mean and peak magnetic field exposure levels are linked to current flow and the average distance of a worker from the source of the magnetic field. These factors are more accurate predictors of high exposures than they are of lower and average levels.

Furthermore, hypotheses underlying distinct models are rarely tested. Domestic cats (Felis catus) can be used to compare models and test their predictions, because cat populations show variable spatial structure that probably results in variability in the relation between density and disease transmission. Cat populations also exhibit various dynamics. We compare four epidemiological models of Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV). We use two different incidence terms, i.e. proportionate mixing and pseudo-mass action. Population dynamics are modelled as logistic or exponential growth. Compared with proportionate mixing, mass action incidence with logistic growth results in a threshold population size under which the virus cannot persist in the population. Exponential growth of host populations results in systems where FeLV persistence at a steady prevalence and depression of host population growth are biologically unlikely to occur. Predictions of our models account for presently available data on FeLV dynamics in various populations of cats.

In the present report, the effect of protein binding of a new synthetic cryptophycin analog, LY355703 (cryptophycin 52), is discussed. In handling the compound, it was found to bind extensively to surfaces, and a high degree of plasma protein binding was also observed (about 99% in human plasma). Similarly, while LY355703 displays potent antiproliferative activity against several human tumor cell lines in vitro (IC50s ranging from 12 to 40 pM), the addition of human or bovine serum albumin (BSA) to CCRF-CEM cells adapted to serum-free (UltraCHO) medium markedly reduced its anti-proliferative activity. For example, the IC50s for LY355703 in BSA at 0, 4 and 40 mg/ml were 2, 19 and 34 pM, respectively. In comparison, the IC50 only increased 2-fold (4210-8530 pM) for taxol over the same BSA concentration range. When log phase CCRF-CEM cells were exposed to 1 microM [3H]LY355703, there was a rapid accumulation of drug, so that LY355703 reached steady state within 10 min. The rate of LY355703 uptake in log-phase CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells was a linear function of concentration over a wide range (0.25-50 microM), although the cytotoxicity IC50 was 19 pM. Drug accumulation was not inhibited by sodium azide. Although cryptophycin was observed to bind extensively to albumin, binding did not markedly modulate cryptophycin uptake by CCRF-CEM cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that attention must be given to the binding properties of LY355703 and similar cryptophycins while handling these compounds, and that binding to albumin (and probably other cellular components as well) is a significant factor for interpretation of results both in vitro and in vivo.",,"['Schultz, R M', 'Shih, C', 'Wood, P G', 'Harrison, S D', 'Ehlhardt, W J']","['Schultz RM', 'Shih C', 'Wood PG', 'Harrison SD', 'Ehlhardt WJ']","['Cancer Research Division, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Biological Transport', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', '*Depsipeptides', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Lactones/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Leukemia', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Paclitaxel/toxicity', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/31 00:00,1998/07/31 00:01,['1998/07/31 00:00'],"['1998/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.5.5.1089 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 1998 Sep-Oct;5(5):1089-94. doi: 10.3892/or.5.5.1089.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Lactams)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'I7FQ5A183L (cryptophycin 52)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,

The induction of apoptosis is restricted to a limited concentration range, which, if exceeded, results in cell death by necrosis. While morphological changes typical of apoptosis induced by many agents are readily demonstrable after treatment of lymphoblastoid cells with 3 microM N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide, distinctive features evident using the retinoid include the absence of cell cycle arrest along with the mode and pattern of DNA breakage.

They were found to follow a single bell-shaped distribution of p75 level, with no discrete group of p75-negative neurons. Sensory neurons were then separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting into high- and low-p75 populations, consisting of cells within the highest and lowest 15th percentiles, respectively, of p75 expression levels. The sorted neurons were tested for trkA staining. All high-p75 neurons were positive for trkA, while many low-p75 cells were negative for trkA. The sorted neurons were placed in culture, and their survival in the absence and presence of various neurotrophins was measured. Low-p75 cells were found to have enhanced survival in the absence of neurotrophins, while cells with high p75 levels had reduced survival, compared to the overall population. Almost all high-p75 neurons were rescued with nerve growth factor, whereas less than half of the low-p75 cells were rescued. The slope of the dose response to nerve growth factor did not differ markedly between high- and low-p75 cells. High-p75, but not low-p75, neurons were responsive to neurotrophin-3. There was only a small response to either brain-derived neurotrophic factor or neurotrophin-4 in both high- and low-p75 neurons. All low-p75 neurons, and 68% of high-p75 neurons, survived in the presence of ciliary neurotrophic factor. These results, while consistent with our hypothesis that p75 may act as a death factor in postnatal sensory neurons, also imply a role for p75 in the modulation of trk responsiveness to neurotrophins. They also indicate overlapping neurotrophin responses in sensory neurons, especially in those with high p75 levels. A large proportion of low-p75 cells were not responsive to any of the nerve growth factor-related neurotrophins, suggesting an important role for cytokines such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukaemia inhibitor factor in the survival of sensory neurons.",,"['Barrett, G L', 'Georgiou, A', 'Reid, K', 'Bartlett, P F', 'Leung, D']","['Barrett GL', 'Georgiou A', 'Reid K', 'Bartlett PF', 'Leung D']","['Physiology Department, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Image Cytometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Receptor, trkA', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-4522(98)00006-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00006-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1998 Aug;85(4):1321-8. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00006-2.,,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']",,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of inhibition does not appear to involve tyrosine phosphorylation, hydrolysis of inositol phosphates or calcium flux. Here we report experiments using a molecular approach to assess the role of calcineurin, a serine/threonine phosphatase thought to be the primary pharmacological target of these drugs. Calcineurin's activity requires association of its catalytic (A) subunit with an intrinsic regulatory (B) subunit. We hypothesized that calcineurin-sensitive signalling events should be affected by the depletion of calcineurin B subunits, thereby reducing the number of active A:B complexes. We therefore transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells with an inhibitory (dominant negative) form of the calcineurin A subunit, which binds the calcineurin B subunit with high affinity but does not possess catalytic activity (B subunit knock-out, BKO). In these transfected cells, the dose-response curve for the inhibition of FcepsilonRI-mediated exocytosis by FK506 was shifted to the left, indicating an increased drug sensitivity of BKO-transfected cells.

Cord blood (CB) or bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells were stimulated and transduced in the presence of three cytokines (interleukin 3 [IL-3], IL-6, and stem cell factor [SCF; c-Kit Ligand]). In the supernatant infection protocol, hematopoietic progenitor cells as measured by X-Gal staining of colony-forming unit cells (CFU-Cs) were transduced more effectively with Tasaf (20%) than with psi-Crip (8%). In contrast, there was no difference between these two cell lines in a coculture protocol. However, gene transfer into more primitive CD34+CD38- subsets and in LTC-IC-derived colonies was low. The use of a large number of cytokines including FLT3-L and PEG-rhMGDF increased the transduction efficiency into CD34+CD38(-)-derived CFU-Cs (35% by PCR) or LTC-ICs (10%). A virus pseudotyped with gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope further improved gene transfer to 60 and 48% for LacZ+ CFU-C- and LTC-IC-derived colonies, respectively. These conditions of transduction allowed multilineage engraftment of primitive cord blood cells in NOD-SCID mice. Moreover, 10% (at least) of the human hematopoietic cells recovered from the marrow of these immunodeficient animals were transduced. These data suggest that the efficiency of transduction of human hematopoietic primitive cells can be significantly improved by judicious combinations of recombinant cytokines and high retroviral titers.",,"['Marandin, A', 'Dubart, A', 'Pflumio, F', 'Cosset, F L', 'Cordette, V', 'Chapel-Fernandes, S', 'Coulombel, L', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Louache, F']","['Marandin A', 'Dubart A', 'Pflumio F', 'Cosset FL', 'Cordette V', 'Chapel-Fernandes S', 'Coulombel L', 'Vainchenker W', 'Louache F']","['INSERM U 362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Mice, SCID', '*Retroviridae']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.10-1497 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Jul 1;9(10):1497-511. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.10-1497.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, about 30% of these children relapse with a dismal prognosis. Achievement of complete remission is an essential step in successful therapy. However, patients in complete remission as defined by morphologic criteria can still harbor more than 10(9) leukemic cells. We have recently shown that residual disease is detected in most patients after completion of therapy. The amount of persistent 'indolent' disease that is actually present in a particular patient and the degree to which it must be reduced to maintain a long-term remission is largely unknown. In order to address this question, and hence to tailor efficient therapy in accordance with the needs of the individual patient, a multitude of techniques for the detection of residual disease have been developed over the last few years. The most commonly used techniques are the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. These sensitive assays have revolutionized this area of research.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients were treated between 1980 and 1992. Induction chemotherapy (CT) to achieve complete response (CR) was: French Multicenter Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) protocols (38), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) protocols (20). Thirty patients underwent transplant after achieving CR (allogeneic 12; autologous 18). RESULTS: Forty-six patients (74%) achieved CR and 16 (26%) failed to respond. The patients who received an ALL induction had an 89% CR rate, while the CR rate was 52% in patients who received a NHL-like regimen. With a median follow-up of 93 months (range 36-187), the actuarial overall survival (OS) rate for all patients is 49% at five years and 41% at 10 years, and the actuarial event-free survival (EFS) rate is 45% and 37%. OS and EFS in the grafted population are, respectively, 60% and 56% at five years. Our results also show a trend toward a longer OS in allografted group.

Thyroid carcinoma has proven to be a common SMN. METHODS: In a multicenter study involving 58 hospitals in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, 18 of 239 (7.5%) SMNs documented following first malignant neoplasm (FMN) in childhood were thyroid carcinoma. RESULTS: The age at diagnosis of FMN ranged from 1 to 15 years. Eleven patients were female. Six children had survived Hodgkin disease, seven acute leukemia, two Ewing sarcoma and three various other tumors. Fifteen of the 18 patients had been treated with radiotherapy to the head and neck region. The time interval between treatment and diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma ranged from 4 to 19 years (median 8 years). The carcinoma was papillary in 17 cases and follicular in one. Eleven patients had metastases in the regional lymph nodes at presentation. DISCUSSION: Radiotherapy appears to be an important risk factor in secondary thyroid carcinoma, but it does not explain all cases. The current data are remarkable for the large proportion of patients who received only prophylactic cranial irradiation for ALL and for the three patients who received no irradiation to the head and neck region. Genetic determinants and chemotherapy must also be considered.

PROCEDURE: Musculoskeletal and gross motor function were assessed in a cohort of 36 survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) seen in a pediatric tertiary care referral centre, compared to 36 age and gender matched comparison subjects. Basic gross motor skills were assessed using dimensions D: standing, and E: walking, running, and jumping of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Strength, balance, and running speed and agility were assessed using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP). Hand grip strength and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion were also measured. Findings in the children with ALL were compared by dependent (paired) t-tests to those in age and gender matched children. RESULTS: The GMFM scores for standing were 98.7% and for walking, running, and jumping were 99% of normal. The mean standard scores for the BOTMP were significantly lower than those of the comparison group: strength 11.5 vs. 19.4, balance 9.4 vs. 15.5, and running speed and agility 9.9 vs. 16.6. The ALL subjects had less hand grip strength 156.3 vs. 190.2, and less ankle dorsiflexion 7.5 vs. 16.1 degrees than the comparison group. The survivors of childhood leukemia were able to perform most basic gross motor functions. However, musculoskeletal impairment was evident and levels of motor proficiency were significantly poorer than those of age and gender matched children.

The first strong stop template switch during Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription was studied to examine how template switch acceptor templates are selected. Retroviral vectors with specific alterations in their template switch acceptor regions were constructed, and DNA products templated by these vectors during a single replication cycle were analyzed. The results indicated that maximizing complementarity between the primer strand 3' end and the acceptor template was not the most significant factor in determining a strong stop template switch site. Instead, preferential transfer to the U3/R junction was observed, with as little as one contiguous base-pair of complementarity between the primer terminus and the template strand sufficient to direct template switching to the U3/R junction. These findings suggest that, in contrast to prevailing dogma, a base-pairing-independent mechanism functions in the specific guidance of retroviral strong stop template switch to the U3/R junction. Certain template alterations 3' of the template switch site were at least as disruptive to acceptor template use as was primer-terminal mismatch, suggesting that template structure or primer strand-internal sequences are important determinants of acceptor template selection.

Resveratrol-treated tumor cells exhibit a dose-dependent increase in externalization of inner membrane phosphatidylserine and in cellular content of subdiploid DNA, indicating loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry and DNA fragmentation. Resveratrol-induced cell death is mediated by intracellular caspases as observed by the dose-dependent increase in proteolytic cleavage of caspase substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the ability of caspase inhibitors to block resveratrol cytotoxicity. We also show that resveratrol treatment enhances CD95L expression on HL60 cells, as well as T47D breast carcinoma cells, and that resveratrol-mediated cell death is specifically CD95-signaling dependent. On the contrary, resveratrol treatment of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) does not affect cell survival for up to 72 hours, which correlates with the absence of a significant change in either CD95 or CD95L expression on treated PBLs.

Peripheral blood samples obtained from 15 patients were incubated with fludarabine in the absence or the presence of the anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) G28-5. In 12 patients a significant proportion of apoptotic cells, ranging from 22% to 38% (mean +/- SE: 28.5 +/- 1.6), were detected after 3 days of culture. In 9 of these samples, the addition of G28-5 reduced apoptosis by at least 30.1% and by 57.1% +/- 7.8% on average (P = .0077). Because the CD40 antigen activates NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors in B cells, and NF-kappaB/Rel complexes can inhibit cell apoptosis, we investigated whether the antiapoptotic effect of G28-5, in our system, could be related to modulation of NF-kappaB/Rel activity. As expected, B-CLL cells displayed significant levels of nuclear NF-kappaB/Rel activity; p50, RelA, and c-Rel components of the NF-kappaB/Rel protein family were identified in these complexes. After exposure to fludarabine, NF-kappaB/Rel complexes were decreased in the nuclei. The addition of G28-5 upregulated the NF-kappaB/Rel levels. To determine the involvement of NF-kappaB/Rel activity in the G28-5-mediated inhibition of apoptosis, we blocked the transcription factor with a decoy oligonucleotide, corresponding to the NF-kappaB/Rel consensus sequence. Cells incubated with the anti-CD40 MoAb in the presence of the decoy oligonucleotide but not a control oligonucleotide displayed a complete impairment of the G28-5 antiapoptotic effect, indicating that NF-kappaB/Rel activity was required for the inhibition of apoptosis. These results suggest that CD40 triggering in vivo could counteract the apoptotic effect of fludarabine on B-CLL cells and that its neutralization, or the use of NF-kappaB/Rel inhibitors, could improve the therapeutic effect of fludarabine.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Romano, M F', 'Lamberti, A', 'Tassone, P', 'Alfinito, F', 'Costantini, S', 'Chiurazzi, F', 'Defrance, T', 'Bonelli, P', 'Tuccillo, F', 'Turco, M C', 'Venuta, S']","['Romano MF', 'Lamberti A', 'Tassone P', 'Alfinito F', 'Costantini S', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Defrance T', 'Bonelli P', 'Tuccillo F', 'Turco MC', 'Venuta S']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universita Federico II, Napoli, Italia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53717-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 1;92(3):990-5.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,['Blood 1999 Mar 15;93(6):2141'],,,

We have already shown that alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) enhances Fas-R expression on CML progenitor cells, thus increasing their sensitivity to Fas-R agonists. Although it appears that IFN-alpha can prime CML cells for the effects of Fas, the response to IFN-alpha in vivo is not a constant feature in CML patients. We studied the mechanisms of Fas-mediated apoptosis in 11 patients suffering from CML in chronic phase and tried to see whether there was a correlation between in vitro inducibility of apoptosis in CD34(+) CML cells after Fas-R triggering and the clinical response to IFN-alpha. After priming with IFN-alpha, Fas triggering resulted in in vitro suppression of hematopoietic cell growth in seven of eight patients who had optimal hematologic response to IFN-alpha; in the same conditions, no inhibitory response to Fas-R agonist was observed in cells from three of three patients who proved to be poor responders to IFN-alpha. In responders to IFN-alpha, Fas-R agonist induced dose-dependent apoptosis of CD34(+) cells; this effect was associated with a decrease in the bcr/abl protein level. In cells derived from patients with a poor response to IFN-alpha, the rate of apoptosis in culture remained unchanged in the presence of Fas-R agonist and no bcr/abl downmodulation was observed. Finally, we measured bcr/abl mRNA by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and found that decreased bcr/abl protein after Fas triggering was not associated with decreased amounts of specific mRNA, a finding which is consistent with a posttranscriptional regulation of the bcr/abl protein expression.

The microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay provides an automated, continuous means of monitoring apoptosis in a cell population. We used the MiCK assay to determine the chemosensitivities of the human promyelocytic HL-60 and lymphoblastic CEM cell lines and leukemia cells freshly isolated from patients with acute nonlymphocytic (ANLL) or acute lymphocytic (ALL) leukemias. Continuous monitoring of apoptosis in the MiCK assay permits determination of the time to the maximum apoptosis (Tm) and its two components which are initiation time (Ti) and development time (Td). Duration of the three timing components of apoptosis varies from hours to days depending on the drug, drug concentration, and type of target cells. In the MiCK assay, the extent of apoptosis is reported in kinetic units of apoptosis. Kinetic units are determined by the slope of the curve created when optical density caused by cell blebbing is plotted as a function of time. Using the leukemia cell lines, we define the relationship between kinetic units determined by the MiCK assay and the percentage of morphologically apoptotic cells in the culture. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis in Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled preparations of HL-60 and CEM cells was also used to compare with data obtained by the MiCK assay. The feasibility of the MiCK assay of apoptosis as a chemosensitivity test was confirmed by its comparison with a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. We show that samples from 10 ANLL and ALL patients patients tested for sensitivity to various doses of idarubicin (IDR), daunorubicin (DNR), or mitoxantrone (MTA) gave the same percentages of apoptotic cells when calculated by the MiCK assay as when determined by morphological analysis. The MiCK assay was used for dose-response analyses of the sensitivities to IDR, DNR, and MTA of leukemia cells from 4 other patients (2 ANLL and 2 ALL). The results from both cell lines and patient samples indicate that ANLL cells are more sensitive than ALL cells to all three of these chemotherapeutic agents. However, for individual patients the chemosensitivities varied significantly among the three chemotherapeutic agents. These varying responses to IDR, DNR, and MTA indicate that the MiCK assay results can be of potential use in designing a treatment regimen for a specific patient with acute leukemia. Among several drugs of presumed similar efficacy, the MiCK assay can permit the selection of the specific chemotherapeutic agent that causes the most apoptosis in the patient's leukemic cells.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kravtsov, V D', 'Greer, J P', 'Whitlock, J A', 'Koury, M J']","['Kravtsov VD', 'Greer JP', 'Whitlock JA', 'Koury MJ']","['Department of Medicine, the Division of Hematology and the Department of Pediatrics, the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/classification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53715-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 1;92(3):968-80.,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we focused on the importance of MDM2 protein in GM-CSF-dependent versus GM-CSF- independent growth of AML cells. The TF-1 AML cell line, which has both wtp53 and mutant p53 genes, showed GM-CSF-dependent growth; deprivation of GM-CSF resulted in G1 growth arrest and apoptosis. MDM2 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in proliferating TF-1 cells in the presence of GM-CSF and decreased significantly with deprivation of GM-CSF. In contrast, p53 protein increased with GM-CSF deprivation. Ectopic overexpression of MDM2 in TF-1 AML cells conferred resistance to GM-CSF deprivation, and is associated with decreased p53 protein expression. Moreover, a variant of TF-1 cells that grows in a GM-CSF-independent fashion also expressed high levels of MDM2 and low levels of p53.

High concentrations of soluble CD23 and L-selectin are found in the serum of patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Because extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) causes shedding of L-selectin via activation of P2Z/P2X7 receptors expressed on B-CLL lymphocytes, we studied the effect of ATP on shedding of CD23. ATP-induced shedding of CD23 at an initial rate of 12% of that for L-selectin, whereas the EC50 for ATP was identical (35 micromol/L) for shedding of both molecules. Furthermore, benzoylbenzoyl ATP also produced shedding of CD23 and L-selectin with the same agonist EC50 values for both (10 micromol/L). Inactivation of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor by preincubation with oxidized ATP abolished ATP-induced shedding of both molecules. Moreover, KN-62, the most potent inhibitor for the P2Z/P2X7 receptor, inhibited ATP-induced shedding of both CD23 and L-selectin with the same IC50 (12 nmol/L). Ro 31-9790, a membrane permeant zinc chelator that inhibits the phorbol-ester-stimulated shedding of L-selectin, also inhibited shedding of CD23 from B-CLL lymphocytes. However, the IC50 for this inhibition by Ro31-9790 was different for L-selectin and CD23 (83 v 6 micromol/L, respectively). Although L-selectin was completely shed by incubation of cells with phorbol-ester, CD23 was not lost under these conditions.

Although these differences have been recognized for some time, the relationship of the two erythroid lineages to each other is not well established. We have used a model system based on the hematopoietic development of embryonic stem (ES) cells in culture to investigate the origins of the earliest hematopoietic populations. Using ES cells transduced with a retrovirus that overexpresses the HOX11 gene, we have established factor-dependent hematopoietic cell lines that represent novel stages of embryonic hematopoiesis. Analysis of three of these cell lines indicates that they differ with respect to cytokine responsiveness, cell surface markers, and developmental potential. Two of the cell lines, EBHX1 and EBHX11, display the unique capacity to generate both primitive and definitive erythroid progeny as defined by morphology and expression of betaH1 and betamajor globin. The third line, EBHX14, has definitive erythroid and myeloid potential, but is unable to generate cells of the primitive erythroid lineage. Analysis of the cytokine responsiveness of the two lines with primitive erythroid potential has indicated that exposure to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) results in the upregulation of betaH1 and a change in cellular morphology to that of primitive erythrocytes. These findings are the first demonstration of a clonal cell line with primitive and definitive hematopoietic potential and support the interpretation that these lineages may arise from a common precursor in embryonic life. In addition, they suggest that LIF could play a role in the regulation of primitive erythropoiesis.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Keller, G', 'Wall, C', 'Fong, A Z', 'Hawley, T S', 'Hawley, R G']","['Keller G', 'Wall C', 'Fong AZ', 'Hawley TS', 'Hawley RG']","['National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO, USA. kellerg@njc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53704-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 1;92(3):877-87.,['R01 HL48834A/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,

Retrospective molecular monitoring studies using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the specific PML/RARalpha fusion gene, have shown that a positive test usually precedes the occurrence of hematologic relapse. Prospective RT-PCR analyses were performed since 1993 at diagnosis and at preestablished time intervals during follow-up in bone marrow (BM) samples of 163 patients with PML/RARalpha+ APL enrolled in the multicenter Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell' Adulto (GIMEMA) trial AIDA (All-trans retinoic acid plus Idarubicin). Treatment consisted of ATRA and idarubicin for induction followed by three polychemotherapy courses as consolidation. The sensitivity level of the RT-PCR assay for PML/RARalpha, as assessed by serial dilution experiments, was 10(-4). All patients were in hematologic remission and tested PCR- at the end of consolidation. Of 21 who converted to PCR-positive thereafter, 20 underwent hematologic relapse at a median time of 3 months (range, 1 to 14) from the first PCR+ result. Seventeen of these 21 (81%) PCR+ conversions were recorded within the first 6 months postconsolidation. Of 142 who tested persistently PCR- in >/=2 tests after consolidation, 8 had hematologic relapse and 134 remained in complete remission (CR) after a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 6 to 38) postconsolidation. Using a time-dependent Cox model, the relative risk of hematologic relapse of patients who converted to PCR+ was 31.8 (confidence limits 95%, 12.9 to 78.3). Our results indicate that conversion to PCR positivity for PML/RARalpha during remission is highly predictive of subsequent hematologic relapse and highlight the prognostic value of stringent molecular monitoring during the early postconsolidation phase in APL. As a result of the present study, salvage treatment in patients enrolled in the GIMEMA trial AIDA is now anticipated at the time of molecular relapse, defined as the conversion to PCR positivity in two successive BM samplings during follow-up.",['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Diverio, D', 'Rossi, V', 'Avvisati, G', 'De Santis, S', 'Pistilli, A', 'Pane, F', 'Saglio, G', 'Martinelli, G', 'Petti, M C', 'Santoro, A', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Mandelli, F', 'Biondi, A', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Diverio D', 'Rossi V', 'Avvisati G', 'De Santis S', 'Pistilli A', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Martinelli G', 'Petti MC', 'Santoro A', 'Pelicci PG', 'Mandelli F', 'Biondi A', 'Lo Coco F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53694-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Aug 1;92(3):784-9.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,

Using flow cytometry in combination with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we observed that bone marrow CD34(+), CD61(+) cells, blood platelets, and megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines all expressed the CXCR4 receptor. To examine the expression of the CXCR4 receptor on megakaryocyte progenitors (colony-forming units-megakaryocyte [CFU-Meg]), CXCR4-positive and -negative CD34(+) populations were separated from bone marrow and cultured in a plasma clot culture system. A subpopulation of the CFU-Meg was found in the CXCR4-positive fraction. The functional significance of CXCR4 expression on cells of the megakaryocytic lineage was examined by studying the effects of SDF-1alpha on migration and proliferation of megakaryocyte progenitor cells in vitro. We found that SDF-1alpha potently induced megakaryocyte progenitor migration and significantly enhanced adhesion of mature marrow megakaryocytes to endothelium.

It is expressed predominantly in erythrocytes. Consensus binding sites for GATA-1 have been found in the regulatory elements of all erythroid-specific genes examined. GATA-1 protein is required for erythroid differentiation beyond the proerythroblast stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that the overexpression of GATA-1 in murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells alleviates DMSO-induced terminal erythroid differentiation. Hence, there is no induction of globin gene transcription and the cells do not arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of GATA-1 in non-transformed erythroid precursors also affects their proliferative capacity and terminal differentiation, as assayed by adult globin gene transcription. To gain insight into the mechanism of this effect, we studied the levels and activities of regulators of cell-cycle progression during DMSO-induced differentiation. A decrease in cyclin D-dependent kinase activity was observed during the induction of both control and GATA-1-overexpressing MEL cells. However, cyclin E-dependent kinase activity decreased more than 20-fold in control but less than 2-fold in GATA-1-overexpressing MEL cells upon induction. Thus GATA-1 may exert its effects by regulating cyclin E-dependent kinase activity. We also show that GATA-1 binds to the retinoblastoma protein in vitro, but not to the related protein p107, which may indicate that GATA-1 interacts directly with specific members of the cell-cycle machinery in vivo. We conclude that GATA-1 regulates cell fate, in terms of differentiation or proliferation, by affecting the cell-cycle apparatus.",,"['Whyatt, D J', 'Karis, A', 'Harkes, I C', 'Verkerk, A', 'Gillemans, N', 'Elefanty, A G', 'Vairo, G', 'Ploemacher, R', 'Grosveld, F', 'Philipsen, S']","['Whyatt DJ', 'Karis A', 'Harkes IC', 'Verkerk A', 'Gillemans N', 'Elefanty AG', 'Vairo G', 'Ploemacher R', 'Grosveld F', 'Philipsen S']","['MGC-Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Funct,Genes and function,9706385,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Erythroblasts/chemistry/*cytology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/02/01 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-4624.1997.00003.x [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Funct. 1997 Feb;1(1):11-24. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-4624.1997.00003.x.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RBL1 protein, human)', '0 (Rbl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,

Clearly, leukemia cell lines have become important research tools. Here, we have summarized the immunological, molecular and standard cytogenetic features of a panel of well characterized B cell precursor (BCP)-leukemia cell lines which were derived from patients with acute lymphoblastic/undifferentiated leukemia (ALL/AUL) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Following the recently proposed immunological EGIL classification, we assigned our panel of 27 BCP-cell lines to one of the following categories: B-I pro-B cell line; B-II common-B cell line; and B-III pre-B cell line. All cell lines express general B-lineage associated surface markers (HLA-DR, CD22, CD79a) being negative for surface immunoglobulin (Ig); the differences between the subgroups reside in expression of CD10 and cytoplasmic Ig. Several BCP-cell lines show the myelomonocytic cell-associated markers CD13 and/or CD33. These immunologically 'biphenotypic' BCP-cell lines are generally TdT+ CD10+ CD13+ CD19+ CD22+ CD34+ and carry the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation. The BCP-cell lines display surface receptors for interferon-gamma (CD119), interleukin-7 (CD127) and FLT-3 ligand (CD135). All BCP-cell lines examined have complex numerical and structural chromosomal alterations including translocations commonly seen in BCP-ALL such as t(4;11), t(9;22), t(11;19), t(12;21), and t(17;19) involving the fusion genes MLL-AF4, BCR-ABL, ENL-MLL, TEL/ETV6-AML1 and E2A-HLF, respectively. Besides the expected rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain receptor gene, several cell lines also have rearrangements of the T cell receptor genes beta, gamma or delta. While some BCP-cell lines express (aberrantly) myeloperoxidase at the mRNA level, most lines are negative in the immunological or cytochemical staining. Several large series documented the difficulty in establishing such BCP cell lines with success rates in the range of 10-20% (on average 15%). Still, since the establishment of the first bonafide BCP-cell line in 1974 (cell line REH), some 150 cell lines have been established of which, however, only a small percentage have been sufficiently well characterized and described. A higher success rate for immortalizing any given leukemia cell might depend on a closer emulation of the physiological in vivo microenvironment. The possibility to grow in vitro leukemia cells at will would represent ideal experimental systems permitting basic research and patient-specific investigations. In summary, the use of well-characterized BCP-cell lines provide unprecedented opportunities for studying a multitude of biological aspects related to normal and neoplastic B-lymphocytes.",,"['Matsuo, Y', 'Drexler, H G']","['Matsuo Y', 'Drexler HG']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(98)00050-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00050-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Jul;22(7):567-79. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00050-2.,,['0 (Culture Media)'],52,,,,,,,,,

The rHuEPO dose was escalated to daily doses at 2 months, and 300 U kg(-1) body weight given three times a week for another 2 months and continuing therapy after 6 months in responsive patients. Response was measured by elimination of transfusions requirement (partial response, PR) and normal hemoglobin level and complete blood counts (complete response, CR). Observed responses for the 23 evaluable patients were 2 CR and 6 PR (34.8%). Odds ratio analysis showed that patients with anemia alone were 14 times more likely to respond than patients with pancytopenia (p = 0.06). In our study, two patients (8%) transformed to acute leukemia in CRA + AT + rHuEPO-treated patients. Median survival of 34 months with a median follow-up of 17 months (range 3-70 months) was observed.

Bcr/Abl proteins have been suggested to directly activate STATs, without exposure to growth factors. We asked whether STATs play a role in leukemogenesis. We analyzed constitutive and induced patterns of STAT activity in pretreatment blasts from 36 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and studied protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that may be involved in STAT activity, using in vitro and in-gel kinase assays.

The second group was cytokine insensitive. Additionally, we found constitutive PTK activity in two patients whose blasts demonstrated constitutive STAT activity, suggesting that PTKs use cytokine receptor signal pathways to activate STATs in AML blasts without exposure to exogenous cytokines.

ERK2 activation by mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) was necessary for RA-induced differentiation in studies using PD98059 to block MEK phosphorylation. G0 growth arrest and RB tumor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation (which is typically associated with induced differentiation and G0 arrest), two putatively RB-regulated processes, also depended on ERK2 activation by MEK. Activation of ERK2 by RA occurred within hours and persisted until the onset of RB hypophosphorylation, differentiation, and arrest. ERK2 activation was probably needed early, because delaying the addition of PD98059 relative to that of RA restored most of the RA-induced cellular response. In contrast to RA (which activates RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors in HL-60 cells with its metabolite retinoids), a retinoid that selectively binds RAR-gamma, which is not expressed in HL-60 cells, was relatively ineffective in causing ERK2 activation. This is consistent with the need for a nuclear retinoid receptor function in RA-induced ERK2 activation. RA reduced the amount of unphosphorylated RAR-alpha, whose activation is necessary for RA-induced differentiation and arrest. This shifted the ratio of phosphorylated:unphosphorylated RAR-alpha to predominantly the phosphorylated form. Unlike other steroid thyroid hormone receptors susceptible to phosphorylation and activation by MAPKs, RAR-alpha was not phosphorylated by the activated ERK2 MAPK.

Two major forms of the human and mouse BAG-1 proteins were detected by immunoblotting. The longer human and mouse BAG-1 proteins (BAG-1L) appear to arise through translation initiation at noncanonical CTG codons located upstream of and in-frame with the usual ATG codon used for production of the originally described BAG-1 protein. Immunoblotting experiments using normal tissues revealed that BAG-1L is far more restricted in its expression and is present at lower levels than the more prevalent BAG-1 protein. Human but not mouse tissues also produce small amounts of an additional isoform of BAG-1 of intermediate size (BAG-1M) that probably arises through translation initiation at yet another site involving an ATG codon. All three isoforms of human BAG-1 (BAG-1, BAG-1M, and BAG-1L) retained the ability to bind Hsc70. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy studies indicated that BAG-1L often resides in the nucleus, consistent with the presence of a nuclear localization sequence in the NH2-terminal unique domain of this protein. In immunohistochemical assays, BAG-1 immunoreactivity was detected in a wide variety of types of cells in normal adult tissues and was localized to either cytosol, nucleus, or both, depending on the particular type of cell. In some cases, cytosolic BAG-1 immunostaining was clearly associated with organelles resembling mitochondria, consistent with the reported interaction of BAG-1 with Bcl-2 and related proteins. Furthermore, experiments using a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-BAG-1 fusion protein demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 in cultured cells can cause intracellular redistribution of GFP-BAG-1, producing a membranous pattern typical of Bcl-2 family proteins. The BAG-1 protein was found at high levels in several types of human tumor cell lines among the 67 tested, particularly leukemias, breast, prostate, and colon cancers. In contrast to normal tissues, which only rarely expressed BAG-1L, tumor cell lines commonly contained BAG-1L protein, including most prostate, breast, and leukemia cell lines, suggesting that a change in BAG-1 mRNA translation frequently accompanies malignant transformation.",,"['Takayama, S', 'Krajewski, S', 'Krajewska, M', 'Kitada, S', 'Zapata, J M', 'Kochel, K', 'Knee, D', 'Scudiero, D', 'Tudor, G', 'Miller, G J', 'Miyashita, T', 'Yamada, M', 'Reed, J C']","['Takayama S', 'Krajewski S', 'Krajewska M', 'Kitada S', 'Zapata JM', 'Kochel K', 'Knee D', 'Scudiero D', 'Tudor G', 'Miller GJ', 'Miyashita T', 'Yamada M', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Codon, Initiator/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genes, bcl-2/physiology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organelles/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Jul 15;58(14):3116-31.,['CA67329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Codon, Initiator)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,

The tripeptide derivative benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl ketone blocks Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-ase (DEVDase) activity and prevents the occurrence of high molecular weight and oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragments associated with apoptosis in CPT-treated cells. In contrast, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK) does not prevent DEVDase activity and high molecular weight DNA fragmentation but completely abrogates the appearance of oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that caspase 3-like activities are involved with high molecular weight DNA fragmentation pathway, whereas TPCK-sensitive activities are involved in oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation pathway in CPT-treated cells. Electron micrographs reveal that caspase inhibition by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl ketone also abrogates the typical morphological changes associated with apoptosis, whereas TPCK does not delay these morphological changes that are typical of apoptosis. Caspase inhibition slows passage of the cells through G2 and causes a transient accumulation of these cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle following CPT treatment. In a cell-free system, when purified nuclei are incubated with apoptotic cytosolic extracts obtained from CPT-treated U-937 cells, TPCK causes a similar effect in abrogating the oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation but does not affect DEVDase activity. Addition of either benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-free carboxyl group or acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde completely inhibits DEVDase activity in these extracts. However, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde does not affect the occurrence of oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation in the cell-free system, whereas the benzyloxycarbonyl derivatives benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-free carboxyl group, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-free hydroxyl group, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-free hydroxyl group, and benzyloxycarbonyl hydrazide abolish it markedly.

We tested a panel of B-cell antibodies from the Sixth Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen workshop for their capacity to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, often considered to be one of the most potent effector mechanisms in vivo. As effector cells, mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells from healthy donors were compared with Fc gammaRI (CD64)-expressing PMN cells from patients receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. Of the 29 IgG workshop antibodies binding most strongly to the tested malignant human B-cell lines, only 3 consistently induced target cell lysis. These three antibodies were determined to be HLA DR reactive. Experiments with a panel of HLA class II antibodies showed the involvement of individual Fc gamma receptors on effector cells to be strongly dependent on the antibody isotype. We then compared killing mediated by chimeric IgG1 antibodies with that from Fc gammaRI-directed bispecific antibodies, targeting classical HLA class II, or the Lym-1 and Lym-2 antigens. The latter two are variant forms of HLA class II, which are highly expressed on the surface of malignant B cells but which are found only at low levels in normal cells. With blood from G-CSF-treated donors, bispecific antibodies showed enhanced killing compared to their chimeric IgG1 derivatives, because they were more effective in recruiting Fc gammaRI-expressing PMN cells. G-CSF- and Fc gammaRI-directed bispecific antibodies to HLA class II, therefore, seem to be an attractive combination for lymphoma therapy.",,"['Wurflein, D', 'Dechant, M', 'Stockmeyer, B', 'Tutt, A L', 'Hu, P', 'Repp, R', 'Kalden, J R', 'van de Winkel, J G', 'Epstein, A L', 'Valerius, T', 'Glennie, M', 'Gramatzki, M']","['Wurflein D', 'Dechant M', 'Stockmeyer B', 'Tutt AL', 'Hu P', 'Repp R', 'Kalden JR', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Epstein AL', 'Valerius T', 'Glennie M', 'Gramatzki M']","['Department of Medicine III, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/physiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Jul 15;58(14):3051-8.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of CD4+ T-cell depletion on GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia reaction after HLA-matched BMT. CD4 depletion was performed using anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies and immunomagnetic beads, initially in small-scale experiments on bone marrow and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood apheresis products. The result was elimination of the CD4+ T cells from both sources (0% and 2+/-1.4% CD4+ cells, respectively). Subsequently, we used this technique for large-scale negative selection of CD4+ T cells from bone marrow grafts of four consenting leukemic patients in relapse (ALL-3, ANLL-1) (M-3, F-1). The large-scale CD4+ T-cell depletion resulted in >98% (n=4) elimination of CD4+ cells. The resulting population included 17.7+/-4.6% CD3+ T cells, 8.9+/-2.5% CD8+ T cells, 0.1+/-0.1% CD16+ natural killer cells, and 2.3+/-3.2% CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.

However, the influence of this binding on the cellular uptake and photodynamic therapy (PDT) phototoxicity of NPe6 is still undefined. In this paper, we studied how serum in medium affected the P388 cellular uptake and PDT phototoxicity of NPe6 in vitro. This was assessed by (1) detection of the red shift (654 nm Q band peak of absorption) induced by protein binding NPe6; (2) detection of intracellular concentration of NPe6 by HPLC and (3) measurements of the cell survival ratio after PDT by MTT assay. The 654 nm Q band peak of NPe6 shifted to 665 nm after binding of NPe6 and serum proteins. The protein-bound NPe6 cannot be uptaken by cells, thus there was no PDT phototoxicity. Nevertheless, phototoxicity recovered when the concentration of NPe6 excessed the serum protein binding ability or there was free serum protein in the medium. These data suggested that the cellular uptake of NPe6 is inhibited by serum components in the medium, and that only free NPe6 is accumulated by P388 cells even during relatively long incubations. The cytotoxicity of PDT mainly depends on the free NPe6 level in the medium.",,"['Sheyhedin, I', 'Aizawa, K', 'Araake, M', 'Kumasaka, H', 'Okunaka, T', 'Kato, H']","['Sheyhedin I', 'Aizawa K', 'Araake M', 'Kumasaka H', 'Okunaka T', 'Kato H']","['Department of Surgery, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Photobiology', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Porphyrins/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1998 Jul;68(1):110-4.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', 'P4ROX5ELT2 (Talaporfin)']",,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that photodynamic treatment (PDT), using the phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc 4 (HOSiPcOSi[CH3]2[CH2]3N[CH3]2), causes increased ceramide generation and subsequent induction of apoptosis in L5178Y-R (LY-R) mouse lymphoma cells. To test further if ceramide generation accompanies photocytotoxicity, we treated various cell lines with a PDT dose producing a 99-99.9% loss of clonogenicity. Like LY-R cells, human leukemia (U937) cells underwent rapid DNA fragmentation initiating within 1 h after PDT. Similarly, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells showed rapid DNA laddering, beginning 1 h following the treatment. In contrast, mouse radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) cells showed no apoptosis within 24 h post-PDT, as judged by the absence of 50 kbp and oligonucleosome size DNA fragments, as well as no annexin V binding to cells with preserved membrane integrity. Using the same doses of PDT, we observed a time-dependent ceramide accumulation in all three cell lines. While a significant increase in ceramide levels was reached within 1 and 10 min in U937 and CHO cells, respectively, elevated ceramide production was measured only after 30 min in RIF-1 cells. In addition, exogenous N-acetyl-sphingosine was able to mimic PDT-induced apoptosis in U937 and CHO cells.

In this paper, we have addressed this issue by correlating mechanistic studies using laser flash photolysis with cellular phototoxicity data, obtained under the same experimental conditions. In particular, we have focused on the interaction between local concentrations of photosensitizer (deuteroporphyrin) and oxygen in determining the mechanism of phototoxicity in L1210 cells. In cells, as well as in models such as liposomes and red blood cell ghosts, hypochromicity and a reduction in fluorescence and intersystem crossing yields are observed on increasing the photosensitizer concentration between 0.5 and 20 microM, which illustrates the onset of a self-association. In aerated cellular preparations, the phototoxicity is predominantly type II (singlet oxygen) for all concentrations studied but an oxygen-independent mechanism occurs at the higher concentrations in deaerated samples. These observations are readily explained by consideration of triplet state kinetics as a function of oxygen and photosensitizer concentrations in cells. The rate constant for quenching of the photosensitizer triplet state by oxygen in cells was measured as 6.6 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 and by photosensitizer ground state as approximately 10(6) M-1 s-1 (in terms of local concentration). The latter reaction gave rise to a long-lived species that is presumably responsible for the oxygen-independent phototoxicity observed at the higher photosensitizer concentrations used. This self-quenching of the triplet state is postulated to arise from electron transfer resulting in radical ion formation. Under conditions where no self-quenching contributes, the phototoxicity measured as a function of oxygen concentration correlates well with a model based on the determined kinetic parameters, thus, unambiguously proving the intermediacy of singlet oxygen. These effects should be borne in mind when interpreting phototoxicity mechanisms from in vitro cell studies. The excellent correlation achieved between laser flash photolysis data and measured phototoxicity gives credence to the direct use of photophysical techniques to elucidate photochemical mechanisms in biological media.",,"['Aveline, B M', 'Sattler, R M', 'Redmond, R W']","['Aveline BM', 'Sattler RM', 'Redmond RW']","['Department of Dermatology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,"['Animals', 'Dermatitis, Phototoxic/*etiology', 'Electron Transport', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Photolysis', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/29 00:00,1998/07/29 00:01,['1998/07/29 00:00'],"['1998/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1998 Jul;68(1):51-62.,['R01 CA68524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Liposomes)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,

The selectivity of the treatment has been evaluated by mixing PBL and TF-1, an erythroleukemic cell line. Upon photoradiation, this photosensitizer leads to a significant and preferential photokilling of leukemia cells in comparison to normal cells. The use of stimulated lymphocytes in PBL/TF-1 mixtures instead of resting cells also leads to a preferential killing towards TF-1 although activated PBL are more affected than resting PBL.

For females under 20 years old, the RR for acute lymphocytic leukemia was 3.26 (95% CI 1.27-8.15). Elevated RRs were observed for chronic myelogenous leukemia among females and for chronic lymphocytic leukemia among males and females. NHL incidence among women was also associated with the highest TCE stratum (RR = 1.36; 95% CI 1.08-1.70). For diffuse large cell NHL and non-Burkitt's high-grade NHL among females, the RRs were 1.66 (95% CI 1.07-2.59) and 3.17 (95% CI 1.23-8.18), respectively, and 1.59 (95% CI 1.04-2.43) and 1.92 (95% CI 0.54-6.81), respectively, among males. Perchloroethylene (PCE) was associated with incidence of non-Burkitt's high-grade NHL among females, but collinearity with TCE made it difficult to assess relative influences. The results suggest a link between TCE/PCE and leukemia/ NHL incidence.

In hematological malignancies, cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), have been widely used for leukopenia after chemotherapy. However, in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), some leukemic cells may be induced to proliferate by these cytokines and they must be used with care. In this study, we have investigated cell reactivity and proliferation with G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CMF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (TPO) in cases of AML. We have also investigated the reactivity of some myeloid leukemia cell lines to TPO. G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, SCF and TPO caused proliferation of leukemic cells in 25%, 58.3%, 8.3%, 21.1% and 0% of cases, respectively. Because of this result, the use of G-CSF in AML should be regarded as potentially hazardous. TPO did not cause proliferation of leukemic cells in any case of AML, or in cell lines except MO7E, which is a megakaryocytic cell line. This result suggests that TPO might cause proliferation of some megakaryocytic leukemia cells. We cannot conclude that TPO does not cause proliferation of other AML cells, as the number of cases was small and it has been reported elsewhere that leukemia cells may proliferate when exposed to TPO in 50% of AML cases.

Vitamin D3 enhanced monocytic differentiation, with 60% of cells becoming monocytic.

However, only a few CD34+ cells expressed the aberrant markers present on the majority blast population. The CD34- population declined in culture while the CD34+ fraction rapidly expanded. This probably reflects the difference in progenitor content; high numbers of colony-forming cells were concentrated in the CD34+ subpopulation. We conclude that both CD34- and CD34+ populations can differentiate but only the CD34+ fraction proliferates.

The biological effects of RA are mediated by two distinct families of transcription factors: retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RARs and RXRs form heterodimers and regulate retinoid-mediated gene expression. We have recently developed a novel RAR-selective antagonist (ER27191) which prevents RAR activation by retinoids. Using this RAR-selective antagonist, and RXR and RAR agonist, we demonstrate the RAR-mediated signaling pathway is important for differentiation and apoptosis of myeloid leukemic cells. Simple activation of RXRs is not sufficient to induce apoptosis of the cells. Interestingly, the combination of the RAR-selective antagonist and 9-cis RA resulted in partial differentiation and apoptosis of HL-60 and NB4 cells, whereas the RAR antagonist completely blocked all-trans RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis of the cells. Additional experiments showed that levels of BCL-2 protein decreased during differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells. Furthermore, HL-60 cells transduced with a bcl-2 expression vector showed the same differentiation response to retinoids as did parental HL-60 cells even though apoptosis was inhibited in these bcl-2-transduced cells, suggesting that differentiation and apoptosis are regulated independently in myeloid leukemic cells.",,"['Ueno, H', 'Kizaki, M', 'Matsushita, H', 'Muto, A', 'Yamato, K', 'Nishihara, T', 'Hida, T', 'Yoshimura, H', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Ueno H', 'Kizaki M', 'Matsushita H', 'Muto A', 'Yamato K', 'Nishihara T', 'Hida T', 'Yoshimura H', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Anthracenes/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology']",1998/07/25 00:00,1998/07/25 00:01,['1998/07/25 00:00'],"['1998/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698000265 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00026-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Jun;22(6):517-25. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00026-5.,,"['0', '(4-(4,5,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-7,7,10,10-tetramethyl-1-(3-pyridylmethyl)anthra-(1,2-b', ')pyrrol-3-yl)benzoic acid)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,

Nitrite, the stable product of NO, accumulated in the supernatant of Eskol cells after prolonged incubation. Maximal nitrite concentrations (range: 0.8-3.5 microM at 2 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) were detected after 7 days of incubation. NO production was augmented by PHA and reduced by PMA. The inhibitors of NO synthase N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and aminoguanidine decreased NO synthesis. Simultaneous activation with the proinflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta and TNF-alpha, increased NO synthesis.

Mouse models for FA(C) have been developed by replacing exon 8 or exon 9 of Fac with the neo gene. Mice homozygous for Fac mutations show reduced fertility and hypersensitivity to induction of chromosomal aberrations by MMC and DEB. To facilitate the study of cellular defects in vitro, transformed mouse fibroblast cell lines were established. Cell-killing experiments and cytogenetic analyses were performed on these cells following treatment with MMC and DEB. Fac-/- showed significant hypersensitivity to MMC and DEB as compared with Fac+/+ and +/- for both cellular phenotypes.

In childhood leukemia, this influence is male-specific. Two separate studies have shown a male-specific increase in the homozoygosity rate for HLA-DR53 in healthy adults. This finding was attributed to possible preferential transmission of HLA-DR53 towards male offspring. If this is the case, the consequences of such a prenatal event should be evident in the newborn population. The present study investigated HLA-B and -DQA1 genotype frequencies in a sample of 134 newborns (73 boys, 61 girls) in Turkey. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis showed a homozygosity rate of 8.2 percent for HLA-DR53. Nine of 11 homozygotes were boys and the sex-specific rates were 12.3 percent vs 3.3 percent in boys and girls, respectively (p = 0.05). The DR53 homozygosity rate in males was higher than the expected rate (p = 0.02). These findings suggested a prenatal mechanism behind the excess of DR53 homozygotes in the male population.

In a comprehensive series of studies performed with various PKC isozymes derived from a variety of mammalian species, neither chelerythrine nor angoline inhibited activity with high potency. To the contrary, chelerythrine stimulated PKC activity in the cytosolic fractions of rat and mouse brain in concentrations up to 100 microM. In addition, chelerythrine and angoline did not inhibit [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding to the regulatory domain of PKC at concentrations up to 40 microg/ml, and no significant alteration of PKC-alpha, -beta, or -gamma translocation was observed with human leukemia (HL-60) cells in culture.

However, among these tumors, some tumors are in excess: lymphomas, gonadal and extragonadal germ cell tumors, and possibly retinoblastomas and pancreatic and bone tumors. Neoplasms in excess are seen earlier, sometimes in fetal life (leukemias and testicular germ cell tumors) or neonatally (leukemias and lymphoma) and affect mainly male subjects. There seems to exist an excess of rare karyotypes. Other tumors are underrepresented, particularly neuroblastomas and nephroblastomas, in young children, and perhaps common epithelial tumors in adults. These observations suggest that DS has a particular tumor profile, with some tissues more affected by malignant diseases (hematopoietic tissue and germ cells) and others that seem to be protected (central and peripheral nervous system, renal tissue, and epithelial tissues). The mechanism is mainly genetic, but differences in exposure to exogenous agents compared with the general population must be kept in mind.

In the MRP1-overexpressing cell line GLC4/ADR and the MRP1-transfected cell line S1(MRP), MK-571 inhibited CF efflux with high factors [45.9+/-5.8 (mean+/-SD) and 14.4+/-3.2, respectively; n=3; efflux-blocking factors are defined as the ratio of the median fluorescence in presence or absence of MK-571] compared with their MRP1 low-expressing counterparts GLC4 (11.5+/-2.7) and S1 (2.8+/-0.4). In 15 AML cases, the CF efflux-blocking factors of MK-571 varied between 1.9 and 5.2. A good correlation was found between MRP1 protein expression and CF efflux-blocking factors of MK-571 (P=0.013, r=0.39). Besides MRP1, MRP2 was demonstrated with reverse transcription-PCR in 40% of the cases. In contrast to the cell lines, MK-571 also inhibited rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux in AML samples. On the other hand, PSC833, a P-glycoprotein specific inhibitor, did not modulate the CF efflux but is efficient in blocking Rh123 efflux.

The cytotoxicity of ara-C depends on its conversion to the triphosphate ara-CTP. In plasma, a major metabolite of ara-C is its deamination product, arabinosyluracil (ara-U). Both ara-U and ara-U monophosphate have been detected in primary leukemia cells during in vitro investigations. Because other ara-U metabolites, especially the triphosphate (ara-UTP), may serve as additional effectors of cytotoxicity, the present study investigated whether ara-UTP accumulates in circulating leukemia blasts during ara-C therapy. Patients with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia received 2- or 4-h infusions of 0.5 g/m2/h ara-C. Intracellular accumulation of ara-CTP and ara-UTP in circulating leukemia blasts from six patients was quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography, revealing that ara-UTP accumulated during ara-C therapy. The intracellular concentration of ara-UTP ranged from 6-50 microM and was between 2 and 10% of the accumulated ara-CTP. In circulating blasts, ara-UTP was maintained for several hours after the end of ara-C infusion. Leukemia blasts from patients (n=27) were incubated for 1-2 h with 1, 10, or 25 microM [3H]ara-C, and radiolabeled metabolites of ara-C were separated and quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Consistent with data obtained during ara-C therapy, [3H]ara-UTP also accumulated in blasts from all these patients during in vitro incubations with [3H]ara-C. The concentration of ara-UTP after 1 h of incubation ranged from 0.2-40 microM. Incubation of cells with the cytidine deaminase inhibitor tetrahydrouridine did not perturb ara-UTP accumulation, whereas incubation with the deoxycytidylate deaminase inhibitor tetrahydrodeoxyuridine suppressed ara-UTP formation from ara-C. These observations suggested that ara-UTP is generated through deamination of ara-C monophosphate to ara-U monophosphate by deoxycytidylate deaminase, followed by its phosphorylation to ara-UTP. Consistent with these results, incubation of blasts with up to 100 microM [3H]ara-U did not result in ara-UTP accumulation, indicating that ara-U is not phosphorylated directly in these cells. The present study demonstrated that circulating leukemia blasts accumulate ara-UTP during in vitro incubations with ara-C and during ara-C therapy.",,"['Gandhi, V', 'Xu, Y Z', 'Estey, E']","['Gandhi V', 'Xu YZ', 'Estey E']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Uridine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1998/07/24 00:00,1998/07/24 00:01,['1998/07/24 00:00'],"['1998/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Jul;4(7):1719-26.,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '60102-52-5 (ara-UTP)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,

This specific molecular event, amenable to attack with specifically designed inhibitors, has recently been successfully influenced by the drug CGP-57148 in mammalian cells transfected with full-length BCR-ABL gene and expressing full-length p210Bcr-Abl protein, as well as in primary human leukemic cells expressing p210Bcr-Abl fusion protein. In view of the heterogeneity of BCR-ABL transcripts associated with various phenotypes, we investigated the effect of CGP-57148 on p190Bcr-Abl- and p210Bcr-Abl-expressing, patient-derived cell lines and primary intact blast cells. In particular, we were interested in whether the variations in molecular events and/or the phenotype of Ph-positive cells would affect their susceptibility to the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor CGP-57148. We have demonstrated that the sensitivity of human cells with lymphoblastic immunophenotype expressing p190Bcr-Abl protein is comparable to that for leukemic myeloid cells expressing p210Bcr-Abl protein. After documenting profound and phenotype-independent suppression of both autophosphorylation and cell growth, we explored the importance of time and dose of exposure on the manifestation and stability of the induced events. Although there were variations between target cells, in vitro exposure for 24-48 h induced extensive and apparently irreversible apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing but not other normal or BCR-ABL-negative leukemic cells. These findings support the potential use of CGP-57148 to purge Ph-positive cells from autologous bone marrow in vitro. Another important finding was the comparable suppressive effect of temporary CGP-57148 exposure on both clonogenic KBM-5 cells and the whole cell population. Exposure time and dose appeared to be important variables among various cell types. Moreover, effective doses appeared uniformly harmless to cells lacking BCR-ABL protein functioning as tyrosine kinase. Thus, the continuous exposure of target cells, at least during the initial period of 24-48 h, may prove to be an important variable in the design of in vitro and in vivo therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",,"['Beran, M', 'Cao, X', 'Estrov, Z', 'Jeha, S', 'Jin, G', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Talpaz, M', 'Arlinghaus, R B', 'Lydon, N B', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Beran M', 'Cao X', 'Estrov Z', 'Jeha S', 'Jin G', ""O'Brien S"", 'Talpaz M', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Lydon NB', 'Kantarjian H']","['Leukemia Department, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/07/24 00:00,1998/07/24 00:01,['1998/07/24 00:00'],"['1998/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Jul;4(7):1661-72.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,

Relationship to drugs and radiation with specific emphasis on the balanced rearrangements.,483-8,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In therapy-related myelodysplasia (t-MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) balanced chromosome aberrations to bands 11q23 and 21q22 have been significantly related to previous chemotherapy with DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate to what extent other balanced chromosome aberrations show the same association, and to evaluate a possible relationship to patient age and subgroups of drugs. DESIGN AND METHODS: All previously published cases of t-MDS and t-AML with any type of balanced aberration identified from Felix Mitelman's Catalog of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer were analyzed for age and type of previous therapy, and the results were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 422 cases were recorded, 328 had previously received well specified types of chemotherapy; 254 presented one out of five characteristic balanced aberrations, whereas 168 cases presented different uncharacteristic balanced aberrations. In univariate analysis cases with translocations to 11q23 had most often received DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, whereas patients with the uncharacteristic balanced rearrangements most often had received alkylating agents (p < 0.00000001). Inv(16), t(15;17), and t(9;22) were likewise significantly associated with previous therapy with DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors and to almost the same extent as translocations to 21q22. Patients with translocations to 11q23 were significantly younger as compared to all other groups of patients. Translocations to 11q23 predominated following therapy with epipodophyllotoxins, whereas patients with translocations to 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), and t(9;22) most often had received anthracyclines. In a multivariate analysis taking age into consideration, however, these drug-specific associations were no longer significant. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Specific balanced chromosome aberrations in t-MDS and t-AML involving chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), and t(9;22) are all significantly associated with previous therapy with DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, as compared to the uncharacteristic balanced aberrations most commonly observed after therapy with alkylating agents. Younger age and not a specific type of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor seems to predispose specifically to development of t-MDS and t-AML with translocations to chromosome band 11q23.",,"['Andersen, M K', 'Johansson, B', 'Larsen, S O', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard, J']","['Andersen MK', 'Johansson B', 'Larsen SO', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard J']","['Finsen Center, Rigshospitalet-University Hospital, Department of Medical Statistics, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1998/07/24 00:00,1998/07/24 00:01,['1998/07/24 00:00'],"['1998/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Jun;83(6):483-8.,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,

However, membrane expression of this molecule is unique in that it is found on only a subpopulation of neutrophils present in NB1-positive adults. We have investigated the ontogeny of NB1 antigen expression by haematopoietic progenitor cells to determine the stage and pattern of antigen expression during granulocytic cell differentiation. In addition, we examined whether the ontogeny and frequency of granulocytic cells expressing the NB1 antigen might vary in subjects according to age. A monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for NB1 (1B5) and flow cytometry was used to assess the frequency and characteristics of the NB1-positive cells found in umbilical cord blood (n = 11), children (n = 37), healthy adults (n = 46) and patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (n = 8). We also used flow cytometry to isolate NB1-positive and NB1-negative bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from various tissue sources. The separated subpopulations were then analysed by Wright stain and light microscopy. The size of the NB1-positive neutrophil subpopulation in 46 healthy adults (56 +/- 19%) was identical to that found for neutrophils from 36 children ranging in age from 8 months to 18 years (56 +/- 11%). In contrast, expression of the NB1 antigen by the neutrophils present in umbilical cord blood (91 +/- 3%, n = 11) was significantly greater than that in adults (P < 0.002) or children (P < 0.002). We also examined the size of the NB1-positive subpopulation among neutrophils from eight patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). The NB1-positive subset in CML subjects (29.5 +/- 22.4%) was significantly less that in healthy adults (P < 0.02) or children (P < 0.02). Marrow cells from eight adults were similarly separated and analysed. We found that 69 +/- 17% of segmented and band forms of neutrophils, 70 +/- 2% of metamyelocytes and 61 +/- 23% of myelocytes were NB1-positive. In fetal bone marrow, 86 +/- 9% of the segmented and band forms, 82 +/- 10% of the metamyelocytes and 3 +/- 4% of myelocytes were NB1-positive. In conclusion, neutrophil-specific antigen NB1 is first expressed at the myelocyte stage of myeloid differentiation. In adult bone marrow, the percentages of myelocytes, metamyelocytes and segmented or band cells that expressed this antigen were similar and comparable in magnitude to the frequency of NB1-positive neutrophils found in the circulation. Although the size of the NB1-positive neutrophil subpopulation was the same in healthy adults and children, it was significantly increased in umbilical cord blood, and in fetal marrow cells.",,"['Stroncek, D F', 'Shankar, R', 'Litz, C', 'Clement, L']","['Stroncek DF', 'Shankar R', 'Litz C', 'Clement L']","['University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/immunology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoantigens/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface']",1998/07/24 00:00,1998/07/24 00:01,['1998/07/24 00:00'],"['1998/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-3148.1998.00136.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfus Med. 1998 Jun;8(2):119-23. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3148.1998.00136.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD177 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,

Twenty days later, she developed diffuse lung infiltrates and leucoerythroblastosis of the peripheral blood, and her bone marrow was diffusely infiltrated with blasts. The blasts were positive for CD56, CD16 and P-glycoprotein, but lacked cytoplasmic azurophilic granules, T. B and myeloid cell markers on the cell surface, rearrangement of the genes for T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin, and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome. The diagnosis was LBL of NK cell origin. She received aggressive therapy, but died of the lymphoma. In contrast to ordinary NK-cell lymphoma, this case and reported cases of LBL of NK-cell origin showed the following common characteristics. The tumour cells often lack cell surface CD2, cytoplasmic CD3, cytoplasmic azurophilic granules, and EBV genome. The prognosis was extremely poor.

This recombinant fusion toxin preserves the catalytic (c) and membrane translocation (t) domains of DT and includes a sterically neutral peptide linker separating the toxin and growth factor domains. Previous work using DTctGMCSF produced in Escherichia coli has shown that this chimeric toxin is selectively cytotoxic to GMCSF receptor (R)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells both in vitro and in vivo. Its clinical development has been hampered due to very low expression levels, requirements for solubilization with guanidine hydrochloride and subsequent refolding, and concerns about bacterial endotoxin contamination. These difficulties prompted us to investigate the utility of a baculovirus/insect cell expression system for the production of DTctGMCSF. Here, we report that a soluble form of DTctGMCSF can be produced in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) and purified to homogeneity by column chromatography. The BEVS-derived DTctGMCSF fusion toxin caused apoptotic death in GMCSF-R-positive human AML cells at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast to the 100 microg/L yields of purified DTctGMCSF obtained from E. coli, the BEVS allows us to routinely generate 8-10 mg/L of purified DTctGMCSF. This increased capacity provided by the BEVS for the production of DTctGMCSF makes it now possible to obtain sufficient quantities to carry out preclinical and clinical trials.

We studied whether use of high efficiency particulate air filtration (HEPA) and/or laminar airflow (LAF) units affect transplant-related mortality (TRM) or survival in the first year after allogeneic transplantation. 5065 patients with leukemia receiving bone marrow transplants from an HLA identical sibling (n = 3982) or alternative related or unrelated donors (n = 1083) between 1988 and 1992 were reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry by 222 teams. Two types of isolation were considered: (1) conventional protective isolation with single patient room and any combination of hand-washing, gloves, mask and gown; and (2) HEPA and/or LAF. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the relative risks (RRs) of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and of deaths from any cause in patients treated in HEPA/LAF units compared to patients treated in conventional isolation. HLA-identical sibling and alternative donor transplants were analyzed separately. Risks of TRM and overall mortality in the first 100 days post-transplant were significantly lower among patients treated in HEPA/LAF units than in those treated conventionally. RRs of TRM were 0.76 (P = 0.009) for recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants and 0.65 (P = 0.003) for recipients of alternative donor transplants. Correspondingly RRs of overall mortality were 0.80 (P = 0.02) and 0.65 (P = 0.0006). Decreased risks of TRM and of death in the first 100 days post-transplant resulted in significantly higher 1-year survival rates in patients treated in HEPA/LAF rather than in conventional isolation units.

In all cases the clonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the lymph nodes was examined by Southern blot analysis. In addition, anti-ATL antigen (ATLA) determination in the serum or PCR analysis of HTLV-I pX amplification in lymph nodes was also performed. 66/313 (21%) cases with ATLA had no evidence of clonal HTLV-I integration. 572 cases were classified into three groups: (A) cases with clonal integration (247 cases), (B) cases with ATLA without clonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA (66 cases), (C) cases without ATLA (259 cases). Histologically, groups B and C frequently demonstrated large cell type and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinaemia (AILD) type; however, group A tended to show a pleomorphic type. Clinically, group A showed a poorer prognosis than groups B and C. In conclusion, group A cases were defined as ATLL (HTLV-I-associated T-cell lymphoma), whereas group B was classified as T-cell lymphoma, which had coincidently occurred in HTLV-I infected carriers. The simplified classification of REAL indicated clinical outcome: the prognosis of ATLL was poor, the unspecified type was intermediate, whereas the other types of lymphoblastic, AILD and anaplastic large cell type were all relatively favourable.",,"['Ohshima, K', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Sato, K', 'Kanda, M', 'Sugihara, M', 'Haraoka, S', 'Takeshita, M', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Ohshima K', 'Suzumiya J', 'Sato K', 'Kanda M', 'Sugihara M', 'Haraoka S', 'Takeshita M', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/*virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Virus Integration']",1998/07/23 00:00,1998/07/23 00:01,['1998/07/23 00:00'],"['1998/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00761.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Jun;101(4):703-11. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00761.x.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether this is a specific disease or a nonspecific disease that embraces several specific conditions. METHODS: We studied 30 cases diagnosed as Weber-Christian panniculitis and found it possible to make a more specific diagnosis. RESULTS: In 12 patients, findings were compatible with erythema nodosum. Six patients had phlebitis or postphlebitic syndrome. Factitial panniculitis was diagnosed in five patients, and trauma had a role in the conditions of another three patients. Cytophagic panniculitis, lymphoma, and leukemia were recognized in one patient each. The lesion was lobular in almost all cases, and the presence of lipophagia was noted in 19 biopsy specimens. Granulomatous, neutrophilic, and lymphocytic pathologic changes were present in nine, eight, and eight tissue specimens, respectively. CONCLUSION: The recognition of distinct disease patterns of fat lesions as fat necrosis with pancreatic disease, alpha1-antitrypsin panniculitis, lupus and connective tissue disease panniculitis, involution lipoatrophy, lipomembranous panniculitis, factitial panniculitis syndromes, calcification panniculitis, lipophagic lipoatrophy, and cytophagic panniculitis has lessened the need for a less specific panniculitis category.

METHODS: Eight patients were identified retrospectively who had CLL and characteristic skin lesions. Clinical and histologic features were recorded. Skin biopsy specimens were analyzed immunohistochemically for eosinophil granule major basic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, neutrophil elastase, and mast cell tryptase. RESULTS: The clinical features, including the lesional distribution, suggested arthropod bites, although most patients could not recall having been bitten. Mixed T- and B-cell lymphoid cell infiltrates were present within lesions, along with prominent eosinophil infiltration and eosinophil granule protein deposition.

Therapeutic application of 1,25(OH)2D3 to hyperproliferative disease, such as cancer, is thwarted by its hypercalcemic activity. To overcome this problem, analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been produced which retain growth regulating properties and exhibit decreased hypercalcemic activity. In the present study, the efficacy of the vitamin D2 analog, 1,24(S)-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (1,24(S)-(OH)2D2) in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and in inducing differentiation of cancer cells was compared to that of 1,25(OH)2D3. By the [3H]-thymidine incorporation procedure, 1,24(S)-(OH)2D2 is as equipotent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in inhibiting the proliferation of five different cell lines, ROS 17/2.8, the rat osteosarcoma cell line, MCF-7, the human breast cancer cell line, HD-11, the chick bone marrow v myc transformed cell line, HT-29, the human colon cancer cell line and HL-60, the human leukemia cell line. The inhibitory action was dose and time-dependent. The NBT reduction method indicated that 1,24(S)-(OH)2D2 induces the differentiation of the human leukemia cell (HL-60) to the same extent as 1,25(OH)2D3. Notwithstanding the vast similarity between 1,24(S)-(OH)2D2 and 1,25(OH)2D3 with regard to the above activities, they differ in their effects on calcium regulation. In conclusion, the present results encourage the use of 1,24(S)-(OH)2D2 for the treatment of cancer disease in vivo.",,"['Levy, Y', 'Knutson, J C', 'Bishop, C', 'Shany, S']","['Levy Y', 'Knutson JC', 'Bishop C', 'Shany S']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Calcitriol/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chickens', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ergocalciferols/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/23 00:00,1998/07/23 00:01,['1998/07/23 00:00'],"['1998/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 May-Jun;18(3A):1769-75.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '124043-51-2 (1,24-dihydroxyvitamin D2)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,

Hpr expression was found in various tumor cell lines. To determine whether the haptoglobin related protein (hpr) affects the growth of an established T-cell leukemia cell line, an Hpr antisense expression vector that specifically reduces hpr production was constructed. The vector was transfected into BE-13 cells, an established T-cell leukemia cell line in which Hpr is expressed. Three stable clones were isolated in which hpr protein expression was reduced. These established cell lines proliferated more slowly than vector transfected cells in proportion to Hpr antisense mRNA expression and the reduction in hpr protein production. Following a BrdU pulse, flow cytometric analysis was performed to estimate the fraction of cells in S phase. Hpr antisense transfected cells contained less cells in S phase compared to vector transfected cells. Also in soft agar, cells expressing the antisense cDNA insert, formed on average at least 7-fold fewer colonies than cells transfected with the vector alone.

The aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro cytostatic activity of this compound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibition of cell growth and DNA synthesis by mouse leukemia L-1210 (mL), mouse hepatoma Hepa 1-6 (mH), rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 (rH) and human colon adenocarcinoma LS-174T (hCC) cells were measured. The effects on the electrophoretic mobility of the pUC18 plasmid, the DNA denaturation temperature and ethidium bromide (EthBr) binding to DNA were studied. RESULTS: A significant antiproliferative effect for Bamet-H2 was found (mH approximately hCC > mL approximately rH). DNA synthesis was also markedly inhibited (mH approximately hCC approximately mL approximately rH). Bamet-H2-induced a change in the electrophoretic mobility of pUC18 and the increase in DNA denaturation temperature suggested the existence of DNA-Bamet-H2 interactions. Scatchard plots obtained from EthBr displacement assays revealed that Bamet-H2 induces a reduction in both the number of DNA sites available and their ability to bind EthBr. CONCLUSION: Bamet H2 is able to interact with DNA, inhibit DNA synthesis, and hence reduce cell proliferation.",,"['Marin, J J', 'Palomero, M F', 'Herrera, M C', 'Macias, R I', 'Criado, J J', 'Serrano, M A']","['Marin JJ', 'Palomero MF', 'Herrera MC', 'Macias RI', 'Criado JJ', 'Serrano MA']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Salamanca, Spain. jjgmarin@gugu.usal.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Ethidium/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Organometallic Compounds/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/23 00:00,1998/07/23 00:01,['1998/07/23 00:00'],"['1998/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 May-Jun;18(3A):1641-7.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (bamet H2)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",,,,,,,,,,

In normal telophase, the plane of the actin constriction ring is determined by the tubulin spindle. In order to investigate the role of tubulin in the megakaryocyte polyploidization, two cell lines with megakaryocyte properties (DAMI and HEL) were incubated for 4 days in the presence or absence of colchicine (10 ng/ml), an inhibitor of the tubulin spindle. As compared to control conditions, cell cultured in the presence of colchicine reveal an augmentation of cell size, the apparition of multilobed nuclei and an increase in the cytoplasm basophilia, suggesting a megakaryocyte morphology. Furthermore, when cells are cultured in the presence of colchicine, diameters measured by morphometry augment from 17.4 microns +/- 1.7 to 34.5 microns +/- 2.0 and from 27.3 microns +/- 0.3 to 40.2 microns +/- 0.6 for DAMI and HEL cell lines, respectively (p < 0.05 by t-test). After four days of culture in the presence of colchicine, cells undergo arrest proliferation. Ploidy measured by flow cytometry, shows that control cells predominantly diploid (2N) become polyploid with the appearance of 8N, 16N and 32N cells after addition of colchicine. Moreover, the endomitotic index inverted question markmean of (log2 DNA content expressed in N)-l inverted question mark increases significantly from 0.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 and from 0.6 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.0 after treatment with colchicine for the DAMI and HEL cell lines, respectively. To identify the nature of the molecules involved in this phenomenon, both forms of actin (monomeric, G- and polymerized, F-) were evaluated by a DNase I inhibition assay. G-actin contents in pg per 10(6) cells are 13.0 pg +/- 2.8 (m +/- SEM) and 1.0 pg +/- 0.1 for unstimulated DAMI and HEL cells. F-actin contents per 10(6) cells are 5.8 pg +/- 1.5 and 0.1 pg +/- 0.0 for DAMI and HEL cells. The addition of colchicine for four days of culture significantly increased the G-actin content (251% and 475% of controls) and F-actin content (170% and 619% of controls) for DAMI and HEL cell lines, respectively. In contrast, the G/F-actin ratio was not affected by colchicine. DAMI cells from each ploidy class were then sorted on an ELITE Coulter and assayed for actin content. While total actin, G-actin and F-actin per cell were augmented in polyploid cells cultured with colchicine, there was a reduction in G-, F- and total actin contents per diploid equivalent when cells become polyploid. In conclusion, these data suggest that inhibition of the tubulin spindle by colchicine induces polyploidization of megakaryocytes by a reduction of both forms of actin, possibly by preventing the actin constriction ring in the telophase.",,"['Baatout, S', 'Chatelain, B', 'Staquet, P', 'Symann, M', 'Chatelain, C']","['Baatout S', 'Chatelain B', 'Staquet P', 'Symann M', 'Chatelain C']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology and Oncology, UCL, Brussels, Belgium. sbaatout@sckcen.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Colchicine/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Ploidies', '*Polyploidy', 'Tubulin/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/23 00:00,1998/07/23 00:01,['1998/07/23 00:00'],"['1998/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 May-Jun;18(3A):1553-61.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",,,,,,,,,,

Because of the resistance against nucleoside analogue inhibitors such as 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, the importance of the investigation of non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors is increasing. We have investigated the influence of trifluoperazine (TFP--a species of phenothiazines) and its newly prepared TFP-metal complexes (TFP-VO(IV), TFP-Cu(II), TFP-Ni(II), TFP-Pd(II), TFP-Sn(IV)). The compounds were tested on Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase assay. The inhibitory effect of metal complexes was higher than that of TFP.

The data concerning the incidence and progression of MF are rather heterogenous. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and progression of MF in cases of CMPD registered in the Consultation Center for Haematopathology Biopsies in Martin Faculty Hospital. METHODS: Fibrotic changes involving bone marrow were evaluated histologically semiquantitatively using reticulin fiber impregnation (method of Gomori). The study included 77 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), 99 cases of polycythaemia vera (PV), 38 cases of essential thrombocythaemia (ET), and 126 cases of the fourth type of CMPD, mostly known as myelofibrosis/osteomyelofibrosis type (MF/OMF). The occurrence and degree of MF were evaluated at the time of all primary biopsies; in 52 of cases also in rebiopsy material. RESULTS: At the time of primary diagnosis, MF occurred in 37/77 (48%) cases of CML, in 27/99 (27.3%) cases of PV, in 8/38 (21%) cases of ET, and in 119/126 (94.4%) cases of MF/OMF. In repeated (secondary) biopsies, the progression of MF or evolution to MF was most common in CML and MF/OMF types. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of the CMPD diagnosis, more than 50% of cases showed the presence of MF. During the course of CMPD, the MF seems to represent a dynamic process evolving the underlying disease. The early diagnosis of MF is important for the selection of the appropriate therapeutic regimen.

BALB/c mice were immunized with peptides identical to the joining region segment of p210 bcr-abl protein. Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted bcr-abl peptide-specific CD8+ CTLs were elicited. The CTL clones were H-2 Kd restricted and specifically recognized a nonamer peptide of the combined sequence of bcr-abl amino acids but neither bcr nor abl amino acid sequence alone. Despite specificity and substantial lytic potential against syngeneic cell line incubated with exogenously supplied peptides, the bcr-abl peptide-specific CTLs failed to lyse syngeneic murine leukemia cells expressing human p210 bcr-abl protein containing the same bcr-abl joining region peptide sequence. Similarly, the bcr-abl peptide-specific CTLs did not lyse human bcr-abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cells expressing murine class I MHC antigen (i.e., K562 cells infected with vaccinia virus expressing H-2 Kd). The appropriateness of the joining region segment of bcr-abl protein to serve as a T cell target depends upon whether that segment is presented by class I MHC in a concentration high enough to stimulate CTLs. The current experiments using murine peptide-specific CTLs could not establish that the joining region of bcr-abl protein is processed and presented by class I MHC antigen-processing pathway, but the possibility was not ruled out.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantations (SCTs) are performed routinely for a number of hematologic malignancies; however, few patients with indolent lymphoma have been treated with SCT. The high incidence of bone marrow infiltration in the indolent lymphomas has made it difficult to perform autologous SCT. In addition, although indolent lymphomas are initially responsive to chemotherapy, many patients have been heavily pretreated, have become chemotherapy resistant, and have a decreased marrow reserve by the time they are considered for high-dose myeloablative therapy. An advantage of studying the indolent lymphomas is that they are characterized by nonrandom chromosomal translocations and/or clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. These translocations and unique immunoglobulin rearrangements provide clonal markers of disease that can be amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allowing detection and assessment of the clinical significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) after SCT. RESULTS: Studies demonstrate that SCT can be performed safely in patients with indolent lymphomas. Although standard-dose therapy rarely eradicates MRD, high-dose therapy and SCT result in eradication of PCR-detectable MRD in a significant number of patients. Furthermore, eradication of MRD is associated with greatly prolonged disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that our therapeutic goal should be attainment of a ""molecular complete remission"" for cure in these malignancies.",,"['Gribben, J G']",['Gribben JG'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/07/22 00:00,1998/07/22 00:01,['1998/07/22 00:00'],"['1998/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 1998 Jul;4 Suppl 2:S37-45.,,,58,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated, relapsed, or refractory indolent NHL and other indolent lymphoid malignancies who have been treated with purine analogues. RESULTS: Purine analogues have revolutionized the treatment of indolent lymphomas. Fludarabine induces responses in almost 50% of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL and produces complete remissions (CRs) in 10% to 15% of patients. In patients receiving fludarabine as initial treatment, CRs are achieved in almost 40%, with an overall response rate of 70% and a median time to progression > 1 year. Response rates with 2-CdA in previously treated patients appear similar to those with fludarabine, although less durable. Fludarabine and 2-CdA achieve a higher number of durable responses in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia than are generally achieved with alkylating agents in this disease. Pentostatin appears to be less active in NHL. Newer purine analogues currently in clinical trials in lymphomas include gemcitabine and compound 506U. Promising activity has been reported with the combination of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, and fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Combinations of 2-CdA with other agents are also in development. Toxicities associated with these purine analogues primarily include moderate myelosuppression, profound immunosuppression, neurotoxicity at higher than recommended doses, and a possible increase in secondary malignancies. CONCLUSION: The purine analogues should provide the basis for new treatment strategies with the goal of curing patients with indolent NHL.

The sequence comprises 1,224 nucleotides, encoding a 408-residue polypeptide of M(r) 46,312. Alignment of the inferred 4070A IN amino acid sequence with the IN proteins of other MLV showed that substitutions are confined largely to segments within the N- and C-terminal domains. In the N-terminal domain the majority of substitutions occur as contiguous 2- to 6-residue blocks, whereas in the C-terminal domain they occur as isolated entities except within a short segment characterized by deletions/insertions. Selection appears to act on the C-terminal 19 residues of IN rather than on the N-terminal residues of ENV (encoded by overlapping reading frames), suggesting a functional role for this segment. Phylogenetic analyses grouped the sequences into two clusters, one comprising IN from the amphotropic strain 4070A and three ecotropic MLV (CAS-BR-E, Moloney and Friend), the other consisting of IN from three ecotropic MLV (two radiation-induced viruses and AKV) and a mink cell focus-forming (MCF) MLV virus.

However, colocalization of IE1 and PML in PODs is only transient, with both proteins subsequently redistributing into a nuclear diffuse form. These processes are believed to promote efficient viral IE transcription and initiation of DNA synthesis especially at low multiplicities of infection. To examine the mechanism of PML displacement by IE1, we carried out indirect immunofluorescence assay experiments with plasmids expressing intact or deleted forms of PML and IE1 in DNA-transfected cells. The results demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal acidic region of IE1 uncouples the requirements for displacement of both endogenous and coexpressed PML from those needed to target to the PODs. Mutant PML proteins containing either a Cys point mutation within the N-terminal RING finger domain or a small deletion (of positions 281 to 304) within the coiled-coil region did not localize to the PODs but instead gave a nuclear diffuse distribution, similar to that produced by intact PML in the presence of IE1. Endogenous PML also colocalized with IE1 in metaphase chromosomes in HCMV or recombinant adenovirus type 5-IE1-infected HF cells undergoing mitosis, implying that there may be a direct physical interaction between IE1 and PML. Indeed, a specific interaction between IE1 and PML was observed in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and the strength of this interaction was comparable to that of IE2 with the retinoblastoma protein. The RING finger mutant form of PML showed a threefold-lower interaction with IE1 in the yeast system, and deletion of the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML abolished the interaction. Consistent with the IFA results, a mutant IE1 protein that lacks the C-terminal acidic region was sufficient for interaction with PML in the yeast system. The two-hybrid interaction assay also showed that both the N-terminal RING finger domain and the intact coiled-coil region of PML are required cooperatively for efficient self-interactions involving dimerization or oligomerization. Furthermore, truncated or deleted GAL4/PML fusion proteins that retained the RING finger domain but lacked the intact coiled-coil region displayed an unmasked cryptic transactivator function in both yeast and mammalian cells, and the RING finger mutation abolished this transactivation property of PML. Therefore, we suggest that a direct interaction between IE1 and the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML may inhibit oligomerization and protein-protein complex formation by PML, leading to displacement of PML and IE1 from the PODs, and that this interaction may also modulate a putative conditional transactivator function of PML.",,"['Ahn, J H', 'Brignole, E J 3rd', 'Hayward, G S']","['Ahn JH', 'Brignole EJ 3rd', 'Hayward GS']","['Molecular Virology Laboratories, Departments of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytomegalovirus/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Metaphase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells', '*Viral Proteins', '*Zinc Fingers']",1998/07/22 02:13,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/07/22 02:13'],"['1998/07/22 02:13 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/07/22 02:13 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.8.4899 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Aug;18(8):4899-913. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.8.4899.,['R01 AI24576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,PMC109074,,,,,,

In the present study, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 is tightly regulated by the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling pathway. Upon deprivation of survival factor from TF-1 myeloid progenitor cells, Mcl-1 levels quickly dropped prior to visible detection of apoptosis of these cells. Upon restimulation of these deprived cells with GM-CSF, the mcl-1 mRNA was immediately induced and its protein product was accordingly resynthesized. Analysis with Ba/F3 cells expressing various truncation mutants of the GM-CSF receptor revealed that the membrane distal region between amino acids 573 and 755 of the receptor beta chain was required for mcl-1 induction. Transient-transfection assays with luciferase reporter genes driven by various regions of the mcl-1 promoter demonstrated that the upstream sequence between -197 and -69 is responsible for cytokine activation of the mcl-1 gene. Overexpression of mcl-1 delayed but did not completely prevent apoptosis of cells triggered by cytokine withdrawal. Its down regulation by antisense constructs overcame, at least partially, the survival activity of GM-CSF and induced the apoptosis of TF-1 cells.

Both the PML and RARalpha components are required for the PML/RARalpha biological activities, namely its capacity to block differentiation and to increase survival of haematopoietic precursors. The physiological role of PML and its contribution to the function of the fusion protein are unknown. PML localizes to the cytoplasm and within specific nuclear bodies (NBs). In vitro, overexpression of PML correlates with suppression of cell transformation. The PML aminoterminal portion retained within the PML/RARalpha protein contains the RING finger, two newly defined cystein/histidine-rich motifs called B-boxes (B1 and B2) and a coiled-coil region. We report here that PML has a growth suppressive activity in all the cell lines tested, regardless of their transformed phenotype, and that the cellular basis for the PML growth suppression is induction of apoptotic cell death. Analysis of various nuclear and cytoplasmic PML isoforms showed that the PML growth suppressive activity correlates with its nuclear localization. Analysis of the localization and growth suppressive activity demonstrated that: (i) the Ring + B1-B2 and coiled-coil regions are both indispensable and sufficient to target PML to the NBs; (ii) individual deletions of the various PML domains have no effect on its growth suppressor activity; (iii) the Ring + B1-B2 region exerts a partial growth suppressor activity but its fusion with the coiled-coil region is sufficient to recapitulate the suppressive function of wild type PML.

In t(12;21) samples, TEL-AML1 was detected as several protein species in the nuclei, whereas the AML1-TEL protein, was inconsistently expressed. AML1 was found to be expressed but no normal TEL proteins were detected. A survey of the TEL proteins in a panel of human leukemic samples without t(12;21) revealed a variation in the ratio of TEL protein isoforms. We also analysed a leukemic cell line bearing a t(12;22)(p13;q11) that was found to affect the 5' untranslated (UT) region of TEL and to be associated with inactivation of the untranslocated TEL allele. No MN1-TEL fusion could be detected upon RT-PCR analysis, in contrast to the previously investigated t(12;22). Strikingly, extremely low levels of apparently normal TEL proteins, expressed from the translocated allele, were detected by Western blot analysis. These results suggest that the level of TEL expression can be important for leukemogenesis.",,"['Poirel, H', 'Lacronique, V', 'Mauchauffe, M', 'Le Coniat, M', 'Raffoux, E', 'Daniel, M T', 'Erickson, P', 'Drabkin, H', 'MacLeod, R A', 'Drexler, H G', 'Ghysdael, J', 'Berger, R', 'Bernard, O A']","['Poirel H', 'Lacronique V', 'Mauchauffe M', 'Le Coniat M', 'Raffoux E', 'Daniel MT', 'Erickson P', 'Drabkin H', 'MacLeod RA', 'Drexler HG', 'Ghysdael J', 'Berger R', 'Bernard OA']","[""U301 de l'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale and SD No 301 CNRS, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Rabbits', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/22 00:00,1998/07/22 00:01,['1998/07/22 00:00'],"['1998/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201817 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Jun 4;16(22):2895-903. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201817.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,

These genes heterogeneously coexpress in leukemic cell lines and bone marrow samples from patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia at diagnosis.

This effect of etoposide is not observed in K562 cells and bcl-2-transfected U937 cells which are less sensitive to drug-induced apoptosis. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that etoposide increases CASP gene transcription in U937 cells, an effect that is prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression. Upregulation of CASP genes is associated with an enhanced synthesis of related procaspases that precedes the appearance of apoptosis markers including caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation.

However, anemia may occur in the absence of overt infiltration of bone marrow by malignant cells. When all other causes of anemia (such as chronic bleeding, vitamin deficiency, hemolysis, and pure red blood cell aplasia) are eliminated, anemia can be related to ""anemia of chronic disorders."" Myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by cytopenias. Anemia is very frequent, and nearly 90% of patients present with anemia during the evolution of the disease. In this disorder, erythroid progenitors are defective for their proliferation and maturation, as shown by in vitro culture techniques. Moreover, these patients often have a high endogenous serum erythropoietin level. The rationale for treating these patients with epoetin alfa is the possibility of overcoming the defective proliferation by pharmacologic doses of epoetin alfa.

By probing CK2alpha with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we found that CK2alpha can be phosphorylated on tyrosine in quiescent cells. In vitro phosphorylation of CK2alpha-containing immunoprecipitates showed that CK2alpha is substrate of an associated tyrosine kinase activity. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CK2alpha is associated with normal c-Abl in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and with the Bcr-Abl fusion protein in K562 human myeloid leukemia cells.

Here we show that exd function and Dpp/Wg signalling are antagonistic and divide the leg into two mutually exclusive domains. In the proximal domain, exd activity prevents cells from responding to Dpp and Wg. Conversely, in the distal domain, exd function is suppressed by the Dpp/Wg response gene Distal-less (Dll), which prevents the nuclear transport of Exd.

The prototype of this system utilizes an indirect method to label the target cell population. Cells are first labeled with a primary monoclonal antibody directed to a specific cell surface antigen, then with a secondary affinity reagent, consisting of a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM-IgG) that has been cross-linked to a CBP derived from the sequence of the rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. In the presence of Ca2+, the CBP on the cells labeled with GAM-IgG-CBP binds to biotinylated calmodulin (CM-Biotin) with high affinity. The target cells are then captured with a solid-phase streptavidin. The unbound non-target cells are washed away and the immobilized target cells are released by chelating Ca2+ with EGTA. The specificity of the GAM-IgG-CBP and CM-Biotin and the feasibility of using this system to separate cells was demonstrated using the KG-1 human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line. KG-1 cells were fractionated on the basis of cell surface expression of HLA-DR. The cell selection reagents and the cell separation process did not affect KG-1 cell viability while cells selected by this procedure were 90% pure with a yield of 75%. This cell separation system also was used for rare cell isolation from normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T cells expressing the Vbeta5 T cell receptor, which represent < 5% of the unfractionated cells, were isolated with 89% viability, 72% purity, 80% yield, and retained the ability to respond to activation signals as measured by blast transformation. The results from this study show that a cell selection system based on the reversible interaction between CM and a CBP can be applied to gently and efficiently isolate cells from a heterogeneous starting population that are free of the solid matrix without exposure to the stresses of mechanical or enzymatic release.",,"['Colinas, R J', 'Walsh, A C']","['Colinas RJ', 'Walsh AC']","['The Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany 12201-0509, USA. colinas@wadsworth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Biotin', 'CD3 Complex/isolation & purification', 'Calmodulin/*metabolism', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Immobilized', 'HLA-DR Antigens/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/isolation & purification', 'Streptavidin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/22 00:00,1998/07/22 00:01,['1998/07/22 00:00'],"['1998/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S002217599800009X [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(98)00009-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1998 Mar 1;212(1):69-78. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(98)00009-x.,"['ES03778/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES05020/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)', 'EC 2.7.11.18 (Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the T lymphocyte cytokine repertoire of clonogenic T lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte clones were prepared from acute leukaemia patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia (leucocytes <0.5x 10(9)/l). A majority of both CD4+ and CD8+ clones secreted detectable interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10, IL-13, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) in response to phytohaemagglutinin + accessory cells (Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed B cell line, 80-Gy-irradiated). The CD4+ clones showed significantly higher levels of IL-10 secretion than the CD8+ clones. Decreased levels of IL-2, IL-13 and IFNgamma were observed when acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) blasts were used instead of cells from the B cell line as accessory cells during phytohaemagglutinin activation, but the differences in IL-13 and IFNgamma levels were reversed by addition of exogenous IL-2. On the basis of these results we conclude: (i) the remaining clonogenic T lymphocytes derived from acute leukaemia patients with therapy-induced leucopenia can respond to activation with a broad cytokine response, and T-cell-derived cytokines may then contribute to cytokine responses during complicating infections in these patients; (ii) although T cells can modulate AML blast functions and mediate antileukaemic effects, the leukaemia blasts will also modulate T cell functions and alter the cytokine profile of activated T lymphocytes.",,"['Bruserud, O']",['Bruserud O'],"['Medical Department, Haukeland Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytokines/*immunology/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukopenia/*chemically induced/*immunology', 'Lymphopenia/chemically induced/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",1998/07/22 00:00,1998/07/22 00:01,['1998/07/22 00:00'],"['1998/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620050481 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1998 Jun;46(4):221-8. doi: 10.1007/s002620050481.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,

The expression of beta2 microglobulin served as an internal standard. Quantifiable transcripts were observed in 20 patients for MRP, in 5 for MDR1, in 24 for GSTpi, and in 19 for GSTmu. The values ranged from undetectable to 132% of the control A549 cell line for MRP, undetectable to 49% of the HL60/DNR control cell line for MDR1, undetectable to 268% of A549 control cell line for GSTpi, and undetectable to 247% of A549 control cell line for GSTmu mRNA. Increased MRP levels were associated with increased GSTpi and GSTmu levels (p<0.01 for both), and increased levels of MDR1 were associated with increased GSTpi levels (p<0.05). The present observations showed no correlation between the MDR1 and MRP values with treatment outcome, in terms of either achieving a complete remission or predilection to early relapse.

Here, we followed the cleavage of two caspase substrates during NO-intoxication, assaying poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and U1-70kDa small ribonucleoprotein (U1-70kDa) degradation. By using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that Z-aspartyl-2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone (Z-Asp-CH2-DCB; 100 microM), a caspase-like protease inhibitor, completely blocked S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)-induced apoptosis in both RAW 264.7 and U937 cells (IC50 = 50 microM for RAW 264.7 macrophages vs. IC50 = 33 microM for U937 cells). Notably, a characterized caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-CHO) inhibitor left NO-induced DNA fragmentation and the appearance of an apoptotic morphology unaltered, although completely blocking caspase-3 activity. However, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB suppressed protease-mediated U1-70kDa cleavage and DNA fragmentation in parallel. In contrast, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in U937 cells was only delayed by Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, while poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase digestion in RAW 264.7 macrophages proceeded unaltered. We further compared U1-70kDa and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in stably Bcl-2 transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages. Rbcl2-2, a Bcl-2 overexpressing clone, suppressed DNA fragmentation and U1-70kDa digestion in response to GSNO, although allowing delayed but complete poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation. Conclusively, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage not causatively coincided with the appearance of other apoptotic parameters. Our results suggest that NO-induced apoptosis demands a Z-Asp-CH2-DCB inhibitable caspase activity, most likely distinct from caspase-3 and caspase-1. NO-mediated executive apoptotic signaling results in U1-70kDa and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage.

We now show that infection/pulsing of human CD34+ peripheral blood hemopoietic progenitor cell-derived dendritic cells (DCs) with Leishmania donovani promastigotes, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Mycobacterium kansasii impairs the constitutive production of IL-12 from these cells. Thus, strategies aimed at modulating a dysregulated Th1/Th2 response to infection would be of great interest. To both augment the host immune response and deliver potent immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-gamma, our goal is to develop a therapeutic strategy using genetically modified, microbial Ag-pulsed DCs. Toward developing such immunotherapies, we used retrovirus-mediated somatic gene transfer techniques to engineer human DCs to secrete biologically active IL-12 and IFN-gamma. DCs pulsed with microbial antigens (e.g., leishmania and histoplasma Ags) were capable of inducing proliferative responses in autologous CD4+ lymphocytes. CD4+ lymphocytes cocultured with IL-12-transduced autologous DCs had enhanced Ag-specific proliferative responses compared with CD4+ lymphocytes cocultured with nontransduced or IFN-gamma- transduced DCs. In this cell culture model system we demonstrate that IL-12 has a negative effect on IL-4 secretion that is independent of its ability to induce IFN-gamma secretion. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-12-transduced DCs may be specifically suited in inducing or down-modulating Ag-specific Th1 or Th2 responses, respectively, and thus may be useful as adjunctive therapy in those intracellular infections in which a dominant Th1 response is critical for the resolution of infection.",,"['Ahuja, S S', 'Mummidi, S', 'Malech, H L', 'Ahuja, S K']","['Ahuja SS', 'Mummidi S', 'Malech HL', 'Ahuja SK']","['University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284, USA. ahuja@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents/chemistry/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Fungal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Protozoan/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Histoplasma/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Interleukin-12/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leishmania donovani/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mycobacterium kansasii/immunology', 'Th1 Cells/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/immunology']",1998/07/22 00:00,1998/07/22 00:01,['1998/07/22 00:00'],"['1998/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Jul 15;161(2):868-76.,['P50 CA58183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Antigens, Protozoan)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,

SCL is also expressed in endothelial cells, but its function is not essential for specification of endothelial progenitors and the role of SCL in endothelial development is obscure. We isolated the zebrafish SCL homologue and show that it was co-expressed in early mesoderm with markers of haematopoietic, endothelial and pronephric progenitors. Ectopic expression of SCL mRNA in zebrafish embryos resulted in overproduction of common haematopoietic and endothelial precursors, perturbation of vasculogenesis and concomitant loss of pronephric duct and somitic tissue.

We have used the 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as a means of investigating the direct effects of bryostatin and the effects of co-incubating this agent with ara-C on fresh blast cells from 53 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Additional studies evaluated the levels of accumulation and retention of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) in cells exposed to ara-C with and without bryostatin. Cells were exposed to bryostatin at a range of concentrations (0.1-100 nM) for 48 h and at 1 nM for both modulation studies and assessment of ara-CTP production. We found bryostatin to be cytotoxic in 18/58 (31%) tests whilst potentiation of formazan production in the MTT assay was seen in 21/58 (36%) patients. On co-incubation with bryostatin, 16/58 (27%) tests showed increased cytotoxicity to ara-C. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the accumulation of ara-CTP on co-incubation with bryostatin (p = 0.0401).

Using a monoclonal antibody against CD117 antigen (95C3), flow cytometric analysis revealed that approximately 25% of the mobilized PB CD34+ cells coexpress c-Kit. This cell fraction showed a considerable heterogeneity with respect to c-Kit expression, consisting of a small fraction with high levels of c-Kit (4.2%) (CD34+/CD117high fraction) and a larger proportion of cells expressing low levels of this antigen (21.0%) (CD34+/CD117low fraction). Clonogenic assays showed that CD34+/CD117high cell fraction consisted almost exclusively of erythroid progenitors, in contrast to CD34+/CD117low cell subset which gave rise mostly to granulocyte-monocyte colonies. The majority of CFU-GEMM and the most primitive week 6 cobblestone area forming cells (CAFCs) segregated in the CD34+/CD117low cell subset, suggesting the highest content of multipotential progenitors within this cell fraction. None of the sorted cell subsets was able to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). However, ex vivo expansion of the sorted subsets with interleukin 3, stem cell factor and FLT3 ligand for 2 weeks resulted in a significant production of O2- and H2O2/HOCl by CD34+/CD117low cell fraction, compared to the same sorted but not expanded counterparts. According to the major content of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors and highest capacity to generate sufficient amounts of ROI after ex vivo expansion, we suggest that CD34+/CD117low cell subset would be one of the most potential candidates for transplantation in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which lack c-Kit antigen expression.",,"['Kuci, S', 'Taylor, G', 'Neu, S', 'Schumm, M', 'Niethammer, D', 'Handgretinger, R']","['Kuci S', 'Taylor G', 'Neu S', 'Schumm M', 'Niethammer D', 'Handgretinger R']","[""University Children's Hospital, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Tuebingen, Germany. smkuci@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD7/analysis', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1998/07/21 00:00,1998/07/21 00:01,['1998/07/21 00:00'],"['1998/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698000022 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00002-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Apr;22(4):355-63. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00002-2.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,

GPRE were extracted using a high KCl procedure. Blast cells from six AML patients were grown in suspension cultures for 24 and 96 h. GPRE or granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were added at the start of the incubation. GPRE, but not GM-CSF, prevented chromatin condensation and fragmentation of blast cell nuclei in AML-M2, -M4 and -M5 and the loss of nucleoli in AML-M2 and -M5. The fraction of phagocytosing blast cells in AML-M1, -M2, -M4 and -M5 was increased by GPRE. GPRE stimulated opsonin-dependent and -independent attachment and internalisation of N. meningitidis. GPRE increased the fraction of blasts expressing CD11b and CD32 in AML-M2 and -M5. GPRE diminished the fraction of AML-M5 cells bearing CD35 and CD32. GPRE also decreased the fraction of CD11c-bearing AML-M2 and -M5 cells. GM-CSF potentiated effects of GPRE in AML-M1, -M2, -M4 and -M5. GPRE and GM-CSF in combination affected phagocytosis and surface antigen expression in blast cells that were not influenced by either factor alone. Neither GPRE nor GM-CSF induced terminal differentiation or DNA-synthesis. We conclude that GPRE affects AML blast cell morphology, function and surface molecule expression, possibly by inhibiting apoptosis.

The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency and clinical significance of altered lipid profiles in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common form of malignant disease in this age group. METHODS: Fasting blood lipid profiles (cholesterol [C], triglycerides [TG], high density lipoprotein [HDL], low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, apolipoproteins A1 [apo A1] and B, and lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]) were obtained in 24 children with ALL at diagnosis, 16 children during consolidation therapy with L-asparaginase, and 18 children during maintenance therapy without L-asparaginase. For comparison the authors studied lipid profiles in 15 children previously treated for leukemia, 15 healthy control children, and 17 children with other forms of cancer, both localized and widespread. RESULTS: An altered blood lipid profile was observed at the time of diagnosis of ALL. Statistically significant values included elevated TG (1.82+/-1.23 mmol/L), reduced HDL-C (0.54+/-0.24 mmol/L), and reduced ApoA1 (0.77+/-0.18 g/L) levels. A wide range of Lp(a) levels (0-1990 mg/L) were observed. Significantly reduced HDL-C (0.55+/-0.20 mmol/L) and ApoA1 (0.69+/-0.22 g/L) were observed in children with widespread but not localized solid tumors at diagnosis. C and TG correlated with serum albumin levels. Significant therapy-related changes in lipid profiles were observed in children with ALL during combination therapy with L-asparaginase (extremely elevated TG levels [3.34+/-2.82 mmol/L] and a striking reduction in Lp(a) levels) that were not observed during combination therapy without L-asparaginase or in children during treatment for solid tumors. In this small study there was no relation between these abnormalities and either thromboembolic events or pancreatitis. Blood lipid profiles in children with ALL returned to normal on completion of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The lipid abnormalities observed at diagnosis in children with widespread cancer (ALL or solid tumors) may reflect altered nutritional states or altered lipid metabolism. Reduced concentrations of Lp(a) and elevated TG levels suggest L-asparaginase specific alterations and may provide insight into the toxicity associated with this drug.",,"['Halton, J M', 'Nazir, D J', 'McQueen, M J', 'Barr, R D']","['Halton JM', 'Nazir DJ', 'McQueen MJ', 'Barr RD']","[""Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/*blood', 'Male', 'Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism']",1998/07/21 02:17,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/07/21 02:17'],"['1998/07/21 02:17 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/07/21 02:17 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980715)83:2<379::AID-CNCR24>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Jul 15;83(2):379-84.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,

German AML Cooperative Group.,291-301,"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections have increasingly become a matter of concern with regard to patients receiving intensive myelosuppressive therapy for hematologic malignancies. Such infections, especially prolonged neutropenia systemic fungal infections, may contribute substantially to infectious complications and early death. Measures for early detection and effective prophylactic strategies using active and nontoxic antifungal agents are therefore urgently needed. METHODS: The current randomized study was initiated to assess the efficacy of oral fluconazole as systemic antifungal prophylaxis for high risk patients with recurrent acute myeloid leukemia undergoing intensive salvage therapy. RESULTS: Of 68 fully evaluable patients, 36 were randomized to fluconazole in addition to standard prophylaxis with oral co-trimoxazol, colistin sulphate, and amphotericin B suspension, and 32 were randomized to standard prophylaxis only. No major differences between the two groups were observed in the number of episodes of fever of unknown origin (61% vs. 50%) or clinically defined infections (56% vs. 50%). Microbiologically defined infections were more frequent in the fluconazole group (50% vs. 31%), mainly due to a higher incidence of bacteremias (42% vs. 22%). There were two cases of proven invasive fungal infections in each group. Systemic amphotericin B was administered more frequently to patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis (56% vs. 28%). Fluconazole prophylaxis had no impact on the rate of early death or overall survival.

We have established cell culture conditions which allow reproducible measurements of cell proliferation that is dependent on Cbl and its carrier protein, TCII. This bioassay has allowed us to demonstrate that several monoclonal antibodies, raised against TCII, are potent inhibitors of cell proliferation and that excess Cbl abrogates this inhibitory effect. Thus, supporting our hypothesis that interference with Cbl uptake or metabolism will result in inhibition of cell proliferation. Furthermore, Cbl metabolism appears to provide a useful target for antiproliferative strategies which now involve the use of inactive Cbl analogs.

Due to its heavy glycosylation, several different epitopes exist on the molecule. Based on the sensitivity of the glycosylated molecule to degradation with a glycoprotease from Pasteurella haemolytica and neuraminidase, three classes of epitopes have been identified. The class I and II epitopes are probably related to the glycosylated part of the molecule while class III epitopes are core protein related. It has been known for some time that CD34 class I epitopes are absent on CD34 molecules expressed on high endothelial venules. Here we review recent observations that expression of both class I and II epitopes, but not class III epitopes, is impaired on mature myeloid CD34-pos.

In addition, cells from patients with CD34-pos. acute myeloid leukaemia of FAB classification M4-M5, i.e., leukaemic blast cells of relatively mature morphologic phenotype, also express less class I and II epitopes than class III epitopes. It therefore seems that HPC maturation and class I and II epitope deprivation are concomitant events and that CD34 class I and II epitopes are lost prior to downregulation of the CD34 molecule per se.

Acquired resistance to ATRA in APL cell lines and in some APL clinical cases can be partially overcome by interferons (IFNs), cytokines which have well established tumor-growth suppressive activities. APL is associated in 99% of cases with a 15;17 translocation that fuses the PML and Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha (RARalpha) genes.

METHODS: A total of 21 samples (19 patients) were evaluated. Two patients had repeat studies after therapy. Thirteen samples were studied at the time of initial diagnosis and 8 during relapse after therapy. After MIBI imaging, either bone marrow aspiration or peripheral blood was obtained for flow cytometric and RT-PCR analyses. Flow cytometry was performed using two different antibodies. After the injection of 555 MBq MIBI, whole-body and pelvic spot images were acquired using a dual-head gamma camera. The uptake in the bone marrow was evaluated against the background (adjacent soft tissue) by both qualitative (scoring system) and quantitative (tm/bkg ratios) analyses. RESULTS: For flow cytometry, the limit for Pgp overexpression was set at >15% Pgp-positive mononuclear bone marrow or peripheral blood cells. There was an inverse correlation between the levels of Pgp and MIBI imaging using both the qualitative (scoring system) and quantitative (tm/bkg ratios) analyses (p = 0.022). Mean values were statistically different between Pgp+ and Pgp- groups for both qualitative and quantitative analyses (p = 0.009 and 0.024, respectively). For RT-PCR, there was statistical support toward a difference in the mean values between Pgp+ and Pgp- groups by qualitative analysis (p = 0.061); however, no statistical difference was found between these two groups by quantitative analysis (p = 0.179).

Fewer than 10 cases with a proven precursor B-cell phenotype have been reported in the English literature. In this report, we describe four cases of B-lymphoblastic lymphoma presenting as a localized intraosseous mass, which clinically and histologically mimicked Ewing's sarcoma. Three tumors occurred in the tibia and one in the humerus. In all four cases, the initial diagnosis was either ""Ewing's sarcoma"" or ""consistent with Ewing's sarcoma."" All four patients were female. Three were children and one was an adult; mean age was 12.5 years (range, 4 to 31 years). All had extremity pain without significant constitutional symptoms. In three cases, the tumors were osteolytic on radiographic evaluation, and in one case, osteosclerotic. Immunohistochemical stains on paraffin-embedded tissue showed that the neoplastic cells expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD43, vimentin, and CD99 (MIC2 gene product) in all cases. Three cases were negative for CD45. CD79a was positive in all four cases studied; however, CD20 (L26) was positive in only two of four cases. CD3 was negative in all cases. Two cases showed focal granular cytoplasmic staining for keratin. Two cases analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene.

The adult patient died two years after diagnosis with disseminated disease. Although rare, B-lymphoblastic lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors of bone. A diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma should be made only after complete immunophenotyping and, if necessary, molecular diagnostic tests to exclude lymphoblastic lymphoma. A limited panel of antibodies can lead to an erroneous diagnosis; B-lymphoblastic lymphoma may be negative for CD45 and CD20 but positive for CD99 and even for keratin, mimicking Ewing's sarcoma.

Selection of alternative donors of hematopoietic stem cells (unrelated individuals or HLA-nonidentical family members) has been aided by establishment of world-wide donor registries now exceeding 3.6 million volunteers and by DNA-based HLA typing to more closely match potential donors. Coupled with improved methods to control graft-versus-host disease and prevent fungal and cytomegalovirus infection, remarkable progress has been made in alternative donor transplantation. For patients 50 years of age or younger, with recently diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, 1- and 5-year survivals after HLA-A, B, DRB1 identical unrelated marrow transplantation in Seattle are 82% and 74%, respectively.

In this report we show that when rhesus monkey bone marrow cells collected 14 days after G-CSF and SCF treatment were transduced with amphotropic retroviruses, gene transfer levels were approximately 10%, which was easily detected by Southern blot analysis.

The Tax response elements (TxREs) of the long terminal repeat resemble cAMP response elements (CREs), the target of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). CREB binds the TxRE with reduced affinity; however, the interaction is specifically enhanced by Tax. Using a fluorescence quenching method, we determined that CREB dimerizes in the absence of DNA, and that Tax does not enhance dimerization. DNA footprinting of the TxRE with 1, 10-phenanthroline-copper complex demonstrates that Tax contacts DNA and extends the footprint of CREB to GC-rich sequences flanking the core CRE-like element. The minor groove-binding drug chromomycin A3, but not distamycin A, disrupted Tax-enhanced CREB binding to the TxRE. Substitution of the guanine-rich sequences flanking the core of the TxRE with inosine residues also blocked the Tax effect. Finally, the IC-substituted TxRE binds CREB with increased affinity, suggesting flanking DNA influences the binding of CREB to the core CRE-like element.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed activation-independent association of CK2 with CD5 in human and murine B and T cell lines and murine splenocytes. The interaction of CK2 holoenzyme with CD5 is mediated by the amino terminus of the regulatory subunit beta. CK2 binds and phosphorylates CD5 at the CK2 motifs flanked by Ser459 and Ser461. Cross-linking of CD5 leads to the activation of CD5-associated CK2 in a murine B-lymphoma cell line and a human T-leukemia cell line and is independent of net recruitment of CK2 to CD5. In contrast, CK2 is not activated following cross-linking of the B cell receptor complex or the T cell receptor complex.

The characteristics of the mutated carrier, RFC1-E45K, were studied by cDNA transfection into the murine MTXrA line in which endogenous carrier is not functional. Folic acid influx doubled in the transfectant MTXrA-E45K as compared with L1210 or MTXrA cells; in contrast, MTX and 5-CHO-THF influx was only 14 and 27% that of L1210 cells, respectively. 5-CHO-THF influx in MTXrA-E45K cells was characterized by a 12- and 3.6-fold decrease in influx Vmax and Kt respectively, relative to L1210 cells. The folic acid influx Ki in L1210 cells was more than 50-fold greater than that of MTX based upon inhibition of 5-CHO-THF influx. In comparison, the mutated carrier had comparable affinities for folic acid and MTX in MTXrA-E45K cells due to a 7-fold decrease in the folic acid influx Ki and 7-fold increase in the MTX influx Ki. Transport via native RFC1 is inhibited by a variety of anions in L1210 cells associated with an increase in influx Kt. However, influx of 5-CHO-THF in MTXrA-E45K cells in a HEPES buffer (9 mM chloride) was decreased by 70% due to a 3-fold fall in the Vmax. In the complete absence of chloride (K+-HEPES-sucrose buffer) 5-CHO-THF influx was only 10% that in HBS buffer. 5-CHO-THF influx was restored by addition of chloride, fluoride, or nitrate but not by sulfate, phosphate, or ATP which were all inhibitory over a broad range of concentrations. The data suggest that substitution of a positive for a negative amino acid at position 45 results in the loss of RFC1 mobility in the absence of small inorganic anions that bind to, and neutralize the positive charge on, the lysine residue. Inhibition by higher charged anions may be due to interactions at another carrier site present in both the mutated and wild type carrier. This and other studies suggest that amino acids in the first predicted transmembrane domain play an important role in determining the spectrum of affinities for, and mobility of, RFC1 and is a cluster region for mutations when cells are placed under selective pressure with antifolates that utilize RFC1 as the major route of entry into mammalian cells.",,"['Zhao, R', 'Assaraf, Y G', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Assaraf YG', 'Goldman ID']","['Departments of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, and the Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Anions/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/21 00:00,1998/07/21 00:01,['1998/07/21 00:00'],"['1998/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.30.19065 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80239-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jul 24;273(30):19065-71. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.30.19065.,['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,

Thus, five maleimide derivatives of chlorambucil were bound to thiolated human serum transferrin which differ in the stability of the chemical link between drug and spacer. The maleimide ester derivatives 1 and 2 were prepared by reacting 2-hydroxyethylmaleimide or 3-maleimidophenol with the carboxyl group of chlorambucil, and the carboxylic hydrazone derivatives 5-7 were obtained through reaction of 2-maleimidoacetaldehyde, 3-maleimidoacetophenone, or 3-maleimidobenzaldehyde with the carboxylic acid hydrazide derivative of chlorambucil. The alkylating activity of transferrin-bound chlorambucil was determined with the aid of 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) demonstrating that on average 3 equivalents were protein-bound. Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of free chlorambucil and the respective transferrin conjugates in the MCF7 mammary carcinoma and MOLT4 leukemia cell line employing a propidium iodide fluorescence assay demonstrated that the conjugates in which chlorambucil was bound to transferrin through non-acid-sensitive linkers, i.e., an ester or benzaldehyde carboxylic hydrazone bond, were not, on the whole, as active as chlorambucil. In contrast, the two conjugates in which chlorambucil was bound to transferrin through acid-sensitive carboxylic hydrazone bonds were as active as or more active than chlorambucil in both cell lines. Especially, the conjugate in which chlorambucil was bound to transferrin through an acetaldehyde carboxylic hydrazone bond exhibited IC50 values which were approximately 3-18-fold lower than those of chlorambucil. Preliminary toxicity studies in mice showed that this conjugate can be administered at higher doses in comparison to unbound chlorambucil.

We reasoned that targeted delivery of protein synthesis inactivating toxins to leukemic blasts would reduce the cellular concentrations of relatively short half-life resistance proteins and sensitize the cells to cytotoxic drugs. To test this hypothesis, we employed human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor fused to truncated diphtheria toxin (DT388-GMCSF). The human AML cell line HL60 and its vincristine-resistant sublines, HL60Vinc and HL60VCR, were incubated in vitro for 24 h with varying concentrations of toxin. Doxorubicin was added for an additional 24 h, and cell cytotoxicity was assayed by thymidine incorporation and colony formation in semisolid medium. DT388-GMCSF sensitized HL60Vinc and HL60VCR but not HL60 to doxorubicin. Combination indices for three log cell kill varied from 0.2 to 0.3. In contrast, pretreatment with doxorubicin followed by toxins failed to show synergy. At least in the case of the vincristine-resistant cell lines, modulation of drug resistance correlated with reduction in membrane P-glycoprotein concentrations based on immunoblots with C219 antibody, flow cytometry with MRK16 antibody, and cell uptake of doxorubicin. These observations suggest clinical trials of combination therapy may be warranted in patients with refractory AML.

Here, we report a study of PS-1 expression in brains, cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a panel of well characterized PS-1-specific antibodies. These antibodies were characterized by immunofluorescent staining of PS-1 transfectants followed by flow cytometric analysis. In human brain, widespread neuronal staining was observed. PS-1 immunoreactivity was primarily confined to neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites. Weaker staining of microglia was also detected, in accord with the finding of PS-1 immunoreactivity in monocytes. PS-1 expression is not particularly associated with neurons either containing or spared from neurofibrillary tangles, nor with senile plaques. The level of PS-1 expression does not differ between normal and AD brains. Immunoprecipitation from AD, FAD and control brains revealed only a 32 kDa N-terminal fragment and an 18-20 kDa C-terminal fragment. Little or no full length PS-1 was detected.

Cellular and antibody-mediated immune responses to shared viral-host antigens have been associated with the development of disease in these patients. Patients infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) develop HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that resembles some forms of MS. Damage to neuronal processes in the CNS of HAM/TSP patients is associated with an activated cellular and antibody-mediated immune response. In this study, IgG isolated from HAM/TSP patients was immunoreactive with uninfected neurons and this reactivity was HTLV-I specific. HAM/TSP IgG stained uninfected neurons in human CNS and cell lines but not nonneuronal cells. Neuronal western blots showed IgG reactivity with a single 33-kd band in all HAM/TSP patients tested. By contrast, no neuron-specific IgG reactivity could be demonstrated from HTLV-I seronegative controls and, more important, from HTLV-I seropositive, neurologically asymptomatic individuals. Both immunocytochemical staining and western blot reactivity were abolished by preincubating HAM/TSP IgG with HTLV-I protein lysate but not by control proteins. Staining of CNS tissue by a monoclonal antibody to HTLV-I tax (an immunodominant HTLV-I antigen) mimicked HAM/TSP IgG immunoreactivity. There was no staining by control antibodies. Absorption of HAM/TSP IgG with recombinant HTLV-I tax protein or preincubation of CNS tissue with the monoclonal antibody to HTLV-I tax abrogated the immunocytochemical and western blot reactivity of HAM/TSP IgG. Furthermore, in situ human IgG localized to neurons in HAM/TSP brain but not in normal brain.

Electrocardiography, echocardiography and spiroergometry were carried out on 56 patients aged 9-28 years, of whom 44 patients had been treated with 15-483 mg/m2 doxorubicin (or equivalent). Acute leukaemia had been diagnosed 1.5-16 years earlier. Of the patients 75% reached normal maximal oxygen uptake, 69% normal oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold and 95% normal maximal work rate. Of the patients 75% achieved adequate values for maximal heart rate and 78% normal blood lactate concentration. No difference was seen between patients treated with and without anthracyclines. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide little evidence for cardiopulmonary impairment in long-term survivors of ALL. Both the cardiac function, as evaluated by ECG and echocardiography, and the physical performance in spiroergometry are normal in a large number of these patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred ninety-nine patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer were randomized to receive thoracic radiation therapy that started on day 1 (arm I) or day 64 of chemotherapy treatment (arm II), or chemotherapy alone with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and etoposide (later, doxorubicin). Thoracic radiation therapy consisted of 4,000 rad to the tumor and mediastinum with a 1,000-rad boost. All patients received prophylactic cranial radiation to a dose of 3,000 rad. RESULTS: Arm I patients had a median survival of 13.04 months, arm II patients 14.54 months, and arm III patients 13.58 months (log-rank test, P = .0072). Median time to clinical failure was 11 months in arm I, 11.21 months in arm II, and 8.7 months in arm III (log-rank test, P = .0004).

Further objectives were to analyze pharmacodynamic effect on deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) and to seek relationships between the decrease in dNTP pools and inhibition of DNA synthesis in CML blasts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HU (8, 12, 18, 27, and 40 g/m2) was administered intravenously by a 24-hour continuous infusion to 19 adults with CML in blastic or accelerated phase. Plasma levels of HU were analyzed in all patients. To determine the role of HU in inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, dNTP pools in the leukemia cells were quantitated. Correlations were sought with these parameters and DNA synthesis inhibition measured ex vivo by [3H]thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: The MTD of HU given as a 24-hour infusion was 27 g/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was mucositis. There was a significant but transient myelosuppression, with nadir counts generally seen 3 to 4 days after the dose. The steady-state concentration of HU in plasma was achieved by 6 hours, and was proportional to the dose. There was a median 57% decrease in the deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) pool in circulating blasts. In contrast, deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) and pyrimidine dNTPs were not significantly affected. The extent of DNA synthesis inhibition was related to the residual concentrations of intracellular dATP. CONCLUSION: A 24-hour infusion of HU results in significant but transient myelosuppression in advanced-phase CML. The specific decrease of intracellular dATP correlated with the inhibition of DNA synthesis in CML blasts. This pharmacodynamic action of HU provides a rationale for combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, the effects of which could be augmented by the decline in dATP pools.",,"['Gandhi, V', 'Plunkett, W', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M', 'Robertson, L E', ""O'Brien, S""]","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M', 'Robertson LE', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. vgandhi@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Middle Aged']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.7.2321 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jul;16(7):2321-31. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.7.2321.,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine was administered at a dose of 20 to 40 mg/m2 per day for 5 days at monthly intervals. RESULTS: Among the 6,137 patients, TLS was suspected in 26 (0.42%), with clinical and laboratory features consistent with TLS present in 20 (0.33%). Prophylaxis against TLS had been administered to 60% of these patients. Clinical or laboratory features were similar to patients who did not develop TLS.

Many of the mutations arise through balanced chromosomal rearrangements, often translocations, that fuse oncogenes with other gene loci. In some instances, this leads to the formation of a qualitatively new hybrid gene encoding a leukemogenic or lymphomogenic protein product, whereas on other occasions the result is deregulation of an otherwise normal gene. The demonstration of such gene rearrangements is of both diagnostic and prognostic value and hence serves as an important supplement to the more traditional phenotype-based investigative techniques. All available methods to detect neoplasia-specific, acquired mutations have both advantages and disadvantages, depending partly on the level of resolution at which they operate (chromosomes, nucleic acids, proteins), but also on the specific characteristics of each individual technique. Ideally, the initial genetic diagnosis of a given tumor should be reached by means of an open-framed screening technique, whereas less labour-intensive, specific techniques may be used during the subsequent follow-up of the patient. The most reliable and complete information is always obtained by combining cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, and strictly molecular genetic investigations.
