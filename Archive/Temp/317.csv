The effects of low dose cyclophosphamide pretreatment on daunorubicin concentrations in leukaemic bone marrow were investigated in rats. At day 12 after transplantation of the leukaemia, rats were injected intraperitoneally with cyclophosphamide (30 mg/kg). 2 days later the leukaemic rats received daunorubicin intravenously (7.5 mg/kg). Cyclophosphamide pretreatment led to a significant increase in daunorubicin concentration in the femoral bone marrow, by a factor of about 7. The log leukaemic stem cell kill (LCK) values, as estimated by a survival assay, were 1.8, 0.7, and 5.4 for the leukaemic rats injected with cyclophosphamide (day 12), with daunorubicin (day 14), or with cyclophosphamide (day 12) plus daunorubicin (day 14), respectively). The simultaneous administration of cyclophosphamide and daunorubicin at day 14, induced a LCK of 2.7, a value that was the sum of the LCKs of cyclophosphamide and daunorubicin alone. Low-dose cyclophosphamide pretreatment led to an increased daunorubicin accumulation in femoral bone marrow of leukaemic rats, and was synergistic with daunorubicin.","['Nooter, K', 'de Vries, A', 'Martens, A C', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Nooter K', 'de Vries A', 'Martens AC', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Institute of Applied Radiobiology and Immunology, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Tissue Distribution/drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(90)90129-h [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1990;26(6):729-32. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(90)90129-h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was open, dose ranging, and noncomparative, and designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of ondansetron in preventing nausea and vomiting caused by cyclophosphamide intravenous (IV) 1,000 mg/m2 day 1, and cytarabine IV subcutaneously (SC) 75 mg/m2 on days 2 to 5. Ten patients were given ondansetron 5 mg/m2 IV (group A) and subsequently another 10 patients were given ondansetron 3 mg/m2 IV (group B). Oral ondansetron was given for 14 doses, at the same dosage for both groups, commencing simultaneously with the IV infusion and continuing at 8 hourly intervals, ie, until day 5. The oral dose was based on surface area with the following schedule: 0.3 to 0.6 m2, 2 mg; 0.6 to 1 m2, 3 mg; and greater than 1 m2, 4 mg. Vomiting on the first day of chemotherapy was reported in group A by one patient and by one patient in group B. Vomiting during days 2 to 5 was reported by two group-A patients and by three group-B patients. Nausea was recorded on day 1 by one patient in group A, and two in group B, and on days 2 to 5 by three patients in group A, and by seven in group B. All patients were alert during treatment with ondansetron and there was no dystonia. There were no changes in renal function or hematology values that could be ascribed to the study drug. Transient elevations in bilirubin and liver enzymes were observed. We conclude that our results indicate that ondansetron is a safe and extremely effective single-agent antiemetic with minimal side effects, when administered both IV and orally.","['Carden, P A', 'Mitchell, S L', 'Waters, K D', 'Tiedemann, K', 'Ekert, H']","['Carden PA', 'Mitchell SL', 'Waters KD', 'Tiedemann K', 'Ekert H']","[""Department of Clinical Haematology and Oncology, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4AF302ESOS (Ondansetron)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antiemetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Ondansetron', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Serotonin Antagonists', 'Vomiting/chemically induced/*prevention & control']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.9.1531 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Sep;8(9):1531-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.9.1531.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The responsiveness of U937 monocytic cells and their macrophage-like inducible forms to platelet-activating factor (Paf), the chemotactic peptide fMLP, and low affinity IgE-receptor occupation was examined. Differentiation of U937 cells by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and a cancer cell line (HBT 5637) conditioned medium (5637-CM), but not INFg or IL4, resulted in a macrophage-like cell line which released TXB2. A high basal release of TXB2 with no significant response to Paf or fMLP challenge was seen following culture of cells with PMA. In 5637-CM-differentiated cells, Paf and fMLP induced a rapid release of TXB2, about 10 fold above basal activity. There was a slow Ca-independent response to short-term treatment with PMA and a rapid Ca-dependent response to the ionophore A23187. Both stimulants acted synergistically on TXB2 synthesis in 5637-CM differentiated cells. Although low affinity receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) were induced by 5637-CM, no TXB2 was released in response to soluble or latex-bound IgE-antigen complexes or to anti-Fc epsilon RII/CD23-antibodies. IL4 and to a lesser extent INFg both induced Fc epsilon RII/CD23 receptor expression, but inhibited release of TXB2 in response to Paf, fMLP, or PMA. We conclude that the functional receptors for IgE on mature macrophages are most probably not Fc epsilon RII/CD23.","['Storch, J', 'Edwards, R J', 'MacDermot, J']","['Storch J', 'Edwards RJ', 'MacDermot J']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism/physiology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thromboxane B2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.48.3.266 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1990 Sep;48(3):266-73. doi: 10.1002/jlb.48.3.266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group consisted of 14 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and eight with Ph-positive acute leukemia (Ph + AL); these diagnoses were based on hematologic and cytogenetic features. In CML-BC patients, an IgH joining region rearrangement was detected only in patients with CD10 expression; TCR-beta, -gamma, or -delta rearrangements were associated with IgH involvement. In contrast, five of the eight Ph+ AL patients had breaks within the major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR), and four of them had IgH involvement. Of the remaining three Ph+ M-BCR nonrearranged AL patients, only one showed IgH rearrangement. In addition, TCR-beta involvement was sometimes detected in Ph+ AL patients (two of the eight patients) with or without rearranged M-BCR, and no PH+ AL case displayed rearranged TCR-gamma. These findings suggest that genotypic changes in CML-BC are usually associated with phenotypic results of the neoplastic cells: the expression of CD10 in CML-BC patients is accompanied by the involvement of IgH with frequent TCR rearrangements which possibly are due to the common recombinase activity. On the other hand, the mechanism of the involvement of IgH in Ph+ AL patients without rearranged M-BCR seems different from that observed in Ph+ leukemia patients with rearranged M-BCR, although TCR involvement could occur whether or not the leukemia cells had a rearranged M-BCR in Ph+ AL patients.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Tauchi, T', 'Saito, M', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Kimura, N', 'Toyama, K']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Tauchi T', 'Saito M', 'Nakazawa S', 'Kimura N', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin', 'Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Aug;4(8):572-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biophys. Acta 1037, 92-99). In the present study the drug was investigated as a potential inhibitor of intracellular ribosyltransferases by competition with endogenous acceptors. To this end, MIBG was compared with the conventional ADP-ribosylation inhibitors nicotinamide and 3-aminobenzamide in cell-free ribosylation systems and in intact L1210 leukemia cells. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (poly-ADPRP) was assayed by the DNAse-I-induced incorporation of [14C]NAD in nuclei of permeabilized L1210 cells. Mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase (mono-ADPRT) was assayed as NAD linkage to [125I]iodoguanyltyramine catalysed by turkey erythrocyte membranes or activated cholera toxin. Poly-ADPRP was inhibited by nicotinamide (IC50 = 0.03 mM) and by 3-aminobenzamide (IC50 less than or equal to 0.03 mM) but was insensitive to MIBG. Conversely, mono-ADPRT was inhibited by MIBG (IC50 = approx. 0.1 mM) but not by 3-aminobenzamide and only weakly so by nicotinamide in high concentration (10 mM). In L1210 cells, intracellular levels of nicotinamide equilibrated at 60-70% of the extracellular drug concentrations assayed at 1 and 10 mM. In contrast, MIBG was concentrated 15-fold by nonspecific uptake. The preferential interference of the drugs with endogenous mono- or poly-ADP ribosylations, predicted from inhibitory capacity in vitro and intracellular concentrations, was confirmed by their effect on dexamethasone-induced lysis of L1210 cell lines. Inhibition of endogenous mono-ADPRT with 0.03 mM MIBG or 10 mM nicotinamide induced sensitivity to glucocorticoids in refractory L1210-wt cells. In contrast, inhibition of poly-ADPRP by 3-aminobenzamide or nicotinamide (1 mM each) did not confer susceptibility to refractory cells but enhanced the lytic process in the sensitive subline L1210-H7 or in L1210-wt cells sensitized by MIBG. These results indicate that MIBG is the first substrate for guanidino-specific mono-ADPRT which accumulates in intact mammalian cells and effectively competes with intracellular acceptors for endogenous enzymes.","['Smets, L A', 'Loesberg, C', 'Janssen, M', 'Van Rooij, H']","['Smets LA', 'Loesberg C', 'Janssen M', 'Van Rooij H']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, (Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Huis), Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Iodobenzenes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine', '*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell-Free System/metabolism', 'Cholera Toxin/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Iodobenzenes/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Niacinamide/pharmacology', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/08/13 00:00,1990/08/13 00:01,['1990/08/13 00:00'],"['1990/08/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/13 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(90)90204-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(90)90204-q [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Aug 13;1054(1):49-55. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(90)90204-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IgE in this complex exhibits only a restricted angular range of segmental motion, much of this restricted motion occurs on a relatively rapid time scale. A fast component of motion with a rotational correlation time of 15-35 ns may correspond to the twisting of Fab segments about their major axis. Intermolecular cross-linking by a short bivalent ligand, N,N'-didansylcadaverine, results in complete loss of this segmental motion. Solubilization of monomeric IgE-receptor complexes using a zwitterionic detergent results in a time-dependent anisotropy decay that exhibits both a fast component and a slower component that is intermediate between the decay for soluble and membrane-bound forms of IgE at long times after excitation. These results are discussed in terms of a model in which binding of IgE to its membrane-bound receptor restricts not only its global rotation but also its slower modes of segmental flexibility as well, while allowing its Fab segments to undergo rapid reorientation within a limited angular range.","['Holowka, D', 'Wensel, T', 'Baird, B']","['Holowka D', 'Wensel T', 'Baird B']","['Department of Chemistry, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology/metabolism', 'Motion', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Solubility']",1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00471a015 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 May 15;29(19):4607-12. doi: 10.1021/bi00471a015.,"['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, preclinical studies have shown that the antitumor activity of FUra can be potentiated by modulating the metabolism of this drug by using other substances, in particular antifolates of folates. Pretreatment with antifolates may, by blocking de novo purine biosynthesis and consequently increasing phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pools, enhance the conversion of FUra to active fluoronucleotide pools via orotate phosphoribosyltransferase. Methotrexate (MTX) pretreatment may also enhance binding of the fluoropyrimidine inhibitor, 5-fluodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP), to the target enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS), indirectly by increasing dihydrofolate polyglutamates or directly, as MTX polyglutamates, by enhancing the formation of ternary complexes with FdUMP and TS. Exogenous folates, in particular 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (folinate, leucovorin, LV), can, by raising the intracellular levels of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, lead to increased formation and stabilization of the ternary complex formed by TS, the folate coenzyme, and FdUMP. In vitro studies have also shown potentiation of FUra cytotoxicity by antifolates and folates against human lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.

ATL cells freshly obtained from patients and ATL cell lines produced limited amounts of IL 1 by culturing in a low-calcium concentration of medium (less than 0.01 mM). However, the production of IL 1 was enhanced by the addition of calcium chloride to the medium in a concentration-dependent manner and reached the maximum at the higher calcium concentration (3-4 mM) than at the standard calcium concentration of medium (1.26 mM). The production of IL 1 from ATL cells was further enhanced by calcium ionophore. Furthermore, the expression of IL 1R on ATL cells was augmented in proportion to the extracellular calcium concentration and calcium ionophore. In accordance with the change of the extracellular calcium concentration, the intracellular calcium concentration of ATL cells detected by Fura 2 was changed. However, this calcium dependency was not observed in the human T-cell leukemia virus I-negative acute T-cell leukemia cells.

We found that the differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophages was accompanied by transcription of the c-fms oncogene, which was assessed by a modified PCR (polymerase-chain reaction) method. After treatment with a c-fms anti-sense oligomer, the PMA and hrGM-CSF induced macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells was significantly inhibited, whereas either 1-alpha-25-(OH)2D3 induced macrophage or DMSO and hrGM-CSF induced granulocytic differentiation was not inhibited. Furthermore, we treated the HL-60 cells with M-CSF (macrophage-colony stimulating factor or CSF-1) anti-sense N degrees 2 (see Figure 1) in the presence of PMA, hrGM-CSF, 1-alpha-25-(OH)2D3 and DMSO. The results showed that this treatment leads to a significant inhibition of PMA and hrGM-CSF-induced macrophage differentiation, but has no influence on the 1-alpha-25-(OH)2D3-induced macrophage differentiation and DMSO-induced granulocytic differentiation. It was further demonstrated that the M-CSF (or CSF-1) and c-fms antisense oligomers acted synergistically on inhibition of macrophage formation induced by PMA and hrGM-CSF, but had no inhibitory effect on the macrophage formation induced by 1-alpha-25-(OH)2D3. Thus we concluded firstly, that HL-60 cells differentiate into macrophages along two different pathways: one is involved in the action of the c-fms oncogene and the other is not. Secondly, an autocrine circuit of M-CSF (or CSF-1) action may exist in the macrophage formation induced by PMA and hrGM-CSF.","['Wu, J', 'Zhu, J Q', 'Han, K K', 'Zhu, D X']","['Wu J', 'Zhu JQ', 'Han KK', 'Zhu DX']","[""Department of Biochemistry, Nanjing University, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Macrophages/drug effects/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Jun;5(6):873-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significant fraction of pp56lck is tightly associated with the cytoplasmic domains of CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins, suggesting an important role for it in thymic development and T cell activation. We have studied the regulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of pp56lck and found recently that it becomes rapidly activated in isolated T cell membranes by an endogenous mechanism apparently involving a phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase). Moreover pp56lck was activated upon addition of isolated CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), a major membrane PTPase, and activation was absent in T cell mutants lacking CD45. Here, we address in more detail the mechanisms of pp56lck activation by the CD45 PTPase and show that this event is time-dependent, sensitive to Na3VO4 (which blocks the PTPase activity of CD45), and is accompanied by dephosphorylation of a regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr-505) near the C-terminus of pp56lck. This provides a molecular mechanism for regulation of the catalytic activity of pp56lck by CD45, which thus is likely to be the physiological activator of pp56lck. Activation of pp56lck by the CD45 PTPase may underlie many of the reported immunomodulatory effects of antibodies to CD45, and provides further support for the notion that CD45-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation plays a critical role in T cell activation and growth.","['Mustelin, T', 'Altman, A']","['Mustelin T', 'Altman A']","['Department of Immunology, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Jun;5(6):809-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A HLA-A, B donor, identical or compatible, was found for 35.87% patients, a HLA-DR identical for 84.21% of 38 patients who had a HLA-A, B identical relative. Bone marrow was transplanted to 16 patients (10 with bone marrow aplasia, 6 with acute or chronic leukaemia), with one exception bone marrow from a sibling. The bone marrow was accepted in all patients but two where the transplantation was made despite MLC positivity. From the results ensues that it is essential for successful transplantation of bone marrow to ensure maximal identity between donor and recipient as regards the ABO group, HLA antigens and negativity of the MLC reaction. The negativity of the MLC reaction is more important than HLA-DR identity; when assessing only one HLA-DR antigen in a donor identical with the patient, it cannot be ruled out that on the lymphocytes of the donor there exists another one which was not detected. The authors discuss the causes of different results of the MLC reaction and HLA-A, B, DR typing.","['Majsky, A', 'Soucek, J', 'Herzog, P', 'Korinkova, P', 'Prazak, J']","['Majsky A', 'Soucek J', 'Herzog P', 'Korinkova P', 'Prazak J']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Tissue Donors']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 1990 Apr;36(4):318-23.,,,,,,Imunologicke zabezpeceni transplantace kostni drene.

After IgE receptor triggering with a specific antigen that was associated with histamine release, cytotoxic activity in the cell lysates and supernatants increased for 2 hr during the culture of RBL-2H3 cells. Furthermore, calcium ionophore A23187 could induce release of histamine and cytotoxic activity from RBL-2H3 cells. However, compound 48/80, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were unable to induce the release of either histamine or cytotoxic activity from the cells. These data suggested that, at least in part, there was a common pathway in histamine release and production of cytotoxic activity. A protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, did not affect histamine release, but inhibited the induction of cytotoxic activity. This cytotoxic activity from RBL-2H3 cells was completely neutralized by anti-mouse TNF rabbit serum. With Northern blot analysis, mouse TNF cDNA probe could hybridize with RNA isolated from RBL-2H3 cells. TNF mRNA was induced as early as 1 hr after stimulation with specific antigen and decreased by 4 hr. Moreover, the molecular weight (MW) of the released cytotoxic factor from RBL-2H3 cells triggered with IgE receptors was approximately 17,000 by SDS-PAGE, which was compatible to that of TNF. Thus, it is concluded that the gene expression and production of TNF occurred in RBL-2H3 cells after IgE receptor triggering in association with histamine release, suggesting that TNF produced by basophils and mast cells may play an important role in allergic reaction through its wide range of biological activity.","['Ohno, I', 'Tanno, Y', 'Yamauchi, K', 'Takishima, T']","['Ohno I', 'Tanno Y', 'Yamauchi K', 'Takishima T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Basophils/immunology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Gene Expression', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1990 May;70(1):88-93.,,,,PMC1384086,,,,,,,,,,,

We seek to understand the mechanisms which are involved in the detection of these cell surface events which lead to changes in [Ca2+]i as well as the interactions between the various subcellular components which impart the delicate control of [Ca2+]i during cellular stimulation.

In the present study, splenic or peritoneal effector cells were used to investigate the ability of SMANCS to augment natural killer (NK) cell activity and to generate cytostatic macrophages (A-M phi). Splenic NK cell activity augmented by SMANCS was characterized by cytotoxicity to various target cells, nylon wool nonadherence, and sensitivity to treatment with anti-asialo-GM1 antiserum or monoclonal anti-Thy-1.2 antibody followed by complement. The A-M phi generated by SMANCS stimulation were characterized by their adherence to a plastic surface coated with fetal calf serum and their ability to phagocytize carbonyl-iron. The maximum level of NK cell activity in the spleens of mice was detected 3 days after i.v. injection of SMANCS, and the highest activity of the peritoneal A-M phi was demonstrated in mice 4 days after SMANCS treatment. On the other hand, the NSRT of mice stimulated with SMANCS was not detectable in mice treated with carrageenan or trypan blue, whereas SMANCS-stimulated NSRT was observed in mice treated with anti-asialo-GM1 antiserum. The NSRT that was stimulated with SMANCS was also demonstrated in mice homozygous for the beige mutation and their non-beige littermates, when NK cell-resistant EL-4 thymoma was used as a tumor target. These results suggest that the expression of NSRT of mice stimulated with SMANCS may require the function of A-M phi, although NK cell activity was also augmented in spleens of mice by administration of SMANCS.","['Suzuki, F', 'Pollard, R B', 'Uchimura, S', 'Munakata, T', 'Maeda, H']","['Suzuki F', 'Pollard RB', 'Uchimura S', 'Munakata T', 'Maeda H']","['Department of Microbiology, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Maleic Anhydrides)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (anti-Thy antibody)', '0 (poly(maleic acid-styrene)neocarzinostatin)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '71012-19-6 (asialo GM1 ganglioside)', '9014-02-2 (Zinostatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Furans/*pharmacology', '*G(M1) Ganglioside', 'Glycosphingolipids/immunology', 'Immune Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Isoantibodies/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Maleic Anhydrides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polystyrenes/*pharmacology', 'Zinostatin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):3897-904.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In L1210 leukemia cells grown in tritiated folic acid (1 microM), most of the endogenous radiolabeled folates were present as formyl-substituted tetrahydrofolates (60-73%, including 10- and 5-formyl and 5,10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate), with lower levels of tetrahydrofolate (including 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate), 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, and non-metabolized folic acid. Trimetrexate (1 microM) caused an elevation of dihydrofolate levels within 5 min following drug addition, from approximately 1 to 20% of the total folates. Whereas total reduced folates were preserved, losses in the levels of individual forms ranged from minor changes in the formyl tetrahydrofolates (approx. 10% decrease), to significant losses in the levels of tetrahydrofolate (approx. 60%) and 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (95%). Under these conditions, the incorporations of [3H]deoxyuridine into TMP and [14C]glycine into purines or of [14C]formate into biosynthetic products were inhibited (69-95%). The majority (59-100%) of the endogenous radiolabeled folates in L1210 cells grown in various concentrations (0.2 to 3 microM) of [3H]folic acid was bound to soluble intracellular proteins when cell-free extracts were fractionated by rapid gel filtration or charcoal adsorption. Total intracellular folate levels increased in proportion to the changes in medium folic acid concentration; however, cofactor binding was saturable. At low concentrations, below that which supported maximal growth (less than 0.75 microM), all of the intracellular folates were protein-bound; only when maximal growth was achieved, could unbound folates be detected. Incubation with trimetrexate (1 or 10 microM), methotrexate (10 microM), or calcium leuvovorin (50 microM) did not alter significantly the levels of total and protein-bound [3H]folates in cells grown in 1 microM [3H]folic acid. Under all conditions, formyl tetrahydrofolates were the major intracellular derivatives; however, these forms were poorly represented in the bound fraction. Conversely, all of the other intracellular folate forms were completely bound. Tetrahydrofolate was the predominant protein-bound derivative in control cells; in antifolate-treated cells, both bound tetrahydrofolate and 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate were largely replaced by protein-bound dihydrofolate. This interconversion in drug-treated cells was independent of (i) sustained levels of [3H]formyl tetrahydrofolates, or (ii) high extracellular concentrations of unlabeled calcium leucovorin (50 microM). Hence, protein-bound tetrahydrofolates must not only be substrates for enzyme mediated reactions (i.e. TMP synthesis) but also must slowly equilibrate with unbound cofactor. In this fashion, binding of endogenous folates to soluble proteins may function to ""segregate' intracellular cofactor pools.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Matherly, L H', 'Muench, S P']","['Matherly LH', 'Muench SP']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Quinazolines/therapeutic use', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/analysis/*metabolism', 'Trimetrexate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(90)90622-R [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90622-r [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Jun 15;39(12):2005-14. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90622-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To optimize antitumor immunotherapy with Lym-1, we determined whether granulocytes could participate in tumor lysis mediated by Lym-1 and whether recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) could influence this reaction. Granulocytes had minimal activity in mediating Lym-1 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, IFN-gamma markedly augmented and occasionally induced granulocyte Lym-1 ADCC in a dose-dependent fashion (optimal 100 U/mL). Granulocytes primed with IFN-gamma for 24 hours displayed greatly increased ADCC in the absence of further IFN-gamma exposure. In most individuals, IFN-gamma also enhanced PBMC Lym-1 ADCC. Interferon alfa (IFN-alpha), although able to enhance PBMC-mediated Lym-1 ADCC and non-ADCC lysis, had no effect on granulocyte activity. Lym-1 ADCC involved an interaction between Fc receptor-bearing granulocytes and Lym-1 antigen positive targets based on the following: (1) The reaction was Lym-1 dose-dependent with cytotoxicity detectable at concentrations as low as 0.5 microgram/mL. (2) An irrelevant, isotype-matched MoAb (UPC-10) was unable to mediate ADCC. (3) In the absence of Lym-1, granulocytes--with or without IFN-gamma--displayed no intrinsic tumor lytic ability.

The visceral fibrosis may have had a pathogenesis similar to that postulated for the myelofibrosis of megakaryoblastic leukemia in older children.","['Becroft, D M', 'Zwi, L J']","['Becroft DM', 'Zwi LJ']","['Princess Mary Laboratory, Auckland Hospital, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Pathol,Pediatric pathology,8303527,,IM,"['Down Syndrome/*complications/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Newborn, Diseases/pathology', 'Leukemia/etiology/pathology', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*complications/pathology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Pancreas/*pathology', 'Pancreatic Diseases/etiology/pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/15513819009067127 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Pathol. 1990;10(3):397-406. doi: 10.3109/15513819009067127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells containing the Ph1 contain a chimeric gene formed from the fusion of BCR (Collins et al., 1987; Lifshitz et al. 1988) and ABL genes that results from the reciprocal translocation of segments of chromosomes 9 and 22 (Shtivelman et al., 1985). The product of this chimera is a 210 kDa protein, termed P210 BCR-ABL, that possesses an activated tyrosine kinase activity (Konopka et al., 1984; Kloetzer et al., 1985). Studies using long-term marrow culture systems and retrovirus-mediated gene transfer have documented that P210 BCR-ABL can stimulate the growth of immature hematopoietic precursor cell types (McLaughlin et al., 1987; Young & Witte, 1984). We have previously reported that P210 BCR-ABL exists in cytoplasmic complexes in association with a 53 kDa protein termed ph-P53 (Maxwell et al., 1987; Li et al. 1988). Similarly, BCR proteins have been found in cytoplasmic complexes containing ph-P53 in cells lacking the Ph1 (Li et al., 1989). These BCR protein complexes possess an associated ser/thr protein kinase activity. In this same study, we found that P210-containing complexes phosphorylate BCR proteins on tyrosine residues in vitro (Li et al., 1989). We now present results which demonstrate that P210 BCR-ABL is tightly associated with P160 BCR and ph-P53 proteins in cytoplasmic complexes from cells containing the Ph1.","['Campbell, M L', 'Li, W', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Campbell ML', 'Li W', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 May;5(5):773-6.,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47372/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous differential staining of p53 (identified by a FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody) versus DNA (stained with propidium iodide, PI), followed by bivariate analysis with flow cytometry (FCM) made it possible to evaluate p53 expression with respect to cell position during the cell cycle. The data show that in stimulated lymphocytes p53 is progressively accumulated during the G1, S and G2-phases, while in non-stimulated conditions most cells are remaining in G0/G1 and express p53 to a lesser degree. This suggests that expression of p53 is more correlated with cell growth than with entrance into (or progression through particular phases of) the cell cycle. Cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines express elevated levels of p53, while all examined human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines synthesize negligible p53 protein.

Localization of O-glycan initiation.,9264-71,"Glycoproteins from the human T leukemia cells Jurkat were found to bind to the GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr-specific lectin from Salvia sclarea seeds. The analysis of the O-linked saccharides of immunopurified leukosialin, the major [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycoprotein in Jurkat cell lysate, revealed the presence of mainly GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr with only minor amounts (approximately 17%) of more complex O-glycans. A comparison between Jurkat and K562 cell glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of O-linked carbohydrates showed that a markedly lower activity of UDP-Gal:GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr beta 1----3galactosyltransferase is apparently responsible for the presence of truncated O-glycans in the Jurkat cell line. The O-glycosylation defect makes Jurkat cells an ideal model to study the initiation of O-linked saccharides. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S] methionine showed that the addition of GalNAc to leukosialin is responsible for the decreased mobility of the mature glycoprotein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, no biosynthetic intermediates between the O-glycan-free precursor and the fully O-glycosylated form could be detected either with an anti-leukosialin antiserum or with the GalNAc-specific lectin. Lowering the chase temperature to 15 degrees C completely inhibited the transfer of GalNAc to the peptide core indicating that O-glycan initiation takes place in the first Golgi elements and not in transitional vesicles between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. In addition, treatment of the cells with monensin did not inhibit GalNAc transfer to leukosialin apoprotein. These results indicate that the initiation of O-glycosylation in Jurkat cells starts in the cis-Golgi stacks.","['Piller, V', 'Piller, F', 'Fukuda, M']","['Piller V', 'Piller F', 'Fukuda M']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'KM15WK8O5T (Acetylgalactosamine)']",IM,"['Acetylgalactosamine/metabolism', '*Antigens, CD', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Galactosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Leukosialin', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polysaccharides/*biosynthesis', 'Sialoglycoproteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/06/05 00:00,1990/06/05 00:01,['1990/06/05 00:00'],"['1990/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)38842-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jun 5;265(16):9264-71.,['R01 CA 33895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro display a more mature phenotype when grown on a bone marrow stroma-derived matrix. To elucidate which component(s) of the stromal matrix is capable of modulating HL-60 cell phenotype, matrices were treated with a variety of chemicals and enzymes prior to being used in the differentiation assay. Treatment of matrices with collagenase, pronase, chondroitinase, or chloroform:methanol:ether could not abolish the differentiation-promoting activity of bone marrow stroma. In contrast, the activity was destroyed by alkali treatment (0.5 M NaOH for 18 h) or heparinase/heparitinase enzymes. Heparin added to cultures increased maturation of HL-60 cells as determined by esterase production, Fc rosette formation, and morphological appearance. Other stromal components such as laminin, fibronectin, collagen I, collagen IV, or chondroitin sulfate did not alter the HL-60 leukemia cell phenotype.

To investigate the possible mechanisms of FLC tumor inhibition in the liver of interferon-treated mice, we developed an in vitro model consisting of a coculture of IFN-alpha/beta-resistant 3Cl8 FLC and syngeneic mouse hepatocytes. Whereas IFN-alpha/beta did not inhibit the multiplication of 3Cl8 FLC cultivated alone, it effectively inhibited the multiplication of 3Cl8 FLC in coculture with hepatocytes. The inhibitory effect was directly proportional to the amount of IFN-alpha/beta added to the cocultures, and more than 90% inhibition of FLC multiplication was noted with 1.6 x 10(5) IU/ml of IFN-alpha/beta on Day 3 of coculture. When FLC were separated from the monolayer of hepatocytes by a pored membrane (0.4 microns), the inhibitory effect on FLC proliferation was unchanged, indicating that a soluble factor(s) released from IFN-treated hepatocytes was most important in the inhibition of FLC multiplication. An inhibitory activity of FLC multiplication was detected only in the conditioned medium of IFN-treated hepatocytes but not in the conditioned medium of control hepatocytes nor in extracts of IFN-treated or control hepatocytes. The inhibitory factor(s) in the conditioned medium of IFN-treated hepatocytes was retained by an ultrafiltration membrane (Mr cut off 10,000), and its activity was completely abrogated by trypsin digestion. Its stability to treatment with 1 M acetic acid as well as lack of correlation between the antiproliferative effect and the amount of L-arginine in the medium distinguished this factor(s) from liver arginase which was also found to be a potent inhibitor of FLC multiplication in vitro. The inhibitory factor(s) was also distinguishable in its biological activity from IFN gamma, interleukin 1 alpha and beta, and transforming growth factor beta 1 and beta 2. These results suggest the possibility that the inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha/beta on the development of 3Cl8 FLC in the livers of IFN-treated mice may be mediated by an IFN-induced inhibitor of FLC multiplication.","['Yasui, H', 'Proietti, E', 'Vignaux, F', 'Eid, P', 'Gresser, I']","['Yasui H', 'Proietti E', 'Vignaux F', 'Eid P', 'Gresser I']","[""Laboratory of Viral Oncology (UPR CNRS 274), l'Institut de Recherches Scientifiques sur le Cancer, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginase/analysis', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Liver/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jun 15;50(12):3533-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the biological function of this glycoprotein still remains to be resolved. In order to clarify the role of CD45 antigen in hematopoietic cell differentiation and function, its expression on human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines was studied by membrane immunofluorescence. Thirty-eight established cell lines were analyzed using T29/33, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that recognizes the common epitopes of this glycoprotein molecule. Conventional cell marker studies were also carried out on these cell lines to compare their CD45 expression. It was shown that CD45 expression varies among B-lineage cells depending on cell differentiation, in contrast to its stable expression on leukemic T cell (6/6, positive) and myeloid (5/5, positive) lineage cell lines. On the other hand, only two out of six histiomonocytoid lineage cell lines were positive. Human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated T cell lines derived from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ALT/L) in Japan did not express CD45 on their cell surface.

Only low levels of intracellular folates were associated with mitochondria (less than 5%). Protein-bound folates comprised 37-100% of the cytosolic cofactors following growth in 2-600 nM 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Total intracellular folates increased in proportion to the changes in media folate concentration; however, binding was saturable. The maximum level of protein-bound folates in L1210 cells was 66 pmol/mg protein. Protein-bound folates were also detected in HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells grown in 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (maximum, 11 pmol/mg protein). For both lines, folate binding was specific for the tetrahydrofolate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate pool, and, to a lesser extent, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Extremely low levels of protein-bound 5-formyl-, 10-formyl-, and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates were measured, even though considerable amounts were detected intracellularly. Pentaglutamyl folates were the predominant cofactor forms in L1210 cells; conversely, the tetraglutamates were the most abundant protein-bound folate derivatives. Increasing media concentrations of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate potentiated 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine cytotoxicity. For L1210 cells, essentially all of the intracellular tetrahydrofolate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate fraction was protein bound over the concentration range of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate which maximally augmented fluoropyrimidine cytotoxicity. The relative changes in the 50% inhibitory concentrations for fluorodeoxyuridine directly approximated the increases in the levels of protein-bound tetrahydrofolates in L1210 cells. There was no direct relationship between the levels of unbound folates and fluorodeoxyuridine cytotoxicity. Similar results were obtained with HT29 cells. The major folate-binding protein in L1210 cells eluted during Sephacryl S-300 chromatography with a molecular weight of approximately 200,000; a small amount of a higher molecular weight folate-binding protein (Mr 450,000) was also detected. These findings support the concept of a compartmentation of endogenous folates involving specific binding to cytosolic proteins. These associations may regulate reduced folate availability for metabolic processes, and also mediate utilization of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for ternary complex formation with thymidylate synthase in cells treated with fluoropyrimidines. In this fashion, the levels of protein-bound tetrahydrofolates could represent an additional, previously unrecognized, determinant of fluoropyrimidine pharmacological activity toward mammalian cells.","['Matherly, L H', 'Czajkowski, C A', 'Muench, S P', 'Psiakis, J T']","['Matherly LH', 'Czajkowski CA', 'Muench SP', 'Psiakis JT']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Floxuridine/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jun 1;50(11):3262-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for altered coupling of receptors and G-proteins.,3449-57,"Prolonged exposure of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, a cultured analog of rat mast cells, to 0.1 microM dexamethasone resulted in global suppression of various stimulatory events in response to Ag and a global enhancement of the same stimulatory events to the adenosine analog, N-(ethylcarboxamide)adenosine (NECA). We had previously shown that Ag and NECA both activate phospholipase C but by different mechanisms; cells that had been treated with cholera or pertussis toxin, for example, responded to Ag but not to NECA with the release of inositol phosphates, increase in levels of cytosolic Ca2+, and secretion. Because the toxins still inhibited the responses to NECA in dexamethasone-treated cells, the effects of dexamethasone may have been exerted at the level of receptor/G-protein coupling rather than at the level of effector systems. Additional evidence for this was the following: 1) NECA-induced hydrolysis of the inositol phospholipids was still enhanced after permeabilizing (with streptolysin O or Staphylococcus alpha-toxin) and washing the cells; 2) the response to the G-protein stimulant, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate was also enhanced in permeabilized, dexamethasone-treated cells and 3) binding and kinetic studies suggested that the enhanced responsiveness to NECA was attributable in part to an increase in receptor number. The suppressive action of dexamethasone on Ag-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, however, was readily lost by permeabilizing RBL-2H3 cells. The results indicate, therefore, that treatment with dexamethasone leads to changes in receptor-coupling mechanisms that are either resistant to (i.e., NECA-mediated responses) or reversed by (i.e., Ag-mediated responses) cell permeabilization.","['Collado-Escobar, D', 'Ali, H', 'Beaven, M A']","['Collado-Escobar D', 'Ali H', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)"", 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dinitrobenzenes/immunology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 May 1;144(9):3449-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is clearly distinct from beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A in its behaviour on DEAE-cellulose columns, and it requires a higher concentration of salt for its elution. This 'extra' form has a higher ratio of activity towards 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-N-acetylglucosaminide 6-sulphate and 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-N-acetylglucosaminide than has beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and is less stable when heated at 50 degrees C. It has a pH optimum of 4.5 and is therefore not beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase C. Anti-(human beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase alpha-subunit) serum precipitated both beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and the 'extra' form, whereas an anti-(beta-subunit) serum precipitated beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A but not the 'extra' form. Western blotting and immunodetection of polypeptides derived from the 'extra' form revealed a band corresponding in size to mature alpha-subunits.

The associated occurrence of several of these features, however, has distinguished affected individuals as having a distinct entity for nearly 125 years. Recent advances in prenatal diagnosis have allowed the earlier detection, in utero, of chromosomal abnormalities. Although predisposing genetic and environmental influences remain for the most part unknown, advances in molecular biology are leading to a greater understanding of other common disorders that occur with an increased incidence in individuals with Down syndrome; these include Alzheimer's disease, acute childhood leukemia, congenital heart malformations, and immunologic abnormalities.

The conjugate consisted of 1.8 mol of neocarzinostatin per 1 mol of transferrin on average and retained cytotoxic activity against human tumor cells. This conjugate was capable of binding to the transferrin receptor of human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and was internalized by endocytosis. The LD50 values of the conjugate and neocarzinostatin alone in the presence of excess native bovine transferrin were 0.20 microgram/ml and 1.80 micrograms/ml, respectively, suggesting that the effect of the conjugate was greater than that of neocarzinostatin alone. A pulse-chase experiment using 125I-labeled conjugate revealed that 25% of the internalized conjugate was degraded in lysosomes and the rest was recycled back to the cell surface without degradation. About 75% of this conjugate recycled back to the cell surface in 18.3 min (3.4 min for receptor binding and 14.9 min for recycling to the cell surface through the acidosomes), while the rest was delivered from the cell surface to the lysosome in 19.6 min. This phenomenon was confirmed by chasing the radioactivity in subcellular fractions separated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Therefore, it was concluded that this conjugate is internalized specifically by transferrin receptors and is at least partly transferred to and accumulated in lysosomal compartments, resulting in the inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis.","['Kohgo, Y', 'Kondo, H', 'Kato, J', 'Sasaki, K', 'Tsushima, N', 'Nishisato, T', 'Hirayama, M', 'Fujikawa, K', 'Shintani, N', 'Mogi, Y']","['Kohgo Y', 'Kondo H', 'Kato J', 'Sasaki K', 'Tsushima N', 'Nishisato T', 'Hirayama M', 'Fujikawa K', 'Shintani N', 'Mogi Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical College.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (transferrin-neocarzinostatin conjugate)', '9014-02-2 (Zinostatin)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Sodium Azide', 'Transferrin/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinostatin/*metabolism/therapeutic use']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02512.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Jan;81(1):91-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02512.x.,,,,PMC5917957,,,,,,,,,,,

By two-colour flowcytometrical analysis, CD10 was found to be expressed at a specific stage of in vivo activating B cells. The expression of CD10 during B cell activation appeared to be unique from that of other activation-related B cell antigens including L29, MA6, OKT9 and OKT10. Although the expression of CD10 was associated with that of the activation-related B cell antigens, CD10+ B cells could be separated in the distinct fractions to those expressing other activation-related B cell antigens when fractionated by cell gravity. In particular, certain CD10+ B cells were detected positive for the resting B cell antigen, L30. In vitro studies revealed that CD10+ B cells arose from CD10- B cells at an early step of B cell activation, and disappeared lately when activated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I. Collectively, CD10 was an antigen transiently expressed at an early phase of B cell activation process. Expression of CD10 and other antigens on Burkitt's lymphomas (15 cases) was studied next. All cases were CD10+, and 87% (13 cases) were also L30+. In addition, six of CD10+ L30+ cases were L29+.

The drug concentration required for 50% reduction in survival was approx. 0.4 microM for both drugs and was similar for both human and mouse cells. A comparison of the two drugs was then made, at an added drug concentration of 0.5 microM, using cultured mouse L1210 and P388 leukaemia, Lewis lung carcinoma cell lines LLAK and LLTC, human Jurkat leukaemia, human histiocytic lymphoma U937 and human colon carcinoma SW620. The sensitivity of the mouse lines for amsacrine was in the order L1210 greater than P388 greater than LLAK greater than LLTC, similar to the in vivo sensitivity. The selectivity of CI-921 for L1210 versus bone marrow, and for LLAK versus L1210 or P388, was greater than that of amsacrine, again in keeping with its in vivo properties. The sensitivity of the human Jurkat and U937 lines for amsacrine was intermediate between that of L1210 and P388, while SW620 was resistant.

Fc gamma R expression was evaluated using specific anti-Fc gamma R monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The cytotoxic capability of each Fc gamma R was examined after the effector cells were treated with the recombinant cytokines IFN-gamma. TNF alpha, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, or IL-6. Hybridoma cell lines (HC) bearing antibody directed to Fc gamma RI (HC 32), Fc gamma RII (HC IV.3) or Fc gamma RIII (HC 3G8) were used as targets, as were chicken erythrocytes (CE) sensitized with heteroantibodies composed of anti-Fc gamma R mAbs (32, IV.3, 3G8) linked to anti-CE antibody. Only IFN-gamma treatment significantly increased Fc gamma R expression and then only Fc gamma RI. IFN-gamma dramatically up-regulated Fc gamma RI expression on all cells tested. However, ADCC was enhanced by treatment with a number of cytokines other than IFN-gamma. GM-CSF, TNF, and IFN-gamma treatment enhanced killing of HC 32 and HC IV.3 by in vitro cultured monocytes. G-CSF treatment enabled PMNs to kill HC through Fc gamma RII, whereas PMN killing of HC through Fc gamma RIII could not be induced by any of the cytokines studied. Although only IFN-gamma treatment increased ADCC of CE by monocytes, GM-CSF treatment as well as IFN-gamma treatment augmented ADCC of CE by PMNs. In addition to IFN-gamma treatment, IL-6 treatment enabled U937 cells to lyse CE. Whereas IFN-gamma-treated U937 cells killed CE through both Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII, IL-6-treated U937 cells killed CE only through Fc gamma RI. In addition to IFN-gamma treatment, G-CSF treatment enabled HL-60 cells to lyse CE through both Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII. These results demonstrate that although IFN-gamma appears unique in regulating Fc gamma R expression on myeloid cells, cytokines other than IFN-gamma affect ADCC by these cells in a receptor-specific manner.","['Erbe, D V', 'Collins, J E', 'Shen, L', 'Graziano, R F', 'Fanger, M W']","['Erbe DV', 'Collins JE', 'Shen L', 'Graziano RF', 'Fanger MW']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis/physiology', 'Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin G', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis/physiology', 'Receptors, IgG']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(90)90060-d [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1990 Jan;27(1):57-67. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(90)90060-d.,"['AI 19053/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 22816/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proportion of CD45R+ cells among CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells in B-CLL was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than in corresponding normal cell populations. We also sought relationships between major T cell subsets and progress of disease and found strongly positive correlations between the total leukocyte count in B-CLL and numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ cells and monocytes. Further, in patients with clinically more advanced disease, CD3+ and CD4+ cells were present in higher numbers than in patients with less advanced disease (p less than 0.05). CD8+ cells, CD4/CD8 ratio, monocytes and total leukocyte count were not significantly different when comparing the less advanced and more advanced disease patients.

The surface expression of Me14/D12 was detectable between 12 and 24 h after activation and was maximal between 24 and 48 h. Several T leukemia cell lines express the Me14/D12 Ag. On Me14/D12- cell lines, PMA and IFN-gamma induced surface expression of Me14/D12.

In a subgroup of five patients the voltage drop was associated with ST-segment or T-wave changes; three of them developed congestive heart failure. At autopsy in 15 patients, the heart weight was on the average 113% of predicted. Myocardial edema, fibrosis and cellular hypertrophy were the most common microscopic findings. Two patients had marantic endocarditis of the aortic valve. Thus, in our experience clinically significant heart involvement affects 5-10% of patients undergoing BMT after pretreatment with CY and TBI. While cardiac complications are generally not a major problem of BMT, they may have serious consequences for individual patients and should therefore be carefully watched for in the treatment of BMT recipients.","['Kupari, M', 'Volin, L', 'Suokas, A', 'Timonen, T', 'Hekali, P', 'Ruutu, T']","['Kupari M', 'Volin L', 'Suokas A', 'Timonen T', 'Hekali P', 'Ruutu T']","['First Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*etiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications', 'Cardiomegaly/etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Failure/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Feb;5(2):91-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results with fluorescent dyes, Dihematoporphyrin Ether (DHE) and Merocyanine-540 (MC-540) are detailed. Following photoradiation of cells with white light, both DHE and MC-540 showed high cytocidal activity towards lymphoid and myeloid neoplastic cells, but had significantly less effect on normal granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E) and mixed colony-forming (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), non-B, non-T, cALLa positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Reh), and diffuse histiocytic B-cell lymphoma (SK-DHL-2) cell lines were exposed to different drug concentrations in combination with white light at a constant illumination rate of 50,000 lux. With DHE doses varying from 2.0 to 2.5 ug/ml and MC-540 concentrations of 15 to 20 ug/ml, clonogenic tumor cells could be reduced by more than 4 logs, when treated alone or in mixtures with normal irradiated human marrow cells. However, preferential cytotoxicity towards neoplastic cells was highly dependent on the mode of light activation. MC-540 had no substantial effect on malignant lymphoid (SK-DHL-2) and myeloid (HL-60) cells, and on normal marrow myeloid (CFU-GM) precursors, when the drug incubation was performed in the dark and followed by light exposure of washed cells. Equal doses of MC-540 (15-20 ug/ml) could preferentially eliminate tumor cells under conditions of simultaneous light and drug treatment (30 minutes at 37 degrees C). Using DHE (2.5 ug/ml), 29.3%, 46.8%, and 27.5% of normal marrow CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM, respectively, were spared, following sequential drug and light exposure of cells, while simultaneous treatment reduced both normal (CFU-GM) and neoplastic cells below the limits of detection. The data from various centers is briefly discussed with special emphasis on clinical trials.

The first phase I trial (1 x 10(6) lymphocytes/kg IBW) was designed to test the procedure for potential toxicities, most notably, graft failure. Study 2 (1 x 10(6) lymphocytes/kg, no CsA) was expected to reduce potential toxicity incurred from long term immunoprophylaxis while study 3 was aimed at reducing the incidence of GVHD by further reducing lymphocyte dose (5 x 10(5)/kg). Graft lymphocyte dose was based on morphologic determination and was subsequently confirmed by limiting dilution analysis and flow cytometry. Although grafts were standardized solely by lymphocyte dose, the product was more uniform than the original harvested BM with respect to other cell populations. Nearly all study I (n = 40) and study III (n = 20) patients engrafted with a median time to ANC greater than 500/ul of 19 days. Three of the 4 patients consecutively enrolled in study II failed to engraft, thus terminating the trial. While a moderate proportion of study I patients had AGVHD (44%) with attendant morbidity, only 20% of study III patients were found to have mild AGVHD (less than or equal to stage I). To date, this cohort has no organ or chronic GVHD and no GVHD-associated morbidity. Median follow-up times for patients in studies I and III are 27 and 11 months, respectively. Overall actuarial survival (n = 60) is 42% at 38 months (38% study I, 80% study III). Good prognosis study I patients experienced 45% actuarial survival versus 9% in the poor prognostic group. While lymphocyte depletion has been effective in reducing the incidence and severity of AGVHD, new strategies are needed to address the issue of disease relapse. As with other methods, lymphocyte depletion by elutriation caused an increased rate of leukemia relapse. The actuarial probability of remaining in remission for recipients of elutriated marrow containing 1 x 10(6) and 5 x 10(5) lymphocytes/kg, respectively, were 60% and 46% at 16 months. Elutriation provides a rapid, reproducible and flexible methodology for graft manipulation which has been effective in reducing the incidence and severity of AGVHD. However, if lymphocyte depletion is to fulfill its promise as a means of reducing the overall morbidity of allogeneic BMT, new strategies may be needed to address the issue of relapse. These may include changes in marrow ablative therapy and post-graft immunosuppression. Equally as important may be the ability to further manipulate accessory cells and lymphoid populations presently excluded from the graft.","['Noga, S J', 'Wagner, J E', 'Rowley, S D', 'Davis, J M', 'Vogelsang, G B', 'Hess, A D', 'Saral, R', 'Santos, G W', 'Donnenberg, A D']","['Noga SJ', 'Wagner JE', 'Rowley SD', 'Davis JM', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Hess AD', 'Saral R', 'Santos GW', 'Donnenberg AD']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;333:345-59; discussion 360-1.,['R01-CA44887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two problems have had to be addressed: (1) More marrow cells must be processed than in marrows from patients with neuroblastoma, for which the separation chamber was originally developed, requiring the use of more beads, causing occlusion of the chamber's collection surface. This has been corrected by using a large surface area pre-magnet for the elimination of excess microbeads prior to processing in the main chamber; (2) Up-modulation (up to 40% positive cells) of the CD9 associated antigen has been detected.

Northern blot analysis of the RNA of RCMC1, RCMC2 and RBL-CA10.7 revealed that all three cell lines contained the same mRNA species for the alpha, beta and gamma subunits for Fc epsilon RI previously found in another rat basophilic leukemia cell line. Quantitation of the relative amounts of alpha, beta and gamma mRNA did not correlate with the expression of the relative amounts of Fc epsilon RI(alpha) in these cells. The relative amounts of mRNA for all these subunits of RCMC2 were equal or higher than those of RCMC1, suggesting that the low expression of Fc epsilon RI(alpha) on the former was a consequence of post-transcriptional events.

Lowering the intracellular ATP concentration also released calcium from an intracellular store and made further 45Ca efflux from the cells unresponsive to subsequent antigen stimulation. Antigen-stimulated 45Ca efflux could be restored by the addition of glucose. The ATP-sensitive calcium store appeared to be the same store that releases calcium in response to antigen. In contrast, intracellular ATP was not lowered, and antigen-stimulated secretion was unaffected by mitochondrial inhibitors, provided that glucose was present in the bathing solution. Similarly, antigen-stimulated 45Ca uptake, 45Ca efflux, and the rise in free ionized calcium were unaffected by individual mitochondrial inhibitors in the presence of glucose. However, when the respiratory chain inhibitor antimycin A was used in combination with the ATP synthetase inhibitor oligomycin in the presence of glucose, antigen-stimulated 45Ca uptake was inhibited, whereas the rise in free ionized calcium and secretion were unaffected. Also, antigen-induced depolarization (an indirect measurement of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane) was not affected. The inhibition of antigen-stimulated 45Ca uptake could, however, be overcome if a high concentration of the Ca2+ buffer quin2 was present in the cells to buffer the incoming 45Ca. These results suggest that in fully functional rat basophilic leukemia cells the majority of the calcium entering in response to antigen stimulation is initially buffered by a calcium store sensitive to antimycin A and oligomycin, presumably the mitochondria.","['Mohr, F C', 'Fewtrell, C']","['Mohr FC', 'Fewtrell C']","['Department of Pharmacology, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Calcium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligomycins)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '642-15-9 (Antimycin A)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antimycin A/*pharmacology', 'Azides/*pharmacology', 'Benzofurans', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Radioisotopes', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytosol', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Homeostasis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Oligomycins/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rotenone/*pharmacology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Sodium Azide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1990.258.2.C217 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1990 Feb;258(2 Pt 1):C217-26. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1990.258.2.C217.,['AI-19910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HIV LTR is also activated by several physical and chemical agents and heterologous viral genes, including adenovirus E1a. As E1a has separable transcriptional activation and repression functions, we examined the negative regulatory effects of E1a on the expression of the HIV LTR by using a trans-dominant E1a mutant. Mutant hr5 strongly suppressed the basal activity of the LTR as well as trans-activation of the LTR by heterologous agents such as the cytomegalovirus immediate early gene or DNA-damaging agents such as mitomycin C and UV irradiation. In addition, hr5 also caused significant suppression of tat gene-mediated trans-activation. The suppression of HIV LTR expression by hr5 appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the repression of the HIV enhancer, as the activity of an enhancer test system composed of the human T-cell leukemia virus I LTR containing an HIV-1 enhancer substitution was severely repressed by hr5. Cotransfection of HIV-1 proviral DNA with hr5 DNA resulted in a significant reduction of HIV production.","['Ventura, A M', 'Arens, M Q', 'Srinivasan, A', 'Chinnadurai, G']","['Ventura AM', 'Arens MQ', 'Srinivasan A', 'Chinnadurai G']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adenovirus Early Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adenovirus Early Proteins', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, Viral', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', 'Plasmids', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Suppression, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.4.1310 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Feb;87(4):1310-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.4.1310.,"['CA-31719/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC53464,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to features characteristic of myeloma cells, we found evidence of the frequent expression by myeloma tumor cells of the pre-B-cell antigen CALLA (common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen) (in specimens from 58 percent of patients) and of megakaryocytic (88 percent), myelomonocytic (65 percent), and erythroid (39 percent) surface markers. The proportion of tumor cells expressing the different markers varied among patients, from 2 to 100 percent of recognizable tumor cells.

We have analyzed the configuration of these genes in 47 unselected acute nonlymphoid leukemias. Morphology, phenotype, immunoglobulin heavy chain, and T cell receptor beta and gamma chain gene configuration were also studied. We have documented TCR delta gene rearrangements or deletions in eight cases using a genomic J delta 1 probe. The comparison of morphological, phenotypical, and molecular findings from these cases with those from control acute myeloid leukemias whose TCR delta genes were in germline configuration show that TCR delta rearrangements occur predominantly in immature leukemia exhibiting extensive lineage infidelity. The most striking feature was the frequent expression of the CD10 antigen. These data show that inappropriate gene rearrangements occur nonrandomly in myeloid leukemias and suggest that common mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of gene rearrangements and in the expression of some differentiation antigens.","['Fontenay, M', 'Flandrin, G', 'Baurman, H', 'Loiseau, P', 'Valensi, F', 'Daniel, M T', 'Sigaux, F']","['Fontenay M', 'Flandrin G', 'Baurman H', 'Loiseau P', 'Valensi F', 'Daniel MT', 'Sigaux F']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Feb;4(2):100-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1988) Elevation of IgE-binding factors in serum of patients with B cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Blood 71, 94). In the present study, we have investigated some of the mechanisms accounting for this observation. We report that the density of CD23 expression per cell is significantly higher on the B-CLLs than on the control cells, although the proportion of CD23+ B cells is comparable in both groups (70-90% of CD20+ cells express CD23 antigen). We have next examined the influence of IL-4 on the CD23 expression, the proliferation and the differentiation of B-CLLs. The results indicate that IL-4 (i) increases CD23 expression and IgE-BFs production by normal and CLL B cells; (ii) does not promote B-CLLs proliferation or differentiation, neither by itself nor in costimulation with either anti-IgM or PMA; (iii) significantly potentiates PMA-induced IgM and IgE-BFs production by B-CLLs. It is further shown that anti-CD23 Mab does not interfere with B-CLLs proliferation or differentiation. It is concluded that: (i) the excessive production of IgE-BFs in CLL patients results not only from the enlarged pool of CD23+ B cells but also from an over-expression of CD23 on B-CLLs; (ii) CD23 is not constitutively expressed on B-CLLS and it is upregulated by IL-4; and (iii) by contrast to normal B cells, CD23 on B-CLLs may not be associated with the functional LMW-BCGF receptor.","['Sarfati, M', 'Fournier, S', 'Christoffersen, M', 'Biron, G']","['Sarfati M', 'Fournier S', 'Christoffersen M', 'Biron G']","['Hopital Notre-Dame, University of Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostatic Secretory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta-microseminoprotein)', '0 (immunoglobulin-binding factors)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', '*Prostatic Secretory Proteins', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(90)90145-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(90)90145-y [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(1):47-55. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90145-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After an overnight incubation in culture medium of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), we demonstrated the presence of B8.7 antigen in 18 of 25 cases (72%). Such an incubation also induced a significant increase in the LMW BCGF responsiveness of ALL cells (P less than 0.03). In addition, we showed a significant correlation between B8.7 expression and the ability of pre-B ALL cells to respond to LMW BCGF. As previously described for normal B cells, the anti-B8.7 monoclonal antibody inhibited the LMW BCGF-dependent proliferation of pre-B ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that B8.7 antigen is expressed and may be functionally related to the LMW BCGF pathway at the pre-B cell stages of differentiation. These results also suggest that human B-cell precursor ALL are not only phenotypically similar to their normal B lymphocyte counterparts, but are also sensitive to the same immunoregulatory cytokines that control normal cell growth.","['Leprince, C', 'Blumenfeld, N', 'Flandrin, G', 'Galanaud, P', 'Sigaux, F', 'Richard, Y']","['Leprince C', 'Blumenfeld N', 'Flandrin G', 'Galanaud P', 'Sigaux F', 'Richard Y']","['Inserm U 131, Clamari, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B8.7 antigen, human)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (low molecular weight-B cell growth factor)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85722-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 15;75(4):963-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All responses measured, which included hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, increase in concentration of cytosolic Ca2+, release of arachidonic acid and the secretion of serotonin, were suppressed, but once the cells were permeabilized the inhibitory actions of dexamethasone were no longer apparent. This suggested that all the necessary components of the stimulatory cascade were intact in the dexamethasone-treated cells. The measurement of phospholipase C activity in cell extracts and studies with phorbol ester also indicated that the cells contained a normal complement of phospholipase C and protein kinase C activity. We had previously shown that both Ag and the adenosine analog, 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)-adenosine, can activate phospholipase C, but they do so through different G proteins. Interestingly, the activation of phospholipase C by 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)-adenosine and the ensuing stimulatory events were markedly enhanced in dexamethasone-treated cells. The treatment with dexamethasone thus did not result in direct suppression of effector systems, but instead resulted in the selective modulation of the coupling between receptors and the effector systems by mechanisms that require soluble cytosolic factors.","['Collado-Escobar, D', 'Cunha-Melo, J R', 'Beaven, M A']","['Collado-Escobar D', 'Cunha-Melo JR', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)"", 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Purinergic/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Jan 1;144(1):244-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under these conditions, 40 microM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) stimulates PLA2 activity 5-6-fold when free Ca2+ concentrations are buffered at 10(-7)-10(-5) M. Antigen-mediated cross-linking of receptors for IgE synergizes with low concentrations of GTP gamma S (0.1 microM) to cause similar stimulation. When the endogenous PLA2 activity is inactivated by chemical modification, we find that exogenously supplied PLA2 from porcine pancreas and Naja naja venom is also activated by the aggregation of cell-surface IgE receptors in these permeabilized cells. As with endogenous PLA2, GTP gamma S synergizes with IgE receptor-aggregation to activate exogenous PLA2 approximately 10-fold at 10(-7)-10(-6) M free Ca2+. These data indicate that receptor-mediated activation of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein can shift the Ca2+ dependence of PLA2 activity resulting in greatly enhanced activity at physiological concentrations of intracellular free Ca2+. The partial reconstitution of various PLA2 forms into such a broken-cell system offers a new approach for studying the mechanisms of G-protein-mediated activation of PLA2.","['Narasimhan, V', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Narasimhan V', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['Section of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*physiology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/25 00:00,1990/01/25 00:01,['1990/01/25 00:00'],"['1990/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)40038-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jan 25;265(3):1459-64.,"['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asymmetry of the chest and ribs was seen in 51 (36%) of these children. Fifty (35%) had scoliosis; 14 had kyphosis. In two children, the scoliosis was treated with a brace, while one developed significant kyphosing scoliosis after laminectomy and had spinal fusion. Twenty-three (16%) patients complained of significant pain at the radiation sites. Twelve of the patients developed leg-length inequality; eight of those were symptomatic. Three patients developed second primary tumors. Currently, the incidence of significant skeletal sequelae is lower and the manifestations are less severe than reported in the years from 1940 to 1970. The reduction in skeletal complications may be attributed to shielding of growth centers, symmetric field selection, decreased total radiation doses, and sequence changes in chemotherapy.","['Butler, M S', 'Robertson, W W Jr', 'Rate, W', ""D'Angio, G J"", 'Drummond, D S']","['Butler MS', 'Robertson WW Jr', 'Rate W', ""D'Angio GJ"", 'Drummond DS']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick 08903-0019.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Orthop Relat Res,Clinical orthopaedics and related research,0075674,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Back Pain/etiology', 'Bone Diseases/*etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leg Length Inequality/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Diseases/*etiology/therapy', 'Spinal Fusion']",1990/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Orthop Relat Res. 1990 Feb;(251):235-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial diagnosis in the affected children were medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, Wilm's tumor retinoblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease and, in two cases, acute lymphocytic leukemias. The age range was 6 months to 11 years. Treatment was done by surgery in 5/8, chemotherapy in 7/8 and radiotherapy in all patients. The latent period between the diagnosis of the first cancer and the diagnosis of the SMT was 3.5 to 12 years (median 8.5 years). Osteosarcomas were the most frequent SMT (5/8). The other SMT were a rhabdomyosarcoma, a non Hodgkin lymphoma and an astrocytoma. The majority of SMT were located in the area of prior radiotherapy (6/8). In the other two cases, one had an osteosarcoma, after a bilateral retinoblastoma, which grew outside the previously treated area, and the last one consisted of a lymphoma which was identified 9 years after an acute lymphocytic leukemia. Only 3/8 SMT patients are alive after 14.21 and 34 months follow up. The other children died between 11 and 20 months after diagnosis of SMT.

In 1967 Chlorambucil was given for 3 months, in 1972 for one month, inducing normalization of leukocyte count, 5.7 x 10(9)/1 with 40-50% of lymphocytes (3 x 10(9)/1). In 1977 the bone marrow showed slight lymphocytosis (38%). Numerous infections were recorded. Splenomegaly disappeared in 1980. In 1982 macrocytic anaemia was observed. Diagnosis of pernicious anaemia was established based on megaloblastic bone marrow and positive Schilling test. Vitamin B12 treatment resulted in reticulocyte response (crisis) and normalization of haemoglobin level. In 1988 light anaemia and melena appeared. Gastroscopy revealed lesions in the fornix histologically identified as ventricular carcinoma. It can be presumed that the appearance of pernicious anaemia as an autoimmune disease is analogous to other autoimmune complications in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia).","['Ruvidic, R', 'Boskovic, D']","['Ruvidic R', 'Boskovic D']","['Institute of Hematology, University Clinical Centre, Belgrade.']",['srp'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Pernicious/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 1990 Nov-Dec;118(11-12):495-7.,,,,,,Hronicna limfocitna leukemija komplikovana pojavom perniciozne anemije u toku dugotrajne remisije.,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA has been inserted into a retroviral vector derived from Moloney murine leukaemia virus, under the control of the human histone H4 promoter. This vector was used to infect melanocytes of the immortal line melan-b, which are homozygous for the b mutation and which display light brown pigmentation in culture. Infected cultures containing between 0.2 and 2 copies of provirus per cell displayed an altered phenotype: 20-50% of cells now had the black to dark brown colour characteristic of cultured wild-type (Black, B/B) mouse melanocytes. Thus the TRP-1 gene complements the brown mutation.

Recently, a number of 'mesoderm-inducing factors' (MIFs), which may be responsible for this interaction, have been discovered. Examples of these MIFs include members of the fibroblast growth factor family as well as members of the TGF-beta superfamily such as TGF-beta 2. In addition to these purified factors, several new sources of mesoderm-inducing activity have been described. One of the most potent of these is the murine myelomonocytic leukemia cell line WEHI-3. Even at high dilutions, conditioned medium from WEHI-3 cells induces isolated Xenopus animal pole regions to form a variety of mesodermal cell types. In this paper we show by several criteria, including N-terminal amino acid sequencing, Northern blotting and various functional assays, that the WEHI-MIF is activin A. Activins are known to modulate the release of follicle-stimulating hormone from cultured anterior pituitary cells and to cause the differentiation of two erythroleukemia cell lines. Our results, along with recent data from other laboratories, indicate that these molecules may also act in early development in the formation of the mesoderm.","['Albano, R M', 'Godsave, S F', 'Huylebroeck, D', 'Van Nimmen, K', 'Isaacs, H V', 'Slack, J M', 'Smith, J C']","['Albano RM', 'Godsave SF', 'Huylebroeck D', 'Van Nimmen K', 'Isaacs HV', 'Slack JM', 'Smith JC']","['Laboratory of Embryogenesis, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Embryonic Induction/*drug effects', 'Inhibins/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mesoderm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Xenopus laevis/*embryology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1990 Oct;110(2):435-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The profile of alkyllyso-GPC:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activity closely paralleled the subcellular distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum marker, NADH dehydrogenase. These data indicate the acetyltransferase in the remodeling pathway of PAF synthesis is located at the same cellular site as the acyltransferase(s) that catalyze the transfer of long-chain acyl moieties from acyl-CoAs to lyso-phospholipids.

Nor does it evince a lack of respect for the child they have conceived. The ethical guidelines that support this conclusion can now be summarized. First, actions should not depersonalize or otherwise endanger personal relationships. Second, although ideally personal relationships are initiated and continued for their own sake, after a personal relationship has been established and sustained the motives for establishing it recede in importance. Third, the requirement of honesty looms especially large in the context of personal relationships. Fourth, privacy protects personal relationships in the family from intrusion by the state. Fifth, even if those with whom we stand in personal relationships are not fully rational or self-conscious, we should treat them with respect. Finally, persons often are called upon to make greater sacrifices in personal relationships. These principles represent only the barest beginnings of an ethics for filial relationships. Nonetheless, they mark progress in the direction of developing a more complete account. We should not suppose that ethics in the family always will be spontaneous or ""natural"". Over a century ago, Mill warned that nature and natural are ""one of the most copious sources of false taste, false philosophy, false morality, and even bad law"". Especially in the wake of medical advances, such as recombinant DNA and new reproductive technologies, the complexity of filial ethics will only increase. The demographics of an aging society will add further complexity to filial contexts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jecker, N S']",['Jecker NS'],"['Department of Medical History and Ethics, University of Washington School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Ethics,The Journal of clinical ethics,9114645,,IM,"['Adult', 'Beginning of Human Life', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*standards', 'Confidentiality', '*Directed Tissue Donation', '*Ethical Analysis', '*Ethics, Medical', '*Family', 'Fertilization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Life', 'Parental Consent', '*Personhood', 'Risk Assessment', '*Siblings', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*standards']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Clin Ethics. 1990 Summer;1(2):99-103; discussion 103-7.,,,,,,,,,,['KIE: 32160'],['KIE'],"['Analytical Approach', 'Genetics and Reproduction', 'Health Care and Public Health', 'Philosophical Approach']","['KIE: 31 fn.', 'KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: organ and tissue donation', 'KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: personhood', 'KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: reproduction', 'KIE: Full author name: Jecker, Nancy S']",,

Selectivity was demonstrated by the boron derivatives in the human solid tumor screens. Almost all the compounds demonstrated cytotoxicity against single-cell suspension growths, eg Tmolt3, L1210, HeLa-S3. Selection of two compounds to examine their mode of action in L1210 lymphoid leukemia cells showed that the agents perferentially inhibited DNA synthesis followed by protein and RNA synthesis. The d(TTP) pools were markedly reduced because of inhibition of nucleotide kinase activity. The agents also inhibited regulatory enzymes in the de novo purine pathway and afforded DNA strand scission.

Simultaneous exposure to CDDP and subtoxic concentrations of VP16 for 1 h produced a cell killing in all cell lines comparable to that achieved by CDDP alone. Sequential exposure of NCI-H146 and NCI-N592 to CDDP for 1 h followed by VP16 for 96 h again produced an additive effect. When two of these cell lines were treated in in vivo models (i.p. P388 leukemia, s.c. NCI-N592) with suboptimal doses of the two drugs, a potentiation of the antitumor effects of the two drugs in simultaneous combination was evidenced by the increase in survival time and in the number of 'cures' in P388 leukemia bearing mice and by the inhibition of tumor size in NCI-N592. This comparative study, using the same cell lines in vitro and in vivo, indicates that the CDDP-VP16 potentiation observed in vivo does not reflect a specific interaction at the cellular-biochemical level.

This is based on the potential of MoAbs reactive with tumor-associated antigens as specific carriers of radionuclides, toxins, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Even though there has been much progress, a great deal of work and innovation will be required before the use of radiolabeled immunoconjugates becomes an established method for clinical tumor detection and therapy. The greatest problem is the relatively low tumor uptake of radiolabeled MoAbs in humans. This results in relatively high background levels of radioactivity in normal tissues and insufficient radioactivity in the tumor for the detection of small lesions and for therapeutic efficacy. In the future, one can expect the development of new MoAbs with greater specificity for particular tumor types, improvements in radiolabeling procedures, and the use of more effective nuclides than 131I. Biological, physiological, pathological, and dosimetric considerations need to be addressed in detail. With this additional information, it is hoped that the full potential for radiolabeled immunoconjugates will be realized.","['Buchsbaum, D J', 'Lawrence, T S']","['Buchsbaum DJ', 'Lawrence TS']","['University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Targeted Diagn Ther,Targeted diagnosis and therapy,8913519,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Colonic Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*trends', 'Radionuclide Imaging']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Targeted Diagn Ther. 1990;3:215-55.,"['P01 CA42768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA43368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA44173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,206,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the genetic mechanisms involved in the emergence of such responses, we have determined the sequences of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain variable region genes for several human monoclonal autoantibodies and compared these with corresponding sequences reported for other antibodies and autoantibodies. Our data reveal that natural autoantibodies can be encoded by nonmutated germline VH and VL genes which are essentially identical to V genes expressed in early B cell ontogeny as well as in some B-lineage tumors. Taken together with other structural data on human autoantibodies, these findings suggest that natural autoimmune responses originate early in ontogeny and that such antibodies may play a regulatory role in development of the normal immune repertoire and possibly in suppressing pathogenic autoimmune or malignant responses.","['Siminovitch, K A', 'Chen, P P']","['Siminovitch KA', 'Chen PP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Mount Sinai Hospital Research Institute, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Int Rev Immunol,International reviews of immunology,8712260,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibody Formation/genetics', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Fetus/immunology', 'Germ Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoproliferative Disorders/embryology/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08830189009056734 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Immunol. 1990;5(3-4):265-77. doi: 10.3109/08830189009056734.,"['AR-39039/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR33489/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,69,,,,,,,,,,,,

This points out the importance of investigations of leukemic cells in culture which should provide more data on proliferation and reactivity of these cells. The population of tumor cells in heterogeneous in morphological and biochemical properties, in proliferative capacity and other characteristics. In cell culture it is possible to investigate the growth of cells and the effects of various agents on normal and malignant cells. In this study we investigated the growth of cells from bone marrow of patients with acute leukemias and acute phase of chronic leukemias. Cells from 17 patients were studied. The patients were from Internal Clinic A in Belgrade and the investigations were performed before treatment. Bone marrow cells were cultured in vitro on plastics and growth of the adherent cells was followed in the course of 2-3 weeks. The results show that bone marrow cells adhered and proliferated in 12/17 patients, there was low proliferation in 4/17 and none in 1/17. It is shown that in these conditions a successful growth of fibroblast-like shaped cells can be obtained with the bone marrow cells, but it is still not possible to correlate the course of the disease and the proliferation in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Sluzic, I', 'Sami, I', 'Djuric, Lj', 'Ristic, M']","['Sluzic I', 'Sami I', 'Djuric Lj', 'Ristic M']",,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Glas Srp Akad Nauka Med,Glas.

Mature granulocytes could possibly arise in acute phase of AML from the remaining normal moelopoietic or granulopoietic stem cell or from the very leukemic clone of stem cell which still display, at least partially, the ability to sustain maturation to normal granulocyte level. In ALL, mature granulocyte probably arise from normal granulocyte precursors. In remitted AML, according to opinions of a majority of authors, mature neutrophils descend from normal stem cells. Following the study of 19 patients with AML and 19 patients with ALL, by utilizing the morphological, cytochemical and cytoenzymic properties of granulocytes et the light and electronomicroscopic level the authors have concluded: (1) in comparison with normal granulocytes, granulocytes show in the active AML, hypogranularity as well as a decrease in the activity of all studied enzymes (myeloperoxidase, alkaline and acidic phosphatase and the esterases). (2) In ALL, mature granulocytes do not feature any particular differences in the above pattern as compared with normal granulocytes. (3) In AML remission, the difference between the mature granulocytes and the granulocytes in the active disease is rather slight as compared with the morphological, cytochemical an cytonzymic characteristics.

In vivo, its net effect on bone is to increase new bone formation. Recently, the sequence of human LIF was found to differ by only a single amino acid from that of human differentiation-inducing factor (D-factor). The effects of LIF on bone appear to be complex since purified murine D-factor and recombinant LIF stimulate bone resorption in cultured newborn mouse calvaria. To examine further the responses of bone to LIF, we studied the effects of recombinant human LIF (glycosylated and nonglycosylated) and recombinant human D-factor (non-glycosylated) on resorption in another in vitro organ culture model, fetal rat long bones. Both LIF preparations and D-factor inhibited basal bone resorption rates by 25% to 44% in these cultures. Resorption rates in maximally inhibited LIF-treated cultures were similar to those in devitalized bones. Inhibitory effects typically occurred at concentrations of greater than or equal to 10 ng/mL (0.5 nM) for the non-glycosylated LIF and D-factor and 1000 U/mL for glycosylated LIF. Neither LIF nor D-factor blocked the resorptive response to interleukin 1 (IL 1) or parathyroid hormone (PTH) nor did they alter total DNA synthesis. Hence, their inhibitory effects appeared to be specific for the mechanisms regulating basal resorptive activity. These results demonstrate that LIF has potent inhibitory actions on basal resorption rates in these cultures. These effects may be important for the anabolic responses that LIF has on bone in vivo. In addition, they may also be involved in the interactions between inflammatory or tumor cells and bone.","['Lorenzo, J A', 'Sousa, S L', 'Leahy, C L']","['Lorenzo JA', 'Sousa SL', 'Leahy CL']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Newington, CT 06111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Resorption', 'Bone and Bones/embryology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glycosylation', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(90)90027-Q [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(90)90027-q [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1990 Jul;2(4):266-71. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(90)90027-q.,"['AR-21707/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-31263/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene delivery was assessed by using the retrovirus BAG vector, which bears the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the MoMLV LTR promoter-enhancer element, and by histochemical staining for bacterial beta-galactosidase activity. Direct injection of this vector (90-900 cfu) into the adult rat brain, with or without prior inoculation of C6 glioma cells (2 x 10(5) cells) resulted in labeling of only a few cells as assessed 1 week later. When the psi 2-BAG packaging line was grafted into the brain, labeled psi 2-BAG cells could be found after 1 day, but not after 5 days, following grafting, suggesting that the grafted cells had been rejected and that no endogenous cells had integrated released vector, or that expression of lacZ had been turned off. In contrast, when the psi 2-BAG packaging line was grafted into a brain region, which had been inoculated previously with rat C6 glioma cells (2 x 10(5) cells), beta-galactosidase labeling of these tumor cells, identified by immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100, could be demonstrated 10 days later. Thus, grafting of retrovirus packaging lines into adult brain provides a mean to infect tumor cells in situ. The grafted packaging cells may continue to release retrovirus particles for an extended period, thus infecting more cells at the stage of division appropriate for viral integration, as compared to inoculation of the virus alone.

The cases were divided into two major variants: Systemic mastocytosis (SM; n = 34) with urticaria pigmentosa-like skin lesions, and malignant mastocytosis (MM; n = 27), without skin involvement. The following results were obtained: (1) Significant differences between MM and SM were found in the main haematological parameters (erythrocyte, platelet and leucocyte counts and haemoglobin level); normal values were found in 16 of the SM cases, but never in MM. (2) The main pathological findings were: in SM, anaemia (9/34) and leucocytosis (5/34); and in MM, leucocytosis (19/27), monocytosis (14/27), eosinophilia (12/27), bicytopenia (12/27, mostly anaemia with thrombocytopenia), basophilia (10/27) and isolated anaemia (7/27). (3) The major finding was a significant difference between MM and SM in the incidence of myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), myelodysplasia and mast cell leukaemia (MCL): these disorders occurred in 23 (92%) MM patients, but only in two (6%) SM patients (P less than 0.001). The four instances of MCL and two of myelodysplasia all occurred with MM. Of the 19 cases of MPD, six (SM, 1; MM, 5) were acute variants (acute myeloid and myelomonocytic leukaemias) and 13 (SM, 1; MM, 12) were chronic variants. No case of malignant lymphoma was noted. (4) The blood picture in 10 of 13 chronic MPD cases represented an atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia for which the preliminary descriptive term 'mastocytosis-associated MPD' is proposed. (5) A survey of 103 published cases (SM, 77; MM, 26) yielded similar findings, including a high incidence of MPD and MCL in MM.

In the course of 15 years the authors collected repeatedly blood specimens from 53 children with ALL before, during and after treatment. Active sera were examined by quantitative titration by means of microbes labelled with 51Cr. The results of the investigation revealed that mean values of bacteriocidity calculated from all specimens and for each child separately are higher in the groups of children with a favourable course of the disease, as compared with children with an adverse course of the disease. It was also found that in a high percentage (78%) patients with long-term remission of leukaemia have a rising trend of bacteriocidity and the majority of children with a relapse of the disease (69%) had a bacteriocidity of serum with a declining trend (p = 0.01). The prognostic value of the test is unequivocally apparent from the results of the ""life table"" analysis.

The dissemination of the DIA/LIF signal is therefore under specific molecular control. The expression of DIA/LIF in vitro is both developmentally programmed and controlled by the action of other growth factors, the most notable of which are members of the fibroblast growth factor family expressed by the stem cells themselves.

In the new 15;16 variant, the breakpoint of chromosome 15 was at the interphase of the D2/3 sub-bands, as in mouse plasmacytomas with the previously well-known typical 12;15 and variant 6;15 translocations. The breakpoint on chromosome 16 was mapped to band 16B1, corresponding to the presumed cytogenetic site of the Ig-lambda gene. In three of the seven tumors with the 15;16 translocation, the derivative chromosome 15 had undergone a duplication, a feature that has not been previously encountered in the MPC-associated 12;15 and 6;15 translocation carriers.

The erythroblasts were subsequently tested for their binding of natural antibodies of all the major immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes and both light-chain types, using Fc- and light-chain-specific FITC-immunoconjugates, and flow cytometry. After short-term (4-h) exposure of IFLE to puromycin, some binding of IgG but not of IgM or IgA could be demonstrated. By contrast, prolonged (17-h) exposure of IFLE to cycloheximide or puromycin resulted in their reaction with antibodies of all major isotypes (IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA) containing kappa-light chains. Under these conditions of damage the percentage of IgM- or IgG-binding IFLE significantly exceeded that of IgA-reactive cells. Moreover, the percentage of damaged IFLE which bound IgG2a or IgG3 was greater than that of cells which bound IgG1 or IgG2b. The percentage of damaged IFLE which bound a certain Ig-isotype did not correlate with the concentration of that Ig-isotype in normal mouse serum.

The intracellular accumulation of ara-CTP (ara-CTP-Ep) was dependent on the cell type, extracellular ara-CTP concentration and pulse voltage on electroporation. In a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, ara-CTP-Ep revealed a cytotoxic effect in a dose-dependent manner, although electroporation alone did not have any significant toxicity. Furthermore, simultaneous injection of dCTP, or continuous exposure to deoxycytidine, but not to other deoxyribonucleosides, immediately after electroporation rescued the cells from the toxicity of ara-CTP-Ep. The degradation of ara-CTP-Ep consisted of an early rapid phase followed by a slower phase with a half life of 1.5 h. The addition of dipyridamole (10 microM), an inhibitor of nucleoside transport, retarded this degradation process. These data indicate that transfer of ara-CTP by electroporation is a useful method for the study of ara-CTP metabolism.","['Kubota, M', 'Yorifuji, T', 'Hashimoto, H', 'Shimizu, T', 'Mikawa, H']","['Kubota M', 'Yorifuji T', 'Hashimoto H', 'Shimizu T', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Buffers', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Electricity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02696.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Dec;81(12):1314-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02696.x.,,,,PMC5918004,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneously we measured adenosine deaminase and purine nucleosidephosphorylase activities by a method of paper radiochromatography in peripheral blood/bone marrow leukemic cells from 23 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 5 patients with prolymphocytic leukemia, one with prolymphocytoid transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 15 patients with hairy cell leukemia.

On the basis of purine enzyme activity we were able to differentiate between chronic lymphocytic leukemia versus prolymphocytic and hairy cell leukemia. In one patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia we could detect very early stage of prolymphocytoid transformation by increased activity of purine nucleosidephosphorylase activity. There were only two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were assigned to the prolymphocytic leukemia on the basis of purine nucleosidephosphorylase activity and two patients with hairy cell leukemia with atypical enzyme pattern attributable to the nonrepresentative number of pathological cells in the peripheral blood.

Approximately 40%-50% of concanavalin A (Con A) or anti-CD3-activated T cells were TL+, with expression detected on both the CD4 and CD8 subsets by dual-color analysis. Activated T cells expressed detectable levels of TL mRNA 48 h after stimulation, but no TL transcripts were detectable in unstimulated splenocytes. However, TL mRNA expression in mature activated T cells did not precisely mimic thymocyte expression: the level of expression was considerably lower in activated T cells, and in most haplotypes the transcripts produced in activated T cells appeared to represent a subset of the transcripts produced in thymocytes. By run-off transcription assays in isolated nuclei, TL gene expression was detected in activated but not resting T cells indicating that lack of expression of TL in resting T cells is not due to message instability. These data demonstrate that TL genes are inducible and transcriptionally regulated.","['Dolby, N', 'Mehta, V', 'Cook, R G']","['Dolby N', 'Mehta V', 'Cook RG']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tla antigens)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00241631 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 1990;32(6):380-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00241631.,['AI17897/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The marrow surrounding focal or patchy lymphoma infiltrates of CLL and CB-CC displayed no relevant changes in fibre density with respect to the control samples. Following chemotherapy, repeated trephine biopsies (restaging procedure) were obtainable from 38 patients. There was no significant decrease in the fibre content of CLL, CB-CC and LPI infiltrates. In HCL an incomplete reduction was recorded after interferon treatment. So-called benign lymphoid lesions may be distinguished from focal-patchy infiltrates of CB-CC and LPI not only by showing a central localization, but also by the absence of significant amounts of reticulin.

Expression of cross-reactive idiotopes characteristic of certain rheumatoid factors and identifying V kappa III, VHI, and VHIII gene family products.",709-16,"Our previous studies have shown that a high frequency of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized cord blood (CB) and fetal liver (FL) clones produce IgM antibodies which display extensive autoreactivity for IgG Fc (rheumatoid factor, RF). To investigate further the repertoire of these early B cells, we have examined the expression of CRI associated with RF paraproteins in relation to antibody specificity and polyreactivity. CRI were detected by ELISA and/or flow cytometry using a panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies defining idiotopes associated with particular V kappa and VH gene family products and raised against Fc-specific paraproteins. Many of the CRI were expressed by these clones, suggesting that they may be markers of early B cells. The presence of the CRI was not always associated with Fc specificity. Three of eight CB/FL clones expressed the V kappa III subgroup of light chains, and two of these expressed the V kappa III sub-subgroup associated CRI, 17-109. These two clones reacted with IgG Fc, and one also bound to single-stranded DNA. The VHIII-associated idiotope D12 was expressed on IgM from 4 out of 9 FL and 5 out of 12 CB clones. D12 and B6 (also a VHIII-associated CRI) were coexpressed in 4 out of 5 CB clones but not in the four FL clones. Seven out of nine clones expressing these idiotopes were polyreactive, and five had Fc-binding activity. Three of the 12 CB clones expressed the VHI-associated conformational idiotope G8. One of 20 CLL clones expressed both B6 and D12, and another expressed both 17-109 and the VHI-associated G6 and G8 idiotopes. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the frequent usage, in early B cells, of V kappa subgroups and VH-associated idiotopes of RF paraproteins. The expression of these CRI was not a prerequisite for binding to IgG Fc, but there was a frequent association of these idiotopes with it. Differences in expression of CRI between CLL and early B-cell clones may suggest differences in the pattern of VH usage between these subsets of B cells.","['Lydyard, P M', 'Quartey-Papafio, R P', 'Broker, B M', 'MacKenzie, L', 'Hay, F C', 'Youinou, P Y', 'Jefferis, R', 'Mageed, R A']","['Lydyard PM', 'Quartey-Papafio RP', 'Broker BM', 'MacKenzie L', 'Hay FC', 'Youinou PY', 'Jefferis R', 'Mageed RA']","['Departments of Immunology, University College, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Liver/cytology/*embryology', 'Multigene Family', 'Rheumatoid Factor/*analysis']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1990.tb03214.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1990 Dec;32(6):709-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1990.tb03214.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acycloadenosine derivatives as inhibitors of the enzyme.,2465-71,"Various adenosine acyclonucleoside derivatives were tested as inhibitors of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MeSAdo) phosphorylase, an enzyme involved in the salvage of adenine and methionine from MeSAdo. The 2-halogenated derivatives of acyloadenosine [9-(2-hydroxyethoxy-methyl)adenine], including the chloro-, bromo- and iodo-congeners, all inhibited murine Sarcoma 180 (S180) MeSAdo phosphorylase, with Ki values in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-5) M. Halogenated derivatives of 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)adenine, which more closely resemble the natural substrate, were substantially more potent inhibitors of the enzyme, with Ki values in the range of 2-7 x 10(-7) M. 5'-Methylthio and 5'-halogenated analogs of 2'-deoxy-1',2'-seco-adenosine were weak inhibitors, with Ki values of 10(-4) M or greater. 9-[(1-Hydroxy-3-iodo-2-proxy)methyl]adenine. (HIPA), the derivative with the lowest Ki values among these analogs, was a competitive inhibitor of S180 MeSAdo phosphorylase. In preliminary studies, HIPA inhibited MeSAdo phosphorylase in intact HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, as it limited the incorporation of [8-14C]MeSAdo into cellular adenine nucleotide pools. In addition, 9-(phosphonoalkyl)adenines, representing potential multisubstrate inhibitors of MeSADo phosphorylase, were synthesized. Of these the heptyl derivative was the most potent inhibitor, with a Ki of 1.5 x 10(-5) M at low (3.5 mM) phosphate concentrations. The inhibitory effects of these analogs could be ablated at high phosphate concentrations (50 mM), suggesting that they interact with the phosphate binding site on the enzyme. Some of these novel MeSAdo phosphorylase inhibitors may have a role in cancer chemotherapy as potentiators of agents that block purine de novo synthesis, e.g. antifolates and 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside.","['Savarese, T M', 'Harrington, S', 'Nakamura, C', 'Chen, Z H', 'Kumar, P', 'Mikkilineni, A', 'Abushanab, E', 'Chu, S H', 'Parks, R E Jr']","['Savarese TM', 'Harrington S', 'Nakamura C', 'Chen ZH', 'Kumar P', 'Mikkilineni A', 'Abushanab E', 'Chu SH', 'Parks RE Jr']","['Division of Biology and Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sarcoma 180/enzymology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1990/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(90)90087-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90087-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Dec 1;40(11):2465-71. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90087-2.,"['CA 07340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By linker insertion scanning, we have produced 33 random mutations along the HTLV-I envelope gene, cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector. The resulting envelope products were analysed by immunoprecipitation and syncytia formation after transfection into COS-1 cells. We show here that 25 out of 33 mutations result in a non-functional envelope product as assessed by the lack of ability to form syncytia. In the majority of these mutants, the processing of the envelope gp61 precursor into the mature gp45 and gp20 proteins was affected. We propose that conformational constraints for processing and fusion abilities tend to limit the variability of the HTLV-I envelope. In three mutants, processing was observed but no syncytia were formed. These mutations might affect regions important for HTLV-I envelope functions, such as the receptor binding region.","['Pique, C', 'Tursz, T', 'Dokhelar, M C']","['Pique C', 'Tursz T', 'Dokhelar MC']","['CNRS UA 1156, Institut G.

DNA synthesis and the expression of the p55 alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor (Tac antigen) were also inhibited. The inhibitory effect was greatest when these factors were added during the first 48 h of a 4-day culture, with reduced cytolytic activity against both natural killer (NK) resistant and NK-sensitive tumour cell line targets. The suppressive action of both cytokines was accompanied by a reduction in tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in lymphocyte culture supernatants. Recombinant human IFN-gamma (rhIFN-gamma), but not recombinant human TNF-alpha (rhTNF-alpha) was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of recombinant human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) on LAK induction and DNA synthesis but not Tac antigen expression. However, cytotoxicity induced by rhIFN-gamma alone was also suppressed by rhIL-4 and TGF-beta 1, inferring that rhIFN-gamma-mediated abrogation of rhIL4 suppression was not simply a direct IL-2-independent effect on cytotoxicity. In addition, rhIL-4 did not increase TGF-beta production from rhIL-2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that rhIL-4 did not mediate reduction of rhIL-2 responses through the induction of TGF-beta release.","['Brooks, B', 'Chapman, K', 'Lawry, J', 'Meager, A', 'Rees, R C']","['Brooks B', 'Chapman K', 'Lawry J', 'Meager A', 'Rees RC']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Microbiology, University of Sheffield Medical School, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cytokines', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/*pharmacology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb05494.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1990 Dec;82(3):583-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb05494.x.,,,,PMC1535485,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute exacerbations of concomitant inflammatory periodontal diseases can result in systemic infections in these patients. However, host-oral bacterial relationships in the periodontium in patients with ANLL are not well understood. Twenty-one adult patients with ANLL with periodontal disease ranging from gingivitis to severe periodontitis were studied. Supragingival and subgingival plaque specimens were collected before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy), and at a defined midpoint of myelosuppression (midchemotherapy; day 14). All specimens were extensively cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. Data were submitted to a partial correlational analysis, controlling for covariation relation to oral hygiene intervention and antibiotic administration. Levels of total yeast exhibited a significant association with Staphylococcus sp. at supragingival sites midchemotherapy (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.05). Levels of total yeast also correlated positively with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at subgingival sites both prechemotherapy (r = 0.70, p less than or equal to 0.01) and midchemotherapy (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant correlations of levels of Veillonella sp. with Neisseria sp. and gram-negative enteric bacilli were observed in both supragingival (r = 0.95, 0.77, p values less than or equal to 0.01) and subgingival (r = 0.69, 0.61, p values less than or equal to 0.05) plaque specimens midchemotherapy but not prechemotherapy.

Scatchard analysis of whole cell specific [3H]triamcinolone acetonide binding data did not reveal any effect of 3-aminobenzamide on either the number of intracellular receptor binding sites or their affinity for the agonist. Treatment of the ICR-27 cell line, which is a glucocorticoid resistant mutant isolated from CEM-C7, with 3-aminobenzamide did not restore triamcinolone acetonide sensitivity. Similarly, 3-aminobenzamide treatment of several other lymphoid cell lines (human HL60 and IM-9 and murine L1210 cells) which contain functional receptors but are not normally lysed by glucocorticoid agonists, failed to induce sensitivity to triamcinolone acetonide. Since treatment of sensitive lymphoid cells with glucocorticoid agonists results in DNA fragmentation prior to cell death, these data suggest that 3-aminobenzamide potentiates the cytolytic response of sensitive cells to glucocorticoid agonists by inhibiting DNA excision repair mechanisms.","['Meyer, A S', 'Schlechte, J A', 'Schmidt, T J']","['Meyer AS', 'Schlechte JA', 'Schmidt TJ']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/*metabolism', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90181-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(10):909-14. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90181-8.,['DK25295/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard incubation conditions for mouse lymphoma cells and the PHS system were developed. The cells were exposed to BNZ and 2-AF with purified PHS in the presence or absence of a peroxide, 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl hydroperoxide (PPHP) which is required for PHS-dependent amine oxidation. Incubations were carried out in a medium consisting of Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium and magnesium and 0.1% pluronic F-68. BNZ by itself or in the presence of PPHP induced a weak mutagenic response in mouse lymphoma cells, but the addition of PHS or PHS and its co-factor PPHP increased the mutagenic response approximately 5-fold over that observed in the absence of PHS. A maximal mutagenic response for BNZ was observed after incubation with the complete activating system, PHS and PPHP. These data are in agreement with the fact that BNZ is an excellent substrate for PHS. When 2-AF was incubated with mouse lymphoma cells, only a minimal mutagenic response was observed. Incubation of 2-AF with either PPHP or PPHP and PHS (complete peroxidase system produced a significant enhancement in mutagenic response. Thus, the mutagenic response of the mouse lymphoma cells to 2-AF was dependent on the peroxide, PPHP but not the enzyme PHS. These data suggest that 2-AF, which is a poor PHS substrate, is oxidized by a different catalyst than PHS. This work demonstrates that BNZ and 2-AF are converted by peroxide-dependent mechanisms to mutagens that can be detected in mammalian cells.","['Sarkar, F H', 'Radcliff, G', 'Callewaert, D M', 'Marnett, L J', 'Eling, T', 'Daston, D S', 'Caspary, W J']","['Sarkar FH', 'Radcliff G', 'Callewaert DM', 'Marnett LJ', 'Eling T', 'Daston DS', 'Caspary WJ']","['Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Rochester, MI 48309.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Peroxides)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', '3A69OS195N (2-aminofluorene)', '94242-71-4 (5-phenylpent-4-enyl-1-hydroperoxide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",IM,"['Alkenes', 'Animals', 'Benzidines/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'Fluorenes/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*methods', '*Mutagens', 'Peroxides', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(90)90050-C [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(90)90050-c [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1990 Dec;242(4):319-28. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(90)90050-c.,['N44-ES-61008/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both groups (12 patients each group) received amphotericin B for antifungal prophylaxis. 20 febrile episodes occurred in 22 courses of oral prophylactic ciprofloxacin and 22 occurred in 24 courses of oral prophylactic polymyxin B. Patients receiving ciprofloxacin had a mean time to the first infection-related febrile episode of 7.2 days, compared with 4.3 days for the polymyxin B group (p less than 0.01). Patients receiving ciprofloxacin also had fewer days of fever (average 6.5 days versus 9.8 days for the polymyxin B group, p less than 0.02). Duration of administration of parental antibiotics were also shorter in the ciprofloxacin group (p less than 0.001). Although modifications of the empiric antibiotic regimen were required more frequent in patients receiving polymyxin B, this did not reach statistical significance.

Tumor growth was followed after intradermal injection, and spleen cells were isolated at different time points. IFN-gamma secretion by tumor cells abrogated their tumorigenicity and induced a persistent and specific antitumor immunity. In contrast to the normally observed cellular immunosuppression in unmodified CMS-5 tumor-bearing mice, IFN-gamma-producing tumors induced a long lasting state of T-cell immunity, as judged by rejection of a CMS-5 tumor challenge and persistence of specific cytotoxic activity in the spleen cell population. High levels of tumor-specific cytotoxic activity could also be detected if IFN-gamma-secreting tumor cells, but not unmodified CMS-5 cells, were used as targets at a time point when immunosuppression was usually seen.

The assay of FDP was performed on serum samples prepared in test tubes containing 5 U/ml thrombin (final concentration) by a method based on latex agglutination using antifibrinogen antibodies, and the levels of D dimer in plasma were determined by a newly developed latex immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies which do not cross-react with fibrinogen. 5 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) had highly elevated FDP levels with normal levels of D dimer. Plasma samples from such patients with CML were treated with various concentrations of thrombin (2-10 U/ml) and after the removal of fibrin clots the levels of FDP in supernatants were assayed by the FDP assay procedure described above. The levels of FDP were normalized when plasma were treated with 10 U/ml thrombin. In 2 patients with CML who had elevated levels of FDP in serum, it was impossible to remove fibrinogen completely by addition of 5 U/ml thrombin. However, FDP levels in the sera treated with 5 U/ml thrombin were almost normal in normal controls and patients with other diseases than CML. From these results it is concluded that residual fibrinogen reacted in the assay procedure as markedly increased FDP in supernatants and elevated FDP levels in serum reflected fibrinogen-related materials, which may not completely polymerize in the presence of lower concentrations of thrombin in some patients with CML. The assay of D dimer in plasma using monoclonal antibodies is recommended in cases of CML to rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation.","['Saito, M', 'Asakura, H', 'Jokaji, H', 'Uotanzi, C', 'Kumabashiri, I', 'Yoshida, T', 'Hashizume, K', 'Matsuda, T']","['Saito M', 'Asakura H', 'Jokaji H', 'Uotanzi C', 'Kumabashiri I', 'Yoshida T', 'Hashizume K', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Internal Medicine (III), Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (fibrin fragment D)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Latex Fixation Tests', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Thrombin']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000205053 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1990;84(3):149-55. doi: 10.1159/000205053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other studies have shown that the c-jun protooncogene is expressed during phorbol ester-induced myeloid differentiation. This work examines the effects of ara-C on c-jun gene expression in human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells. The results demonstrate that c-jun transcripts are undetectable in uninduced KG-1 cells and that ara-C induces expression of this gene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Ara-C treatment was also associated with increases in c-jun transcripts in U-937, THP-1, and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, transcriptional run-on analysis has demonstrated that exposure to ara-C increases the rate of c-jun gene transcription. The results also demonstrate that while inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces c-jun mRNA levels in phorbol ester-treated KG-1 cells, cycloheximide had no effect on the induction of c-jun transcripts during ara-C treatment. Moreover, the half-life of c-jun transcripts in ara-C-treated KG-1 cells was 42 min. These findings suggest that the increase in c-jun mRNA observed during ara-C treatment is regulated by a transcriptional mechanism, and that c-jun may be involved in the induction of differentiation and regulation of gene expression by ara-C.","['Kharbanda, S M', 'Sherman, M L', 'Kufe, D W']","['Kharbanda SM', 'Sherman ML', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI114870 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1990 Nov;86(5):1517-23. doi: 10.1172/JCI114870.,"['CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC296898,,,,['c-jun'],,,,,,,

After 48 h of incubation with rIFN-gamma (500 U/ml) the percentage of 2G5-positive cells increased from 40% to 79%, and the 2G5 mean density was enhanced by 10-fold (11,000 versus 110,000 molecules/cell). Concurrently, rIFN-gamma pretreatment induced a dramatic improvement of 2G5 RTA-IT dose-effect cytotoxicity, as well as immunotoxin cytotoxicity kinetics. When 2G5 RTA-IT was used at the optimal dose of 10(-8)M (the maximum dose which avoided non-specific ricin A-chain cytotoxicity), the immunotoxin-induced cell kill increased with the percentage of DR-positive ML-3 cells according to a similar linear-logarithmic function of rIFN-gamma concentration. Moreover, in the same range of rIFN-gamma concentrations, the killing values and the percentage of DR-positive ML-3 cells were similar if not identical. These findings imply that the enhancement of 2G5 RTA-IT cytotoxicity by rIFN-gamma is mainly related to the rIFN-gamma 2G5 antigen induction on HLA-DR negative cells when immunotoxin was used at 10(-8) M. Furthermore, 2G5 RTA-IT dose-effect cytotoxicity on DR-expressing ML-3 cells, when used at lower concentrations, was also increased by rIFN-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. This result suggests that for immunotoxin concentrations close to the limiting membrane saturation dose (10(-10)M), rIFN-gamma may not solely act by inducing HLA-DR expression on DR-negative ML-3 subpopulation but also by increasing individual cellular DR density on DR expressing ML-3 cells. Finally, our study showed that immunotoxin potency on malignant cell populations which display an heterogeneous antigen expression, could be greatly improved by the use of rIFN-gamma.","['Chiron, M', 'Jaffrezou, J P', 'Carayon, P', 'Bordier, C', 'Roubinet, F', 'Xavier, C', 'Brandely, M', 'Laurent, G']","['Chiron M', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Carayon P', 'Bordier C', 'Roubinet F', 'Xavier C', 'Brandely M', 'Laurent G']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology, CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Ricin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/pathology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb05429.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1990 Nov;82(2):214-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb05429.x.,,,,PMC1535130,,,,,,,,,,,

To isolate clone-specific sequences, we first synthesized oligonucleotides that match conserved variable (VH) and joining (JH) sequences flanking the third hypervariable region (HVR3) in the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. In polymerase chain reactions (PCR), these primers were then used to amplify the intervening HVR3 segments from leukemic DNA samples. Of 12 B-lineage ALLs studied, ten generated one or more fragments of the size expected for HVR3 gene segments. Thus, this single pair of amplimers was sufficient to isolate HVR3 sequences from a majority of acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To verify that the amplified fragments originated from HVR3 alleles and to assess their diversity, we sequenced 7 PCR products derived from 6 leukemias. In addition to elements of recognized D segments, each of the 7 fragments contained novel VH-D and D-JH junctional sequences, including N nucleotides, not known to be present in the germline. Each sequence was unique, and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes hybridized only to HVR3 segments from which the probes were derived. Therefore, as anticipated, these HVR3 segments appeared to possess the diversity required to serve as clonal markers for leukemic populations. To demonstrate that these amplified HVR3 alleles could serve as the basis for a sensitive and specific assay to detect rare leukemic cells, we analyzed in detail one pre-B leukemia that had rearranged 2 IgH alleles. The HVR3 sequences were shown to be linked to rearranged JH-containing restriction fragments in digests of genomic DNA, establishing their origin in the leukemic cells. We synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to the unique junctional sequences in the HVR3 segments. Using these novel amplimers in an allele-specific amplification and hybridization procedure, we showed that this assay can detect 10 leukemic cells in a background of 10(6) normal blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, the leukemic HVR3 sequences were not detected in extracts of normal or unrelated remission leukemic leukocytes. We conclude that the assay for specific IgH HVR3 sequences is a realistic strategy for detection of minimal residual disease in B-lineage ALL.","['Jonsson, O G', 'Kitchens, R L', 'Scott, F C', 'Smith, R G']","['Jonsson OG', 'Kitchens RL', 'Scott FC', 'Smith RG']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-8852.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Amplification/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology']",1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82119-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Nov 15;76(10):2072-9.,"['CA42891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44016/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the patients were treated on two consecutive Children Cancer Study Group protocols and received identical chemotherapy and either 18 or 24 Gy radiation therapy (RT) to one of the following fields: craniospinal plus 12 Gy abdominal RT including the gonads (group 1); craniospinal (group 2); or cranial (group 3). The median age at the time of their last evaluation was 14.5 years (range, 10.5 to 25.7), which took place a median of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10.3) after discontinuing therapy. The incidence of primary germ cell dysfunction as judged by raised levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or reduced testicular volume was significantly associated with field of RT; 55% of group 1, 17% of group 2, and 0% of group 3 were abnormal (P = .002). Leydig cell function, as assessed by plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone, and pubertal development, was unaffected in the majority of subjects regardless of RT field. These data indicate that in boys undergoing therapy for ALL, germ cell dysfunction is common following testicular irradiation and can occur following exposure to scattered irradiation from craniospinal RT. In contrast, Leydig cell function appears resistant to direct irradiation with doses as high as 12 Gy.","['Sklar, C A', 'Robison, L L', 'Nesbit, M E', 'Sather, H N', 'Meadows, A T', 'Ortega, J A', 'Kim, T H', 'Hammond, G D']","['Sklar CA', 'Robison LL', 'Nesbit ME', 'Sather HN', 'Meadows AT', 'Ortega JA', 'Kim TH', 'Hammond GD']","['Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, New York University, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Luteinizing Hormone/*blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Puberty/blood', 'Sexual Maturation/*radiation effects', 'Testis/*radiation effects']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.12.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Dec;8(12):1981-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.12.1981.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Local bone-resorbing agents such as IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and LPS greatly induced IL-6 mRNA expression in both MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblast-like cells. Parathyroid hormone slightly increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in primary osteoblast-like cells but not in MC3T3-E1 cells. Neither IL-6 nor 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in either of the osteoblast-like cells. In agreement with the expression of IL-6 mRNA, biologically active IL-6 was produced in response to the treatment with IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS in MC3T3-E1 cells. Adding IL-6 dose dependently stimulated the release of 45Ca from prelabeled fetal mouse calvaria. Simultaneously adding suboptimal concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha induced bone resorption cooperatively. In accord with the increase in the release of 45Ca by IL-6, there were three times as many osteoclasts in the bone sections of calvaria cultured with IL-6 for 5 days as in the controls. IL-6 slightly suppressed alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. These results indicate that IL-6 is also produced by osteoblasts, preferentially in response to local bone-resorbing agents, and it induces bone resorption both alone and in concert with other bone-resorbing agents.","['Ishimi, Y', 'Miyaura, C', 'Jin, C H', 'Akatsu, T', 'Abe, E', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Yamaguchi, A', 'Yoshiki, S', 'Matsuda, T', 'Hirano, T']","['Ishimi Y', 'Miyaura C', 'Jin CH', 'Akatsu T', 'Abe E', 'Nakamura Y', 'Yamaguchi A', 'Yoshiki S', 'Matsuda T', 'Hirano T', 'et al.']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation factor)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Animals', 'Bone Resorption/*chemically induced', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/biosynthesis', 'Female', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Nov 15;145(10):3297-303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 296 subjects, 132 (44.6%) had anti-HTLV-I antibodies. Fifty-nine (41.0%) out of 144 males and 73 (48.0%) out of 152 females were seropositive. The positive rates of antibody to HTLV-I increased with age, especially between the 30-39 and the 40-49 age groups. Five out of 6 fathers, 3 out of 4 mothers, 31 (60.8%) out of 51 spouses, 40 (63.5%) out of 63 siblings and 46 (33.8%) out of 136 children of patients with ATL had anti-HTLV-I antibodies.

In contrast, none of the 13 children whose mothers were not carriers were seropositive. These results supported the hypothesis that the mother-to-child transmission is one of the most important modes of HTLV-I transmission. In wives of male patients with ATL, the positive rate of antibody to HTLV-I was 65.6% (21/32), and in husbands of female patients, it was 52.6% (10/19). The high positive rate of antibody to HTLV-I not only in wives of male patients but also in husbands of female patients suggests that either HTLV-I is more frequently transmitted from wives to their husbands than we had originally expected, or that ATL may develop even in wives who acquire HTLV-I from their husbands after marriage.","['Momita, S', 'Ikeda, S', 'Amagasaki, T', 'Soda, H', 'Yamada, Y', 'Kamihira, S', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kinoshita, K', 'Ichimaru, M']","['Momita S', 'Ikeda S', 'Amagasaki T', 'Soda H', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kinoshita K', 'Ichimaru M']","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Family', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/epidemiology/immunology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', 'Sex Factors']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02662.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Sep;81(9):884-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02662.x.,,,,PMC5918107,,,,,,,,,,,

Since commitment was not inhibited by blocking DNA replication by aphidicolin or cytokinesis by cytochalasin B, mitosis may be the only phase of the cell cycle required for commitment.","['Dinnen, R', 'Ebisuzaki, K']","['Dinnen R', 'Ebisuzaki K']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/drug effects', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Mitosis/drug effects', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(90)90049-G [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(90)90049-g [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1990 Nov;191(1):149-52. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(90)90049-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the biological effects of N-m-KRTLR using as an in vitro model the induction of the IL-2 receptor and IL-2 secretion by Jurkat cells in response to stimulation with 12-O tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) plus phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and TPA plus OKT3 mAb. N-m-KRTLR significantly suppressed induction of the IL-2 receptor on the surface of the Jurkat cells by TPA plus either PHA or OKT3 mAb. Furthermore, N-m-KRTLR inhibited the production and release of IL-2 from cultured Jurkat cells stimulated with TPA plus either PHA or OKT3 mAb. Similarly, this peptide significantly inhibited the IL-2 production in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to stimulation by TPA and PHA. In contrast, this peptide did not affect expression of the CD3 complex on the surface of the Jurkat cells either alone or in the presence of TPA or PHA. Furthermore, N-m-KRTLR did not interfere with the spontaneous proliferation of the Jurkat cells, and its effects on IL-2 secretion and IL-2 receptor expression in the Jurkat cells were evident without loss of cell viability. These results suggest that the novel protein kinase C inhibitor N-m-KRTLR may selectively inhibit certain activation pathways of Jurkat cells and indicate the usefulness of N-m-KRTLR in the analysis of discrete events in T cell activation.","['Ioannides, C G', 'Freedman, R S', 'Liskamp, R M', 'Ward, N E', ""O'Brian, C A""]","['Ioannides CG', 'Freedman RS', 'Liskamp RM', 'Ward NE', ""O'Brian CA""]","['Department of Gynecology, University of Texas M.

The mechanisms underlying the cell specific actions of TNF are not known. In the present study, postreceptor events associated with the autoinduction of TNF expression were examined in HL-60 cells. There was no detectable alteration in phospholipase C activity as measured by inositol phosphate generation or release of choline metabolites following TNF stimulation. However, TNF increased the release of arachidonic acid metabolites from HL-60 cells. This increase in arachidonic acid metabolism was associated with a 40% increase in phospholipase A2 activity. Furthermore, the release of arachidonic acid metabolites was blocked by inhibitors of phospholipase A2. Taken together, these findings indicated that TNF stimulates phospholipase A2 and arachidonic acid metabolism in HL-60 cells. The results also demonstrate that TNF expression is induced 15-30 min after stimulation with TNF and that this effect is associated with an increase in the rate of TNF transcription. This autoinduction of TNF mRNA was blocked by inhibitors of phospholipase A2. While the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no detectable effect, ketoconazole and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, inhibitors of lipoxygenase, also blocked the induction of TNF expression by TNF. These findings suggest that phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase activity are required for the transcriptional activation of TNF gene expression associated with TNF stimulation of HL-60 cells.","['Spriggs, D R', 'Sherman, M L', 'Imamura, K', 'Mohri, M', 'Rodriguez, C', 'Robbins, G', 'Kufe, D W']","['Spriggs DR', 'Sherman ML', 'Imamura K', 'Mohri M', 'Rodriguez C', 'Robbins G', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'PN0FRW1G4Z (4-bromophenacyl bromide)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Nov 15;50(22):7101-7.,"['CA-42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since both interferons act through different receptors on their hematopoietic target cells, they are expected to be capable of independently inhibiting abnormal blood cell development in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. We have utilized recombinant human interferon alfa-2c to treat 11 patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase, who were resistant to previous interferon gamma therapy. Ten of the patients were evaluable for hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular-genetic response following interferon alfa-2c therapy for 6 to 30 months. In 5 patients, IFN alfa-2c treatment failed due to lack of hematologic response. A complete hematologic or partial hematologic response was achieved in the remaining 5 patients. Three of these experienced cytogenetic improvement with reappearence of 100% diploid hematopoietic cells and disappearence of c-abl/bcr rearrangement in one patient. In two patients interferon alfa-2c did not prevent transformation of the disease into an accelerated state or blast crisis, respectively. We conclude that recombinant human interferon alfa-2c may also control hematopoiesis in interferon-gamma resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, although the long-term response will need to be elucidated in further studies.","['Herrmann, F', 'Jonas, D', 'Helfrich, S G', 'Lindemann, A', 'Schleiermacher, E', 'Mertelsmann, R']","['Herrmann F', 'Jonas D', 'Helfrich SG', 'Lindemann A', 'Schleiermacher E', 'Mertelsmann R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytogenetics', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Interferon-gamma/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01744136 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1990 Oct;61(4):226-31. doi: 10.1007/BF01744136.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most widely studied model systems has been the Friend murine erythroleukemia cell (F-MELC) line, which can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by a variety of chemical agents. Constitutive overexpression of either the c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes has been previously shown to inhibit F-MELC differentiation, whereas c-myc antisense sequences accelerate the process. To investigate the potential involvement of other proto-oncogenes and immediate early response genes in F-MELC differentiation, we studied the expression of the three known members of the jun family as well as another gene, egr-1, which, like the jun family members, is expressed as an immediate early response gene in growth factor-stimulated quiescent cells. All four genes were expressed in F-MELC, although the levels of expression and modes of regulation differed. Transfection with amplifiable c-jun, junB, or junD expression plasmids inhibited differentiation, whereas transfection with an egr-1 expression plasmid was without effect. These results indicate that jun family members play a role in mediating F-MELC differentiation. The known inhibitory effect of phorbol ester tumor promoters on F-MELC differentiation may be the result of their known stimulation of jun expression.","['Prochownik, E V', 'Smith, M J', 'Snyder, K', 'Emeagwali, D']","['Prochownik EV', 'Smith MJ', 'Snyder K', 'Emeagwali D']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83103-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Nov 1;76(9):1830-7.,,,,,,,,"['egr-1', 'jun']",,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the time patterns of 17p- and morphological characters of bone marrow cells in 14 myelodysplastic patients with clonal 17p- who have been reinvestigated within 3- to 6-month intervals for 15-56 (median 37) months. We found that the 17p- frequency increases significantly with time. Further, the deletion is positively correlated with bone marrow myeloblast frequencies and negatively with those of maturing granulocytes (myelocytes and later forms). These results suggest that 17p- interferes with and delays granulocyte maturation. Inactivation or deletion of genetic material in 17p in myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukaemia, and a wide variety of solid tumours further suggests that genes present on 17p may have a central position in malignant transformation of cells in a number of different tissues.","['Pedersen, B', 'Kerndrup, G']","['Pedersen B', 'Kerndrup G']","['Danish Cancer Society Department of Cytogenetics, Aarhus Amtssygehus.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*genetics/pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000205033 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1990;84(2):77-81. doi: 10.1159/000205033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immediate fixation with buffered formaldehyde at low temperature, or the addition of EDTA to buffered formaldehyde blocked the DNA degradation. Analysis of pulsed field gel electrophoresis also showed that DNA was degraded before extraction. These results suggest that tissue nuclease has an important role in DNA degradation in tissue. Furthermore, formaldehyde fixation at low temperature, which may take time and which decreases slightly the staining capacity, is useful for the extraction of intact DNA.

Blocking isoprenoid synthesis by incubation of MEL cells with lovastatin resulted in a decrease in the concentration of G25K in the particulate fraction and a corresponding increase in immunodetectable protein in the soluble fraction. Lovastatin treatment also produced shifts in the electrophoretic mobilities of the G25K isoforms on two-dimensional gels. These observations are consistent with the idea that isoprenylation plays a permissive role in the association of G25K with the cell membrane or other organelles. However, the high proportion of soluble isoprenylated G25K in MEL cells under normal culture conditions suggests that the role of the isoprenoid modification may be more complex than simply serving as a structural anchor for stable insertion of proteins into the lipid bilayer.","['Maltese, W A', 'Sheridan, K M']","['Maltese WA', 'Sheridan KM']","['Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania 17822.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Mevalonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/isolation & purification']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)38246-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Oct 15;265(29):17883-90.,['R01 CA 34569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the slowly progressing induction of H4biopterin synthesis during activation of resting T cells, it is completed during a 59-h period and is directed by a synergism of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Both GTP cyclohydrolase and (6R)-(1',2'-dioxopropyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin synthase activities are induced by IFN-gamma. They are further enhanced by combined treatment with IL-2, which per se is ineffective. Furthermore, the combined treatment synchronizes the time periods of both maximum activities, now extending from 33 to 44 h. This period correlates with high cellular H4biopterin levels. It is preceded by a fast and transient period of H4biopterin increase which depends on the synergistic action of both IFN-gamma and IL-2. It coincides with a transient increase in sepiapterin reductase activity. In contrast to MT-2 cells, HTLV-I-transformed HUT 102 cells constitutively secrete IFN-gamma and express IFN-gamma mRNA. The accumulation of H4biopterin is suppressed by anti-IFN-gamma polyclonal antibody and correlates with constitutive expression of all H4 biopterin-synthesizing enzymes.","['Ziegler, I', 'Schott, K', 'Lubbert, M', 'Herrmann, F', 'Schwulera, U', 'Bacher, A']","['Ziegler I', 'Schott K', 'Lubbert M', 'Herrmann F', 'Schwulera U', 'Bacher A']","['GSF-Institut fur Experimentelle Hamatologie, Munchen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)', 'EC 4.6.- (Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.6.10 (6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/biosynthesis', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'GTP Cyclohydrolase/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', '*Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism']",1990/10/05 00:00,1990/10/05 00:01,['1990/10/05 00:00'],"['1990/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)44863-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Oct 5;265(28):17026-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Susceptibility to NK lysis was not affected by the de novo expression of HLA antigens on the K562 after DNA mediated gene transfer.

There was neither stimulation or inhibition of the slgM+ CLL or the slgM- PCL cells. The inhibitory effect on the PLL cells was observed at an anti-mu concentration below the stimulatory threshold for normal B cells. Significant impairment of trypan blue exclusion was delayed until 48 hours, with morphological cellular changes suggestive of a programmed cell death mechanism or apoptosis. The cytotoxicity was independent of the slgM-staining intensity or the autonomous and BCGF-augmented DNA synthetic activity of the PLL cells and was similar in patients with de novo PLL or with prolymphocytic transformation of CLL. Cells from a PLL patient were separated by elutriation into two fractions, a BCGF-unresponsive large ""transformed"" cell fraction with marked autonomous DNA synthesis and a smaller lymphoid cell subset with low 3H-thymidine uptake that could be augmented by BCGF.

Here we report on the in vitro activity of okadaic acid in 3 assay systems: BALB/c 3T3 cell transformation, gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in various cell types, and inhibition of induction of differentiation of Friend virus-transformed murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. The activity of okadaic acid was compared to that of the phorbol ester tumor promoters TPA and phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PDD). In a test system involving a 2-week exposure of BALB/c 3T3 cells following 3-methylcholanthrene initiation, okadaic acid at a concentration of 10 ng/ml was equipotent to PDD as a promoter of cell transformation (4.9 and 3.7 foci/dish, respectively). Longer exposures to okadaic acid resulted in cytotoxicity. Okadaic acid-generated as well as PDD-generated transformed foci displayed a selective lack of GJIC between focus cells and surrounding normal cells, i.e., transformed cells communicate among themselves but not with surrounding cells. However, in contrast to TPA, there was no inhibition by okadaic acid, except at toxic doses, of homologous GJIC in BALB/c 3T3 cells or human and mouse keratinocytes. Furthermore, okadaic acid, unlike TPA, did not inhibit MEL cell differentiation. Together, these results indicate that okadaic acid acts as a promoter of cell transformation but that its mechanism of action is different from that of the phorbol ester tumor promoters.","['Katoh, F', 'Fitzgerald, D J', 'Giroldi, L', 'Fujiki, H', 'Sugimura, T', 'Yamasaki, H']","['Katoh F', 'Fitzgerald DJ', 'Giroldi L', 'Fujiki H', 'Sugimura T', 'Yamasaki H']","['Programme of Multistage Carcinogenesis, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Keratinocytes/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02614.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Jun-Jul;81(6-7):590-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02614.x.,['R01 CA 40534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6504065,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF potentiated the increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity produced by RA. The LIF effect was time and dose dependent (EC50, approximately 1 pM). The earliest effects on AP activity were detected at 48 h, and maximal effects were observed after 72 h. RA increased AP mRNA about 2-fold at 3 h and 6-fold at 6 and 12 h.

When given alone, LIF had no effect on either AP activity or mRNA levels. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 also potentiated the RA induction of AP, and interleukin-6 had a small effect, whereas granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor had no effect.

These results demonstrate that site-specific gene expression can be achieved by direct gene transfer in vivo and could be applied to the treatment of such human diseases as atherosclerosis or cancer.","['Nabel, E G', 'Plautz, G', 'Nabel, G J']","['Nabel EG', 'Plautz G', 'Nabel GJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '4C905MSK4W (Hexadimethrine Bromide)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Arteries/*metabolism', 'Catheterization, Peripheral', '*Gene Expression', 'Hexadimethrine Bromide', 'Liposomes', 'Methods', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Swine', '*Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis/genetics']",1990/09/14 00:00,1990/09/14 00:01,['1990/09/14 00:00'],"['1990/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2119055 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1990 Sep 14;249(4974):1285-8. doi: 10.1126/science.2119055.,"['AI 29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 42706/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-13457/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug sensitivity was expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). The degree of reversal of resistance was expressed as x-fold decrease by dividing the IC50 value without modifier(s) by that with modifier(s). CyA overcame P-gp-associated MDR significantly in all four MDR cell lines. Reversal of VCR resistance by CyA appeared to be dose-dependent. In the case of low-grade MDR cell lines (KYO-1, HEL and CMK), CyA at the low concentration of 0.5 microgram/ml was still effective. The degree of reversal of VCR resistance in this condition was greater (6.3- to 16-fold decrease) in the low-grade MDR cell lines than in a high-grade MDR cell line (K562/ADM) (2.9-fold decrease). At a high concentration (5 micrograms/ml) of CyA, however, it was greater (240-fold decrease) in the high-grade MDR cell lines than in the low-grade MDR cell line (20- to 100-fold decrease). This indicates that concentration of CyA required for overcoming drug resistance in MDR cells was dependent on the degree of drug resistance. CyA overcame VCR resistance more efficiently than VER. The combination of CyA and VER enhanced reversal of VCR resistance in a supra-additive or at least an additive manner and overcame VCR resistance at low concentrations of both modifiers that are clinically achievable with safety.","['Ishida, Y', 'Shimada, Y', 'Shimoyama, M']","['Ishida Y', 'Shimada Y', 'Shimoyama M']","['Hematology-Oncology and Clinical Cancer Chemotherapy Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02653.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Aug;81(8):834-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02653.x.,,,,PMC5918095,,,,,,,,,,,

GM colony formation of bone marrow cells by colony-stimulating factor (CSF) was normal in CMML and MPD patients, but was decreased in MDS patients. Circulating granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) were detected in CMML and MPD patients, but not in MDS patients. GM colony formation without CSF was observed in CMML patients, but not in MDS or MPD patients. These endogenous colonies decreased markedly after adherent cell (AdC) depletion, but AdC did not form endogenous colonies in sufficient numbers to explain their marked decrease after AdC depletion. In CMML patients, the numbers of circulating CFU-GM and endogenous colonies correlated with leukocyte and monocyte counts, respectively. The cellular composition of GM colonies was normal in MDS and MPD patients, whereas granulocytic colonies predominated in all CMML patients but one. The CSF-producing capacity of peripheral blood cells was also studied and was found to be increased in CMML patients. This capacity was markedly decreased by AdC depletion; and AdC could produce CSF only in CMML patients. CSF produced by CMML patients supported granulocytic colonies to a greater extent than CSF produced by MDS or MPD patients. These results suggest that enhanced granulopoiesis in CMML patients is closely associated with the possible hyperproduction of granulocytic CSF by their adherent monocytes.","['Yuo, A', 'Miyazono, K', 'Urabe, A', 'Takaku, F']","['Yuo A', 'Miyazono K', 'Urabe A', 'Takaku F']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,,IM,"['*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*pathology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02651.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Aug;81(8):820-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02651.x.,,,,PMC5918077,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the B-cell lineage we found that the expression of B-ly-7 was highly specific for HCL and reacted with all 28 cases examined, as well as with 3 of 9 cases of a variant form of HCL. Cells of other closely related B-cell disorders, prolymphocytic leukemia, and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes were negative. Investigation of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with HCL before and after treatment with alpha-interferon or deoxycoformycin suggests that B-ly-7 may be useful in the assessment of minimal disease after therapy. In addition to HCL, we found that B-ly-7 was positive with cells of three mature, CD4+ T-cell malignancies. In view of the reactivity with malignancies of activated B and T cells, we searched for the expression of B-ly-7 on activated, normal B and T cells and found that B-ly-7 reacted specifically with activated normal peripheral blood CD8+ T cells. B-ly-7 has a number of applications, including the precise classification of mature B-cell neoplasia and the diagnosis HCL and its assessment after treatment. In addition, B-ly-7 recognizes a small subset of T-cell disorders. Its expression on these malignancies and on in vitro activated peripheral blood CD8+ T cells suggests that B-ly-7 detects a lymphocyte activation antigen.","['Mulligan, S P', 'Travade, P', 'Matutes, E', 'Dearden, C', 'Visser, L', 'Poppema, S', 'Catovsky, D']","['Mulligan SP', 'Travade P', 'Matutes E', 'Dearden C', 'Visser L', 'Poppema S', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74496-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Sep 1;76(5):959-64.,,,,,['Blood. 1991 Apr 15;77(8):1854-5.

The induction of HTLV-I specific antigens on the surface of normal PBL cultured with HTLV-I in vitro was inhibited by the addition of rIFNs in a dose dependent manner. The rIFNs also had dose dependent suppressive effects on the proliferation of ATL cells and one of the ATL cell lines (MT-2). These suppressive effects of rIFNs were not due to a direct cytocidal activity, because rIFNs did not affect the viability of ATL cells at these concentrations.

Similarly, tritiated thymidine uptake into total AML populations was not affected by LIF, but the percentage of clonogenic cells killed by exposure to high specific activity 3HTdR was reduced in LIF-treated cultures compared to controls.

This system has been used to evaluate the immunotherapeutic activity of macrophages, specifically reactive T-cells (CTL/RFB), lymphokine-activated killer cells and interleukin 2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon-gamma. In the present studies, CTL/RFB were evaluated for their ability to prevent disease recurrence. Animals with the regressing strain of Friend virus at Day 39 post virus were treated with either one or two injections of 5 x 10(6) CTL/RFB. Animals given one or two injections of CTL/RFB had a significantly lower rate of recurrence than did untreated animals. The helper T-cell component of CTL/RFB was implicated in causing leukemia regression. Interleukin 1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha, multifunctional cytokines with similar biological activities, were evaluated for their ability to suppress leukemic erythroid colony-forming cells and induce regression. Interleukin 1 alpha suppressed the conventional strain of, but not the polycythemia-inducing strain of, Friend virus-leukemic late erythroid colony-forming units and caused only a temporary regression of disease, while tumor necrosis factor alpha suppressed both forms of the disease and with multiple inoculations could cause permanent disease regressions.

The enhancer consists of tandem AP-1-binding sites, phased 10 bp apart, which are both required for full activity.

This cis-regulatory sequence is located within the retroviral 3' long terminal repeat and coincides with a predicted, highly stable RNA stem-loop structure. Rex action requires both the overall secondary structure intrinsic to the RexRE and specific sequences from one small subregion of this large structure. This small subregion likely forms a protein-binding site for Rex or a cellular RNA-binding factor. Whereas Rex can functionally replace the Rev protein of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) through its interaction with the analogous Rev response element (RevRE), distinct subregions of this HIV-1 RNA element mediate the responses to Rex and Rev. Strikingly, Rex acts as a dominant repressor of Rev action, following the deletion of the Rex responsive subregion of the RevRE. Similarly, Rev inhibits Rex function in a dominant manner when the Rev responsive subregion of the RevRE is deleted. Together, these findings suggest that Rex and Rev not only interact with their respective RNA response elements but also may either form mixed inactive multimers or interact with a common cellular factor(s).

To better understand this process, we have used several approaches to identify which G proteins are present in platelets, normal human megakaryocytes, and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a leukemic cell line with megakaryocytic features. Because platelet and HEL cell responses to thrombin are inhibited by pertussis toxin, we have focused upon the members of the Gi family, whose alpha subunits can be ADP-ribosylated by that toxin. Western blots with antisera specific for Gi alpha demonstrated the presence in both platelets and HEL cells of the three best-described forms of this protein: Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, and Gi alpha 3. Based upon immunoprecipitation studies with [35S]-methionine-labeled HEL cells, their relative abundance appears to be Gi alpha 2 much greater than Gi alpha 3 greater than Gi alpha 1. A HEL cell cDNA library screened with the Gi alpha antisera produced clones encoding Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 that had sequences similar to those reported from other sources. Gi alpha-specific probes created from these cDNA clones confirmed the presence of mRNA encoding Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 in both platelets (by Northern blotting) and megakaryocytes (by in situ hybridization). Thus the pertussis toxin substrates that have previously been detected in platelets and HEL cells are shown to be members of the Gi alpha family, all of which are candidates for interaction with receptors for thrombin and other agonists.","['Williams, A G', 'Woolkalis, M J', 'Poncz, M', 'Manning, D R', 'Gewirtz, A M', 'Brass, L F']","['Williams AG', 'Woolkalis MJ', 'Poncz M', 'Manning DR', 'Gewirtz AM', 'Brass LF']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['*Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'DNA/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/metabolism/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82447-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Aug 15;76(4):721-30.,"['CA36894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that survivors of ALL commonly have reduced bone density in the lumbar spine and suggest that the diminution is related to nervous system irradiation, not to the disease or to chemotherapy.","['Gilsanz, V', 'Carlson, M E', 'Roe, T F', 'Ortega, J A']","['Gilsanz V', 'Carlson ME', 'Roe TF', 'Ortega JA']","['Department of Radiology, University of Southern California, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles 90054-0700.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Bone Density', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Osteoporosis/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography', 'Radiotherapy, High-Energy/*adverse effects']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)80536-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80536-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1990 Aug;117(2 Pt 1):238-44. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80536-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of growing PBL with phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) or calcium ionophore (A23187) for 1 h caused phosphorylation of prosolin with the production of up to four prominent phosphorylated forms differing in degree of phosphorylation and/or two-dimensional electrophoretic mobility (peptides B to E). Formation of these phosphopeptides coincided with rapid down-regulation of DNA synthesis. A23187 was particularly effective in inducing phosphorylation of the more highly phosphorylated peptides D and E, suggesting the existence of a (Ca2+)-activated mechanism in their phosphorylation. The T cell leukemia cell lines Jurkat, HuT-78, CCRF-CEM, and Molt-4 showed reduced to absent ability to phosphorylate prosolin peptides rapidly in response to A23187 and also showed diminished down-regulation of DNA synthesis. In leukemic cells treated with both TPA and A23187, peptides B and C were rapidly phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation of peptides D and E seen in normal PBL remained deficient. The T cell leukemic cells appear to have intact a TPA-activated mechanism for phosphorylating prosolin peptides B and C, but share an impairment of a specific Ca2(+)-activated mechanism, possibly a Ca2(+)-dependent protein kinase, required for phosphorylation of prosolin phosphopeptides D and E. The degree of rapid down-regulation of DNA synthesis was correlated with degree of phosphorylation of peptide E in PBL and in three of four T cell leukemic cell lines. Thus, rapid phosphorylation of prosolin may mediate responses to TPA and A23187 in normal proliferating PBL, including down-regulation of DNA synthesis. A deficiency of this pathway in leukemic T cells may impede their response to physiologic growth regulatory signals utilizing this pathway and contribute to unrestrained cell growth.","['Cooper, H L', 'Fuldner, R', 'McDuffie, E', 'Braverman, R']","['Cooper HL', 'Fuldner R', 'McDuffie E', 'Braverman R']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Aug 15;145(4):1205-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report it is shown that early events following virus-induced suppression of the cell-mediated immune response of freshly isolated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBL) infected with HTLV-I can be partially counteracted by treatment with interferons alpha, beta or gamma (IFN). All three types of IFN exerted a protective effect on CBL cultures exposed to the virus. This resulted in: (a) a reduced number of virus-positive cells until 4 weeks of culture; (b) delay in the clonal expansion of infected cells (IFN alpha and gamma); (c) increased natural killer cell activity of CBL, 1 week post-infection (p.i.), mediated by IFN gamma; (d) increase of allospecific recognition of infecting and priming HTLV-I donor MT-2 cells by CBL in a cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-like response, mediated by IFN and particularly by IFN gamma; (e) phenotype distribution of CBL subpopulations, tested 4 days p.i., more similar to that of non-infected CBL cultures. In contrast, the overall CBL proliferation, that is profoundly depressed during the first week p.i., was not restored by IFN treatments, suggesting that boosting of the cell-mediated killing induced by IFN might involve the maturation of undifferentiated precursor cells rather than stimulation of their proliferation. The improvement of the efficiency of the antiviral immune response induced by treatment with IFN is likely to contribute to the clearance of virus-positive cells during the early phase of infection. This would provide experimental evidence to support an immunopharmacological approach contributing to the conversion of HTLV-I carriers from positive to negative.","[""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Pesce, C D', 'Fontana, T', 'Ciprani, F', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Calio, R']","[""D'Onofrio C"", 'Pesce CD', 'Fontana T', 'Ciprani F', 'Bonmassar E', 'Calio R']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, II University of Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/*microbiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects/physiology', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01789171 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1990;31(4):213-20. doi: 10.1007/BF01789171.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant deficits in verbal memory (p less than 0.025) and verbal learning (p less than 0.05) were observed that were associated with the presence and type of CT brain scan abnormalities; the greatest impairments were observed in patients with calcifications. No significant differences between CT scan groups were found for nonverbal memory and learning. Previous evaluation of attentional processing in these patients using reaction time tests had revealed the presence of deficits primarily in the ability to sustain attention.

Cytogenetic and molecular changes after interferon alfa therapy are apparent in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, as manifested by change in the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL gene, respectively. The exact role of interferon in prolonging the life of chronic myeloid leukemia patients, however, remains to be determined in larger studies of longer duration. Interferon treatment seems to be well tolerated, and the frequency of treatment-limiting toxicity is low.

The human gene is highly homologous to the murine gene and shows 91% and 94% homology in nucleotide or amino acid sequence respectively.

In these studies HL-60 cells were cultured over 30 passages in fatty acid-free medium to deplete them of arachidonic acid. Even though the phospholipid classes from these cells contained no arachidonate, they could still be differentiated into granulocytes by dimethyl sulfoxide (1.25%). When the differentiated HL-60 cells, depleted of arachidonic acid, were stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of Ca2+ and [3H]acetate, only minimal amounts of [3H]PAF were produced. In contrast, if the differentiated HL-60 cells were supplemented with 10 microM arachidonic acid for 24 h and then stimulated with the ionophore, there was a large amount of [3H]PAF formed. The increase in PAF synthesis depended on the length of time the cells were supplemented with arachidonic acid; only a small increase in PAF synthesis occurred during the early hours of supplementation whereas stimulation of PAF synthesis was maximal (3-5-fold) after a 24-h period of the 20:4 supplementation. Other polyenoic fatty acid supplements (20:5, 22:4, and 22:6 for 24 h) also stimulated PAF production in the ionophore-treated HL-60 cells depleted of 20:4, but the amount of PAF was significantly less than found for the supplements of 20:4 under identical experimental conditions. Also noteworthy is that undifferentiated cells supplemented with 20:4 or their unsupplemented controls could not be stimulated by the calcium ionophore to produce PAF. Addition of indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), A63162 (5'-lipoxygenase inhibitor), or eicosatetraynoic acid (cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor) to the incubations caused little change in the production of [3H]PAF in the differentiated cells supplemented with 20:4 for 24 h. On the other hand, the addition of mepacrine, bromophenacyl bromide, or U26384 (phospholipase A2 inhibitors) resulted in very large decreases (80-90% lower than controls) in the amount of [3H]PAF produced under the same conditions. Analysis of the molecular species of [3H]alkylacyl-GroPCho (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, the precursor of PAF in the remodeling pathway) in 20:4-supplemented cells prelabeled with [3H]alkyl-lyso-GroPCho revealed that only the alkylarachidonoyl-GroPCho species were preferentially decreased after stimulation with the A23187 ionophore. These results demonstrate that arachidonate must be at the sn-2 position of alkylacyl-GroPCho in order for it to serve as a precursor of PAF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Suga, K', 'Kawasaki, T', 'Blank, M L', 'Snyder, F']","['Suga K', 'Kawasaki T', 'Blank ML', 'Snyder F']","['Medical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Tennessee 37831-0117.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/25 00:00,1990/07/25 00:01,['1990/07/25 00:00'],"['1990/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)38355-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jul 25;265(21):12363-71.,['27109-08/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serological studies indicated that the Mabs were probably not directed against an antigenic determinant of Rh polypeptides, the LWab glycoprotein or glycophorin B, all structures absent from or aberrantly expressed on Rhnull red cells. The antigen was found to be erythrocyte-specific, and was also present on pro-erythroblasts, erythroblasts and malignant erythroblastoid cells but not on erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. The Mabs were found to block each other in an immune rosette method and are thus probably directed against the same epitope or against neighbouring epitopes on the same structure. In immunochemical studies, MB-2D10 precipitated the 30-32 kDa Rh polypeptides from red cell membranes and a protein or proteins which formed diffuse and overlapping bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with Mrs of 40-200 kDa (probably the Rh-related glycoproteins). Under certain experimental conditions glycophorin B appeared to be coprecipitated.

The lymphocyte count at rest was within normal limits (2.2 x 10(9)/l), then fell to the resting level within 15 min of cessation of exercise. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed the morphology of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) by light and electron microscopy both at rest (30%) and to a much greater extent during exercise (70%). Immunophenotyping of these lymphocytes during exercise demonstrated that the predominant cell was CD3+, CD8+, CD57+ (Leu7)/CD4-, CD16-, CD25-. In the resting state, despite a total lymphocyte count within the normal range, surface marker studies indicated an excess of cells with the CD8+/CD57 + T cell phenotype (26%; cf. normal range less than or equal to 10%). Functional assays revealed a minimal increase in natural killer (NK) activity during exercise. T cell receptor beta chain gene rearrangement was demonstrable in the peripheral blood at rest and during exercise. Although severe neutropenia was present, the growth of normal colony forming units, granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) was not inhibited by patient lymphocytes and no anti-neutrophil antibodies were demonstrated.

At our institution, 122 patients with pure seminoma were treated by orchidectomy followed by radiation therapy from 1951 to 1986. Six were lost to follow-up. For the 116 remaining patients, the overall 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year survival probability was 95%, 90%, 87%, and 84%, respectively. Eleven patients developed 12 second cancers, with a cumulative risk of 7%, 16%, and 16% at 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively.

Most of these polypeptides were continuously synthesized and associated with mu chains in virgin B cells lines, although some of them scarcely bound to the mu kappa dimer or mu 2 kappa 2 tetramer concomitantly present in the same clone or population. However, in mature B cells they were no longer detectable except B34. Cross-linking of micron chains on the surface of pre-B cells resulted in an increase in intracellular free Ca2+, indicating that the micron chain complex on the surface of pre-B cell lines acted as a signal transduction molecule. However, the receptor cross-linkage of pre-B cell lines did not induce the increased inositol phospholipid metabolism usually observed in virgin and mature B cell lines. These results suggest that, during the differentiation from pre-B to mature B cells, the cells express two types of mu chain complexes which exhibit different structures as a whole and possess different signal transducing capacities.","['Takemori, T', 'Mizuguchi, J', 'Miyazoe, I', 'Nakanishi, M', 'Shigemoto, K', 'Kimoto, H', 'Shirasawa, T', 'Maruyama, N', 'Taniguchi, M']","['Takemori T', 'Mizuguchi J', 'Miyazoe I', 'Nakanishi M', 'Shigemoto K', 'Kimoto H', 'Shirasawa T', 'Maruyama N', 'Taniguchi M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/immunology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Aug;9(8):2493-500.,,,,PMC552278,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence is presented that TNF may be constitutively produced by B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells and that it may play a relevant role in these diseases. These conclusions are based on the presence of circulating levels of TNF in the serum of 20 of the 24 patients tested (83.3%), while undetectable values were found in normal sera. The suggestion that the increased serum levels were due to the leukemic cell population is strengthened by the evidence that purified B-CLL and HCL cells may constitutively release variable degrees of TNF. These levels markedly increase after incubation with interferon gamma or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) plus phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The cellular release of TNF by primary B-CLL cells was significantly (P less than .001) higher in B-CLL stage O-I patients compared with stage II-III patients. The demonstration that, in B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, the pathologic cells may release TNF was further confirmed by the presence of the mRNA for this cytokine in primary and/or in pre-activated cells. Recombinant TNF was capable of inducing a proliferative signal only in a minority of cases (4/24); in most cases it was ineffective, and, in a few, it reduced the degree of proliferation. Furthermore, in costimulatory experiments with interleukin-2 and PHA plus PMA, TNF was ineffective. On the other hand, when primary B-CLL cells were incubated in the presence of an anti-TNF antibody, in 8 of 12 independent experiments a 2- to 15-fold increase in thymidine uptake was documented. Taken together, these results suggest that TNF may play a regulatory role in the progression of the neoplastic clone in B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and may be implicated in some of the side effects associated with these diseases.","['Foa, R', 'Massaia, M', 'Cardona, S', 'Tos, A G', 'Bianchi, A', 'Attisano, C', 'Guarini, A', 'di Celle, P F', 'Fierro, M T']","['Foa R', 'Massaia M', 'Cardona S', 'Tos AG', 'Bianchi A', 'Attisano C', 'Guarini A', 'di Celle PF', 'Fierro MT']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology']",1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82487-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jul 15;76(2):393-400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This type of rearrangement effectively excludes functional kappa expression from that allele. A truncated mRNA product resulting from the V kappa signal exon splicing to the C kappa exon is diagnostic of these unique rearrangements.

In contrast, ethanolamine produced a dose-dependent reduction in this slow rate of 14C accumulation. The reduction in the slow rate of 14C accumulation produced by ethanolamine was due almost entirely to a decrease in the accumulation of nonexchangeable 14C. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of 14C accumulation produced by 25, 100, and 250 microM ethanolamine was compatible with competitive inhibition. Thin layer chromatography of cell extracts showed that the ability of ethanolamine to reduce 14C accumulation by L1210 cells incubated with [14C]thiotepa was due solely to reduction in production of [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine. These results are all compatible with and predicted by our previously described scheme wherein thiotepa enters cells by simple diffusion and serves as a prodrug for aziridine, some of which is hydrolyzed to ethanolamine which is then incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine via normal metabolic synthetic pathways.","['Egorin, M J', 'Snyder, S W', 'Wietharn, B E']","['Egorin MJ', 'Snyder SW', 'Wietharn BE']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Ethanolamines)', '5KV86114PT (Ethanolamine)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Choline/*pharmacology', 'Ethanolamine', 'Ethanolamines/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Thiotepa/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 15;50(14):4322-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At high doses (2 micrograms, three times daily) LIF exhibited toxic effects seen as behavioral changes, loss of body fat, and thymus atrophy. Dose-related rises were observed in blood platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and serum calcium to albumin ratios, including dose schedules with no toxic effects. LIF induced a decrease in bone marrow cell numbers, particularly in marrow lymphocytes, and a moderate increase in spleen weight with a reduction in spleen lymphocytes and an elevation of erythroid populations. LIF-injected mice showed a rise in megakaryocytes up to twofold in the marrow and fivefold in the spleen, with an associated 10-fold rise in megakaryocyte progenitor cells in the spleen. Comparable rises in other types of progenitor cells were also observed in the spleen. The observed changes indicate the biologic activity of LIF in vivo and are consistent with the known wide range of in vitro actions of this molecule.

The purpose of this study was to define the pathologic basis for macroglobulinemia in patients whose routine bone marrow biopsies were not diagnostic of a lymphoplasmacytic neoplasm. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry of cell suspensions prepared from aspirated marrow, as well as immunohistochemistry of core biopsies, to perform immunopathologic evaluations of the bone marrow from 16 such patients. Seven individuals without a monoclonal serum paraprotein, who were similarly studied, served as controls. Our data indicate that 13 of the 16 patients with monoclonal serum IgM paraproteins whose routine bone marrow biopsies were normal or showed nondiagnostic changes morphologically had a dispersed monotypic B lineage population of concordant immunoglobulin heavy and light chain type in the bone marrow. The immunophenotype of these cells spanned the range from mature B cell to plasmacytoid B cell to plasma cell.

The inhibition of the DNA synthesis by saturating concentration of transforming growth factor beta was further enhanced by the addition of LIF, suggesting independent pathways for the action of the two growth inhibitors.

The results demonstrate that ELISA and Western blot assay have limitations for HTLV-I antibody detection in an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) nonendemic population. This conclusion is based on the many false reactives obtained by ELISA, and weak and indeterminate reaction (mostly p19 band) on Western blotting. All moderate to strongly HTLV-I ELISA-positive samples tested were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. Although 6/27 mycosis fungoides (MF) patients tested gave mostly a weak reaction on HTLV-I ELISA, 3/6 MF patients gave multiple bands (p19, p31, p36, gp46) on Western blotting and three samples from one patient gave the same p31, p36, and gp46 bands. This may suggest involvement of some HTLV-I-related virus in MF. These results also indicate that prevalence of HTLV-I infection in leukemia/lymphoma patients was rare, if it exists at all, since, despite the reactivity of some sera with HTLV-I-suspected antigens, none of the samples satisfy the USPHS criteria for positivity which is based on the detection of antibodies to gag protein p24 and to an env gene product gp46 or gp61/68.","['Srivastava, B I', 'Gonzales, C', 'Loftus, R', 'Fitzpatrick, J E', 'Saxinger, C W']","['Srivastava BI', 'Gonzales C', 'Loftus R', 'Fitzpatrick JE', 'Saxinger CW']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Products, gag/immunology', 'HIV/immunology', 'HIV Antibodies/immunology', 'HIV Antigens/analysis', 'HIV Core Protein p24', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prevalence', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Viral Core Proteins/immunology']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1990.6.617 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1990 May;6(5):617-27. doi: 10.1089/aid.1990.6.617.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This proviral integration always results in the expression of two mRNA transcripts, 5.7 kb and 4.7 kb long. We isolated two classes of cDNAs from a myeloblastic cell line with a F-MuLV provirus integrated in Fim-3. By sequence analysis, we found that one Evi-1 cDNA (E29) had an internal deletion of 972 nucleotides when compared to the full-length sequence previously published by Morishita et al. (1988). This deletion eliminated the 6th and 7th Evi-1 finger domains and was bordered by consensus donor and acceptor splice sequences. The E29 clone most likely resulted from alternative splicing of the Evi-1 gene. This was confirmed by Northern blot analysis and S1 mapping experiments.

In quiescent cells c-jun mRNA expression was undetectable or at low levels. Upon treatment with TPA or Bryo, the steady-state levels of c-jun mRNA increased rapidly, reached a maximum at 0.5 or 1 hr, and then decreased in the B-CLL cells from all five patients analyzed; this reaction was augmented by the addition of A23187. Induction of c-jun mRNA by direct stimulation of PKC could be blocked by the PKC inhibitor H7.

A very rapid initial phase is followed by a much slower second phase that reflects accumulation of radioactivity in a form that is not lost or exchanged when cells are resuspended and incubated in drug-free medium for up to 8 h. In this study we attempted to characterize this nonexchangeable radioactivity. Nuclei (10(7)) isolated from L1210 cells and incubated with [14C]thiotepa did not accumulate 14C during incubations of up to 5 h. Similarly, nuclei isolated from 10(7) L1210 cells that had been shown to accumulate nonexchangeable 14C after incubation with [14C]thiotepa did not show an increase in nuclear-associated 14C. Eighty to 85% of nonexchangeable 14C in L1210 cells incubated with [14C]thiotepa was soluble in ethanol or chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), and although most of this cell-associated nonexchangeable 14C was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, subsequent treatment of that precipitate with methanol solubilized most of the 14C so that only 15 to 20% remained with the final precipitate. When chloroform:methanol-soluble nonexchangeable 14C was analyzed with thin-layer chromatography systems suitable for thiotepa or simple lipids, all radioactivity remained at the origin. In contrast, when analyzed with one- and two-dimensional thin-layer chromatographic systems suitable for complex lipids, all chloroform:methanol-soluble radioactivity was associated with a single lipid spot. This lipid cochromatographed with phosphatidylethanolamine, reacted with ninhydrin but not with 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine or the Dragendorff choline reagent, and was digested by phospholipases C and D, all of which lead to its identification as phosphatidylethanolamine. This extensive labeling of phosphatidylethanolamine in L1210 cells incubated with [14C]thiotepa can be explained by liberation of [14C]aziridine from [14C]thiotepa, hydrolysis of the [14C]aziridine to [14C]ethanolamine, and incorporation of that radiolabeled material into phosphatidylethanolamine via the normal cellular synthetic pathways for that lipid. This information implies that thiotepa serves, at least in part, as a prodrug for aziridine and has implications as to the mechanism of thiotepa-induced cytotoxicity in that aziridine is a monofunctional alkylating agent incapable of producing interstrand, intrastrand, or protein-DNA cross-links.","['Egorin, M J', 'Snyder, S W']","['Egorin MJ', 'Snyder SW']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes/analysis', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*metabolism', 'Thiotepa/*pharmacokinetics', 'Time Factors']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):4044-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity of daunorubicin may be partially due to the formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, and superoxide anion radical). Protection against free radicals and peroxides is largely dependent upon the availability of reduced glutathione, which in turn requires NADPH for its continual regeneration. Pentose phosphate cycle (also called hexose monophosphate shunt) is known to provide NADPH for maintenance of glutathione. Activities of the two NADPH-producing dehydrogenases of the cycle, glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, were 40% higher (P less than 0.05) and activity of the cycle in intact cells was 2-fold higher in the resistant than the sensitive cells. The cycle was as active in these cells as it is known to be in macrophages, indicating a very effective protection against oxidative stress, free radicals, and alkylating electrophiles. Elevated activity of the pentose phosphate pathway in drug-resistant cells can represent a mechanism of resistance against multiple structurally unrelated drugs. Efflux of daunorubicin may be aided by further metabolism to glucuronides. Daunorubicinol, a known active metabolite of daunorubicin, can be metabolized to a glucuronide by the cells and eliminated into the surrounding medium. Glucuronidation of daunorubicinol was evidenced by (a) release of daunorubicinol following glucuronidase hydrolysis of media from cell incubations with 1.8 microM daunorubicin and (b) production of radioactive glucuronide when cell homogenates were incubated with UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid plus daunorubicinol. Glucuronyltransferase activity with a broad substrate specificity was found in the cells. Using model substrates, 1-naphthol and o-aminophenol, it was determined that glucuronyltransferase activity was 4 times higher in daunorubicin-resistant than -sensitive P388 cells. Elevated glucuronyltransferase could contribute to daunorubicin and multidrug resistance.","['Gessner, T', 'Vaughan, L A', 'Beehler, B C', 'Bartels, C J', 'Baker, R M']","['Gessner T', 'Vaughan LA', 'Beehler BC', 'Bartels CJ', 'Baker RM']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Carmustine/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', '*Pentose Phosphate Pathway']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):3921-7.,"['CA21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SO7-RR05648-22/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence supporting a clonal origin of CNL is considered and the nature of the relationship between the chronic myeloid expansion and the development of multiple myeloma is discussed.","['Standen, G R', 'Jasani, B', 'Wagstaff, M', 'Wardrop, C A']","['Standen GR', 'Jasani B', 'Wagstaff M', 'Wardrop CA']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/complications/*immunology/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*immunology/metabolism', 'Paraproteinemias/complications']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19900701)66:1<162::aid-cncr2820660129>3.0.co;2-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Jul 1;66(1):162-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900701)66:1<162::aid-cncr2820660129>3.0.co;2-z.,,,31,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CLL had mu lambda surface immunoglobulin (sIg) whereas the DLC had mu kappa sIg. However, the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement and surface marker analysis demonstrated that both CLL and DLC had identical rearrangement patterns of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) and identical surface markers CD5+, CD19+, and CD20+. These facts imply that in this case the two malignancies are of single clonal origin initially, and that different sIg of CLL and DLC do not, therefore, necessarily indicate the biclonality of these malignancies. The origin of DLC in Richter's syndrome remains controversial. This case suggests difficulty in concluding the biclonality of these malignancies. For a conclusion on clonality to be definitive, there is a need for cloning and nucleotide sequencing of rearranged Ig genes in more patients with Richter's syndrome.","['Miyamura, K', 'Osada, H', 'Yamauchi, T', 'Itoh, M', 'Kodera, Y', 'Suchi, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Ueda, R']","['Miyamura K', 'Osada H', 'Yamauchi T', 'Itoh M', 'Kodera Y', 'Suchi T', 'Takahashi T', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*immunology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Syndrome']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19900701)66:1<140::aid-cncr2820660125>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Jul 1;66(1):140-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900701)66:1<140::aid-cncr2820660125>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The photolabeled protein migrates on SDS-PAGE gels as a broad band with a mean apparent molecular weight (75,000 +/- 3000) significantly higher than that reported for the nucleoside transporter in human erythrocytes (55,000) (Young et al. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2202-2208). However, after treatment with endoglycosidase F to remove carbohydrate, the NBMPR-binding protein in CEM cells migrates as a sharp peak with an apparent molecular weight (47,000 +/- 3000) identical to that reported for the deglycosylated protein in human erythrocytes (Kwong et al. (1986) Biochem. J. 240, 349-356). It therefore appears that the difference in the apparent molecular weight of the NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter between the CEM cell line and human erythrocytes is a result of differences in glycosylation. The NBMPR-binding protein from CEM cells has been solubilized with 1% octyl glucoside and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles by a freeze-thaw sonication technique. Optimal reconstitution of uridine transport activity was achieved using a sonication interval of 5 to 10 s and lipid to protein ratios of 60:1 or greater. Under these conditions transport activity in the reconstituted vesicles was proportional to the protein concentration and was inhibited by NBMPR. Omission of lipid or protein, or substitution of a protein extract prepared from a nucleoside transport deficient mutant of the CEM cell line resulted in vesicles with no uridine transport activity. The initial rate of uridine transport, in the vesicles prepared with CEM protein, was saturable with a Km of 103 +/- 11 microM and was inhibited by adenosine, thymidine and cytidine. The Km for uridine and the potency of the other nucleosides as inhibitors of uridine transport (adenosine greater than thymidine greater than cytidine) were similar to intact cells. Thus, although the nucleoside transporter of CEM cells has a higher molecular weight than the human erythrocyte transporter, it exhibits typical NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transport activity both in the intact cell and when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles.","['Crawford, C R', 'Ng, C Y', 'Ullman, B', 'Belt, J A']","['Crawford CR', 'Ng CY', 'Ullman B', 'Belt JA']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Biological Transport', 'Blood Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Carrier Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Membrane Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1990/05/24 00:00,1990/05/24 00:01,['1990/05/24 00:00'],"['1990/05/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/24 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(90)90357-T [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(90)90357-t [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 May 24;1024(2):289-97. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(90)90357-t.,"['CA09346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK38809/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LEC11 cells (a mutant of the CHO cell line, Pro -5), which are known to express a complex array of carbohydrate structures, were used to develop the assay for use with whole cell extracts. A detergent-solubilized preparation of the enzyme from whole cells was used to convert the substrate, lactotriglycosylceramide, to the product, neolactotetraglycosylceramide. The monoclonal antibody, 1B2, which specifically binds to the Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc epitope, was used in an ELISA to identify and quantify the product. The enzyme activity in the preparations was found to be similar to that obtained by conventional radioactive assay methods. The beta-galactosyltransferase found in LEC11 cell detergent extracts exhibited an absolute requirement for the nucleotide sugar and MnCl2. The activity of the enzyme was also strictly dependent on the presence of exogenous glycolipid acceptor. When Triton X-114 was used to solubilize the LEC11 beta-galactosyltransferase, activity was found in both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic phases, suggesting the presence of two forms of the enzyme. The ELISA-based assay was used to compare beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase activity in detergent extracts of four CHO cell lines: Pro-5, Lec1, LEC11, and LEC12 and in detergent-solubilized microsomes from human leukemia cells. The results from this study demonstrate the utility of the ELISA-based assay for measuring glycosyltransferase activity in detergent-solubilized whole cells and microsome preparations.","['Stults, C L', 'Macher, B A']","['Stults CL', 'Macher BA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, San Francisco State University, California 94132.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', 'EC 2.4.1.22 (Lactose Synthase)', 'EC 2.4.1.90 (N-Acetyllactosamine Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gangliosides/analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactose Synthase/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'N-Acetyllactosamine Synthase/*analysis/metabolism']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(90)90512-W [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(90)90512-w [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1990 Jul;280(1):20-6. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(90)90512-w.,"['CA 32826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 40205/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed a significantly higher CFU-GM cloning inhibition after addition of 100 or 1,000 U/ml of alpha IFN to 0.1 microgram/ml PTT-119 (from 39.6% +/- 26.6 SD to 80.7% +/- 10 SD and 91.5% +/- 8 SD, respectively), while gamma IFN resulted in only a slight increase in colony growth inhibition when compared to the drug used alone. The association of alpha plus gamma IFN coupled with PTT-119 treatment did not significantly improve the results observed after exposure of leukemic progenitors to PTT-119 and alpha IFN alone.

Five out of five virus isolates were also passaged in phytohemagglutinin/interleukin-2 (PHA/IL-2)-treated lymphoblasts.

Progeny virus recovered from infected lymphoblasts was fully infectious for other lymphoblasts, but failed to infect MCSF-treated monocytes. Detailed analysis of target cell tropism among HIV isolates showed that HIV isolated in monocytes infected both monocytes and lymphoblasts; progeny virus isolated in lymphoblasts infected only T cells. HIV interacts differently with monocytes and T cells. Understanding this interaction may more clearly define both the pathogenesis of HIV disease and strategies for therapeutic intervention.","['Gendelman, H E', 'Baca, L M', 'Husayni, H', 'Turpin, J A', 'Skillman, D', 'Kalter, D C', 'Orenstein, J M', 'Hoover, D L', 'Meltzer, M S']","['Gendelman HE', 'Baca LM', 'Husayni H', 'Turpin JA', 'Skillman D', 'Kalter DC', 'Orenstein JM', 'Hoover DL', 'Meltzer MS']","['Henry M.

As a first step in accomplishing this goal, we built an argon ion laser-based computerized image cytofluorometry (ALCIC) system and determined this instrument's ability to quantitatively measure HIV nucleotides in infected lymphocytes. ALCIC consisted of a 43-mW argon ion laser connected to a Zeiss Universal microscope via a fiberoptic cable, a charged coupled-device video camera, a video frame grabber and array processor and a Micro Vax II computer using computer programs written in FORTRAN. HIV RNA and DNA were detected in infected CEM lymphocytes in culture by in situ hybridization using acetylaminofluorene (AAF)-labeled HIV-DNA probes, a rabbit anti-AAF antibody and a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. ALCIC measurements showed that 61% of the CEM cells were infected and that quantitative differences were distinguishable within this group. The levels of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence were sixfold or more greater than that observed with the same system using a 100-W mercury lamp for illumination; the improved intensity of the laser-based system is due to greater excitation intensity of the laser and the matching of the excitation spectrum to the peak wavelength of FITC. ALCIC has potential clinical value for determining the effect of antiviral agents on HIV infection and for assessing the susceptibility of different cell types to infection.","['Hart, L', 'Donovan, R M', 'Goldstein, E', 'Brady, F P']","['Hart L', 'Donovan RM', 'Goldstein E', 'Brady FP']","['Department of Physics, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['*DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluoresceins', 'HIV/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Lasers', 'Lymphocytes/analysis/microbiology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/microbiology/*pathology', 'Thiocyanates', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/microbiology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 1990 Apr;12(2):127-34.,"['AI-22745/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-72652/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of extracellular calcium, the ability of leukoregulin to permeabilize the cell membrane is diminished but is fully restored by addition of 1 mM extracellular Ca++ as shown flow cytometrically by loss of intracellular fluorescein. Membrane permeability is also increased by calcium ionophore A23187 but permeablization is completely blocked in calcium-free medium despite the intramembrane presence of the calcium ionophore. Membrane permeablization by the lectin phytohemagglutinin, in contrast, is independent of extracellular calcium. A similar divergence in cell proliferation activity of the three modulators of calcium flux and membrane permeability occurs in the absence of extracellular calcium. Leukoregulin inhibition of cell proliferation is abolished, inhibition by calcium ionophore A23817 is greatly reduced, and inhibition by phytohemagglutinin is unchanged. Leukoregulin permeabilized K562 cells isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting resume proliferation after 72 h. In contrast cells permeablized by calcium ionophore A23187 or phytohemagglutinin fail to resume proliferation by 7 days. The membrane permeablizing action of leukoregulin is, therefore, partially dependent upon extracellular calcium. It is also effected through a mechanism other than calcium ionophore transport or lectin type transmembrane signaling, and is accompanied by a reversible inhibition of cell proliferation.","['Barnett, S C', 'Evans, C H']","['Barnett SC', 'Evans CH']","['Division of Cancer Etiology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (leukoregulin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', '*Cell Division', '*Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240430109 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1990 May;43(1):89-101. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240430109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results clearly indicate that the inhibitory effects of KT6149 on the growth and DNA synthesis of HL-60 cells are more potent than those of MMC and that KT6149-induced DNA damage is due to single-strand scission and to cross-linking of DNA, suggesting a mode of activation different from that of MMC.","['Ishioka, C', 'Kanamaru, R', 'Konishi, Y', 'Ishikawa, A', 'Shibata, H', 'Wakui, A']","['Ishioka C', 'Kanamaru R', 'Konishi Y', 'Ishikawa A', 'Shibata H', 'Wakui A']","['Department of Clinical Cancer Chemotherapy, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '118359-59-4 (KW 2149)', '39R4TAN1VT (ferrous sulfate)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Ferrous Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/*pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02897256 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(2):117-21. doi: 10.1007/BF02897256.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both human and rodent CD8 antigens are comprised of two distinct polypeptide chains, alpha and beta. The majority of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) reactive with the human CD8 antigen bind the CD8 alpha chain, while a single mAb, T8/2T8-5H7, has been identified which binds to the CD8 alpha/beta heterodimer. While the two chains of CD8 have been presumed to be coordinately expressed in normal T cells, this is not always the case. Northern blot analysis of a panel of T-cell leukemias and normal cells demonstrate that CD8 alpha and CD8 beta are not invariably co-transcribed and phenotypic analysis of fresh and interleukin 2 (IL-2) expanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) confirm that the CD8 alpha and CD8 beta chains are differentially expressed at the cell surface. Four distinct subpopulations of CD8+ cells have been identified based on the expression of CD8 alpha/alpha or CD8 alpha/beta complexes: (1) T-cell receptor (TcR) alpha beta+ T cells which are CD8 alpha+/beta+; (2) TcR alpha beta+ T cells which are CD8 alpha+/beta-; (3) TcR gamma delta+ T cells which are CD8 alpha+/beta- and (4) natural killer (NK) cells which are CD8 alpha+/beta-. We also demonstrate the down-regulation of the CD8 alpha/beta heterodimers from the surface of a CD8+ T-cell clone following treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) while CD8 alpha/alpha homodimers remain on the cell surface. This observation demonstrates that a) a CD8+ T-cell clone can express both CD8 alpha/alpha homodimers and CD8 alpha/beta heterodimers and b) these two complexes do not have identical biological properties. Together, these data suggest that CD8 alpha/alpha and CD8 alpha/beta dimers may not subserve identical functions. The differential contribution of these two CD8 complexes should be considered in models of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and T-cell activation.","['Terry, L A', 'DiSanto, J P', 'Small, T N', 'Flomenberg, N']","['Terry LA', 'DiSanto JP', 'Small TN', 'Flomenberg N']","['Effector Lymphocyte Biology Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1990.tb01761.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1990 Feb;35(2):82-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1990.tb01761.x.,"['CA22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33050/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model is justified, in part, because THP-1 cells can be induced to express features of activated peripheral blood monocytes or tissue macrophages. The current investigation, however, demonstrates that THP-1 cells differ from normal monocytes in their secretion of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) following exposure to reagents that induce synthesis. For example, LPS treatment alone did not result in IL-1 beta secretion and very low concentrations were observed when lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated cells were simultaneously incubated with silica or silica in combination with hydroxyurea. Silica-enhanced release of IL-1 was related to changes in cell membrane permeability. Recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma) alone did not induce IL-1 beta secretion and did not significantly increase secretion by LPS- and silica-stimulated cells. In contrast, mezerein stimulation led to higher extracellular concentrations of IL-1 beta and rIFN gamma augmented secretion by mezerein-treated cells. Isoelectrofocusing of conditioned medium and titration of pooled fractions showed a direct correlation between extracellular levels of biologically active and immunoreactive IL-1. The role of IFN gamma in stimulating IL-1 beta secretion was not related to an enhancement of viability or an increase in the proportion of mezerein-treated cells synthesizing DNA. It was concluded that mezerein's regulation of secretion by THP-1 cells depended on the expression of monocyte features, including cell adherence and responsiveness to IFN gamma.","['Gaffney, E V', 'Stoner, C R', 'Lingenfelter, S E', 'Koch, G A']","['Gaffney EV', 'Stoner CR', 'Lingenfelter SE', 'Koch GA']","['Department of Research, Baptist Medical Centers, Birmingham, Alabama 35213.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Terpenes)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', '*Diterpenes', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1990 Apr;9(2):205-11.,"['CA44677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluation of non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted effectors reveals differential effects on natural and lymphokine-activated killing.,113-26,"Interferon-gamma (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) were examined for their ability to enhance major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on a variety of human tumor and normal tissue targets. Enhanced expression of MHC correlated with decreased target susceptibility to lysis by fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and IL-2-augmented PBMCs (aPBL) but not as clearly with cells with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity. These studies revealed maximal MHC enhancement after 48-72 h of incubation in IFN. Resistance to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells was best demonstrated after 72 h. Further, IFN and TNF were synergistic in their effects on MHC expression and induction of resistance of the cultured leukemias K562 and Molt-4 to aPBL effectors. Conversely, LAK susceptibility was usually unaltered after target IFN and TNF treatment. Incubation of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells with IFN also consistently resulted in MHC class I enhancement and resistance to NK lysis, whereas LAK susceptibility was variably affected. The brief incubation of fresh PBL in IL-2 (4-6 h) resulted in effectors highly lytic toward cultured cells, but with no activity against fresh tumor. Cultured cell lines treated with IFN and TNF were rendered relatively resistant to lysis by these activated cells. Fresh tumor MHC expression and LAK susceptibility was unchanged after IFN incubation. Additionally, there was no correlation between the level of MHC class I or class II expression and LAK susceptibility to any fresh, uncultured melanoma studied.

The ability of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to lyse the cultured autologous tumor target was markedly increased by preincubation of the targets with IFN and TNF.

Tonsil B-cells responded to phorbol ester (TPA) by an increased beta 2m production rate, which was further enhanced by the combined stimuli of TPA plus the calcium ionophore A23187. In marked contrast, however, lymphocytes from a majority (8/11) of B-cell malignancies showed a suppression of the TPA-induced beta 2m production rate in response to the combined TPA/A23187 stimulus. These different responses of 'normal' and malignant B-cells were not apparent when IgM production rates were examined. The recombinant cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma and TNF also enhanced beta 2m production rates of both normal and leukaemic B-cells, but to a considerably lesser extent than did TPA. Bryostatin-1 increased beta 2m production to a level intermediate between that obtained by TPA and the cytokines. It is suggested that beta 2m production rates may correspond to the degree of B-cell differentiation, and/or to the degree of cellular 'activation'. The results further indicate that the in vitro measurement of beta 2m production provides a different index of the cellular response than that obtained by the conventional measurement of IgM production.","['Jones, R A', 'Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M', 'Child, J A', 'Scott, C S']","['Jones RA', 'Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM', 'Child JA', 'Scott CS']","['Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Mitogens', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1990.153 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 May;61(5):675-80. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.153.,,,,PMC1971599,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent identification, characterization and cloning of several peptide regulatory factors, including granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating peptide regulatory factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin, and interleukins and a study of their actions, suggest that agents producing agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and leukemia may interfere with the action of these factors. The agents that are capable of inducing these diseases and the various peptide regulatory factors have positive and/or negative actions on the prostaglandin system. Prostaglandins are known to be involved in the maturation and differentiation of the progenitor cells of the bone marrow and in erythropoietin-mediated erythropoiesis. Since prostaglandins influence immune response, modify genetic damage induced by drugs and chemicals, modulate gene action, and have feed-back control on the actions of peptic regulatory factors, it is likely that prostaglandins are involved in the pathogenesis of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and leukemia.

Sixty-five patients developed a second cancer leading to a statistically significant increased relative risk (RR = 1.58), especially if extended radiotherapy had been given (RR = 4.13). The excess risks of developing lung cancer and malignant melanoma were 2.03 and 3.89, respectively. Increased RR for these two cancer types were seen both after extended radiotherapy and after radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Studies of the time between treatment and secondary lung cancer indicated that the development of the new lung cancer could be partly treatment related, whereas the raised incidence of malignant melanoma may be related to the frequent health checks performed in patients with testicular cancer. Patients who had received extended radiotherapy were also at an increased risk of developing cancer of the stomach and of the colon. Three cases of acute leukaemia were observed more than 5 years after treatment, all of them in patients who had received abdominal radiotherapy only. It is concluded that patients apparently cured of a testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing a new treatment related non-germ cell malignancy, in particular lung cancer.

The TNF production by THP-1 cells in response to K562 cells was preceded by a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i, initiated within 1 h and terminated within 4 h as a refractory state took over. Neither the amount nor the duration of TNF production was enhanced by gamma-interferon. The P32/ISH cells did not induce a significant [Ca2+]i change of TNF production, while MOLT-4 cells failed to induce TNF despite their capacity to mobilize Ca2+ in THP-1 cells. The failure of P32/ISH or MOLT-4 to induce TNF was attributed primarily to a lack of stimulatory membrane molecules rather than to suppression by an inhibitory component, since liposomes carrying membrane components of K562 and MOLT-4 or P32/ISH in varying proportions elicited TNF production that precisely reflected the K562 proportion. The ability of K562 to induce TNF was selectively impaired by trypsin, whereas the ability to mobilize [Ca2+]i was more sensitive to glutaraldehyde, although once the latter activity was extinguished, the K562 cell could no longer induce TNF. These results suggest that some leukemia cells are equipped with two or more signaling membrane moieties which together stimulate monocytes for transient tumoricidal expression in the preimmune stage.","['Yamauchi, T', 'Sagawa, T', 'Kanoh, M', 'Utsumi, S']","['Yamauchi T', 'Sagawa T', 'Kanoh M', 'Utsumi S']","['Department of Microbiology, Ehime University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 1;50(9):2708-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors examine peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. More than 90% of these cells bound T-lymphocyte specific antibodies, failed to bind B-lymphocyte specific antibodies, had rearranged T-cell receptor beta-chain genes and had retained immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in the germline configuration. Despite these T-lineage markers, the majority of these cells had rearranged kappa immunoglobulin light chain genes. This provides the first conclusive evidence for rearranged kappa genes in malignant T-lineage cells and warns that gene rearrangement studies alone cannot indicate tumor cell lineage. To detect T-lineage cells that rearrange immunoglobulin genes, multiple immunophenotypic and genotypic parameters must be evaluated. These cells may provide important models to study how normal and malignant cells rearrange lymphocyte receptor genes.","['Lutz, C T', 'Galles, M E', 'Kemp, J D', 'Goeken, J A', 'Dick, F R']","['Lutz CT', 'Galles ME', 'Kemp JD', 'Goeken JA', 'Dick FR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/93.5.702 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 May;93(5):702-5. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/93.5.702.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow transplantation Unit has been set up, the team of specialists has been formed and educated and the protocol for allogenic transplantation with Busulfan and cyclophosphamide combination for pretransplant conditioning has been adopted. In research work concerning the field of bone marrow transplantation a particular emphasis has been put on the working out of a mathematical model for optimal timing of bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia.","['Pejin, D', 'Popovic, S', 'Dokic, M', 'Felle, D', 'Stefanovic, N']","['Pejin D', 'Popovic S', 'Dokic M', 'Felle D', 'Stefanovic N']",,['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Acta Chir Iugosl,Acta chirurgica Iugoslavica,0372631,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*surgery', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/prevention & control']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Chir Iugosl. 1990;37 Suppl 1:11-5.,,,,,,Alogena transplantacija kostne srzi u hematoloskim oboljenjima.

We describe here the cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a cDNA fragment encoding the two putative zinc fingers (FI and FII) domain of the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the amino acids involved in metal coordination and analyzed the consequence of altering the proposed zinc-finger structures on DNA binding. Disruption of the metal binding ability of the second zinc finger, FII, dramatically reduced target DNA binding. In contrast, when the postulated Zn(II) ligands of FI were mutated, the DNA binding activity was only slightly affected. DNase I protection studies showed that the FII is involved in the specific recognition of a DNA strand break. These results demonstrate that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase contains a type of zinc finger that differs from previously recognized classes in terms of both structure and function.","['Gradwohl, G', 'Menissier de Murcia, J M', 'Molinete, M', 'Simonin, F', 'Koken, M', 'Hoeijmakers, J H', 'de Murcia, G']","['Gradwohl G', 'Menissier de Murcia JM', 'Molinete M', 'Simonin F', 'Koken M', 'Hoeijmakers JH', 'de Murcia G']","['Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Laboratoire de Biochimie II, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Zinc/*metabolism']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.8.2990 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Apr;87(8):2990-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.8.2990.,,,,PMC53819,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis indicated that proteins retaining the amino-terminal portion of gag through the capsid protein-coding region were incorporated into retrovirus particles. Proteins which deleted portions of the capsid protein were assembled into virions at low efficiency, indicating the importance of capsid protein interactions in retrovirus assembly. Fusion proteins which retained the amino-terminal matrix protein of the gag polyprotein but which lacked the capsid protein were released efficiently from cells in a nonviral form. The nonviral form was characterized by a high sedimentation coefficient and a low density, suggestive of membrane vesicles. While beta-gal was present in the cytoplasm of expressing cells, all fusion constructs were associated with cellular membranes. gag-beta-gal proteins which were capable of release from cells demonstrated a two-component immunofluorescence staining pattern consisting of a circle of fluorescence around the nucleus and a punctate pattern of staining throughout the remainder of the cell. Interestingly, fusions within the matrix protein were trapped intracellularly and yielded distinct perinuclear staining patterns, possibly localizing to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi. This observation suggests that Moloney murine leukemia virus gag proteins travel to the plasma membrane by vesicular transport associated with the cytoplasmic face of intracellular vesicles.","['Jones, T A', 'Blaug, G', 'Hansen, M', 'Barklis, E']","['Jones TA', 'Blaug G', 'Hansen M', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Portland, Oregon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Galactosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Codon/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Galactosidases/*genetics', 'Genes, gag', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.64.5.2265-2279.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1990 May;64(5):2265-79. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.5.2265-2279.1990.,['5R01 CA47088-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC249388,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, Gs alpha was radiolabeled by cholera toxin-catalzyed (32P)ADP-ribosylation with (32P)NAD as substrate. In membranes from left ventricular myocardium of six patients with dilated cardiomyopathy classified as NYHA IV and three samples from two non-failing donor hearts, labeling was too weak to allow detection of possible changes in the amount of Gs alpha. Therefore, the cytosolic small molecular weight G protein ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor), a cofactor for cholera toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha, was partially purified from bovine cerebral cortex. ARF activity was quantified by its ability to enhance auto-ADP-ribosylation of cholera toxin A1-subunit. Gs alpha was identified by comparing the ADP-ribosylation patterns of myocardial membranes, membranes prepared from human leukemia (HL 60) and S 49 mouse lymphoma wild type cells (45 kDa-band present) with membranes of the Gs alpha-deficient S 49 variant cyc- (45 kDa-band missing). In the presence of ARF, specific radiolabeling of the Mr 45,000 subtype of Gs alpha was markedly enhanced. The amounts of Gs alpha as measured by cholera toxin-dependent (32P)-ADP-ribosylation in the presence of ARR were similar in failing and nonfailing human hearts. It is concluded that factors other than Gs alpha are responsible for the altered regulation of the adenylate cyclase complex in heart failure. Moreover, by enhancing cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, endogenous ADP-ribosylation factor from bovine brain appears to be a useful tool to study Gs alpha even in tissues in which the labeling of Gs alpha is rather weak.","['Schnabel, P', 'Bohm, M', 'Gierschik, P', 'Jakobs, K H', 'Erdmann, E']","['Schnabel P', 'Bohm M', 'Gierschik P', 'Jakobs KH', 'Erdmann E']","['Medizinische Klinik I, Universitat Munchen, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Cell Cardiol,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,0262322,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factors', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cerebral Cortex/analysis', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Heart Failure/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myocardium/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-2828(90)90973-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-2828(90)90973-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Cardiol. 1990 Jan;22(1):73-82. doi: 10.1016/0022-2828(90)90973-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which IL-3 functions have been studied through the use of a series of IL-3-dependent cell lines isolated from myeloid leukemias or long-term bone marrow cultures. A variety of studies have implicated tyrosine phosphorylation in IL-3 signal transduction. One of the substrates of phosphorylation is a 140 kDa, IL-3-binding protein that is speculated to be the biologically relevant IL-3 receptor. IL-3, through tyrosine phosphorylation, supports viability and growth through the regulation of transcription of a series of genes including c-myc and c-pim-1. The c-myc gene contributes to viability, in part, by regulating the transcription of the ornithine decarboxylase gene. The role of growth factors in differentiation is less clear. By studying IL-3-dependent myeloid leukemia cell lines, two genes have been identified whose altered expression is associated with blocking the ability of the cells to differentiate. The c-myb gene is a nuclear DNA binding protein that has been implicated in myeloid transformation in a number of systems. The Evi-1 gene is a novel gene of the zinc finger family of transcriptional activators. Possible mechanisms by which these genes interfere with normal differentiation are discussed.","['Ihle, J N', 'Morishita, K', 'Bartholomew, C', 'Matsugi, T', 'Askew, D']","['Ihle JN', 'Morishita K', 'Bartholomew C', 'Matsugi T', 'Askew D']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Metalloproteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530080712 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1990 Jan;8 Suppl 1:130-46. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530080712.,['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,56,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of phorbol ester-induced down modulation of CD4 molecules, however, have not been elucidated. To determine how PMA down-modulates CD4 expression by T lymphocytes, we studied the ability of inhibitors of protein kinase C, calmodulin, actin, and tubulin to block PMA-induced modulation of CD4 in several murine and human cell types. We also tested the ability of intracellular and extracellular calcium chelators to block CD4 internalization. There was marked variability in the degree of PMA-induced down-modulation of CD4 among various cell types. The effects of PMA on CD4 expression were greater for murine thymocytes, for human PBL, and for the human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, MOLT-3, than for any of the other cell types studied. The protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, blocked phosphorylation but not internalization of CD4 molecules induced by PMA. Therefore, phosphorylation of CD4 molecules by protein kinase C is not required for the internalization of the molecules. Internalization was blocked by both inhibitors of calmodulin, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide, and trifluoperazine. PMA-induced internalization of CD4 was blocked by Quin-2 AM, which chelates intracellular calcium. EGTA, which chelates extracellular calcium, did not block internalization. Inhibitors of actin or tubulin did not block internalization.

The last route was not responsible for HTLV-I infection before the advent of modern medicine, nor will it be a major route in the future because anti HTLV-I antibody-positive blood is now screened out. Thus, the carriage rates in various areas of Japan have to be explained by the former two transmission methods. Based on the relationship between the two modes of transmission and carriage rates, several simulation experiments were performed. These experiments revealed that: (a) No population with a vertical transmission rate lower than 50% can be maintained as endemic for the virus. (b) Slight differences in horizontal transmission rates can cause a large change of the carriage rates. (c) A 1,000-fold carriage rate difference would become indistinguishable within a hundred generations if both modes of transmission were operating at nearly the same rate. (d) The probability of a formerly non-endemic population becoming endemic due to a single female carrier is not negligible. (e) Prevention of vertical transmission is much more effective in lessening the carriage rate within a short period of time than is prevention of horizontal transmission.

Stimulation of CMK cells with thrombin resulted in an increase of [Ca2+]i as measured with the fluorescent marker Fura 2-AM. The rise in [Ca2+]i was mostly dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) further increased [Ca2+]i after thrombin addition, thus indicating that PGE1 had a different action on [Ca2+]i in cells of the platelet-megakaryocyte lineage. The addition of thrombin and the calcium ionophore A23178 to CMK cells caused similar rapid formations of TXB2 as measured by RIA. Thrombin plus A23178 had a synergistic effect on TXB2 synthesis in CMK cells. Thrombin had no effect of TX metabolism in the cells with myeloid, erythroid, B-lymphoid, and T-lymphoid lineages.

The inserted segments of DNA varied in size between 0.35 and 6.5 kb and displayed restriction enzyme cleavage maps reminiscent of intracisternal A-particle (IAP) genomes.

Activation of the expression of the Evi-1 gene is frequently found in murine myeloid leukemias and leukemia cell lines and is due to retroviral insertions in the 5' region of the gene in either the Evi-1 or the CB-1/FIM3 common sites of viral integrations. To examine the role of the Evi-1 gene in human leukemias we have cloned regions of the human locus corresponding to the coding region of the gene and regions corresponding to the Evi-1 and CB-1/FIM3 common sites of integrations. Using these probes we demonstrate that the human Evi-1 gene maps to chromosome 3q24-q28 in a region that is translocated in acute nonlymphocytic leukemias with a t(3;5)(q25;q34).

LAK cells were generated in vitro by culturing PBL with 100 U recombinant human interleukin-2 (rH-IL-2)/ml for 72 h. K562 (human myelogenous leukemia), MKN-45 (human stomach adenocarcinoma) and PC-14 (human pulmonary adenocarcinoma) were used as target cells. The cytotoxicity of PBL to K562 and MKN-45 was suppressed in patients with stomach cancer before chemotherapy, compared with that in healthy volunteers (P less than 0.05). The cytotoxicity of LAK cells was significantly higher to all three cell lines tested than that of PBL in both the healthy volunteers and stomach cancer patients (P less than 0.01); however, a lower level of LAK activity was generated in patients with cancer compared to that in the healthy volunteers. FAM therapy did not suppress the cytotoxicities of PBL and LAK cells. The surface markers of PBL and LAK cells were measured, demonstrating that there was no significant change in the percentage of lymphocytes with CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+ or CD19+ after chemotherapy. The ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ cells in PBL and LAK cells were also not significantly changed after chemotherapy. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the PBL of stomach cancer were defective in generating LAK activity compared to those of controls, but the LAK activity generated from PBL receiving chemotherapy was similar to that from PBL without chemotherapy in stomach cancer patients.","['Hong, W S', 'Kim, C M', 'Lee, J O', 'Kang, T W', 'Yun, T K', 'Kim, C Y']","['Hong WS', 'Kim CM', 'Lee JO', 'Kang TW', 'Yun TK', 'Kim CY']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Nowon-ku, Seoul.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/administration & dosage', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1990 Mar;20(1):87-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells synthesize a single predominant species of intracellular proteoglycan with an approximate molecular weight of 100,000. The cells contain about 1 microgram of proteoglycan/million cells. The proteoglycan is turned over within the cells in two apparent pools with half-lives of about 0.6 and 27 h, respectively. The fast pool represents secretion into medium in an apparently intact form, whereas the slow pool represents intracellular degradation to free chondroitin sulfate chains and smaller fragments. The proteoglycan contains a protein core with an apparent Mr on gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of about 20,000-30,000. To the core protein are attached an average of six or seven chondroitin sulfate chains, each with an Mr of about 10,000. The chondroitin sulfate chains contain approximately 85% 4-sulfated and approximately 15% nonsulfated disaccharides. The chondroitin sulfate attachment region of the core protein is essentially resistant to trypsin and elastase, whereas the remainder of the protein core is readily degraded by proteases. The size of the chondroitin sulfate attachment region peptide generated by trypsin was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa. Based on the molecular size, distribution of amino acids, protease susceptibility, and the extent of O-glycosylation, we propose that the intracellular proteoglycan characterized in this study is the translation product of a proteoglycan gene reported to be present in these cells (Stevens, R.L., Avraham, S., Gartner, M.C., Bruns, G.A., Austen, K.E., and Weis, J.H.

DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: West Cumbria health district. SUBJECTS: 52 Cases of leukaemia, 22 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 23 of Hodgkin's disease occurring in people born in the area and diagnosed there in 1950-85 under the age of 25 and 1001 controls matched for sex and date of birth taken from the same birth registers as the cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antenatal abdominal x ray examinations, viral infections, habit factors, proximity to and employment characteristics of parents at Sellafield. RESULTS: Expected associations with prenatal exposure to x rays were found, but little information was available on viral illnesses. Relative risks for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were higher in children born near Sellafield and in children of fathers employed at the plant, particularly those with high radiation dose recordings before their child's conception. For example, the relative risks compared with area controls were 0.17 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.53) for being born further than 5 km from Sellafield 2.44 (1.04 to 5.71) for children of fathers employed at Sellafield at their conception, and 6.42 (1.57 to 26.3) for children of fathers receiving a total preconceptual ionising radiation dose of 100 mSv or more. Other factors, including exposure to x rays, maternal age, employment elsewhere, eating seafood, and playing on the beach did not explain these relationships. Focusing on Seascale, where the excess incidence has predominantly been reported, showed for the four out of five cases of leukaemia and one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma whose fathers were employed at Sellafield and for whom dose information was obtained that the fathers of each case had higher radiation doses before their child's conception than all their matched control fathers; the father of the other Seascale case (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was not employed at the plant. These results seem to explain statistically the geographical association. For Hodgkin's disease neither geographical nor employment associations with Sellafield were found. CONCLUSIONS: The raised incidence of leukaemia, particularly, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among children near Sellafield was associated with paternal employment and recorded external dose of whole body penetrating radiation during work at the plant before conception. The association can explain statistically the observed geographical excess. This result suggests an effect of ionising radiation on fathers that may be leukaemogenic in their offspring, though other, less likely, explanations are possible. There are important potential implications for radiobiology and for protection of radiation workers and their children.","['Gardner, M J', 'Snee, M P', 'Hall, A J', 'Powell, C A', 'Downes, S', 'Terrell, J D']","['Gardner MJ', 'Snee MP', 'Hall AJ', 'Powell CA', 'Downes S', 'Terrell JD']","['MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit (University of Southampton), Southampton General Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Employment', 'England/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', '*Fathers', 'Habits', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Recreation', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors', 'Virus Diseases/complications']",1990/02/17 00:00,1990/02/17 00:01,['1990/02/17 00:00'],"['1990/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.300.6722.423 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1990 Feb 17;300(6722):423-9. doi: 10.1136/bmj.300.6722.423.,,['BMJ. 1992 Sep 19;305(6855):715.

Constitutive and stable expression of beta-galactosidase activity was observed in muscle fibers after 6 days and 1 mo of muscle regeneration. Two patterns of expression were observed, diffuse expression within fibers and focal expression associated with the sarcolemma. This technique will allow future experiments with muscle-specific genes and promoters to study the physiological regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression in the intact adult mammal. Furthermore, the technique of stimulating stem cell proliferation to allow retroviral-mediated gene transfer may be generally applicable to other tissues.","['Thomason, D B', 'Booth, F W']","['Thomason DB', 'Booth FW']","['Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77225.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['EC 3.2.1.- (Galactosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'Y8335394RO (Bupivacaine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bupivacaine/toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Galactosidases/*genetics', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Muscles/drug effects/*enzymology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'beta-Galactosidase/*genetics/metabolism']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1990.258.3.C578 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1990 Mar;258(3 Pt 1):C578-81. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1990.258.3.C578.,"['AR-19393/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-07520/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['NASA: 90196206'],,,,,

It has been suggested that hypohaptoglobinemia results from isohemagglutinins or other contaminating proteins in the infused factor concentrates. The advent and increased utilization of Factor VIII concentrates that are highly purified by use of monoclonal antibodies have provided the opportunity to study whether proteins other than Factor VIII contained in the concentrate induce hemolysis. Of 49 consecutively studied Factor VIII-deficient hemophiliacs, 19 (39%) had a reduced serum haptoglobin level (less than 27 mg/dl). In particular, 16 of 35 (46%) of patients receiving only monoclonally purified Factor VIII products (Monoclate or Hemofil-M) had a reduced serum haptoglobin value. Haptoglobin measurements were variable on repeat measurement in 8 patients. Haptoglobin levels did not correlate with type or severity of hemophilia, hemoglobin value, or alterations in liver function. Low serum haptoglobin values were also observed in children with leukemia, without apparent hemolysis, who had extensive cutaneous hemorrhage associated with thrombocytopenia. We propose that reduced serum haptoglobin values in hemophiliacs do not result from immune-mediated hemolysis due to contaminating proteins in the concentrate. Moreover, hypohaptoglobinemia may not be due to hemolysis at all but may instead result from dissolution of hematomas and other foci of internal hemorrhage.","['Buchanan, G R', 'Holtkamp, C A', 'Johnson, A']","['Buchanan GR', 'Holtkamp CA', 'Johnson A']","['North Texas Comprehensive Hemophilia Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Haptoglobins)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Factor VIII/*therapeutic use', 'Haptoglobins/*analysis', 'Hemophilia A/*blood/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830330404 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 Apr;33(4):234-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830330404.,['MCJ-482003-05/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential activation of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.,2351-8,"To further study the mechanisms by which surface Ig triggering activates the inositol phospholipid signaling pathway, we have used B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients which, as previously described, display two patterns of response upon sIg cross-linking: in one group this cross-linking induces an inositol phosphate release, an intracellular free Ca2+ concentration elevation and a subsequent cell proliferation; in a second group none of these events occur although there is an increased class II Ag expression following anti-mu stimulation as in the first group. We have been able to demonstrate that the phosphatidyl inositol specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) can be activated in permeabilized B cells from the first group by direct stimulation, with GPT gamma S, of a guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein. In addition, since anti-mu + GTP gamma S stimulate an increased inositol phosphate production in these cells, this suggests that surface Ig cross-linking activates PI-PLC via a G protein. However, in cells from the second group no inositol phosphate is released after GTP gamma S stimulation although PI-PLC can be directly activated by high Ca2+ concentrations. This reflects in these cells, an interruption of the signaling cascade sIg/G protein/PI-PLC at the level of the G protein or at the G protein/PI-PLC coupling. In cells from both groups PMA treatment, which is known to alter phosphatidyl inositol metabolism in B cells, completely inhibits PI-PLC activation even by high Ca2+ concentrations. These studies show that the phosphatidyl inositol-dependent signaling cascade after surface Ig triggering can be altered at different levels in B cells.","['Hivroz, C', 'Geny, B', 'Brouet, J C', 'Grillot-Courvalin, C']","['Hivroz C', 'Geny B', 'Brouet JC', 'Grillot-Courvalin C']","['Laboratory of Immunochemistry and Immunopathology, INSERM U. 108, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HLA-D Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Mar 15;144(6):2351-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inasmuch as non-antibody macrophage activators also bind C1q to initiate C1 activation, we determined the effects of these same inhibitors of C1q biosynthesis on activation of macrophages for antibody-independent, nonspecific tumor cytotoxicity by lipid A and a variety of other non-antibody activators. Preexposure of mouse inflammatory peritoneal macrophages to either DHP (0.5 to 2.5 mM) or 2,2'-dipyridyl (0.1 to 0.3 mM) for 24 h produced a dose-related suppression of their response to activation by lipid A to mediate tumor cytotoxicity of L1210 mouse leukemia targets. Inhibition of C1q secretion by DHP-treated macrophages was confirmed both by a complement hemolytic assay and by autoradiographic analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled culture supernatants. DHP-treated macrophages were inhibited in their response to direct activation and triggering of IFN-gamma-primed macrophages by lipid A, Poly I:C, and cobra venom factor for tumor cytotoxicity. DHP inhibited macrophage activation for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of L1210 tumor targets mediated by antitumor target IgG. The addition of exogenous purified C1q (2 micrograms/ml) to macrophages after DHP treatment, reconstituted their response to activation for both antibody-independent and antibody-dependent tumor cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that C1q synthesis and secretion by effector macrophages is a prerequisite for the initiation of their activation by both immune complex and by non-antibody agents that also bind C1q. It now appears that macrophage-derived C1q may act as an auxiliary amplification signal for autocrine-like modulation of the initiation of macrophage activation by both the antibody-dependent and independent pathways.","['Leu, R W', 'Zhou, A Q', 'Shannon, B J', 'Herriott, M J']","['Leu RW', 'Zhou AQ', 'Shannon BJ', 'Herriott MJ']","['Biomedical Division, Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc., Ardmore, OK 73402.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Lipid A)', '0 (Pyridines)', '3220-74-4 (3,4-dehydroproline)', ""551W113ZEP (2,2'-Dipyridyl)"", '80295-33-6 (Complement C1q)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"[""2,2'-Dipyridyl/*pharmacology"", 'Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*drug effects', 'Complement C1q/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Lipid A/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Proline/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Secretory Rate/drug effects']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Mar 15;144(6):2281-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these compounds are certain naturally occurring purines such as hypoxanthine or 1-methylhypoxanthine. We have extended these studies to other modified oxypurines and have identified some areas of cell regulation with which they may be interacting. Monomethylated derivatives of guanine, hypoxanthine or xanthine are active as inducers of differentiation. Excluding hypoxanthine, the parent oxypurines guanine and xanthine are ineffective in inducing differentiation. The dimethyl- and trimethylxanthine derivatives are also inactive as inducers. The methylated oxypurines are not metabolized to nucleotides by the cell and, therefore, probably do not interact with nucleic acid synthesis directly. We have investigated one cellular process of possible regulatory significance with which they do interact. ADP-ribosylation has been implicated in control of gene expression and differentiation. The methylated oxypurines inhibit this reaction, as measured in permeabilized cells, in the same concentration range at which they are effective as inducers of differentiation. Additionally, 1-methylguanine and 7-methylguanine decrease incorporation of mannose and glucosamine into glycoprotein and into dolichol-oligosaccharide precursors. These effects may be related to cell surface alterations observed during differentiation.","['Kerr, S J']",['Kerr SJ'],"['Dept. of Biochemistry/Biophysics/Genetics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Dolichol Phosphates)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dolichol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Guanine/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/18 00:00,1990/01/18 00:01,['1990/01/18 00:00'],"['1990/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/18 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00220717 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1990 Jan 18;92(1):37-44. doi: 10.1007/BF00220717.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells normally express inward rectifier K+ channels, with a macroscopic whole-cell conductance in normal Ringer ranging from 1 to 16 nS/cell. This conductance is stabilized by including ATP or GTP in the pipette solution. Intracellular dialysis with any of three different activators of G proteins (GTP gamma S, GppNHp, or AlF-4) completely inhibited the inward rectifier K+ conductance with a half-time for decline averaging approximately 300 s after ""break-in"" to achieve whole-cell recording. In addition, with a half-time averaging approximately 200 s, G protein activators induced the appearance of a novel time-independent outwardly rectifying K+ conductance, which reached a maximum of 1-14 nS. The induced K+ channels are distinct from inward rectifier channels, having a smaller single-channel conductance of approximately 8 pS in symmetrical 160 mM K+, and being more sensitive to block by quinidine, but less sensitive to block by Ba2+. The induced K+ channels were also highly permeable to Rb+ but not to Na+ or Cs+. The current was not activated by the second messengers Ca2+, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, or by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (0.1 microgram/ml for 12-13 h) prevented this current's induction both by guanine nucleotides and aluminum fluoride, but had no effect on the decrease in inward rectifier conductance. Since GTP gamma S is known to stimulate secretion from patch-clamped rat peritoneal mast cells, it is conceivable that K+ channels become inserted into the plasma membrane from secretory granules. However, total membrane capacitance remained nearly constant during appearance of the K+ channels, suggesting that secretion induced by GTP gamma S was minimal. Furthermore, pertussis toxin had no effect on secretion triggered by antigen, and triggering of secretion before electrical recording failed to induce the outward K+ current. Finally, GTP gamma S activated the K+ channel in excised inside-out patches of membrane. We conclude that two different GTP-binding proteins differentially regulate two subsets of K+ channels, causing the inward rectifier to close and a novel K+ channel to open when activated.","['McCloskey, M A', 'Cahalan, M D']","['McCloskey MA', 'Cahalan MD']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,2985110R,"['0 (Aluminum Compounds)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '21340-02-3 (tetrafluoroaluminate)', '284SYP0193 (Fluorine)', '34273-04-6 (Guanylyl Imidodiphosphate)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)']",IM,"['Aluminum/*pharmacology', '*Aluminum Compounds', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Fluorides', 'Fluorine/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Guanylyl Imidodiphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neural Conduction/*drug effects', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Thionucleotides/*pharmacology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1085/jgp.95.2.205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Physiol. 1990 Feb;95(2):205-27. doi: 10.1085/jgp.95.2.205.,"['GM-14514/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-35901/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2216315,,,,,,,,,,,

One such activity, differentiation-inducing factor (DIF, D-factor) from mouse spleen cells, shares a number of biological and biochemical properties with the recently characterized and cloned leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). We have assessed the effects of recombinant LIF on bone resorption and other parameters in neonatal mouse calvaria. Both recombinant murine and human (h) LIFs stimulated 45Ca release from prelabeled calvaria in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in bone resorption was associated with an increase in the number of osteoclasts per mm2 bone. The osteolytic effect of hLIF were blocked by 10(-7) M indomethacin. hLIF also stimulated incorporation of [3H] thymidine into calvaria, but the dose-response relationship was distinct from that for bone resorption, and this effect was not blocked by indomethacin. Similarly, hLIF increased [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into calvaria, and this was also not inhibited by indomethacin. It is concluded that LIF stimulates bone resorption by a mechanism involving prostaglandin production, but that a distinct mechanism is responsible for its stimulation of DNA and protein synthesis. The primary structure of LIF differs from that of other fully characterized, bone-active cytokines, and it, thus, represents a novel factor which may be involved in the normal regulation of bone cell function.","['Reid, L R', 'Lowe, C', 'Cornish, J', 'Skinner, S J', 'Hilton, D J', 'Willson, T A', 'Gearing, D P', 'Martin, T J']","['Reid LR', 'Lowe C', 'Cornish J', 'Skinner SJ', 'Hilton DJ', 'Willson TA', 'Gearing DP', 'Martin TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Bone Resorption/physiopathology', 'Bone and Bones/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cytokines', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Skull/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo-126-3-1416 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1990 Mar;126(3):1416-20. doi: 10.1210/endo-126-3-1416.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used two-color immunofluorescence and B-cell gating to develop an improved assay that avoids false positives due to non-B cells, without requiring restrictive light scatter gates that may exclude true positives. This method is sensitive to 0.2% monoclonal B cells admixed with fresh normal lymphocytes, to 0.6% monoclonal B cells admixed with normal lymphocytes that have been stored for up to 72 hours, and readily detects 1% monoclonal cells in patient specimens.

The median sCD8 level in non-splenectomized patients was 1,050 U/mL (range: 160 to 2,400 U/mL) and was significantly higher (P less than .0001) than the median of 275 U/mL (range: 20 to 1,080 U/mL) in splenectomized patients. The relationship of sCD8 to clinical response to subsequent interferon alpha (IFN alpha) treatment was analyzed. Patients who showed subsequent hematologic response with normalization of all blood counts had significantly lower levels of sCD8 concentrations at diagnosis than those who did not (P = .0056). Furthermore, normalization of sCD8 during IFN alpha treatment paralleled the achievement of normal counts in peripheral blood, whereas soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels remained high in most patients after 12 to 15 months of treatment. We speculate that activation of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells might play a role in myelosuppression, and its modulation during treatment with IFN alpha correlates with normalization in peripheral blood counts.","['Ho, A D', 'Grossman, M', 'Trumper, L', 'Pezzutto, A', 'Pralle, H', 'Boedewadt-Radzun, S', 'Papendick, U', 'God, B', 'Zwingers, T', 'Hunstein, W']","['Ho AD', 'Grossman M', 'Trumper L', 'Pezzutto A', 'Pralle H', 'Boedewadt-Radzun S', 'Papendick U', 'God B', 'Zwingers T', 'Hunstein W']","['Department of Internal Medicine V and Poliklinik, Heidelberg, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood', 'Time Factors']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84444-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Mar 1;75(5):1119-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The octanol: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) partition coefficient of thiotepa was 2.4 +/- 0.1 (n = 8). With this value, the permeability coefficient (Ps) for thiotepa was estimated to be between 2.8 x 10(-4) and 1.81 x 10(-3) cm/sec, and the half-life of accumulation of thiotepa by L1210 cells was estimated to be 0.063 to 0.40 seconds. Thiotepa accumulation by cells was measured after incubation of cells with [14C]thiotepa and subsequent harvesting of cells by centrifugation through silicone fluid. Thiotepa accumulation by L1210 cells was biphasic. The initial phase was rapid and essentially complete by 10 seconds. The amount of cell-associated 14C increased linearly with increasing extracellular concentrations of thiotepa or with increasing size of the cell pellet. The absolute amount of cell-associated 14C was consistent with that expected if the [14C]thiotepa had been evenly distributed in the incubation medium and a volume equal to that of the cell pellet had been sampled and counted. This rapid phase of thiotepa accumulation was not slowed when cells were incubated on ice. The second phase of [14C]thiotepa accumulation occurred at a rate much slower than that of the initial phase. This slower phase of drug accumulation was linear for at least 5 hours. The rate of 14C accumulation increased progressively over a range of extracellular thiotepa concentrations from 5 to 100 nmol/mL and could not be saturated under acceptable tissue culture conditions. The slower rate of 14C accumulation was ablated by incubating cells on ice and was reduced by 30% to 50% in the presence of 1mM of sodium azide or 2,4-dinitrophenol. The slow rate of accumulation of 14C reflected summation of a relatively stable or constant amount of exchangeable 14C and an amount of nonexchangeable 14C that increased linearly from almost undetectable levels at the start of the experiment to amounts equal to 64 +/- 11% of total cellular radioactivity after 5 hours. The initial association of [14C]thiotepa with both human and avian RBCs was also very rapid. Avian RBCs also exhibited a slow rate of 14C accumulation that was linear for at least 5 hours but that was 15% to 20% that of L1210 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Egorin, M J', 'Snyder, S W', 'Pan, S S', 'Daly, C']","['Egorin MJ', 'Snyder SW', 'Pan SS', 'Daly C']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Birds', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thiotepa/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(90)90173-Z [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1990 Feb;17(1 Suppl 3):7-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapeutic agents have been selected for combinations based on cytotoxic activity, different mechanisms of action (to avoid cross-resistance), and different dose-limiting toxicities (to avoid additive toxicity). The ideal combinations use the highest tolerable doses of active non-cross-resistant agents to minimize the potential for drug resistance and achieve optimum cytotoxicity. Dose escalation is often limited by myelosuppression. Hematologic stem cell support from bone marrow or peripheral blood allows the administration of significantly higher doses of chemotherapy. In 1977, Thomas and colleagues in Seattle reported that 13 of 100 patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation for relapsed acute leukemia were disease-free 1 to 4.5 years later. Today, almost 50% of selected patients with acute myelogenous leukemia who undergo transplantation with human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor marrow during first remission are cured. Between 20% and 50% of lymphoma patients who undergo transplantation after failing conventional treatment have survived; those whose disease is responding to standard-dose therapy at the time of transplant have the best prognosis. Conditioning regimens that are sufficiently cytoreductive are not currently available for patients with solid tumors. The diversity of solid tumors makes it likely that a variety of regimens will be required. In a sequence of laboratory and clinical studies, we have constructed and evaluated a regimen comprising 6 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2 of N,N',N''-triethylenethiophosphoramide (thiotepa), and 800 mg/m2 of carboplatin. The response rate in women with measurable breast cancer was 81%. While profound myelosuppression was noted, organ toxicity has been rare. This regimen, designed to exploit the principles of curative cancer chemotherapy, is associated with low morbidity and high cytoreductive efficacy. The regimen is currently being evaluated in a phase II trial in patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer who are responsive to conventional-dose chemotherapy. Of 29 patients entered in the study, only one has died of toxicity, confirming the low incidence of treatment-related toxicity associated with the regimen.","['Antman, K', 'Eder, J P', 'Elias, A', 'Ayash, L', 'Shea, T C', 'Weissman, L', 'Critchlow, J', 'Schryber, S M', 'Begg, C', 'Teicher, B A']","['Antman K', 'Eder JP', 'Elias A', 'Ayash L', 'Shea TC', 'Weissman L', 'Critchlow J', 'Schryber SM', 'Begg C', 'Teicher BA', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Insitute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Carboplatin', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Thiotepa/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(90)90175-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1990 Feb;17(1 Suppl 3):33-8.,['P01CA-38493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results imply that the bcl-2 gene is preferentially linked to the IgL genes in CLL and could function in leukemogenesis.","['Adachi, M', 'Tefferi, A', 'Greipp, P R', 'Kipps, T J', 'Tsujimoto, Y']","['Adachi M', 'Tefferi A', 'Greipp PR', 'Kipps TJ', 'Tsujimoto Y']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA/genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.171.2.559 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Feb 1;171(2):559-64. doi: 10.1084/jem.171.2.559.,"['CA-49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2187727,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta 1 alone induced differentiation of a human monocytic leukemia U-937 line into the cells with macrophage characteristics. When combined with TNF, TGF-beta 1 synergistically or additively induced differentiation associated properties. A human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, ML-1, differently responded to TGF-beta 1 in induction of differentiation. FcR activity and phagocytic activity induced by TNF were suppressed by TGF-beta 1. However, nitroblue tetrazolium reducing activity was synergistically induced by combinations of TGF-beta 1 and TNF. Scatchard analysis of TNF receptors indicated that the number of binding sites and dissociation constant of TNF for its receptors on U-937 or ML-1 cells were not changed by treatment with TGF-beta 1. Although IFN-gamma, IL-6, granulocyte CSF, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF-induced nitroblue tetrazolium reducing activity of U-937 cells, only IFN-gamma, and TNF induced it synergistically in combination with TGF-beta 1. Synergism between TGF-beta 1 and TNF was also observed in inhibition of growth of U-937 and ML-1 cells. Although TGF-beta 1 induction of differentiation of other monocytoid leukemic THP-1 cells was similar to that of U-937 cells, TGF-beta 1 only slightly induced differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells, either alone or in combination with TNF.

The effect of hypoosmotic shock on the regulation of ODC protein and mRNA levels was studied in a variant L1210 mouse leukemia cell line (D-R cells) which expresses ODC at greater than or equal to 100-fold higher levels than the parental cells. Hypoosmotic stress increased ODC activity in proportion with the osmotic gradient imposed to both D-R cells and their normal counterparts. A 60% decrease in medium osmolality increased ODC activity and the amount of immunoreactive ODC protein from 20- to 30-fold after 4 h without any detectable change in ODC mRNA contents in D-R cells. ODC induction was sustained up to 48 h after hypoosmotic shock, with maximal activity levels being observed at 24 h. Hypotonic shock dramatically increased (up to 36-fold) the rate of ODC synthesis as measured by 10-min pulses with 35S-labeled methionine, in agreement with kinetic constants predicted from the changes observed for the enzyme activity. Moreover, hypoosmotic stress extended the half-life of ODC activity from 35 +/- 10 to 212 +/- 67 min and blocked any degradation of the radiolabeled immunoreactive protein, which had a half-life of 28 +/- 6 min under isotonic conditions, for at least 120 min after addition of cycloheximide. The induction of ODC by hypoosmotic stress was quickly reversed by a sudden upshift of osmolality through a very rapid inhibition of ODC biosynthesis and an increase in the rate of enzyme degradation. Thus, hypoosmotic stress activates the expression of ODC exclusively through post-transcriptional mechanisms in D-R cells. The osmotically induced accumulation of ODC molecules is quite unique as shown by the fact that ODC is the major protein (approximately 25% of total) synthesized during the first 4 h following a 60% hypotonic shock, despite a 30-50% reduction of the rate of labeled precursor incorporation into soluble proteins.","['Poulin, R', 'Pegg, A E']","['Poulin R', 'Pegg AE']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Milton S.

We studied the effects of TPA on the regulation of c-jun gene expression in HL-60 cells during monocytic differentiation. Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in untreated HL-60 leukemic cells, increased significantly by 6 h, and reached near maximal levels by 24 h of exposure to 32 nM TPA. Similar kinetics of c-jun induction by TPA were observed in human U-937 and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells. Similar findings were obtained with bryostatin 1 (10 nM), another activator of protein kinase C and inducer of monocytic differentiation. Furthermore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.5 microM), a structurally distinct agent which also induces HL-60 monocytic differentiation, increased c-jun expression. TPA treatment of HL-60 cells in the presence of cycloheximide was associated with superinduction of c-jun transcripts. Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of c-jun gene transcription in untreated HL-60 cells, and that exposure to TPA increases this rate 3.3-fold. Treatment of HL-60 cells with both TPA and cycloheximide had no effect on the rates of c-jun transcription. The half-life of c-jun RNA as determined by treating HL-60 cells with TPA and actinomycin D was 30 min. In contrast, the half-life of c-jun RNA in TPA-treated HL-60 cells exposed to cycloheximide and actinomycin D was greater than 2 h. These findings suggested that the increase in c-jun RNA observed during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.","['Sherman, M L', 'Stone, R M', 'Datta, R', 'Bernstein, S H', 'Kufe, D W']","['Sherman ML', 'Stone RM', 'Datta R', 'Bernstein SH', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1990/02/25 00:00,1990/02/25 00:01,['1990/02/25 00:00'],"['1990/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)39769-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Feb 25;265(6):3320-3.,"['CA01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon was accompanied by a synergistic antiproliferative effect. Further characterization of these two activities of the IFN gamma/5-FU combination on HL-60 cells was carried out. Whereas a brief pretreatment of the cells with IFN gamma followed by 5-FU was sufficient to exert the synergistic antiproliferative action, the effect on differentiation was dependent on a prolonged concomitant exposure to both drugs. In an attempt to gain more insight into the biochemical mechanisms of these phenomena, we have examined the effects of RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors and of cytoskeleton disrupting agents on the actions of IFN gamma. Inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis by actinomycin D or cycloheximide did not prevent the antiproliferative action of IFN gamma nor the induction of monocytic differentiation, yet these two compounds blocked the priming effect of IFN gamma on the potentiation of 5-FU action. Actinomycin D synergistically potentiated the antiproliferative action of IFN gamma. Colchicine, vinblastine, and cytochalasin B, disrupting the microtubular and microfilament structure, did not interfere with the actions of IFN gamma; higher concentrations of the drugs even improved the priming effect. Exogenous thymidine, known to counteract the antiproliferative effect of 5-FU, also blocked the antigrowth action but not the differentiation induced by the IFN gamma/5-FU combination. The results suggest the existence of two different mechanisms of the IFN gamma/5-FU synergism: one governing the antiproliferative action via an effect on thymidine synthetase, inducible by a short-term IFN gamma pretreatment and dependent on de novo RNA and protein synthesis; and the other mediating the induction of differentiation requiring a long-term exposure of the cells to both drugs. From a clinical point of view, drug combinations such as IFN gamma and 5-FU, inducing differentiation as well as inhibiting proliferation, may suggest a new approach to the treatment of leukemia.","['Kafka, M', 'Dvilansky, A', 'Nathan, I']","['Kafka M', 'Dvilansky A', 'Nathan I']","['Hematology Laboratory, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Mar;18(3):153-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All bone marrow grafts were from HLA-identical siblings and were not depleted of T-lymphocytes. Twenty percent of the recipients had one or more episodes of septicaemia during the granulocytopenic period after transplantation, mostly due to gram-positive bacteria. Only five children died due to infection, in each case caused by a microorganism originating from the endogenous flora. Complete gastrointestinal decontamination was superior to selective gastrointestinal decontamination in preventing infectious complications (p less than 0.001).

An addback of exogenous MuIFN-gamma to HuIL-2-cyclosporin A-treated PC cultures and to the nonadherent subpopulation of such cultures, at a concentration which itself produced no antitumor effect, permitted HuIL-2 to induce its antitumor effect.

Using these methods, we have shown that busulfan (BU) was more effective against the self-renewal of blast progenitors than against the terminal divisions. As reported previously, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is more effective against self-renewal and adriamycin (ADR) is more effective against terminal divisions. To determine the reason why antileukemic drugs show different sensitivity against self-renewal and terminal divisions, we studied the effects of these drugs on normal human bone marrow cells. We have shown that BU and Ara-C suppressed the colony formation induced by interleukin-3 (IL-3) more effectively than that by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). On the other hand, ADR suppressed the colonies induced by G-CSF more effectively. In normal hemopoiesis, IL-3 has been shown to stimulate the growth of more primitive hemopoietic stem cells, while G-CSF has been documented to stimulate the growth of granulopoietic committed precursors at a more differentiated stage. Therefore, BU and Ara-C are considered to be more effective against the immature cells in normal bone marrow and ADR is effective against the more differentiated cells. We suppose that the different differentiation stage of target cells may explain the difference of the effects on self-renewal and terminal divisions between BU, Ara-C and ADR.","['Tohda, S', 'Nagata, K', 'Suzuki, T', 'Nara, N']","['Tohda S', 'Nagata K', 'Suzuki T', 'Nara N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Busulfan/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000205156 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1990;83(1):16-21. doi: 10.1159/000205156.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Involvement of arachidonic acid metabolites.,442-7,"The effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on the regulation of macrophage-specific colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) gene expression have been studied in HL-60 cells during monocytic differentiation. CSF-1 transcripts were undetectable in uninduced HL-60 cells, reached maximal levels by 3 h of exposure to TNF, and returned to that of control cells by 24 h. Transcriptional run-on analysis demonstrated that exposure to TNF stimulated the rate of CSF-1 gene transcription by 6.4-fold. The combination of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and TNF increased levels of CSF-1 mRNA compared with treatment by TNF alone. We also studied the signal transduction mechanisms responsible for regulating TNF-induced CSF-1 mRNA levels. Both 4-bromophenacyl bromide and quinacrine, inhibitors of phospholipase A2 activity, blocked TNF-induced increases in CSF-1 transcripts in a concentration-dependent manner, while caffeic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, inhibitors of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, had no detectable effect on induction of CSF-1 RNA. PGE2 or dibutyryl cAMP treatment of HL-60 cells in the presence of TNF blocked the expression of CSF-1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the increase in CSF-1 RNA observed during TNF treatment is regulated, at least in part, by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, and that PGE2 and cAMP regulate transcriptional activation of the CSF-1 gene by TNF.","['Sherman, M L', 'Weber, B L', 'Datta, R', 'Kufe, D W']","['Sherman ML', 'Weber BL', 'Datta R', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'PN0FRW1G4Z (4-bromophenacyl bromide)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI114457 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1990 Feb;85(2):442-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI114457.,['K08 CA-01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['J Clin Invest 1990 Apr;85(4):following 1338'],,PMC296443,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of cultured cells with [3H]mevalonate, an isoprenoid precursor, results in the labeling of multiple polypeptides, the most prominent of which migrate in the range of 21-26 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. In Rat-6 fibroblasts transformed by H-ras, one of the farnesylated proteins was identified as p21ras by two-dimensional immunoblotting. However, this protein accounted for only a small proportion of the [3H]mevalonate-derived radioactivity incorporated into 21-26-kDa proteins. Murine erythroleukemia cells, which did not express immunodetectable quantities of p21ras, contained several 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins distributed in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions. At least eight of these proteins were capable of binding [alpha-32P]GTP on nitrocellulose membranes. Pulse-chase studies showed that the isoprenoid modification did not necessarily result in the translocation of the cytosolic proteins to the cell membrane. A prominent group of carboxyl-methylated proteins in murine erythroleukemia cells overlapped with the 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins on one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Methylation of this group of proteins was selectively abolished when cells were treated with lovastatin, an inhibitor of isoprenoid synthesis. Addition of exogenous mevalonate to the lovastatin-treated cells fully restored carboxyl methylation. These studies suggest that the 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins in mammalian cells are members of a recently discovered family of low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins which, although ras-related, appear to be distinct structurally and possibly functionally from the products of the ras genes. The observed isoprenoid-dependent carboxyl methylation of a group of 21-26-kDa proteins suggests that the low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins may undergo a series of post-translational C-terminal cysteine modifications (i.e. farnesylation, carboxyl methylation) analogous to those recently elucidated for p21ras.","['Maltese, W A', 'Sheridan, K M', 'Repko, E M', 'Erdman, R A']","['Maltese WA', 'Sheridan KM', 'Repko EM', 'Erdman RA']","['Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania 17822.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Methylation', 'Mevalonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats']",1990/02/05 00:00,1990/02/05 00:01,['1990/02/05 00:00'],"['1990/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)39953-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Feb 5;265(4):2148-55.,['R01 CA 34569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we used a cell-free translation system to further investigate the mechanism by which this regulation occurs. Lysates of ODC-overproducing cells were capable of synthesizing large amounts of ODC. The degree of initiation was poor in the lysates and the synthesis of ODC was mainly a result of continued elongation of peptide chains on pre-initiated ribosomes. By determining the amount of ODC produced in the lysate, we obtained an estimate of the number of ribosomes that were actively translating ODC mRNA at the moment of lysis. Using this polysomal run-off assay we demonstrated that the polyamine-mediated regulation of ODC synthesis occurs without any change in the number of ribosomes associated with the message. This finding indicates that the polyamines exert a coordinate effect on initiation and elongation.","['Autelli, R', 'Holm, I', 'Heby, O', 'Persson, L']","['Autelli R', 'Holm I', 'Heby O', 'Persson L']","['Department of Physiology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Polyamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Eflornithine', 'Feedback', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polyamines/*pharmacology', 'Polyribosomes/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spermidine/pharmacology']",1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(90)80060-V [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(90)80060-v [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1990 Jan 15;260(1):39-41. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(90)80060-v.,,['FEBS Lett 1990 Mar 26;262(2):369'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined whether BC and leukemia colony-forming cells (L-CFC) from AML patients could differentiate in vitro after short-term culture with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), retinoic acid (RA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Expression of myeloid differentiation antigens CD15, CD14, CD33, and p124 was determined on the BC by immunofluorescence and on the L-CFC by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and complement (C')-mediated cytotoxicity followed by cloning in methylcellulose. We found that 26 of 39 (67%) cases demonstrated changes in the expression of myeloid differentiation antigens on the BC, and 6 of 7 (86%) cases showed an altered L-CFC myeloid antigen phenotype after short-term culture with differentiating agents. Alterations in myeloid antigen expression in the L-CFC population correlated with a reduction in L-CFC cloning potential. In the BC, alterations of myeloid differentiation antigens occurred in a manner consistent with those observed during normal myelopoiesis. For example, CD14 antigen expression (a late-stage monocyte antigen) increased on BC from 12 of 39 (31%) cases, and p124 (an antigen expressed both by myeloid progenitor cells and by a subset of monocytes) increased on 15 of 39 (38%) cases. Changes in the expression of CD33 antigens (expressed normally by myeloid progenitor cells and by mature monocytes) on the BC were variable, with 7 of 29 cases (24%) showing a decrease and 7 of 29 cases (24%) showing an increase. When comparisons were made between pairs of differentiation agents that caused the altered expression of an antigen on either the BC or L-CFC of a patient, the majority of changes were in the same direction (either both ""increased"" or both ""decreased""). This suggests that the direction of antigen change is characteristic of the leukemia cell subpopulation for each patient and not of the stimulatory agent. This study demonstrates that cells from more than two thirds of AML cases examined responded to various differentiation agents in vitro as measured by changes in the expression of myeloid cell-associated surface antigens and by alterations in cloning potential of the L-CFC, a finding of potential clinical significance.","['Howell, A L', 'Stukel, T A', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Davey, F R', 'Ball, E D']","['Howell AL', 'Stukel TA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Davey FR', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85760-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 1;75(3):721-9.,"['CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracytoplasmic LeuM5 was detectable at 3 to 4 days and surface membrane LeuM5 was detectable continuously between 5 and 17 days on greater than or equal to 20% CD3 cells (maximum, 42% CD3 cells at 10 days) after activation. Two-color flow cytometric analysis of the activated T cells demonstrated that a maximum of 60% CD8 but only 25% CD4 cells expressed LeuM5; the mean percentage of LeuM5+ CD8 cells was 44% compared with 12% LeuM5+ CD4 cells. A variable proportion of the neoplastic T cells in 19 of 73 (26%) T-cell neoplasms were LeuM5+. Twelve of 18 CD4-CD8+ (67%) but only 5 of 40 CD4+ CD8- T-cell neoplasms expressed LeuM5.

Having isolated a full-length cDNA for the polymerase, we have now evaluated the effect of endogenously and exogenously induced DNA strand breaks on the transcriptional control of this enzyme. During retinoic acid or dimethyl-sulfoxide-induced differentiation of HL-60 human leukemia cells, which may involve DNA breaks as well as other changes in chromatin, mRNA levels for the polymerase increased very early and remained high for up to 48 h after which it decreased to pre-induced levels. Polymerase transcript levels did not change, however, during the induction of DNA strand breaks by dimethylsulfate, a variety of other alkylating agents, X-irradiation, or UV-irradiation in several mammalian cell lines. It appears that in sharp contrast to the catalytic requirement of the polymerase, the induction of transcription of the polymerase gene may not be a strand-break-dependent process. The noninducibility of the polymerase gene following DNA damage suggested that there may be adequate levels of the polymerase in the cells to cope with DNA damage. To test this hypothesis we examined the efficacy of DNA repair in Cos cells engineered to overexpress the polymerase. Although there was a slight augmentation of the repair rate, this increase was apparent only after very high levels of DNA damage and only at early repair times. After a longer repair period, the extent of repair in control cell was similar to that in the cell overexpressing the polymerase. We thus conclude that the basal levels of the polymerase are adequate for significant amounts of DNA damage.","['Bhatia, K', 'Pommier, Y', 'Giri, C', 'Fornace, A J', 'Imaizumi, M', 'Breitman, T R', 'Cherney, B W', 'Smulson, M E']","['Bhatia K', 'Pommier Y', 'Giri C', 'Fornace AJ', 'Imaizumi M', 'Breitman TR', 'Cherney BW', 'Smulson ME']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes', 'HeLa Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/11.1.123 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1990 Jan;11(1):123-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/11.1.123.,"['CA13195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25344/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This release exceeded the starting intracellular content of TC II. In contrast, endothelial cells did not contain or elaborate R binder, the other major circulating binding protein for cobalamin, Cycloheximide inhibited the elaboration of TC II, suggesting that the endothelial cells synthesize the protein. Thrombin, which stimulates tissue plasminogen activator release, did not enhance TC II release, and neither did endotoxin or mellitin. However, thrombin did appear to partially protect TC II release from inhibition by cycloheximide.

(1988) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 21, 9-13; Smets, L.A., Metwally, E.A.G., Knol, E. and Martens, M. (1988) Leukemia Res. 12, 737-743). In the present study it was investigated whether MIBG could serve as an acceptor for the ribosyl transferase activity of cholera toxin and of erythrocyte membranes. MIBG appeared a substrate for the cholera toxin-catalyzed transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to arginine-like residues with the highest affinity for this enzyme reported as yet (Km = 6.5 microM). MIBG was also ADP-ribosylated by the mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase(s) of turkey erythrocyte membranes. Moreover, the drug appeared a potent affector of the ADP-ribose linkage to membrane proteins by these enzymes. Interference by MIBG was stronger than by related guanyltyramine, the monoamine precursors of MIBG, meta-iodobenzylamine had no effect at all. In contrast, the drug failed to affect endogenous, O-linked poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, induced in nuclei of S49-leukemia cells by deoxyribonuclease. Since MIBG is the first described drug that specifically interferes with the cellular N-linked mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase reactions, it may be an important tool to elucidate the physiological role of this posttranscriptional protein modification.","['Loesberg, C', 'van Rooij, H', 'Smets, L A']","['Loesberg C', 'van Rooij H', 'Smets LA']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Iodobenzenes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)', '60-20-8 (N-guanyltyramine)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'X8ZC7V0OX3 (Tyramine)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine', 'ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cholera Toxin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Iodobenzenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars/*biosynthesis', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*biosynthesis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Turkeys', 'Tyramine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1990/01/19 00:00,1990/01/19 00:01,['1990/01/19 00:00'],"['1990/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(90)90106-P [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(90)90106-p [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Jan 19;1037(1):92-9. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(90)90106-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, this spontaneous proliferation was inhibited by anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (mabs). Moreover, myeloma cell lines, completely dependent upon exogenous IL-6 for their growth, could be reproducibly established by initially stimulating the myeloma cells with both IL-6 and GM-CSF. These results demonstrate that IL-6 is a major paracrine myeloma-cell growth factor in vitro. High serum IL-6 levels were observed in MM patients with active disease, especially patients with terminal disease. High IL-6 mRNA levels were found in bone-marrow cells of MM patients, mainly in myeloid and monocytic cells, in vivo. The myeloma cells did not express IL-6 mRNA. Injection of anti-IL-6 mabs to MM patients with terminal disease and extramedullary proliferation, completely blocked the myeloma-cell proliferation in vivo and completely inhibited the serum IL-6 bioactivity and the serum CRP levels. One patient with plasma cell leukemia and hypercalcemia was treated for two months with anti-IL-6 mabs and maintain in remission for 2 months without major side effects. Interestingly, the serum calcium levels also decreased in these patients.

The supernatant of a TH2 cell clone (ST2/K.9) stimulated by concanavalin A was found to contain a factor, provisionally termed mast cell costimulatory activity (MCA), that substantially enhances the proliferation of MMC promoted by a combination of IL 3 and IL 4. In comparison to other lymphokines MCA is rather resistant to tryptic digestion but is very sensitive to pH values lower than 6.0 and to organic solvents. Chromatographic fractionation of MCA revealed that activity is associated with protein(s) or glycoprotein(s) of 35 to 40 kDa. Partially purified MCA that was functionally free of other T-cell-derived lymphokines did not stimulate mast cell proliferation in the absence of a combination of IL 3 and IL 4. In addition, MCA did not affect the proliferation of mast cells when employed together with either IL 3 or IL 4 alone. Control experiments demonstrated that MCA is identical to neither the T-cell-derived lymphokines IL 2 to IL 6, IL 9, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha or beta, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), nor to IL 7, granulocyte CSF, macrophage CSF, erythropoietin, leukemia inhibitory factor, or epidermal growth factor (EGF). Finally, experiments using a panel of PPD-reactive TH1- and TH2-like cell lines revealed that MCA is preferentially produced by TH2 cells. These data, especially the relative resistance of MCA to trypsin and the high sensitivity to low pH values and organic solvents, indicate that MCA is distinct from known T-cell-derived lymphokines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schmitt, E', 'Huls, C', 'Nagel, B', 'Rude, E']","['Schmitt E', 'Huls C', 'Nagel B', 'Rude E']","['Institut fur Immunologie der Joh.

Irradiation initiates ""preleukemic"" cells, which are promoted to become neoplastic. Studies in mice in which lymphoma development is inhibited by a bone marrow transplantation after irradiation suggest that radiation--induced alterations to the T cell lineage, and particularly to thymic microenvironment, are critical for the promotion of preleukemic cells. It is proposed that the lack of physiological differentiation signals within the thymus, as a result of irradiation, allows these cells to escape the normal controls of thymocyte production and pushes them towards neoplastic transformation. A disturbance in the production of cytokines may be involved, since exogenous cytokines, such as Interferon gamma or Tumor Necrosis Factor a, can inhibit radiation-induced lymphomagenesis, reproducing the effects of bone marrow transplantation. The model is thus suitable for studying the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and designing biological manipulation devoted to cancer prevention in individuals who have been exposed to oncogenic agents.","['Boniver, J', 'Humblet, C', 'Rongy, A M', 'Delvenne, C', 'Delvenne, P', 'Greimers, R', 'Thiry, A', 'Courtoy, R', 'Defresne, M P']","['Boniver J', 'Humblet C', 'Rongy AM', 'Delvenne C', 'Delvenne P', 'Greimers R', 'Thiry A', 'Courtoy R', 'Defresne MP']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Animals', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*physiopathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology/physiopathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1990 Jan-Feb;4(1):41-3.,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutagenized human tumor T cell lines, deficient for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase have been used for the development of T-T cell hybrids. Unfused tumor cells are removed by using appropriate selection media. Certain of these media contain components (such as thymidine) that inhibit the growth of the hybrids. A different method involves the use of tumor T cell lines chemically treated, before the fusion, with irreversible biochemical inhibitors. This treatment eliminated any unfused cells of the T cell line. Recently, a method has been developed for the generation of human T-T cell hybrids without the use of mutagenized or chemically treated tumor T cell lines. Hybrids are selected on the basis of their ability to form colonies in soft agar, and their hybrid nature is confirmed by HLA typing and functional tests. The human lymphoblastoid cell lines used did not form colonies in agar. Hybrids developed by this method exhibit excellent growth characteristics and increased stability. A large number of human T-T cell hybrids producing growth, differentiation or immunoregulatory factors have been developed. Certain hybrids exhibiting immunological functions requiring direct cell-cell contact have been developed also. The advantages of using T-T cell hybrids over other methods for immortalizing T cell functions or lymphokine production are summarized.

In our study comparing Cy and TBI with Melph and TBI in AML, we have shown a significant increase in antileukemic activity after transplantation following the latter conditioning regimen. The retrospective study of Melph/TBI in autologous versus allogenic transplantation suggested that in AML this antileukemic effect may derive from increased GvHD and is not present in the autologous setting. We hope that by increasing the intensity of our GvHD prophylaxis we can reduce the toxicity of Melph/TBI and preserve its antileukemia effect. Our experience with GM-CSF has been a little disappointing: despite facilitating neutrophil recovery, we were unable to demonstrate a clinical benefit in the treatment arm. We hope to further investigate the use of cytokine combinations in the transplant setting.","['Tiley, C', 'Powles, R']","['Tiley C', 'Powles R']","['Leukemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Transpl,Clinical transplants,8812419,"['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'England', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*surgery/therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Transpl. 1990:165-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here summarize and extend our results, obtained in two different experimental systems, on the antagonism between these two major interleukins. IL-4 inhibits the effect of IL-2 on the proliferation as well as the differentiation of B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. When B-CLL cells are activated by anti-mu Ab in the presence of IL-4, this latter enhances the expression of the p55 as well as the p70/75 chain of the IL-2 receptor. In contrast IL-4 profoundly suppresses the number of high affinity binding sites for IL-2 on in vitro activated B-CLL cells. Such a discrepancy between the suppression of IL-2 binding sites and the enhancement of each component of the heterodimeric IL-2 receptor, is as far as we know, yet undescribed. The interaction of IL-4 with its own receptors might influence the state of p55-p70/75 complex association or act on a third subunit of the IL-2 receptor. When used alone, IL-4 enhances the expression of other activation molecules by B-CLL cells: CD23, DR antigen. Similarly IL-4 can concomitantly enhance the specific response of normal B-cells while suppressing the action of IL-2. When normal human B-cells are specifically stimulated by an insolubilized antigen, IL-4 alone induces an expansion of the number of specific antigen-binding cells. In contrast IL-4 profoundly suppresses the generation of antigen-induced IL-2-dependent specific IgM antibody forming cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Galanaud, P', 'Karray, S', 'Llorente, L']","['Galanaud P', 'Karray S', 'Llorente L']","['INSERM Unite 131.32, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antigens/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1990 May-Jun;1(2):57-64.,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze cholesterol ester accumulation, P388D1 macrophages were incubated with increasing quantities of unmodified or acetylated human LDL, washed, and live stained with a lipophylic fluorescent dye Nile Red. The increase in fluorescence intensity was quantitatively determined by the interactive laser cytometer (ACAS 470) and compared with the accumulation of cellular cholesterol esters determined by the gas liquid chromatography. Correlation between the two methods was highly significant (r greater than 0.9, P less than 0.001). A good agreement between the two methods was also found in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility. With the use of 589 nm narrowband interference filter in the light path of emitted light the intensity of fluorescence correlated well with cellular cholesterol ester content even in the presence of relatively high concentrations of triglycerides. Therefore, digital imaging fluorescence microscopy appears to be a reliable method for quantification of cholesterol ester accumulation at the single cell level offering new possibilities of studying interactions between cells and cholesterol ester rich lipoproteins.","['Koren, E', 'Franzen, J', 'Fugate, R D', 'Alaupovic, P']","['Koren E', 'Franzen J', 'Fugate RD', 'Alaupovic P']","['Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,"['0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'P476F1L81G (nile red)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Cholesterol Esters/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oxazines', '*Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Triglycerides/blood']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0021-9150(90)90109-V [pii]', '10.1016/0021-9150(90)90109-v [doi]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 1990 Dec;85(2-3):175-84. doi: 10.1016/0021-9150(90)90109-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean rate of LDL degradation was 1.7-fold higher in CAD-MNL than in control-MNL (P less than 0.05), independent of the LDL source. The increased LDL degradation rate in CAD-MNL appeared to be due to an increased receptor-mediated LDL degradation rate in CAD-MNL and not to an increased CAD-LDL interaction with the receptor since LDL isolated from patients with and without CAD had similar in vitro degradation rates in HL-60 cells and 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced HL-60 macrophages. An increased ratio of apo B to cholesterol, specifically apo B to cholesteryl ester, was observed in LDL isolated from patients with CAD. LDL particles isolated from CAD patients contained 14.8% less cholesteryl ester than LDL from control subjects (P less than 0.01). The data suggest that CAD patients have an increased plasma LDL particle number even though they have similar plasma LDL-cholesterol levels as compared to control subjects. These data indicate that CAD patients with normal plasma LDL cholesterol levels have two metabolic abnormalities: an altered LDL composition resulting in particles with reduced cholesteryl ester content and an increased LDL catabolism resulting in an increased influx of LDL cholesterol into MNL; both of which may play a role in the development of coronary heart disease.","['Shi, F', 'Hurst, P G', 'McNamara, D J']","['Shi F', 'Hurst PG', 'McNamara DJ']","['Department of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,"['0 (Apolipoproteins B)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apolipoproteins B/analysis', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/analysis', 'Coronary Disease/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, LDL/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0021-9150(90)90104-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0021-9150(90)90104-q [doi]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 1990 Dec;85(2-3):127-37. doi: 10.1016/0021-9150(90)90104-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nasal and genital swabs, mouth washings, urine, stool and blood serum were taken for mycological and serological examination before and weekly during one episode of neutropenia (less than 10(9) granulocytes/l) per patient. The quantitative determination of the yeast concentration in stool specimens demonstrated that amphotericin B led to intestinal yeast count reduction in only one third of the patients and could not prevent the increase of the intestinal yeast flora in another third of the patients. Beyond that the quantitative determination of yeast colonization in oropharynx, genital region, blood and stool did not prove to be a reliable tool for evaluating the host-fungus relationship during neutropenia. On the other hand mycoserology reflected episodes of candidosis well. 19 patients treated with fluconazole showed only minor titer increases. In 21 patients treated with amphotericin B, four fungemias were found: two by both hemagglutination (HAT) and immunofluorescence (IFT), one by IFT and one by antigen detection (Ramco Cand-Tec) alone. In only one of these cases yeast cells were released in urine. From these results is concluded that control of serology is essential in studies of that type and that fluconazole seems to provide better protection from candidosis than amphotericin B during induced neutropenia.","['Finke, R']",['Finke R'],"['Abt.

Immunological study.,211-21,"The study has been performed on peripheral blood and splenic malignant cells from 16 patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). The cell surface markers were identified by rosette techniques and using monoclonal antibodies (m Ab). The surface markers' expression of the hairy cells (HC) varied. The E receptors, the T-cell antigens, the HLA-DR antigens and smIgG were either expressed or not according to the affected organ, the progress of illness, or the treatment. The surface pattern changed sometimes in the same patient during the progress of illness. These observations demonstrate that HCL is a unique disease with malignant cells characterized by a marked variability of the cell surface markers. To demonstrate the ability of hairy cells to bind labile smIgG, the cells were studied by affinity chromatography on SpA-Sepharose 6MB and by ES-rosette assay. The percent of cells bound on SpA-Sepharose varied between 6% and 66%, representing the hairy cells with labile-bound smIgG. With affinity chromatography it was also possible to separate the hairy cells with a special phenotype: T3+ T4+ T8+ T11+ surface membrane labile-bound IgG+ (11gG+) FcR+, HLA-DR+ EACD+ (Ripley rosette forming cells), resembling a normal subset of large granular lymphocytes (LGL). The percentage of these cells varied between 60% and 86% of the bound cells. These observations suggest that in HCL, the malignant transformation might involve a common progenitor for the B, T and LGL lineages, the hairy cell being a hybrid type of malignant cell. Its main immunological peculiarity is the marked mobility of the surface membrane structures and hence the lability (plasticity) of the surface markers' expression.","['Stela, R', 'Berceanu, S', 'Munteanu, N', 'Ursea, C', 'Motoiu, I', 'Moraru, I']","['Stela R', 'Berceanu S', 'Munteanu N', 'Ursea C', 'Motoiu I', 'Moraru I']","['Clinic of Hematology Fundeni Hospital, Bucharest.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rosette Formation', 'Splenectomy']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1990;23(4):211-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical diagnosis can be achieved on the basis of cytochemical investigation alone.

The majority of cells with at least one rearranged p53 allele do not express detectable levels of p53 protein. Here, we show that in 4 out of 19 newly established erythroleukemic cell lines induced by infecting DBA mice with either the anemia (FV-A) or polycythemia (FV-P)-inducing strains of Friend virus, the p53 gene is rearranged as a result of integration of spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV). Integration of SFFV within the p53 gene resulted in inactivation of gene expression as determined by Western blot analysis. The sites of SFFV integration in the p53 gene were found, by Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction, to be localized in a 1-kbp region between introns 7 and 9. In addition, loss of the normal p53 allele was observed in three of the erythroleukemic cell lines that carried a rearranged p53 gene. Insertion of SFFV in these cell lines resulted in either the appearance of aberrant p53 transcripts or the complete lack of p53 expression. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that retroviral insertions can not only contribute to neoplastic transformation by activating dominant oncogenes but also by inactivating genes that normally function in a negative way to control cell growth. Thus, it may be possible to identify additional genes of this class by characterizing chromosomal sequences that are adjacent to common sites of retroviral integration in tumors.","['Ben-David, Y', 'Lavigueur, A', 'Cheong, G Y', 'Bernstein, A']","['Ben-David Y', 'Lavigueur A', 'Cheong GY', 'Bernstein A']","['Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,New Biol,The New biologist,9000976,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Dominant', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polycythemia/genetics/microbiology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/microbiology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,New Biol. 1990 Nov;2(11):1015-23.,,,,,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,

The use of aspiration cytology as the initial diagnostic procedure for these neoplasms is more controversial since this technique may deprive the clinician of valuable information (histologic subtype, oncogene status) now available only by examination of large tissue biopsies. Similarly, FNA can serve as a triage technique for the separation of patients harboring thyroid nodules or enlarged lymph nodes into operative candidates and non-operative candidates. As cytopathologists become more familiar with the appearance of pediatric neoplasms, this diagnostic technique will become more widely used, reducing the need for operative intervention in the diagnosis of many benign and reactive lesions.","['Layfield, L J', 'Reichman, A']","['Layfield LJ', 'Reichman A']","['Department of Pathology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cysts/diagnosis/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dis Markers. 1990 Nov-Dec;8(6):301-15.,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute leukemias have been defined as major types of lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias according to morphological and cytochemical criteria. 2. The technical improvements and standardization of immunofluorescence and immunocytology staining methods have provided new insights for classifying these disorders on the basis of monoclonal antibodies. 3. The scheme used to describe normal lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, when also used to describe their malignant counterparts, provides a well-established model for the immunological classification of acute leukemias. 4. In this review article, we suggest some guidelines for performing a series of cytochemical reactions using immunological markers to ensure a reliable diagnosis of acute leukemia.","['Pombo-de-Oliveira, M S', 'Tabak, D G']","['Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Tabak DG']","['Centro Nacional de Transplante de Medula Ossea, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 1990;23(9):763-72.,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to herbicides of the phenoxyacid variety (2, 4, 5-T; 2, 4-D) has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In addition several studies have suggested that agricultural workers have an excess risk of hematolymphopoietic malignancies, although no specific agent has yet been identified. Italy is particularly attractive for investigating further these associations, because: a) there is a high prevalence of exposure to solvents in industrial areas (estimated to be 10-16% in the province of Torino, Varese and Florence), and a high prevalence of exposure to herbicides (including phenoxyacides) in agricultural areas; b) there is also considerable extra-occupational exposure to solvents and pesticides; c) competent groups of hematologists exist in several towns, using advanced diagnostic techniques including cytogenetics. We propose therefore to conduct a multicenter population-based case-control study in 11 italian areas, chosen on the basis of a high exposure prevalence. In three years, we intend to interview approximately 1100 cases of leukemia, 1900 cases of lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin) and 400 cases of myeloma; 1900 randomly selected individuals, residents of the same areas, will serve as a population control group. Cases will be all those occurring in the study period among residents of the 11 areas, newly diagnosed. Particular care will be dedicated to diagnostic aspects, including B- and T- cell characterization. Cases and controls will be blindly interviewed by trained personnel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Vineis, P', 'Seniori Costantini, A']","['Vineis P', 'Seniori Costantini A']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Ospedale Maggiore, Torino.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,"['0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Pesticides)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology"", 'Case-Control Studies', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Herbicides/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Solvents/*toxicity']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 1990 Nov-Dec;81(6):506-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the efficiency of the SF liquid system to sustain normal residual haemopoiesis to the detriment of the leukemic population in patients with ALL. Probes for a potential selective effect were brought through leukemic progenitor cell assay (CFU-ALL) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study of the bcr/abl translocation. In 13 experiments done in 12 patients, morphological blast cells and the ALL-CFU were dramatically reduced within 3 weeks of incubation in both SF and SD cultures. In 5/5 experiments in SD conditions and 2/5 experiments in SF conditions, leukemic cells expressing the bcr/abl fusion gene also disappeared within the same period. There was no difference in the CFU-GM production between SF and SD mediums. Erythropoiesis exhibited a slower decline in conditions SF, compared to the conditions SD. These results indicate that the liquid marrow culture may selectively deplete the leukemic lymphoblastic cells and enable repopulation by residual normal hemopoietic cells.

We analysed a panel of 15 T-ALL and 15 T-LL selected for their cell surface expression of the CD3 molecules. The results indicate that TcR gamma delta is more frequently used than TcR alpha beta in T-ALL (10 out of the 15 patients tested). This is in contrast to the results obtained with T-LL where the vast majority expressed TcR alpha beta (13 out of the 15 patients). These findings suggest that the leukemic cells could have a different origin in these two diseases. In addition analysis of TcR variable regions expressed by the leukemic blasts showed that in most cases they had rearranged functional V delta 1 gene segments (8 out of 11 patients) whereas in a unique case V delta 2 gene segment was used. Taken together these results and those indicating that T-ALL cell coexpress the CD1a,b and c molecules strengthen the possibility that even though these leukemic cells express the CD3-TcR complex at their cell surface their normal counterparts are not found in peripheral blood.","['Gouttefangeas, C', 'Bensussan, A', 'Boumsell, L']","['Gouttefangeas C', 'Bensussan A', 'Boumsell L']","['INSERM U93, Institut de recherche sur les maladies du sang, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1990;32(5):337-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the detection of B5, CD25, CD71 and CD38 activation markers clearly demonstrated that the B-CLL lymphocyte is a preactivated or activated cell, at various phases of the cellular cycle.

In specimens prepared for routine transmission electron microscopy, ingested W. recta were not observed. In immunogold experiments, phagocytosed W. recta were noted, but only rarely. Opsonization of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. gingivalis and W. recta with specific antisera appeared to increase their level of interaction with the HL-60 cells.

A high incidence (67%) of nonthymic lymphomas and leukemias was observed in the thymectomized NFS mice. Development of nonthymic lymphomas and leukemias in these mice started about 2 months later than that of thymic lymphomas and increased significantly 10 months onward after the last irradiation, when the development of thymic lymphomas in intact mice had already come to an end. These nonthymic lymphomas and leukemias involved predominantly the spleen and the mesenteric lymph nodes. Twelve out of 18 lymphomas and leukemias were examined immunocytologically. All of these tumors except one were diagnosed as lymphomas including one plasmacytoma. One case was diagnosed as myelomonocytic leukemia because the leukemic cells were highly positive for nonspecific esterase and negative for chrolacetate esterase. All lymphomas tested were negative for thy-1.2, and five of them expressed surface immunoglobulins. From these results, nonthymic lymphomas developed in thymectomized and X-irradiated NFS mice were classified as B-cell lymphomas probably including non-T/non-B cell lymphomas. Present findings demonstrated that a low incidence of nonthymic lymphomas in intact NFS mice exposed to split-dose X-irradiation should be ascribed to a longer latency since most of the mice died of thymic lymphomas prior to the development of overt nonthymic lymphomas.","['Mori, N', 'Takamori, Y']","['Mori N', 'Takamori Y']","['Department of Applied Bioscience, University of Osaka Prefecture, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,,IM,"['Animals', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Thymus Gland/*physiology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1269/jrr.31.389 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1990 Dec;31(4):389-95. doi: 10.1269/jrr.31.389.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the antileukemic effect of Bisantrene (an anthracene derivative now undergoing phase II clinical trials in relapsed/resistant acute non lymphoid leukemias-ANLL) using the ANLL cell clonogenic assay. Fifteen cases were studied (9 newly diagnosed, 5 relapsed and 1 refractory ANLL). Normal CFU-GM sensitivity was tested in a subset of 10 normal controls. A wide range of concentrations (from 0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml) at 3 durations of exposure (30 min, 120 min, continuous) was employed. Bisantrene proved effective in 12 out of 15 ANLL cases, inhibiting blast colony growth (50% at 1 micrograms/ml; nearly 100% at 10 micrograms/ml) in a dose-dependent, time-independent way. Three cases were unresponsive both in vitro and in vivo. Normal CFU-GM were inhibited at lower doses (50% at 0.5 micrograms/ml; 100% at 5 micrograms/ml). We conclude that: 1) Bisantrene is active in vitro on leukemic clonogenic cells at doses corresponding to plasmatic levels achievable in patients, with a parallel activity in vivo in 3 relapsed cases. It should be tested in vitro before therapeutic use in order to avoid, if possible, improper use in resistant patients. 2) Normal CFU-GM are more sensitive than clonogenic leukemic cells. This must be taken into account, in view of possible prolonged neutropenias after therapy. 3) The time-independent effect of the drug should be evaluated in the design of new therapeutic schedules.","['Visani, G', 'Rizzi, S', 'Tosi, P', 'Cenacchi, A', 'Gamberi, B', 'Lemoli, R M', 'Papadopulu, P', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Rizzi S', 'Tosi P', 'Cenacchi A', 'Gamberi B', 'Lemoli RM', 'Papadopulu P', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia L. e A.

In each case the blast cells were separated from the maturing precursors of the erythroid and granulocytic lineage by centrifugation on a Percoll density gradient. Parallel chromosome investigations were performed in each cell fraction. Cytogenetic analysis performed at presentation did not reveal distinctive karyotype features in metaphases arising in the blast enriched cell fraction, as compared with those obtained from the fraction containing erythroblasts and promyelocytes--myelocytes. These findings suggest that in the initial phase of MDS blast cells may lack distinctive cytogenetic features and may thus represent part of a clonal preleukemic proliferation. At the time of leukemia onset, clonal aberrations [trisomy 21 and del(11)(q23)] showing a restricted pattern of distribution within the blast cell enriched fractions were detected in two patients, whereas one patient showed an increase in size of the abnormal clone carrying monosomy 7, an aberration detected in metaphases obtained from both cell fractions. Thus, some evolutive steps in the natural history of these disorders can be heralded by the acquisition of chromosome aberrations more readily detectable in blast enriched cell fractions. In some cases, partial loss of differentiative capability by the abnormal clone may account for the detection, at leukemia onset, of chromosome aberrations involving both the blast cell fraction and the erythroblast-promyelocyte enriched cell fraction.","['Piva, N', 'Cuneo, A', 'Carli, M G', 'Cariani, D', 'Fagioli, F', 'Castoldi, G']","['Piva N', 'Cuneo A', 'Carli MG', 'Cariani D', 'Fagioli F', 'Castoldi G']","['Cattedra di Ematologia Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1990 Nov-Dec;75(6):522-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of a Philadelphia chromosome by translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 provokes the breaking and migration of a cellular oncogen (ABL), located in the 9q34 region, towards chromosome 22 and the 22q11 region where the PHL gene is situated. This gene is broken in the bcr area the rearrangements of which are specific to CML. The ABL and PHL genes fragments fuse together, creating a new hybrid gene which is transcribed into an 8.5 kilobase messenger RNA specific to CML. This RNA is translated into a 210 kilodalton protein whose abnormally high tyrosine kinase activity seems to contribute to the development of the disease. Genetic engineering techniques improve our understanding of CML molecular mechanisms and can be very useful to clinicians as they permit the diagnosis of CML in some cases devoid of chromosomal markers, and the detection of a possible relapse in marrow-grafted patients with a much greater sensitivity (one in 100,000 cells) than that of cytogenetics.","['Aissaoui, Z', 'Lai, J', 'Fenaux, P', 'Kerckaert, J P']","['Aissaoui Z', 'Lai J', 'Fenaux P', 'Kerckaert JP']","[""Interne des Hopitaux, stagiaire a l'unite 124 INSERM, Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer de Lille.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,,IM,"['Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0248-8663(05)80863-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(05)80863-x [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 1990 Jul-Aug;11(4):308-12. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(05)80863-x.,,,33,,,Leucemie myeloide chronique: de la cytogenetique a la biologie moleculaire.,,,,,,,,,

Recent biochemical fractionation of PKC as well as sequence analysis of its cDNA clone has revealed the existence of multiple subspecies of this enzyme with obvious tissue- and cell-specific expression. The present study is concerned with the differential regulation of expression of PKC subspecies of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 during differentiation toward granulocyte-like cells induced by retinoic acid. PKC in HL-60 cells is resolved into three distinct subspecies (peak a, b, and c) by the hydroxyapatite column chromatography. Biochemical and immunochemical analyses revealed that peak a and c enzymes were identified with the type II (beta II) and type III (alpha) PKC subspecies previously identified and characterized from brain. On the other hand, peak b enzyme was separable from type I, II and III PKC, and is suggested to be unidentified PKC subspecies possessing subtly different characters from others. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1 microM retinoic acid caused the decrease in peak b activity within 24 h, while peak a activity was increased and peak c activity was slightly decreased within 48 h. The elution profile of PKC subspecies in human peripheral neutrophils resembled that obtained with HL-60 cells treated with RA. The results imply that activities of PKC subspecies in HL-60 cells may be distinctly regulated by retinoic acid treatment prior to the achievement of cell differentiation.","['Hashimoto, K']",['Hashimoto K'],"['Department of Biochemistry, Kobe University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Kobe J Med Sci,The Kobe journal of medical sciences,0413531,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Kobe J Med Sci. 1990 Aug;36(3-4):87-101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that while the oxidation by external H2O2 is completely inhibited by azide or cyanide, the oxidation by endogenous species is still present, even under anaerobic conditions. The data herein reported indicate that autoxidation and peroxidation of DCFH2 are distinct reactions. Hence only by addition of increasing concentrations of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, the fluorescence of DCF can be used to evaluate the cellular ability of scavenging H2O2. By this method we have found that the erythroleukaemia cell line K562 and promyelocytic line HL-60 show a faster rate of DCFH2 oxidation than peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), mature T-cells (MOLT-3 and MOLT-4) and B-cells (DAUDI).

Persistence of leukemic cells during the first 18 months of treatment.,448-55,"BACKGROUND: Whether patients in clinical remission for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) continue to harbor leukemic cells is not known, because methods of detecting residual malignant cells have not been sufficiently sensitive. This information might be useful for predicting recurrence and determining the duration of therapy. METHODS: Using a sensitive new method--identifying complementarity-determining region III sequences with the polymerase chain reaction--we estimated the number of residual leukemic cells in the bone marrow of eight children with B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia before and after remission. RESULTS: Induction chemotherapy produced a 3-to-4-log reduction in the number of leukemic cells. In all samples obtained up to 18 months after diagnosis, however, 0.004 to 2.6 percent of bone marrow nucleated cells were residual leukemic cells. Among the four patients studied more than 18 months after diagnosis, three had no detectable leukemic cells in marrow samples. Despite this, one of them, who was no longer receiving therapy, had a central nervous system relapse. In one patient receiving maintenance chemotherapy, there was a 60-fold increase in leukemic cells three months before bone marrow relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The complete disappearance of leukemic cells (or their reduction below our method's threshold of detection, 1 in 100,000 cells) may be necessary to achieve a cure of ALL. The quantification of residual leukemic cells in serial marrow aspirates during therapy may allow the early detection of relapse.","['Yamada, M', 'Wasserman, R', 'Lange, B', 'Reichard, B A', 'Womer, R B', 'Rovera, G']","['Yamada M', 'Wasserman R', 'Lange B', 'Reichard BA', 'Womer RB', 'Rovera G']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",1990/08/16 00:00,1990/08/16 00:01,['1990/08/16 00:00'],"['1990/08/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/16 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199008163230705 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1990 Aug 16;323(7):448-55. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199008163230705.,"['CA 10819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['N Engl J Med. 1991 Mar 14;324(11):772-5.

The role of these FU analogues as prodrugs was evaluated by comparing metabolism of normal pyrimidine pathways and activation by hepatic mixed function oxidases (MFO). Significant differences in biochemical activity and cytotoxicity were measured between FU and FU analogues. FU and FU analogues were cytotoxic to L1210 cells (63-92% growth inhibition of 100 microM concentrations after 72 hr of incubation). However, at equimolar concentration cytotoxicity of the FU analogues after MFO activation (56-66% growth inhibition) was greater than FU (47% growth inhibition). Hypoxanthine, a purine precursor, did not significantly alter fluoropyrimidine cytotoxicity with or without MFO.

We present in this communication, investigations performed to assess the antitumor activity of Adriamycin (ADR), on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, and the effect of bepridil, a calcium channel blocker on the ADR cytotoxicity. Inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA was used as an index of the cytotoxic effects of drugs when utilised alone or in combination. The combination of bepridil (1 and 5 micrograms/ml) and ADR (5 and 10 micrograms/ml) indicated a significant (P less than 0.001) enhancement in the DNA biosynthesis inhibition in CML cells, as compared to those samples exposed to ADR alone. The observed inhibition of DNA biosynthesis was found to be totally reversible, partially reversible and completely irreversible when the CML cells were exposed to bepridil alone, ADR alone and ADR plus bepridil, respectively. Bepridil was found to be highly lipid soluble at physiological pH, and this property could be responsible for the modulation of the ADR activity observed in this study. Results obtained, though preliminary due to the small sample size, clearly indicate a necessity for a detailed evaluation of bepridil effects, which would lead to higher therapeutic gains in anticancer chemotherapy in the clinic.","['Parekh, H', 'Advani, S', 'Chitnis, M']","['Parekh H', 'Advani S', 'Chitnis M']","['Cellular Chemotherapy Unit, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Sel Cancer Ther,Selective cancer therapeutics,8912502,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '755BO701MA (Bepridil)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Bepridil/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/sct.1990.6.183 [doi]'],ppublish,Sel Cancer Ther. 1990 Winter;6(4):183-91. doi: 10.1089/sct.1990.6.183.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reduced survival was associated with the presence of either single or multiple clonal abnormalities at referral, abnormalities of chromosome 7 or 8 (either alone or with other lesions) and exclusively abnormal metaphases. The presence of 5q- alone did not appear to affect survival. Sequential studies were carried out in 77 patients of whom 12 showed karyotypic evolution. Reduced survival was observed in patients with an evolving karyotype but appeared to be due almost entirely to evolution in those patients whose initial karyotype was normal. Leukaemic transformation occurred more commonly in patients with an abnormal karyotype, particularly those with multiple abnormalities, and in patients with an evolving karyotype. Although the first appearance of an abnormal karyotype or an apparent evolution are important phenomena, it is probable that in some cases they merely represent expansion of a previously existing clone that has escaped detection. The distinction between true karyotypic evolution or clonal expansion and statistical variations due to small sample size and variability of samples may be difficult but needs to be taken into account in considering clinical significance.","['Geddes, A A', 'Bowen, D T', 'Jacobs, A']","['Geddes AA', 'Bowen DT', 'Jacobs A']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07871.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Oct;76(2):194-202. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07871.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used in-vitro clonogenic assays to investigate the mechanism of the eosinophilia in five patients. The mean eosinophil count increased from 0.05 x 10(9)/l before rhIL-2 to 0.98 x 10(9)/l within 48 h of stopping the infusion, and an exponential correlation between the pretreatment lymphocyte CD4:CD8 ratio and the maximum eosinophil count was observed. RhIL-2 did not stimulate eosinophil colony formation by normal bone marrow. However, serum collected from patients during rhIL-2 infusion was a potent stimulator of eosinophil colony forming units (CFU-Eo), but had no significant stimulatory effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM). The CFU-Eo stimulation by pre-treatment serum was 2.8-fold higher than control serum. Serum collected during treatment stimulated CFU-Eo 12 times more than control serum (P less than 0.05). By pre-incubating patient serum, collected during rhIL-2 treatment, with monoclonal antibodies to murine IL-5, or human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a reduction of 80% and 38% respectively in eosinophil and GM colony production was found. The CFU-Eo stimulating effect of patient serum was in the range of the CFU-Eo stimulating effect of normal serum, after the addition of 5 u/ml of recombinant murine IL-5. The results suggest that eosinophilia was caused by IL-5 and GM-CSF production by rhIL-2 stimulated CD4 positive lymphocytes. The location on chromosomes 5 of the genes for IL-5, GM-CSF and IL-3 may be associated with regulation of expression, by a common mechanism, of all the factors known to be involved in eosinophil production. This mechanism may be activated by IL-2 stimulation. The separate location on chromosome 17 of the G-CSF gene may explain the ability of IL-2 to produce a distinct stimulus to eosinophil but not neutrophil production.","['Macdonald, D', 'Gordon, A A', 'Kajitani, H', 'Enokihara, H', 'Barrett, A J']","['Macdonald D', 'Gordon AA', 'Kajitani H', 'Enokihara H', 'Barrett AJ']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Eosinophilia/*chemically induced/immunology', 'Eosinophils/cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-5/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07867.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Oct;76(2):168-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07867.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated cellular stiffening of several types of leukocytes using a method which measures the force resisting cellular indentation. We have found that lymphocytes stiffen in response to crosslinking cell surface antigens in a process associated with the much studied capping and patching processes. Further studies of myosin-deficient mutants of the ameba Dictyostelium discoideum suggest that this stiffening process results from a myosin dependent contractile process. Rat basophilic leukemia cells and pancreatic islet cells stiffen when triggered to secrete. The function of these cytoskeleton dependent processes is now unknown, but, at least in the islet cells, may be related to a regulation of the rate of secretion. Primary neutrophils stiffen in response to the chemotactic agent, fMet-Leu-Phe. This stiffening may be responsible for retention of these cells in the pulmonary microcirculation during response to inflammation.

The combined use of both substances results in a more prolonged and pronounced inhibition of DNA-metabolism by inhibiting thymidylate-synthase (TS) activity. This effect is caused by stabilisation of the ternary complex of 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), TS and N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2FH4). The influence of the combined treatment with 5-FU and LCV has been studied on permanently growing human lymphoblastoid cells. Two different methods were used: a) Tritium-release-assay for measurement of TS activity; b) incorporation of 3H-deoxyuridine (3H-dUR) and 3H-thymidine (3H-dTR) into the DNA for determination of the intrinsic nucleoside pools. The results with both methods were similar. Neither with sequential nor with simultaneous application of both substances was it possible to demonstrate a significantly increased substances was it possible to demonstrate a significantly increased inhibition of TS as compared with 5-FU alone. The methods demonstrated are easy to perform and permit the biochemical characterisation of cell populations in which the combination of LCV + 5-FU is not more effective than 5-FU alone.

The retrovirus-induced tumors comprise above all T- and B-cell leukemias/lymphomas, chronic myelogenous leukemia and mammary carcinomas, and are characterized by a long latent period between infection and manifestation of the disease. Since their detection, oncogenic retroviruses have been the object of intense study contributing to our knowledge of basic mechanisms and molecular events involved in carcinogenesis in general. An essential step in the retrovirus life cycle is the covalent integration of the double-stranded DNA copy of viral RNA into the cellular genome, forming the provirus. The proviruses are quite stable and are generally a permanent acquisition for the cellular genome. Therefore, the presence of the provirus can have profound genetic implications for the host cell. There are at least three main routes that are assumed to lead to retroviral oncogenesis: Transduction of cell-derived oncogenes (v-onc) carried by some retroviruses, activation of cellular proto-oncogenes (c-onc) in cis by insertional mutation or activation of cellular genes in trans by virus encoded transcription factors.","['Leib-Mosch, C', 'Brack-Werner, R', 'Salmons, B', 'Schmidt, J', 'Strauss, P G', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Erfle, V']","['Leib-Mosch C', 'Brack-Werner R', 'Salmons B', 'Schmidt J', 'Strauss PG', 'Hehlmann R', 'Erfle V']","['III.

The allogeneic procedure is the transfer of bone marrow between compatible siblings, whereas in autografting the patient's own haematopoietic stem cells are collected, stored, and subsequently reinfused. Both forms have become established in the treatment of the leukaemias, aplastic anaemia, the malignant lymphomas, myeloma and certain immunologic diseases. Similarly, these techniques are being used in solid tumour oncology to reconstitute bone marrow function after high doses of chemotherapy, which would otherwise result in irreversible myelotoxicity. The success of such programmes depends upon a well developed multidisciplinary approach, prominently involving experienced and dedicated nursing staff. The latter individuals will establish contact with the patient typically during the first admission for chemotherapy and this will be consolidated during subsequent outpatient visits. Then follows the highly specialised care of central venous lines and management of radiation or chemotherapy-related side effects, often with intensive care needed for safe reversal of sepsis that may, however, be associated with renal or cardiorespiratory dysfunction.

Additional interaction is also necessary with dieticians, social workers, liaison psychiatrists, occupational therapists and frequently the infectious disease, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal services.

The availability of large amounts of recombinant highly purified cytokines now allows clinicians to explore the possible therapeutic use of these molecules. Some of these cytokines (such as interferons, ""tumor necrosis factor"" and interleukin-2) have been widely shown to exert antitumor effects in animal model systems and are now used in clinical trials to treat cancer patients. However, the mechanisms of these antitumor effects are poorly understood. In view of their multiple biological properties it appears very important to define suitable experimental systems for studying the antitumor effects of cytokines. In fact, one of the major problems facing researchers involved in the cytokine field is to evaluate the relevance of the different biological effects observed in in vitro cell systems with respect to the antitumor effects observed in vivo. Tumor bearing-mice injected with transplantable tumor cells can represent unique, preclinical, experimental systems to study the mechanisms of antitumor action of cytokines. In fact, only by combining the information derived from in vitro cell systems with data obtained from suitable animal models it is possible to achieve relevant insights on the mechanisms of antitumor action of cytokines. Such in vitro and in vivo studies should represent a basic support for a better use of cytokines in clinical trials with cancer patients. In this article we review the major mouse models for studying the mechanisms of antitumor action of cytokines. Furthermore, we briefly summarize our data on the antitumor effects of cytokines in mice injected with transplantable Friend leukemia cells and we discuss the advantages and the disadvantages in choosing specific animal models for studying the antitumor effects of cytokines.","['Ciolli, V', 'Sestili, P', 'Brigato, M', 'Gabriele, L', 'Varano, F', 'Locardi, C', 'Belardelli, F']","['Ciolli V', 'Sestili P', 'Brigato M', 'Gabriele L', 'Varano F', 'Locardi C', 'Belardelli F']","['Laboratorio di Virologia, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Ann Ist Super Sanita,Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,7502520,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Research Design', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Ist Super Sanita. 1990;26(3-4):441-51.,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate IL-5-mediated intracellular mechanisms, we have established IL-5-dependent and -independent murine early B cell lines, J6 and MJ88-1, respectively, and examined the effect of IL-5 on the expression of proto-oncogenes during proliferation. Two- to 3.5-fold increases in the levels of c-myb, c-myc, c-fos, and c-fms mRNA were observed in J6 cells, compared with those in MJ88-1 cells. Further, a role of IL-5 in the proto-oncogene expression during differentiation was examined by using thymidine-treated murine B-cell chronic leukemia BCL1-B20 cells with growth arrest. After 4-day culture, the amount of IgM secreted from BCL1-B20 cells was augmented 4-6 fold in the presence of IL-5. Although expression of c-myb, c-fos, and c-fms mRNA did not change, only c-myc mRNA expression was elevated within 30 min of stimulation with IL-5 and reached a maximal level by 1 hr. Addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or IL-4 to the culture of BCL1-B20 cells inhibited both the IL-5-mediated augmentation of IgM secretion and the elevated expression of c-myc mRNA.

Actin polymerization has been considered to be essential for locomotion of cells, chemotaxis and chemokinesis, and thus it reflects the chemotactic reaction of EoL-1 cells stimulated by PAF. Unstimulated EoL-1 cells showed little PAF-induced actin polymerization, whereas EoL-1 cells cultured for 9 days with the supernatant of a human ATL cell line, HIL-3 (HIL-3 sup), showed marked actin polymerization when stimulated with PAF. The actin polymerization in EoL-1 cells induced by PAF was seen in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10(-10) M to 10(-6) M of PAF, and the maximum effect was seen at 10(-7) M of PAF. CV-3988, a specific antagonist of PAF, inhibited 80% of the actin polymerization in EoL-1 cells induced by PAF at a concentration of 10(-5) M. Ketotifen inhibited up to 40% of the PAF-induced actin polymerization of EoL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10(-9) M to 10(-5) M.

To examine the effects of these synthetic retinoids on limb pattern formation, AG1-X2 beads containing these retinoids were applied to the anterior margin of stage 19-20 chick wing buds. By implanting the beads with 1 microgram/ml retinoids, normal wings were formed and extra digits 2 or 32 were rarely formed. As the retinoid concentrations increased from 10 micrograms/ml to 100 micrograms/ml duplicated limbs 3234, 43234, 432234, 4334 were progressively produced. At higher concentrations, 1 mg/ml, the wings often truncated, although duplication occurred in some embryos. These synthetic analogs seem to have the same degree of morphogenetic potential as RA, since the activity index of these retinoids was similar to that of RA. Since these synthetic retinoids hardly bind to CRABP (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein), it may be possible that the retinoids and RA may affect limb-pattern formation without the interaction with CRABP. It is known that limb buds cannot develop distal structures when the posterior region including all ZPA (zone of polarizing activity) is removed. When beads containing the above mentioned retinoids were implanted to the anterior margin of wing buds from which the posterior one third region including all ZPA had been removed, distal growth of the wing buds and the formation of digit elements were observed. Some of the wing buds produced a completely reverse digit pattern 432. From these results, we discussed the roles of RA in limb development and pattern formation.","['Tamura, K', 'Kagechika, H', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Shudo, K', 'Ohsugi, K', 'Ide, H']","['Tamura K', 'Kagechika H', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Shudo K', 'Ohsugi K', 'Ide H']","['Biological Institute, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cell Differ Dev,Cell differentiation and development : the official journal of the International Society of Developmental Biologists,8811335,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', '102121-60-8 (Am 580)', '5S5A2Q39HX (Chalcone)', ""95906-67-5 (3,5-di-tert-butylchalcone 4'-carboxylic acid)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Chalcone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Chalcones', 'Chick Embryo', 'Extremities/embryology', 'Morphogenesis/*drug effects', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/*pharmacology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0922-3371(90)90095-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Differ Dev. 1990 Oct;32(1):17-26. doi: 10.1016/0922-3371(90)90095-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such advances include the primary structures of the IL-3 proteins, the nucleotide sequences of the IL-3 genes, and the elucidation of the retroviral insertion that resulted in constitutive synthesis of IL-3 by the leukemic cell line WEHI-3B. These advances have facilitated studies of the control of IL-3 gene expression in normal and malignant cells, which is an ongoing area of interest. The use of the cloned IL-3 gene in a retroviral expression vector has allowed the generation of experimental autocrine leukemias from IL-3-dependent cell lines. The use of recombinant rat, mouse, and human IL-3 has verified that IL-3 is a multilineage hemopoietic regulator in each of these species. Although it is clear that in each of the above species IL-3 promotes the growth of a wide variety of myeloid progenitors, the regulation of stem-cell division and maturation by IL-3 and its synergism with other regulators requires clarification and remains an active area of research. The discovery that hemopoietic stem cells from certain murine strains do not proliferate in response to IL-3 alone has provided a model system in which to analyze the synergistic activities of IL-3. It will be interesting to see whether analogous differences in the responsiveness of stem cells to IL-3 also exist in humans. Our work on the ontogeny of blood cell development in embryonic and fetal mice indicates that in every strain, early hemopoietic progenitor cells respond to IL-3 plus M-CSF, or to IL-3 plus IL-4, rather than to IL-3, M-CSF, or IL-4 alone. The difficulties encountered in acquiring sufficient cells to work with from embryonic sources could possibly be overcome by developing a fetal sheep model in which access to the embryo and fetus can be achieved at several sequential points in development. It may then be possible to determine the molecular events that regulate primitive stem-cell responsiveness to IL-3 as well as other hemopoietic cytokines. Recombinant IL-3 proteins should continue to prove valuable in further biological studies of IL-3, in the generation of monoclonal antibodies against IL-3, and for further studies of the IL-3 receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Morris, C F', 'Young, I G', 'Hapel, A J']","['Morris CF', 'Young IG', 'Hapel AJ']","['John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Ser,Immunology series,0404721,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hylobates', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunol Ser. 1990;49:177-214.,,,144,,,,,,,,,,,,

The light-exposed MC540 was then mixed (in the dark) with tumor cells and normal cells to determine the antiproliferative activity. Treatment with light-exposed MC540 resulted in 70-90% tumor cell kill from different cell lines, while 85% of the normal human mononuclear cells and 41% of the granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (CFU-GM) survived the treatment. The observed cytotoxicity of light-exposed MC540 to the tumor cells was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than the native MC540. Results show that tumor cell specificity and cytotoxicity in the light activated dye are retained for at least 30 days. Addition of catalase and mannitol decreased the cell kill by light-exposed compound, indicating that the observed effects may be due to reactive oxygen species. The electron micrographs of treated cells show a progression towards apoptosis in a majority of the cells. The life span of L1210 leukemia-bearing mice treated with light-exposed MC540 was prolonged compared to the untreated and native MC540 treated mice. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of light-exposed material shows a completely different elution profile compared to the native compound. Results presented here show that light-exposed photoactive compounds can be used without further illumination and may have significant clinical applications. Photoactive mechanisms dependent on events other than short-lived transient elevations in energy or singlet oxygen must be invoked to explain the reported cytotoxicity.","['Gulliya, K S', 'Pervaiz, S', 'Dowben, R M', 'Matthews, J L']","['Gulliya KS', 'Pervaiz S', 'Dowben RM', 'Matthews JL']","['Baylor Research Foundation, Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology/*radiation effects/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*pathology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1990.tb08689.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1990 Oct;52(4):831-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1990.tb08689.x.,['HL 43421/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agricultural workers generally show a lower cancer mortality compared with other occupational categories. This observation is currently believed to be due to lower cigarette consumption. However, for some types of tumours (lymphoma, leukaemia, myeloma, soft tissue sarcoma, skin, prostate, brain and stomach tumours), mortality is higher among agricultural workers. The only chemical substances used in agriculture for which the IARC Monographs have established the existence of sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity for man are arsenical compounds and mineral oils; for other substances there is clear evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals, mostly in the absence of human data. In the case of exposure to phenoxyacetic herbicides, the available epidemiological evidence is contradictory, with excesses of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma reported in some studies but not in others. Cohort studies have been performed among insecticide production workers and spray operators (with excesses of lung tumour), and among grain processing workers (with excesses of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in particular). A number of case-control studies are also available, especially concerning tumours of the lymphatic and haemopoietic systems and ovarian tumours.","['Vineis, P', 'Settimi, L', 'Seniori Costantini, A']","['Vineis P', 'Settimi L', 'Seniori Costantini A']","['Servizio di Epidemiologia dei Tumori, Ospedale Maggiore, Universita di Torino.']",['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Pesticides)', '8020-83-5 (Mineral Oil)']",IM,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced"", 'Animals', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Herbicides/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mineral Oil/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 1990 Sep-Oct;81(5):363-72.,,,,,,Esposizione a fitofarmaci e rischio oncogeno.,,,,,,,,,

Antibodies WM-63 and WM-68 were derived after immunization of mice with human T-CLL cells and the leukaemic cell line HSB-2. Both antibodies were shown to react with over 90 per cent of normal T and B lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tonsil, and also with monocytes from peripheral blood. A subset of bone marrow leucocytes, including granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, were also reactive. No activity with non-haemopoietic cells or tissues could be identified, however WM-63 and WM-68 showed binding to virtually all cases of chronic B cell malignancy, including chronic lymphatic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as a proportion of cases of acute leukaemia. Although the antigen recognized by these antibodies could not be immunoprecipitated from membrane extracts, it was removed from the surface of intact cells using the proteolytic enzymes protease and papain. Re-expression on cultured cells was inhibited by incubation with puromycin, cycloheximide, and tunicamycin, indicating that the epitopes detected by WM-63 and WM-68 are likely to be carbohydrate moieties on a protein backbone. Removal of the antigen from the cell surface by treatment with the enzyme phosphatidyl-inositol phospholipase C indicates that it is linked by a phosphatidyl-inositol bond. WM-63 and WM-68 were both recently clustered at the Fourth International Workshop on Human Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens into CD-48, together with four other monoclonal antibodies. Although no biological function has been ascribed to the molecule detected by these antibodies, its restriction to the haemopoietic lineage suggests a role in regulation of leucocyte function.","['Henniker, A J', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Grimsley, P', 'Atkinson, M K']","['Henniker AJ', 'Bradstock KF', 'Grimsley P', 'Atkinson MK']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD48 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'CD48 Antigen', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dis Markers. 1990 Jul-Aug;8(4):179-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of the RRE mutants indicated that Rev and RevBL bind to the same target within the RRE in vitro and in vivo. In vivo experiments demonstrated that RevBL did not increase the steady-state levels of HIV-1 mRNA or protein. These experiments suggested that additional cellular factors interacting with Rev but not with RevBL are necessary for function. The Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is similar to Rev and acts through a sequence named Rex-responsive element (RXRE) located in the long terminal repeat of HTLV-I. We examined the function of RevBL on a hybrid mRNA molecule containing both the RRE and RXRE. While RevBL prevented Rev function, it did not affect Rex function on the mRNA containing either the RXRE or both the RRE and RXRE. Therefore, binding of RevBL to the RRE had neither positive nor negative effects on the mRNA, since this mRNA could be efficiently utilized in the presence of a functional Rex-RXRE interaction. The results obtained in vivo and in vitro strongly suggest that RevBL inhibits Rev function by binding to the same site as Rev and preventing Rev binding and function.","['Benko, D M', 'Robinson, R', 'Solomin, L', 'Mellini, M', 'Felber, B K', 'Pavlakis, G N']","['Benko DM', 'Robinson R', 'Solomin L', 'Mellini M', 'Felber BK', 'Pavlakis GN']","['ABL-Basic Research Program, National Cancer Institute-FCRDC, MD 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,New Biol,The New biologist,9000976,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/*genetics', '*Genes, rev', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', '*RNA, Viral', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,New Biol. 1990 Dec;2(12):1111-22.,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The receptor for IL-5 has been identified as two cross-linked complexes on T88-M cells (a murine IL-5-dependent early B cell line). In this study the IL-5 receptor was directly characterized by utilizing an immobilized IL-5 column and a rat monoclonal antibody, designated H7, directed against the IL-5 receptor. H7 completely inhibited specific binding of 35S-labeled IL-5 to T88-M cells, and bound to IL-5-responsive cells, e.g. T88-M, BCL1-B20 (a chronic B-cell leukemia), and MOPC104E (a myeloma), whereas H7 did not bind to IL-5-non-responsive cells, e.g. X5563 (a myeloma), FDC-P1 (an IL-3-dependent line), and MTH (an IL-2-dependent CTLL). H7 could barely bind to T88-M cells in the presence of IL-5, and immunoprecipitated a major band with an Mr of approximately 60 kd from the extract of surface-radioiodinated T88-M cells. The precipitation of this 60 kd molecule was inhibited by the addition of IL-5. Analysis with immobilized IL-5 also revealed that a 60 kd molecule bound specifically to IL-5-coupled beads compared with control beads. Furthermore, no additional molecule with a higher Mr that was recognized by H7 appeared under non-reducing, compared with reducing, conditions.

After 5 days in culture, in several separate experiments with different oligomer preparations, more than 90% growth inhibition was observed in c-myb antisense-treated HL60 cells. At this time, independent of the differentiation inducer used, c-myb antisense-treated HL60 cells differentiate only along the monocytic pathway, whereas in sense oligomer-treated cultures, retinoic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide induced granulocytic differentiation. No perturbation of the HL60 cell growth was observed after 5 days of treatment with antisense c-fes oligomer. However, induction to granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide resulted in progressive cell death, whereas monocytic differentiation by other differentiation inducers was only marginally affected.

The embryos into which we injected supercoiled plasmid DNA of pFb(-860/+10)CAT containing the Bombyx fibroin promoter region ligated to the CAT gene showed a reasonably high CAT activity beginning around 30 h after oviposition. This high activity was observed only when the plasmid was injected before termination of the early nuclear cleavage stage, which was about 8 h after oviposition, but not after this stage. This means that the expression of injected DNA is closely related to the presence of cleavage nuclei in early embryos. Promoters originating from insect genes, like the Bombyx sericin-1 gene, Drosophila hsp70 and Drosophila copia LTR, functioned as strong promoters in the embryos. On the contrary, promoters from mammalian virus genes, such as the SV40 early and Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR genes, functioned as weak promoters. Moreover, linearized DNAs showed no or weak activity of expression in embryos.

The overall actuarial survival was 50% at 5 years. In multivariate analyses, the probability of relapse correlated with the phase of the disease, the method of total body irradiation, the T cell depletion of the marrow and the occurrence of a chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The probability of survival was better for patients with grade 0-1 GVHD than for patients with grade 2-4 GVHD. In contrast, the probability of disease-free survival was significantly better for patients who received a non-T cell-depleted marrow than for recipients of T cell-depleted marrow.

The antitumor effect was confined to the subcellular particle fraction of this bacterium and was associated with a molecule of glycoprotein nature (40,000-38,000 Daltons) isolated from this fraction by affinity chromatography with concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. This substance exerted mitogenic activity on C3H/HeJ splenocytes and T cells, stimulatory activity on macrophages, and further exhibited antitumor effect on P388 leukemia in CDF1 mice. The Winn assay disclosed that the antitumor effect induced by this substance was dependent on L3T4+ T cells. Furthermore, both the mitogenic and antitumor activity of this moiety were resistant to heating at 100 degrees C for 30 min or RNase digestion, but sensitive to trypsin digestion, or low or high pH. These results indicate that the antitumor effect of C. kutscheri is attributable to the heat-stable glycoprotein moiety which can directly stimulate T cells and macrophages.","['Kita, E', 'Emoto, M', 'Oku, D', 'Hamuro, A', 'Nishikawa, F', 'Tanikawa, I', 'Yasui, K', 'Katsui, N', 'Kashiba, S']","['Kita E', 'Emoto M', 'Oku D', 'Hamuro A', 'Nishikawa F', 'Tanikawa I', 'Yasui K', 'Katsui N', 'Kashiba S']","['Department of Bacteriology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul,Natural immunity and cell growth regulation,8407979,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Corynebacterium/analysis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Weight', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul. 1990;9(6):387-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRC- and CRC-/NL cells were utilized to study pathways of NK activation by phorbol esters, calcium ionophore (A23187), and monoclonal antibody (mAb). 10(-6)-10(-7) M phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) but not phorbol didecanoate or 4-beta-phorbol activated CRC-/NL to lyse YAC-1 targets. Activated CRC-/NL cells produced 20-90% specific cytotoxicity compared to 0-5% for nonactivated cells. 10(-7) M PMA inhibited normal CRC- cytotoxicity. The optimum concentration of PMA for activation was 10(-6)-10(-7) M and 3-6 h treatment time. Augmentation of cytotoxicity by PMA occurred at different E:T ratios. The time required to reverse the PMA activation of CRC-/NL cells was approximately 9-10 h posttreatment. In an effort to attempt to differentiate pathways which initiated activation, CRC-/NL cells were treated with FAM binding mAb, or with combinations of mAb and ionophore, mAb and PMA, or PMA and A23187. mAb singly or in combination with 10(-7) M PMA increased cytotoxicity. However, A23187 either singly or when combined with PMA or mAb did not produce an augmented lysis of YAC-1 target cells. Additional experiments were conducted to determine if PMA activation was associated with FAM binding. This was accomplished by analyzing redirected killing of various FAM mAb-producing myeloma cells in the presence of 10(-7) M PMA. PMA treatment of the CRC-/NL cells caused a significant increase in the lysis of myeloma/mAb-producing cells compared to control cells. Further evidence that FAM binding was associated with cytotoxicity was presented by demonstrating specific inhibition of redirected lysis by homologous mAb. Phenotype analysis of CRC- and CRC-/NL cells demonstrated that OX-7 and OX-1 expression on CRC-/NL cells was increased by 71.8 and 86.8% respectively compared to CRC-. FAM expression (78-83% positives) by CRC- and CRC-/NL cells was not different. These experiments indicated at the functional level that rat NK cells can be activated for increased cytotoxicity by FAM-specific mAb binding and/or by treatment with the diacylglycerol analogue PMA. This implies that protein kinase C mobilization either singly or in concert with inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate activation following FAM mAb binding may play important roles in NK cell cytotoxicity.","['Evans, D L', 'Harris, D T', 'Staton, D L', 'Jaso-Friedmann, L']","['Evans DL', 'Harris DT', 'Staton DL', 'Jaso-Friedmann L']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul,Natural immunity and cell growth regulation,8407979,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*immunology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul. 1990;9(6):353-65.,"['CA 47338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 48085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Highly conserved regions called src homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3), comprising amino acid residues 88 to 250, are believed to modulate the protein-tyrosine kinase activity present in the carboxy-terminal halves of the src proteins. To explore the functions of these regions more fully, we have introduced deletion mutations within the amino-terminal half of p56lyn, a member of the src-related family of the protein tyrosine kinases. These mutant alleles were expressed under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat in the vector plasmid pZip-neo-SV(X) to examine the biochemical and biological properties of the mutant proteins after introduction into NIH3T3 cells and WEHI-231(immature B-cell line). No mutant proteins induced transformed foci in NIH3T3 transfectants. Deletional mutant affecting residues 163 to 234 (lyn-dC) impaired kinase activity severely and residues 35 to 60 (lyn-dV), to the lesser extent. In WEHI-231 transfectants, we could also found the inhibition of kinase activity with deletions of residues 163 to 234 (lyn-dC) and 35 to 60 (lyn-dV). WEHI-231 transfectant with lyn-dC, named WE-C was induced lesser growth arrest by crosslinking membrane IgM compared with wild type (wt) WEHI-231 cells.

Both WB detected antibody to proteins encoded by 2 different genes: antibody to gag products were revealed equally by both WB, but commercialized WB detected antibody to tax protein whereas the 'in-house' WB detected antibody to env protein (gp46) more efficiently. The second part of the work, conducted with 158 African sera, compared results of an 'in-house' virus lysate WB and RIPA. Our data show a perfect concordance between the two procedures when sera were clearly positive by WB (gag + env reaction). Sera reacting to p19 and p24 (both gag) by WB were confirmed positive by RIPA in 75% of the cases. The majority of the indeterminate WB profiles not confirmed by RIPA presented isolated gag reactivity (p15 or p19 or p24).","['Verdier, M', 'Leonard, G', 'Sangare, A', 'Prince-David, M', 'Bonis, J', 'Barin, F', 'Denis, F']","['Verdier M', 'Leonard G', 'Sangare A', 'Prince-David M', 'Bonis J', 'Barin F', 'Denis F']","['Laboratoire de Virologie, CHU Dupuytren, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['*Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*diagnosis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Pregnancy', '*Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166-0934(90)90070-V [pii]', '10.1016/0166-0934(90)90070-v [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1990 Dec;30(3):283-9. doi: 10.1016/0166-0934(90)90070-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cognitive functioning in 30 adult allogeneic BMT patients (mean of 47 months post-BMT) treated for either acute or chronic leukemia was assessed by two standardized self-report questionnaires. Consistent with hypothesis, results of both univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that increased dose of TBI was associated with increased cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, this relationship remained even after the impact of psychological distress upon cognitive functioning was accounted for. TBI-related cognitive impairment primarily involved slowed reaction time, reduced attention and concentration, and difficulties in reasoning and problem-solving. These results complement previous findings of an inverse association between dose of TBI and self-perceptions of health and physical functioning in BMT survivors and indicate the importance of including quality of life measures in clinical trials of therapeutic innovations in the field of BMT.","['Andrykowski, M A', 'Altmaier, E M', 'Barnett, R L', 'Burish, T G', 'Gingrich, R', 'Henslee-Downey, P J']","['Andrykowski MA', 'Altmaier EM', 'Barnett RL', 'Burish TG', 'Gingrich R', 'Henslee-Downey PJ']","['Department of Behavioral Science, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington 40536-0086.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Oct;6(4):269-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three of these cases, a complete cytogenetic response was confirmed at the DNA level by Southern blotting, but specific amplification of the BCR/ABL junction by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), performed in two cases, still showed residual disease.

After incubation for 24 h, IL-2 enhanced the intracellular tissue factor 15-fold with U937 cells, and GM-CSF enhanced it 6-fold. In contrast, other lymphokines, such as IL-1-alpha, IL-1-beta, IL-3, IL-4 and G-CSF, did not affect the activity of tissue factor. The leukemic blasts, depleted of T-lymphocytes, taken from five out of 16 AML patients showed a 2.5-14-fold increase in the activity of tissue factor per cell following incubation with 200 u/ml of IL-2 for 72 h. The IL-2 induced tissue factor activity more markedly than GM-CSF. Tissue factor stimulation by IL-2 did not correlate with the expression of the IL-2 receptor, Tac, but correlated well with FAB classification of AML cells. IL-2 responders were found in M4 and M5 subtypes only, but not all M4/M5 leukemias responded to IL-2. These findings indicate that IL-2 can mediate the tissue factor induction in the monocytic type of AML and the effect is not mediated by Tac receptors. This may shed a new light on our understanding of hypercoagulability in acute monoblastic leukemia.","['Tanaka, M', 'Kishi, T']","['Tanaka M', 'Kishi T']","['Nagoya National Hospital, Department of Clinical Research, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08977199009011004 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 1990;4(1):1-8. doi: 10.3109/08977199009011004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nature of the paramagnetic ions involved was not determined. In the present communication, we report results of analysis of the contents of three biologically prominent paramagnetic ions (manganese, iron and copper) in 9 normal mouse tissues (brain, heart, small intestine, kidney, liver, lung, voluntary muscle, spleen and stomach); one strain of rat cancer cells (As-30, rat hepatoma); and 6 strains of mouse cancer cells (Ehrlich mammary adenocarcinoma, LSA lymphoma, Krebs carcinoma of the inguinal region; sarcoma 180; Klein TA3 mammary adenocarcinoma; P815 mast cell leukemia). Our data indicate that manganese and iron are by far the two most important paramagnetic ions contributing to the diversity of NMR relaxation times. The average manganese content of all the normal mouse tissues studied (29.6 +/- 4.99 mu mole/kg) is 24 times higher than the average manganese contents of all the cancer cells studied (1.22 +/- 0.27 mu moles/kg) and there is essentially no overlap between the two groups of data. The average iron content of the normal mouse tissues (281.6 +/- 51.2 mumoles/kg) is 4 times the average in cancer cells (66.7 +/- 7.74 mumoles/kg) but there is some overlap here. The observed differences in both the manganese and iron contents are statistically highly significant, with P's below 0.0001. The copper contents of the cancer cells is lower than the average of normal mouse tissues but only by some 20%.

Parallel investigations were undertaken on three surgically resected traumatically ruptured (but otherwise normal) spleens and three spleens removed at autopsy from accident victims. 1) Up to ten weeks after BMT, the splenic lymphoid tissue was extremely atrophic. Lymphoid follicles (LFs) and periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths (PALS) were completely absent. A considerable increase in lymphoid cells in the red pulp and formation of small LFs and PALS occurred only in the longest surviving patient, who had died 50 weeks after BMT. 2) B cells (L26+, 4KB5+, Ki-B3+) were almost completely absent in the early post-transplantation period and thus T cells (UCHL1+) represented the major constituent of the hypoplastic splenic lymphoid tissue. Considerable numbers of T cells were already found two weeks after BMT. T-immune-accessory reticulum cells (S-100 protein+) were found in the PALS of the controls, but were absent in three of the BMT recipients. The findings clearly reflect the marked immunodeficiency in the early post-transplantation period, during which many patients (4/7 in this study) die of opportunistic infections, and are in line with the fact that the earliest signs of reconstitution of the immune system have been found to occur at three months post-transplantation. Since six of our BMT recipients had suffered from graft-versus-host disease our findings probably do not fully correspond to those when the immune system undergoes undisturbed reconstitution.","['Horny, H P', 'Ruck, M', 'Kaiserling, E', 'Ehninger, G']","['Horny HP', 'Ruck M', 'Kaiserling E', 'Ehninger G']","['Department of Special Histo- and Cytopathology, Eberhard-Karis University, Tubingen, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Atrophy/pathology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(11)80269-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80269-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1990 Dec;186(6):775-83. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80269-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the treatment of sensitive tumors (Gross leukemia and Lewis lung tumor) the complex provided efficacy comparable to that of doxorubicin. Among resistant models, only P388/DX, which is only weakly responsive to cisplatin itself, showed significant sensitivity to the platinum complex. Since all resistant tumors were transplanted in the same site (s.c.) of the same mouse strain, it is likely that the different tumor response reflects different underlying mechanisms of cell resistance rather than alterations in pharmacologic behavior of the anthracycline after covalent binding to platinum. The data reported in this preclinical study support the potential value of this approach to overcome selected manifestations of resistance to anthracyclines. In contrast to the highly toxic doxorubicin/cisplatin combination, doxorubicin complexation with platinum was not associated to an increase in toxicity.","['Zunino, F', 'Pratesi, G', 'Formelli, F', 'Pasini, A']","['Zunino F', 'Pratesi G', 'Formelli F', 'Pasini A']","['Division of Experimental Oncology B, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '107283-77-2 (cis-(platinum-dichloro(doxorubicin)(tert-butylamine)))', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Investigational/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00198589 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1990 Nov;8(4):341-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00198589.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probability maps of childhood cancer in the West Midlands Health Authority region.,853-9,"The West Midlands Regional Children's Tumour Registry collects detailed information on all cases of childhood cancer in the West Midlands Health Authority Region (WMHAR). The distribution by electoral ward of all cases diagnosed in the WMHAR between 1980 and 1984 has been determined. Analysis has also been performed for leukaemias/non-Hodgkin's lymphomas alone. We suggest that this latter grouping should be universally employed, owing to the difficulty of accurately separating out cases of leukaemia. Both spatial analyses showed several wards with significantly excessive rates on the basis of their cumulative Poison probability. Observed/expected ratios of 3-35 were seen for cases in significant wards, which are similar to the ratios seen in analysis of incidence around nuclear installations. However, further detailed consideration of these individual significance levels in the light of the number of statistically significant wards which would occur by chance alone, due to the multiple use of the test, accounted completely for the number of wards obtained in each of the groups considered. Thus, apparent 'clustering' of cases could be mere statistical artefact. In the WMHAR, therefore, using the technique of probability mapping, no true spatial pattern of incidence was found, other than that which would occur by chance alone. This, in a large area without nuclear installations and an even mix of rural and industrialised regions, could be seen as control data for those studies which have considered cases of childhood leukaemia around nuclear facilities, where the observation of single point clusters associated with suspected sites restricts assessments of spatial pattern in the rest of the area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Muir, K R', 'Parkes, S E', 'Mann, J R', 'Stevens, M C', 'Cameron, A H', 'Raafat, F', 'Darbyshire, P J', 'Ingram, D R', 'Davis, A', 'Gascoigne, D']","['Muir KR', 'Parkes SE', 'Mann JR', 'Stevens MC', 'Cameron AH', 'Raafat F', 'Darbyshire PJ', 'Ingram DR', 'Davis A', 'Gascoigne D']","[""West Midlands Regional Children's Tumour Registry, Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Probability', 'Registries']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/19.4.853 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1990 Dec;19(4):853-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/19.4.853.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibodies recognizing human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus I (HTLV-I) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) core proteins were found in 12 of 14 MF patients as shown by the Western blot method. The antibody reactivities showed three patterns: three patients had antibodies cross-reacting with the gag-encoded core proteins of both HTLV-I and HIV-1; seven patients showed antibodies reacting with HTLV-I core proteins only; and the sera of two patients reacted with HIV p24 core protein only. When following the clinical course of these patients, we found that the three patients with antibodies cross-reacting with both viruses had the most fulminant clinical course, and the overall duration of MF was, on average, 4 years less than in the rest of the patients. None of the patients, however, became leukaemic, or showed any other features suggestive of acute T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL). Two patients, who did not show anti-retroviral antibodies during the follow-up, had a stable disease with plaque-type skin lesions. Histological or immunohistological typing of the skin infiltrates did not correlate with the disease outcome or the above antibody patterns. Our results thus raise the possibility that an unknown retrovirus, immunologically related to the known human retroviruses, may be aetiologically linked to MF.","['Ranki, A', 'Niemi, K M', 'Nieminen, P', 'Krohn, K']","['Ranki A', 'Niemi KM', 'Nieminen P', 'Krohn K']","['Department of Dermatology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,"['0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",IM,"['Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Female', 'HIV Antibodies/*analysis', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Viral Core Proteins/*immunology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00371949 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 1990;282(8):532-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00371949.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCH granules were recognized as giant eosinophilic granules, measuring up to 5 microns, in the cytoplasm of leukemic cells on smears. At the electron microscope level, most PCH granules were round to oval and outlined by a limiting membrane, and contained homogeneous, granular, crystalloid, rod-like or myelin-like materials. The PCH anomaly was demonstrable in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients, which indicates that the anomaly is not rare in childhood AML M2.

Circulating leukemic cells were observed less frequently in the PCH anomaly-positive group than in the PCH anomaly-negative group (p less than 0.05); the leukemic cells were not demonstrable in three of the five patients in the former group, although they were detected in all 15 patients in the latter group.

With the use of coprecipitation analysis, radiolabeled interleukin-2 cross-linking procedures, and flow cytometric resonance energy transfer measurements, a series of additional peptides of molecular weight 22,000, 35,000, 40,000, 75,000 (non-IL-2 binding), 95,000-105,000, and 180,000 has been associated with the two interleukin-2-binding peptides. In contrast to resting T cells, the abnormal T cells of patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus I-associated adult T-cell leukemia, patients with select autoimmune disorders, and individuals rejecting allografts express the Tac peptide (p55) of the IL-2 receptor. To exploit this difference in Tac antigen expression, we have initiated therapeutic trials using unmodified anti-Tac, conjugates of anti-Tac with truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin PE-40, interleukin-2-truncated toxin fusion proteins, and alpha- and beta-emitting isotopic chelates of anti-Tac. Furthermore, by genetic engineering humanized hyperchimeric anti-Tac molecules have been prepared in which the molecule is entirely human IgG1, except for the small complementarity-determining regions that are retained from the mouse antibody.

All patients with CML were Ph positive, additional chromosomal changes were ascertained in 29% of patients in CP and in 71% of patients in BP. The most frequent chromosomal abnormalities were trisomy 8, additional Ph, (i(17q] and loss of Y chromosome. More favorable course of the disease was observed for group of patients with Ph chromosome as solitary chromosomal abnormality in CP. Acquired chromosomal aberrations were proved in 137 patients with AML (73.3%). Except specific chromosomal changes delineated according to the specific subtype of AML we were concerned with evaluation of nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities, specially those involving chromosome 5 and 7. Numerical and morphological changes of those chromosomes were found in 33 patients (17.6%). In MDS patients abnormal chromosomal clones were found in 68.8% of patients, those involving chromosome 5 and/or 7 in 68 patients (38.8% of all examined). The frequency of these abnormalities in AML does not differ significantly from the results quoted by the other studies. However, in our MDS patients these so called ""mutagen-associated"" chromosome abnormalities were significantly more frequent than in all studies published so far. Prognostic value of cytogenetic examination was evaluated on the basis of cumulative survival of patients with normal and abnormal chromosomal clones present in bone marrow cells.","['Michalova, K', 'Musilova, J', 'Zemanova, Z']","['Michalova K', 'Musilova J', 'Zemanova Z']","['Third Medical Department, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Praha, Czechoslovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Czech Med,Czechoslovak medicine,7805372,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*diagnosis', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Czech Med. 1990;13(4):133-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven of these 10 mice (70%) contained the intact proviral genome in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus. Of these 7,3 mice contained a high-copy number of the provirus in all the hematopoietic tissues tested. The mice contained anywhere from one to four proviral integration sites that were the same in all three tissues, indicating that these mice have been repopulated by one or more transduced multipotential hematopoietic stem cells. Five months after transplantation, bone marrow from the eleventh mouse was transplanted into secondary recipient animals. The secondary recipients contained the intact proviral genome in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and macrophages 4 months after the secondary transplantation. This further supports the conclusion that hematopoietic stem cells have indeed been targeted. Human GCase RNA was detected in all 7 mice containing the proviral DNA.

A continuing increase in the survival time correlated with advances in therapy was observed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), Hodgkin's disease (HD) and multiple myeloma (MM). An indicator of the advances in the treatment of acute leukaemias was also an over fourfold rise in the likelihood of achieving complete remission in the decade 1971-1980 in relation to two preceding decades. On the other hand, no improvement of the effectiveness of treatment was noted in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), polycythaemia vera (PV), myelofibrosis (MF) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL).

Autopsy revealed multiple organ infiltration of monocytoid granulocytes on the patients with advanced stage and more bone marrow blasts. Two cases have coexistence of myeloproliferative disorders, one with essential thrombocythemia, and another with myelofibrosis, which, later, transformed to acute leukemia. And a Group C patient transformed to chronic phase with chemotherapy, and maintained the state for six years, but at the end stage, mature monocytes increased and pancytopenia developed. These findings indicate the heterogeneity of CMMoL in respect of the disease stage and the coexistence of other myeloproliferative disorders.","['Kurata, H', 'Hirai, M', 'Miwa, A', 'Murai, Y', 'Mori, M']","['Kurata H', 'Hirai M', 'Miwa A', 'Murai Y', 'Mori M']","['Department of Hematology, Jichi Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1990 Dec;31(12):1906-13.,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine if BCL1 rearrangement is associated with a particular subtype of lymphoma, we analysed 131 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma samples by Southern blot analysis, using a BCL1 probe. The BCL1 locus was rearranged in 9 out of 25 (36%) cases of intermediate lymphocytic cell lymphomas (ILL), in 1 out of 8 cases of diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma, in 1 out of 12 cases of diffuse mixed cell lymphoma, and in 1 out of 21 cases of diffuse large cell lymphoma. In contrast, BCL1 was never found rearranged in any of the 46 follicular lymphomas analysed. The BCL2 gene was in germ-line configuration in all ILL. Sequential hybridization of Southern blots with JH, C mu, and BCLI probes identified comigrating fragments in only one case of ILL, which suggests that, in all the other cases, either the rearrangement of BCL1 did not result from a t(11;14) translocation or the break on chromosome 14 occurred outside the JH or C mu regions.

We cloned and sequenced the translocation breakpoints on both derivative 10q+ and 14q- chromosomes from a patient with t(10;14)(q24;q11) T-ALL. Two distinct diversity segments of TCRD, D delta 2 and D delta 3, were identified at the two translocation breakpoints on chromosome 14. The 9.5 kb DNA that separates these two subunits in the germline was deleted, possibly in the course of a D-D joining event. The two chromosome 10 breakpoints were 10 nucleotides apart and occurred in the immediate vicinity of a pseudo-heptamer signal motif.

We have isolated human complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding a protein which, when expressed in normally uninfectable mouse NIH3T3 cells, confers on these cells specific sensitivity to infection by GALV. This was done by transfection into mouse cells of human DNA and selection of putative receptor gene transfectants using infection with a retrovirus carrying a drug resistance gene. Transfected genomic sequences were then cloned through their association with repetitive DNA, and these were used to isolate cDNA clones. The predicted 679-amino acid sequence encoded in these cDNAs is characteristic of an integral membrane protein in that multiple potential transmembrane domains are present. Searches of DNA and protein data banks failed to reveal homologies to other known sequences. It thus appears that the sequence isolated is novel and represents the human receptor for GALV.

Protocol 1 (18 patients) consisted of an intensive four-drug induction therapy (daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone), CNS prophylaxis (cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate), and continuous maintenance with methotrexate and mercaptopurine for three years, with periodical reinductions with vincristine and prednisone. Protocol 2 (13 patients) included a similar induction regimen (doxorubicin instead of daunorubicin, dexamethasone instead of prednisone), followed by post-remission intensification with alternating courses of non-cross-resistant agents (amsacrine and high dose cytarabine; vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin; etoposide and conventional dose cytarabine) given in a cyclical eight-month program. CNS prophylaxis consisted of intrathecal methotrexate and systemic high-dose cytarabine. The patient characteristics of the two therapy groups were comparable. The complete remission (CR) rate for both groups was 77%, with a median overall and relapse-free survival of 18 and 29 months, respectively. The three-year overall survival of complete remitters was 59%. No correlation was found between CR rate and age, mediastinal, or bone marrow involvement. Stage I disease had a significantly higher CR rate (100%) than did stages II-IV (64%). Leukemic evolution occurred in 32% of cases, within a median time of 11 months from diagnosis; meningeal disease developed in six cases (19%); in four of them leukemia was concomitant. No significant differences were found between the two successive treatments for CR rate, survival, CNS relapses or toxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bernasconi, C', 'Brusamolino, E', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Morra, E', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Orlandi, E']","['Bernasconi C', 'Brusamolino E', 'Lazzarino M', 'Morra E', 'Pagnucco G', 'Orlandi E']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a057692 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)30979-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1990;1(2):141-6. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a057692.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blue white autofluorescence of the L. dumoffii colonies when viewed under ultraviolet light was particularly useful in preliminary identification. The patient recovered from his pneumonia after administration of erythromycin and rifampin. Legionella have been shown to multiply in monocytes and cell-mediated immunity appears to be the primary mechanism of host defense in man. Hairy cell leukemia is characterized by monocyte dysfunction and such patients have a predilection for infection by microbes that are controlled by cell-mediated defenses. We review other cases of community-acquired L. dumoffii pneumonia as well as other cases of Legionella infection in patients with hairy cell leukemia.","['Fang, G D', 'Stout, J E', 'Yu, V L', 'Goetz, A', 'Rihs, J D', 'Vickers, R M']","['Fang GD', 'Stout JE', 'Yu VL', 'Goetz A', 'Rihs JD', 'Vickers RM']","['Infectious Disease and Special Pathogens Sections, VA Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15240.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Legionella/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Legionellosis/*complications', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/*complications', 'Sputum/microbiology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01646415 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 1990 Nov-Dec;18(6):383-5. doi: 10.1007/BF01646415.,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2 h exposure, however, the IC50 values of the platinum complexes were dramatically changed, i.e., a marked difference was observed between those of L' = RNH2 and L' = R2NH. On the other hand, the amounts of platinum taken into the L-1210 cells is little affected by the alkylamino substitution.

Although procoagulant substances released from leukaemic blast cells may induce DIC by activating conventional coagulation pathways, there is increasing evidence to suggest that direct activation of fibrinogen by proteases released from blast cells may be the predominant mechanism by which DIC is initiated. Primary fibrinolysis has also been proposed as the cause of the haemorrhagic diathesis in some cases of acute leukaemia. Although plasminogen activators have been demonstrated in leukaemic blast cells supporting this view, cases of primary fibrinolysis would appear to be rare. A bleeding tendency attributed to primary fibrinolysis may more often be the result of an exaggerated fibrinolytic response secondary to DIC. The main strategies of treatment for leukaemia associated DIC are rapid initiation of chemotherapy and vigorous blood product support until the DIC resolves once the blast cells have been eradicated. The role of heparin in the management of leukaemia associated DIC remains controversial. There is recent evidence to suggest that heparin therapy does reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic death although it has been recommended that relatively low intravenous doses should be administered initially to reduce the risk of heparin induced haemorrhage.","['Wilde, J T', 'Davies, J M']","['Wilde JT', 'Davies JM']","['University Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(90)90004-C [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(90)90004-c [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1990 Dec;4(4):245-51. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(90)90004-c.,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we present a case of bacteremia due to Salmonella enteritidis detected in a healthy man. A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a fifty-day history of fever on May 18, 1985. On admission, he showed no symptoms except high body temperature (38.8 degrees C). In the laboratory data, C-reactive protein was 3+, white- cell count was 9600, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm/h. Culture in blood and stool yielded Salmonella enteritidis. However, no abnormal findings were found in UGIS, barium enema, OC + DIC, abdominal CT and echography. As soon as Ampicillin was administered, the fever was gone and the blood culture yielded nothing. After six months, the stool culture was negative for pathological intestinal bacterial flora and he was in good physical condition.

Groups of male DBA/2J mice were exposed to 0, 10, 30, or 100 ppm benzene (6 h/day for 5 days). One day and 5 days after the benzene exposures, the numbers of the two most primitive erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E and CFU-E) and the numbers of the most primitive granulocytic progenitor cells (GM-CFU-C) were assessed. Additional groups of mice were given hemolytic doses of phenylhydrazine (PHZ) during the 5 days of benzene exposure, while other groups of mice were given PHZ during the 5 days of recovery from benzene exposure. These experiments were designed to determine the effects of benzene exposure on progenitor cell numbers during periods of markedly heightened erythropoiesis. The results demonstrate that short-term benzene exposure does induce a growth advantage for granulocytic cells in both the bone marrow and spleen of exposed mice. Moreover, a benzene-induced shift toward granulopoiesis is observed even in those mice treated with a powerful erythropoietic stimulus.

The median %S was 6.1% (range 0.6-25.9%) and the median PF was 13.0% (range 2.4-36.1%), with a median of 7243 NBMPR binding sites per cell (range 1716-27247). In contrast to a previous report which included bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts, %S in marrow blasts did not correlate with NBMPR binding sites per cell (r = 0.005, p = 0.979). Similarly, PF did not correlate with NBMPR sites per cell (r = 0.190, p = 0.325). This lack of correlation between leukemia cell proliferation and NBMPR binding sites per cell suggests that DNA synthesis in AML blasts depends primarily on de novo nucleoside synthesis rather than the usage of salvage pathways.","['Powell, B L', 'White, J C', 'Gregory, B W', 'Brockschmidt, J K', 'Rhinehardt-Clark, A', 'Lyerly, E S', 'Chorley, H M', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Powell BL', 'White JC', 'Gregory BW', 'Brockschmidt JK', 'Rhinehardt-Clark A', 'Lyerly ES', 'Chorley HM', 'Capizzi RL']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1082.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', '*S Phase', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Jul;5(7):598-601.,"['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-03596/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Leukemia. 1992 May;6(5):486-7; discussion 487-8.

All four cell lines grew better when human plasma was added as a supplement to the culture in comparison to fetal calf serum.

Owing to the variability of both breakpoints a large number of different deletions occur. However, as banding problems have hitherto precluded the precise localization of the breakpoints, it is still uncertain whether or not different deletions are associated with clinical differences. In this paper relationships between cytogenetic and clinical data were analyzed in 96 5q- cases investigated with high resolution techniques, which allow more precise breakpoint localizations. Twenty-nine cases have not been published before; the others were extracted from the literature. The analyses show: (1) With higher age at diagnosis the proximal breakpoint approaches the centromere. (2) The female patients are older, develop additional chromosome aberrations less often, and tend to live longer than the male patients. (3) del(5)(qI3q33), which is more frequent than any other deletion, tends to be associated with female sex and older age, and shows lower frequencies of additional chromosome abnormalities, and longer survival than the other deletions. It seems to constitute a more benign subgroup than the other deletions. (4) 5q31 is missing in 91 of 93 informative cases and is the most common deleted segment. (5) These results suggest that the deletion of 5q31 may be central in the pathogenesis of 5q- related disorders and that the deletion of other bands has important consequences for prognosis.","['Pedersen, B', 'Jensen, I M']","['Pedersen B', 'Jensen IM']","['Danish Cancer Society, Department of Cytogenetics, Aarhus.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Jul;5(7):566-73.,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples from 24/44 patients were found to be positive for translocations involving the major breakpoint region of the BCL2 gene. In samples from seven patients two distinct t(14;18) translocations were shown to be present simultaneously; in one case the second translocation involved the minor cluster region of the BCL2 gene. Biopsy tissue obtained earlier in the course of the disease was available from five of these patients and was shown to contain one of the translocations in each case, but both translocations in only one. Further remission blood and bone marrow samples from the group were also examined. This led to the detection of both translocations in separate samples obtained at different times in a total of four out of the seven cases. In two of the remaining three patients the second translocation could not be amplified from further samples, but in both cases the search led to the identification of a third translocation, again only detectable in a single sample. These findings demonstrate that JH/BCL2 translocations can occur more than once during the course of follicular lymphoma. They suggest that biclonal follicular lymphoma may be more common than has previously been recognized but also raise the possibility that the translocation arises sporadically in the normal lymphoid cells of this group of patients.","['Price, C G', 'Tuszynski, A', 'Watt, S M', 'Murdoch, S J', 'Lister, T A', 'Young, B D']","['Price CG', 'Tuszynski A', 'Watt SM', 'Murdoch SJ', 'Lister TA', 'Young BD']","[""ICRF Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Jul;5(7):548-54.,,,,,,,,"['BCL2', 'mbr']",,,,,,,

Detection of this exchange by cytogenetic or Southern blot analysis is highly diagnostic for CML. The latter approach has not previously been used to quantify the relative proportions of leukemic and non-leukemic cells. We have assessed the feasibility of estimating the relative proportion of leukemic cells present in a sample by densitometric analysis of autoradiographs of Southern blots. In dilution experiments of CML cells with normal cells, a linear relationship could be demonstrated between the relative intensity of the autoradiograph band corresponding bcr rearrangement and the proportion of leukemic cells present. This relationship was found to be largely independent of autoradiograph exposure time. Six patients receiving various therapies have been evaluated for as long as 4.5 years by repeated densitometric and cytogenetic analysis. In general, a declining proportion of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive cells was paralleled by decreasing intensity of the autoradiograph band representing bcr rearrangement. Densitometric changes were often seen prior to the detection of Ph negative cells. This analysis appears to provide a sensitive method for monitoring patients with CML.","['Grossman, A', 'Silver, R T', 'Szatroswki, T P', 'Gutfriend, A', 'Verma, R S', 'Benn, P A']","['Grossman A', 'Silver RT', 'Szatroswki TP', 'Gutfriend A', 'Verma RS', 'Benn PA']","['Lifecodes Corporation, Valhalla, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Densitometry', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Remission Induction']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Jul;5(7):540-7.,,,,,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR', 'phl']",,,,,,,

The correlation between our in vivo results and the direct binding of Rex protein to mutant and wild-type RxRE sequences supports both the existence of the predicted secondary structure and the importance of this direct interaction with the cis-acting RNA sequence for Rex function in vivo.,"['Ballaun, C', 'Farrington, G K', 'Dobrovnik, M', 'Rusche, J', 'Hauber, J', 'Bohnlein, E']","['Ballaun C', 'Farrington GK', 'Dobrovnik M', 'Rusche J', 'Hauber J', 'Bohnlein E']","['SANDOZ Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.8.4408-4413.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Aug;65(8):4408-13. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.8.4408-4413.1991.,,,,PMC248880,,,,['rex'],,,,,,,

To further delineate the role of HTLV-I and the interleukin 2 (IL2) system in the transformation process, human primary lymphocytes were infected by cocultivation with lethally X-irradiated MT2 cells in the presence or absence of human rIL2; the polymerase chain amplification reaction was used to examine quantitatively the expression of HTLV-I, IL2, and IL2R alpha mRNAs during early and late proliferation phases that displayed polyclonal (days 7 to 49) and oligoclonal (days 100 to 150) proviral integration, respectively. IL2 mRNA and IL2 activity were transiently expressed during the polyclonal phase but were undetectable at later time points. IL2R alpha mRNA expression remained at a constitutively high level throughout the examined time course. Viral transcripts were detectable at each time point. Expression of the tax-rex mRNA was inversely related to IL2 mRNA levels; it was low early in the polyclonal phase but increased 30-fold with the development of oligoclonality. In addition, paraformaldehyde-fixed HTLV-I-producing cells activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. These data suggest that HTLV-I activates human T lymphocytes. However, IL2 expression is transient, indicating a limited involvement of an IL2 autocrine growth loop in the transformation process. Lastly, another viral determinant, in addition to the trans activator tax, may be important in HTLV-I-induced T-cell proliferation.","['Kimata, J T', 'Ratner, L']","['Kimata JT', 'Ratner L']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*physiology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Time Factors']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.8.4398-4407.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Aug;65(8):4398-407. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.8.4398-4407.1991.,"['GM07067/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC248879,,,,"['env', 'gag', 'pol', 'rex', 'tax']",,,,,,,

Constitutive envelope gene expression prevents infection by interfering with the binding of viruses which recognize the same receptor. We have used this property to investigate the receptor binding capacities of deleted or truncated murine leukemia virus ecotropic envelope glycoproteins. Friend murine leukemia virus envelope glycoproteins bearing internal amino-terminal deletions, or a soluble 245-amino-acid gp70 amino-terminal fragment, were expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. The susceptibility of these cells to ecotropic and amphotropic virus infection was determined. We observed that both membrane-bound and soluble forms of the gp70 245-amino-acid amino-terminal domain induced resistance to ecotropic virus, indicating that this fragment binds the ecotropic receptor. Binding occurs both at the cell surface and in the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown by the use of soluble envelope fragments either secreted in the culture supernatants or retained in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen by a KDEL sequence. These results suggest that the gp70 amino-terminal domain folds into a structure which recognizes the ecotropic receptor regardless of the carboxy-terminal part of the molecule.","['Heard, J M', 'Danos, O']","['Heard JM', 'Danos O']","['Laboratoire Retrovirus et Transfert Genetique, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Solubility', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.8.4026-4032.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Aug;65(8):4026-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.8.4026-4032.1991.,,,,PMC248833,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer incidence in the high-risk tamoxifen-treated group relative to that in the high-risk group not treated with tamoxifen was not significant (1.3).

People with lower annual incomes (below $5,000 per year in the years 1977 to 1981) and those with lower educational level (grade school only) showed survival times significantly shorter than those with higher income or education, respectively. These survival differences were associated with, but could not be fully explained by, severity of disease at initial presentation. SES continued to exert a small but significant impact on cancer survival, even after controlling for all known prognostic variables. Economically and educationally disadvantaged cancer patients may require treatment programs that include education about treatment and compliance, even after an initial diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated.

As a prelude to its inclusion into bone marrow transplant (BMT) preparative regimens, a phase I study of high-dose AZQ with autologous BMT (ABMT) was performed. Patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas were treated with a single 24-hour infusion of AZQ at 50 to 355 mg/m2 in dose escalations of 20%. Fifty-six patients received 69 courses. Those receiving greater than 60 mg/m2 had nadir granulocyte and platelet counts less than 500/microL and 20,000/microL, respectively. Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and diarrhea were mild, transient, and not dose-related. Transient minimal elevations of liver function tests were seen in five patients and were also not dose-related. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose AZQ was found to be 245 mg/m2, with nephrotoxicity being dose-limiting. Significant azotemia was seen in four of 12 patients treated at 295 and 355 mg/m2, including fatal anuric renal failure in three of these patients. Reversible proteinuria also occurred in 24 of 26 courses above 150 mg/m2, including nephrotic range proteinuria in eight courses, all at doses of 205 to 355 mg/m2. The proteinuria was also associated with multiple proximal tubular defects including generalized aminoaciduria and proximal renal tubular acidosis.

The others were treated with two courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy (ICC): course 1 with 4 days of high-dose Ara-C and 3 days of amsacrine (m-AMSA); course 2 with carmustine (BCNU), Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Forty-two patients received both planned courses, 15 received only the first, and 13 patients could only support conventional maintenance therapy. Four patients died during consolidation. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the disease-free survival (DFS) after ICC at 5 years is 40.3% (+/- 6.5%), with no statistically significant difference between patients receiving one or two courses. The DFS for the 17 transplanted patients is comparable (P = .72) and is lower for the 13 excluded patients (23% +/- 11.5%, P = .046). Age did not influence the probability of remaining in CR. In univariate analysis, three parameters had a negative impact on the 5-year DFS: a high initial WBC count (52% for patients with less than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L v 12% for patients with greater than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L, P = .01), a long delay between induction treatment and course 1 (+/- 60 days; 63% v 29%, P = .01), and a long delay between course 1 and course 2 (+/- 60 days, 61.5% v 28.5%, P = .05). In multivariate analysis (Cox model), only the WBC count remained significant.

After adjusting for changes in IQ test versions that were necessitated by advancing patient age, no statistically significant declines in Verbal, Performance, or Full Scale IQs were noted for the three CNS treatment groups. However, comparisons of group means masked declines in individual children; 22% to 30% of children exhibited a clinically significant deterioration (greater than or equal to 15 points) in uncorrected IQ values over the study period. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of deterioration in Verbal IQ, but we were unable to identify risk factors associated with other declines in intellect and achievement. The inability to reliably predict individual patients at risk for clinically significant neuropsychologic toxicities on the basis of age at diagnosis or specific method of CNS prophylaxis suggests that other etiologic factors must be explored as the basis for these changes, such as ecologic factors and chemotherapy during the continuation phase of treatment.","['Mulhern, R K', 'Fairclough, D', 'Ochs, J']","['Mulhern RK', 'Fairclough D', 'Ochs J']","[""Division of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intelligence/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*psychology/*radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychomotor Performance/*radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Verbal Behavior/*radiation effects']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.8.1348 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Aug;9(8):1348-56. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.8.1348.,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['J Clin Oncol 1991 Oct;9(10):1922'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Black race (P = .001) and leukemia without an anterior mediastinal mass (P = .05) were associated with an increased risk of failure after completion of treatment in the two earlier clinical trials, whereas a lower leukemic cell DNA content (DNA index less than 1.16) was the only predictor of late treatment failure in the more recent trial (P = .019). None of the other presenting features that were examined (eg, age, leukocyte count, and sex) had value as predictors of late failure. Thus, improved treatment altered the impact of specific prognostic factors and the distribution of sites of relapse, but it did not significantly affect the risk of delayed failure.","['Pui, C H', 'Dodge, R K', 'Look, A T', 'George, S L', 'Rivera, G K', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Ochs, J', 'Evans, W E', 'Crist, W M', 'Simone, J V']","['Pui CH', 'Dodge RK', 'Look AT', 'George SL', 'Rivera GK', 'Abromowitch M', 'Ochs J', 'Evans WE', 'Crist WM', 'Simone JV']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.8.1341 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Aug;9(8):1341-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.8.1341.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1991 Aug;9(8):1332-3.

MoAb 53.6, raised against uninduced cells of a human erythroleukemia line (HEL), recognizes a surface membrane antigen that is displayed on proliferating (cell cycle phase G1, S, and M + G2 phase) human leukocytes. The expression and redistribution (i.e., patching and capping) of the p34 kDa antigen on 27 different long-term human hematopoietic cell (HHC) lines was defined by fluorescence microscopy. These lines had been established from patients with leukemia or healthy donors and included phenotypically defined populations of T cells, B cells, and myelomonocytic cells. Almost all (greater than 95%) of the leukocytes of the 27 lines reacted strongly with MoAb 53.6. The majority of the leukocytes displayed p34 kDa antigen patching (26/27 lines; patched cells, 96-100%); moreover, 20 of 27 lines exhibited p34 kDa antigen capping (capped cells, 8-96%). Presentation of the p34 kDa antigen on surface membrane ultrastructures, imaged with immunogold using an indirect antibody labeling procedure, was illustrated by scanning electron microscopy, and endocytosis of the gold-tagged antigen-antibody complex was studied by transmission electron microscopy. The HHC lines are thought to represent immortalized populations of different human leukocyte subsets that are in different stages of maturation and/or differentiation; thus these lines should prove useful as models for further characterizing this unique p34 kDa proliferation-associated antigen and for defining the mechanisms and significance of surface membrane antigen redistribution and modulation that has been associated with leukocyte activation and propagation.","['Streck, R J', 'Hurley, E L', 'Pauly, J L']","['Streck RJ', 'Hurley EL', 'Pauly JL']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocytes/cytology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.50.2.182 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1991 Aug;50(2):182-91. doi: 10.1002/jlb.50.2.182.,"['CA-16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S07 RR-05648-23/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following findings were obtained. Of 16 patients who were found to have cryptococcosis, 14 (87.5%) were treated at the department of internal medicine, and one each at the departments of neurosurgery and dermatology. A study of these patients in terms of clinical type revealed 10 patients (62.5%) with meningitis, two with pneumonia and one with sepsis. The remaining three patients had complicated diseases: meningitis with sepsis, pneumonia with cutaneous cryptococcosis, or pleuritis with sepsis. Underlying disease, including liver cirrhosis, leukemia, multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma and collagen disease, was found in 6 patients (37.5%), who were all from the department of internal medicine. All patients but one were given antimycotic agents. They were treated by a combination therapy except for three patients who received single amphotericin B (AMPH) therapy. The most frequent combination was AMPH + 5-flucytosine (5-FC), which was found in 7 cases. Seven patients (43.4%) died, three males and four females.

The results show that the glucocorticoid response element-specific DNA binding domain is essential, and that only the sequence including the amino acids that subsume the first zinc finger through about half of the second zinc finger are absolutely necessary. Furthermore, in contrast to assays of receptor mutants for ability to increase gene transcription, deletion of the steroid binding domain results in a functionally constitutive receptor fully as active for cell kill as is the holoreceptor after addition of ligand. Deletion of most known transcription-activation, dimerization, ligand-binding, and nuclear translocation regions still leaves a receptor fragment highly potent for cell lethality.

Both activities of CDM, enhancing the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in K562 cells and potentiating the cytotoxicity of cytosine arabinoside for K562 cells, were significantly augmented by the replacement of the 7-carboxyl group with cyano (CDM-CN) or formyl (CDM-CHO), but they were not changed by the replacement with methyl. The activities were almost completely diminished by the replacement of ribose with arabinose, but the simultaneous replacement of carboxyl and ribose with formyl and arabinose showed higher activities than those of CDM. The replacement of 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine with 7-carboxy-7-deazainosine markedly weakened the activity. CDM-CN and CDM-CHO at 0.2 micrograms/ml significantly potentiated the activity of cytosine arabinoside against MOLT-3 cells but CDM at 1 micrograms/ml did not. These results indicate that the ribose and guanine moieties in the CDM molecule are very important for its activity. Also replacing the carboxyl group at the C-7 position with cyano or formyl group is a useful way to strengthen the CDM activity.

Bright nucleolar fluorescence was observed in exponentially growing control cells. The addition of DSF in the culture system resulted in time- and dose-dependent induction of protein B23 translocation from nucleoli to nucleoplasm, inhibition of cell growth, DNA and RNA synthesis. The addition of FeCl3 at culture initiation completely reversed the effects of DSF. Furthermore, significant numbers of HL-60 cells could be rescued from the effects of DSF when iron was added back as late as 24 hr after exposure to DSF. Cells resumed their abilities to grow and to synthesize DNA and RNA upon the iron rescue. Protein B23, accordingly, relocated from nucleoplasm to nucleoli. These results indicate the importance of iron for proliferation of leukemic cells and localization of protein B23 in nucleoli. Preribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles (pre-rRNPs) were extracted from isolated nucleoli of HL-60 cells and fractionated on sucrose density gradients. Protein B23 was found to be co-localized with the pre-rRNPs as determined by ELISA assays. No such B23-associated pre-rRNPs or other pre-rRNP fractions were obtained from nucleoli of DSF-treated cells. These results suggest that one of the effects of the anti-proliferative action of DSF is the inhibition of rRNA synthesis in nucleoli. Due to the lack of new synthesis of rRNA in nucleoli, protein B23 loses its binding target and translocates into the nucleoplasm. B23 translocation, as observed by immunofluorescence, may be a simple and rapid method for assessing inhibition of cell growth in response to anti-proliferative drugs such as deferoxamine in cancer chemotherapy.","['Yung, B Y', 'Yang, Y H', 'Bor, A M']","['Yung BY', 'Yang YH', 'Bor AM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chang Gung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'U38V3ZVV3V (ferric chloride)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorides', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Ferric Compounds/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Ribosomal/biosynthesis', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1991/07/09 00:00,1991/07/09 00:01,['1991/07/09 00:00'],"['1991/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910480524 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Jul 9;48(5):779-84. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910480524.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of BCL2 for growth factor-induced proliferation of these cells was further confirmed by the useage of BCL2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. The mechanisms by which overexpression of p26 BCL2 contributes to fibroblast proliferation are unknown, but do not involve alterations in: (a) the production of inositol triphosphates (IP3), (b) PDGF-induced transient elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ ions, or (c) the activity of protein kinase C enzymes in these transfected cells.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with either HQ or p-BQ produced the same DNA adduct. The DNA adduct level varied from 0.05 to 10 adducts per 10(7) nucleotides as a function of treatment time and concentration for both compounds. To achieve the same DNA adduct level required higher concentrations and longer treatment times with HQ compared to p-BQ. p-BQ was also more cytotoxic to HL-60 cells than HQ. Reaction of calf thymus DNA with a p-BQ/HQ mixture produced five adducts as detected by 32P-postlabeling. Two isomers of (hydroxy)-1,N2-benzetheno-2'- deoxyguanosine-3'-phosphate were isolated from the reaction of 2'-deoxyguanosine-3'-phosphate with a p-BQ/HQ mixture and one of the isomers was identified as adduct no. 1 of the DNA reaction.

Staurosporine at a dose of 30 nM inhibited antigen-stimulated Ca2(+)-influx into the cells from the extracellular environment. In contrast, the drug at this concentration inhibited neither the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores nor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation. At a high concentration (300 nM), however, staurosporine completely inhibited the cytosolic calcium responses as well as IP3 formation. These results indicate that staurosporine, if used at an appropriate concentration, can be used to discriminate Ca2(+)-influx from extracellular environment from mobilization of the ion from intracellular stores. These results also suggest that protein kinases, possibly protein kinase C, are involved in the calcium influx of RBL-2H3 cells from the extracellular environment. Serotonin release was strongly inhibited by the drug at 30 nM staurosporine. Since the inhibition of serotonin release and suppression of cytosolic calcium increase in response to the antigen were in parallel, we concluded that the inhibition of serotonin release from RBL-2H3 cells caused by the drug was elicited by the suppression of Ca2(+)-influx into the cells.","['Teshima, R', 'Ikebuchi, H', 'Terao, T', 'Nakanishi, M']","['Teshima R', 'Ikebuchi H', 'Terao T', 'Nakanishi M']","['National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,0377775,"['0 (Alkaloids)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*drug effects', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/cpb.39.747 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo). 1991 Mar;39(3):747-51. doi: 10.1248/cpb.39.747.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that virus constructs encoding either v-Myb or v-Ets as their only oncoprotein are nonleukemogenic and that constructs coexpressing nonfused v-Myb and v-Ets proteins appear to be weakly leukemogenic. Surprisingly, leukemic animals injected with the latter contain highly leukemogenic variant viruses that exhibit internal deletions in their genome, resulting in the synthesis of novel Myb-Ets fusion proteins.

As GVHD prophylaxis, 36 patients (control) received standard cyclosporine and methotrexate (C + M) whereas 11 patients (study) received C + M plus antibody 2A3, 1.0 mg/kg on day -1, and 0.5 mg/kg daily from day 0 through day +19. Antibody administration was not associated with appreciable toxicity and did not adversely affect engraftment. During treatment, circulating CD25+ cells appeared saturated by the infused antibody. Patients receiving antibody 2A3 tolerated more cyclosporine than controls (p less than 0.001) with lower increase of serum creatinine (p less than 0.05) during the first month. Seven of 10 (70%) evaluable study patients developed acute GVHD of grade II-IV with onset at a median of 20 days compared to 27 of 31 (87%) control patients with onset at a median of 13 days (p = 0.11). Trough serum levels of antibody 2A3 ranged from 7.2 to 68.8 mg/l, and lower values correlated with occurrence of acute GVHD. A human anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody response was detected in four patients but was not associated with lower levels of antibody 2A3 in the serum. Two study patients and two controls have survived more than 1 year (p = 0.92). These findings suggest that administration of antibody 2A3 suppressed and delayed activation of alloantigen-specific T cells but did not result in their elimination.","['Anasetti, C', 'Martin, P J', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Beatty, P G', 'Calori, E', 'Davis, J', 'Doney, K', 'Reichert, T', 'Stewart, P']","['Anasetti C', 'Martin PJ', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Beatty PG', 'Calori E', 'Davis J', 'Doney K', 'Reichert T', 'Stewart P', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/surgery', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 May;7(5):375-81.,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 11 other patients, various structural chromosomal abnormalities (not related to the original leukaemia) were found in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. In three different patients structural anomalies were also found in bone marrow and blood samples from donor-derived cells.

Our data reveal that the bone marrow transplant patients were experiencing greater difficulties than the maintenance chemotherapy patients in several areas. For example, the bone marrow transplant patients had experienced greater disruption of vocational functioning and reported more sexual difficulties. However, in spite of more objective difficulties, bone marrow transplant patients, compared to maintenance chemotherapy patients, viewed themselves as equally healthy and reported similarly low levels of psychological distress.

In contrast, effector LAK cells generated in vitro were shown to be resistant to treatment with Campath-1 and complement. We hypothesize that if indeed IL2-dependent non-MHC restricted cytotoxic cells play a role in vivo in the immediate post-BMT period, a T lymphocyte depletion procedure such as the Campath-1 may have the capacity to reduce, at least temporarily, the graft-versus leukemia effects mediated by such anti-tumor effector mechanisms.","['Morecki, S', 'Nabet, C', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Schlesinger, M', 'Slavin, S']","['Morecki S', 'Nabet C', 'Ackerstein A', 'Schlesinger M', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Cd52 protein, rat)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement System Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Apr;7(4):269-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL commonly affects the elderly, but a small proportion of patients are less than 50 years old. In this age group a novel form of therapy, high-dose chemoradiotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), has been used recently. Review of the literature and the IBMTR data show that 26 patients have received BMT (24 allogeneic, two syngeneic). Patients were predominantly male (20/26) with an age ranging between 21 and 49 years; 18 had advanced disease at BMT and had received multiple courses of chemotherapy to which they were considered refractory. Conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation, plus additional agents in one-third of the patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention was variable. Twenty-five patients are evaluable: 12 died of early complication of BMT (GVHD, infection, haemorrhage, etc.) and only two died of CLL. The effect of BMT on the disease was evaluable in 22 patients: 19 achieved a remission, three showed persistent disease and two relapsed; 11 were alive and apparently disease-free, with follow-up between 5 and 48 months. In two of these patients molecular biology studies showed no residual disease. These results indicate that further studies of the use of BMT for selected patients with CLL appear to be justified.","['Bandini, G', 'Michallet, M', 'Rosti, G', 'Tura, S']","['Bandini G', 'Michallet M', 'Rosti G', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology L.A.

Here we report that treatment of the R8 cell line with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) increased H-2Kb steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels several fold. The induced H-2Kb mRNA transcripts were functional, as demonstrated by their ability to be translated into immunoprecipitable H-2Kb alloantigen. H-2Kb null variants derived from the R8 cell line were shown to be the product of both cis- and trans-acting mechanisms, insomuch as the treatment of R8-derived H-2Kb non-expressor lines with CHX re-established expression of H-2Kb mRNA to the same extent as transfection of the variant cell line with the wild-type H-2Kb gene. Such findings indicate that downregulation of MHC class I gene expression is constitutive for the R8 leukemic cell line, a phenomenon that may be related to the immature pre-B-cell phenotype of this A-MuLV transformant.","['Zeff, R A', 'Zhao, Y F', 'Tatake, R', 'Lachman, H', 'Borriello, F', 'Nathenson, S G']","['Zeff RA', 'Zhao YF', 'Tatake R', 'Lachman H', 'Borriello F', 'Nathenson SG']","['Department of Pathology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington 06032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics', 'Histones/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83230-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 15;78(2):524-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested an association between t(11;14) chromosomal translocations and bcl-1 rearrangement in centrocytic and related intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas. To further characterize the association between bcl-1 and centrocytic lymphoma, Southern blot analysis was performed on samples from 23 patients using four separate bcl-1 breakpoint probes spanning 63 kb of the chromosome 11 bcl-1 locus. Rearrangements were identified in six patients with the major translocation cluster (MTC) probe and in another six with probe p94PS, located about 24 kb 5' of MTC. Eleven of these 12 cases showed comigration of rearranged bcl-1 and Ig heavy chain-joining genes, consistent with the t(11;14) chromosomal translocation. No rearrangements were observed with the bcl-1 locus probes p210 or p11EH located 5' of p94PS, nor with bcl-2 or c-myc oncogene probes. No bcl-1 rearrangements were identified in B-cell follicular NHL (15), small noncleaved cell (Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's) NHL (8), T-cell NHL (4), multiple myeloma (14), and pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (9). One of 23 B-cell NHL of large cell type and one of 19 chronic lymphocytic leukemias or small lymphocytic NHL had MTC rearrangement. Thus, bcl-1 rearrangement occurred at MTC or p94PS in 12 of 23 centrocytic lymphomas (52%), confirming a nonrandom association and suggesting a pathogenetic role for the bcl-1 locus in this immunohistologic subtype of NHL.","['Williams, M E', 'Meeker, T C', 'Swerdlow, S H']","['Williams ME', 'Meeker TC', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cyclin D1', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Reference Values', 'Restriction Mapping']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83225-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 15;78(2):493-8.,"['CA01102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A B-cell origin was confirmed by the expression of CD19 and HLA-DR. Four stages of B-cell leukemias were defined: stage I (pro-B) as CD10-, cytoplasmic mu- (c mu-), surface Ig- (sIg-); stage II (cALL) as CD10+/c mu-/sIg-; stage III (pre-B) as CD10+ or -/c mu+/sIg-; and stage IV (B) as CD10-/c mu-/sIg+. A linear correlation was found between immunohistochemical and radiochemical determination of 5'NT (r = .86). 5'NT expression was low in T-cell leukemias and stage I, high in stages II and III, and low again in stage IV of B-cell leukemias. 5'NT expression was not related to c mu, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD34, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression, but was significantly related to CD10 and inversely related to kappa/lambda expression. However, the 5'NT activity in CD10+ leukemias (stages II and III) shows a very wide range. Within the group of CD10+ leukemias no differences were detected between 5'NT+ and 5'NT- cells in their expression of other B-cell antigens. We conclude that the place of 5'NT in leukemias corresponding to early stages of B-cell development has been characterized. 5'NT is expressed in CD10+ stages and decreases before the expression of sIgs. Future studies should make clear whether a high expression of this enzyme in CD10+ stages is a normal maturation phenomenon or a malignant phenomenon.","['Pieters, R', 'Thompson, L F', 'Broekema, G J', 'Huismans, D R', 'Peters, G J', 'Pals, S T', 'Horst, E', 'Hahlen, K', 'Veerman, A J']","['Pieters R', 'Thompson LF', 'Broekema GJ', 'Huismans DR', 'Peters GJ', 'Pals ST', 'Horst E', 'Hahlen K', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*analysis"", 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*immunology']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83224-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 15;78(2):488-92.,"['AI18220/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM39699/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-4 suppressed the clonogenic cell growth in methylcellulose culture, inhibited the uptake of 3H thymidine in a dose-dependent manner at 5 to 100 U/mL, and consequently suppressed the growth of clonogenic cells in short- and long-term suspension cultures. In addition, IL-4 markedly increased the number of adherent cells. These adherent cells were alpha-naphthyl-butyrate (alpha-NB) esterase-positive and showed macrophage-like appearance, increased expression of CD14, CD11b, CD23, and Ia, and significantly decreased clonogenicity. On the other hand, nonadherent cells growing in suspension showed only slight increase in proportion of alpha-NB esterase-positive or monocyte/macrophage-like cells and increased CD23 expression by an addition of IL-4. The clonogenicity of the nonadherent cells was not significantly influenced by IL-4. By addition of the media conditioned by OCI-AML1a cells in the presence of IL-4, the clonogenic cells growth of OCIAML1a cells was suppressed and adherent cells were markedly increased. The suppressive and differentiative effects on OCI/AML1a cells of the conditioned media and IL-4 itself were almost completely abolished by anti-IL-4 antibody. Furthermore, the neutralizing antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or IL-6 did not influence the effect of recombinant IL-4. Taken together, IL-4 was shown to suppress the growth and induce differentiation toward adherent macrophage-like cells of the G-CSF-dependent myeloblastic cell line. The effect of IL-4 may be direct, and not secondary via inducing production of other cytokines such as TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, or IL-6 by leukemic cells.","['Imai, Y', 'Nara, N', 'Tohda, S', 'Nagata, K', 'Suzuki, T', 'Nagasawa, M', 'Murohashi, I', 'Aoki, N']","['Imai Y', 'Nara N', 'Tohda S', 'Nagata K', 'Suzuki T', 'Nagasawa M', 'Murohashi I', 'Aoki N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83222-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 15;78(2):471-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cell line has the characteristic chromosome abnormality of M4E0, inv(16) (p13q22). When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, ME-1 cells were monoblastoid, but with the addition of cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-4, or medium conditioned by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral leukocytes (PHA-LCM), the cells exhibited differentiation to macrophage-like cells. PHA-LCM also promoted eosinophilic-lineage differentiation of this cell line, although IL-5 did not do so. To elucidate the mechanism of proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells, we studied the effect of a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), on colony formation of ME-1 cells. H-7 inhibited colony formation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF dose dependently, but had little inhibitory effect on colony formation by IL-4. These results indicate that the proliferation and differentiation of ME-1 cells by IL-3 or GM-CSF were related to the activation of protein kinase C, while those by IL-4 involved other regulatory systems. ME-1 cells should be useful for studying the pathogenesis of M4E0 and the mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of leukemic and normal progenitors by cytokines.","['Yanagisawa, K', 'Horiuchi, T', 'Fujita, S']","['Yanagisawa K', 'Horiuchi T', 'Fujita S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Ehime University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Eosinophilia/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Macrophages/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Muramidase/blood', 'Phagocytosis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83219-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 15;78(2):451-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiolabeled recombinant human IL-5 (hIL-5) was used to characterize the IL-5 receptor present on normal human eosinophils and on the myeloid leukemia line HL-60, which can be induced to differentiate into eosinophilic cells. Binding studies with eosinophils and HL-60 cells grown under alkaline conditions demonstrated similar high-affinity binding sites for hIL-5 on both cell types with kd values of approximately 400 pmol/L. The binding observed was specific in that it was not inhibited by hIL-3, human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or hIL-2. Binding studies with a number of other human cell lines, including a B-lymphoma line, and with lymphocyte and neutrophil preparations were also performed, but IL-5 receptors were not detectable on these cells. The number of hIL-5 receptors on HL-60 cells could be correlated with its propensity to differentiate towards an eosinophilic cell type. Expression of hIL-5 receptors on HL-60 cells was upregulated by butyric acid under alkaline conditions, downregulated by hIL-3, virtually eliminated by dimethyl sulfoxide and hIL-5, while hIL-2 had no detectable effect. One major 125I-hIL-5-crosslinked complex of 75 to 85 Kd in Mr was detected on HL-60 cells using crosslinking agents giving a molecular mass of 55 to 60 Kd for the hIL-5 receptor itself. Studies using cellular autoradiography showed that IL-5 receptors were evenly distributed on eosinophils but that receptor distribution on HL-60 cells was noticeably heterogeneous. Eosinophils were the only cells in slides prepared from peripheral blood that had detectable levels of IL-5 receptors in agreement with the specific action of IL-5 on the human eosinophil lineage.","['Ingley, E', 'Young, I G']","['Ingley E', 'Young IG']","['Medical Molecular Biology Group, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/*metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Interleukin', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Thermodynamics']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83204-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 15;78(2):339-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fibroblast colony-forming cells (CFU-F) are present exclusively in the STRO-1+ population. Dual-color cell sorting using STRO-1 in combination with antibody to glycophorin A yields a population approximately 100-fold enriched in CFU-F in the STRO-1+/glycophorin A- population. When plated under long-term BM culture (LTBMC) conditions, STRO-1+ cells generate adherent cell layers containing multiple stromal cell types, including adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblastic elements. STRO-1+ cells isolated from LTBMC at later times retain the capacity to generate adherent layers with a cellular composition identical to that of the parent cultures. The STRO-1-selected adherent layers are able to support the generation of clonogenic cells and mature hematopoietic cells from a population of CD34+ cells highly enriched in so-called long-term culture-initiating cells.

Nine of the 59 initially responding patients became resistant to rIFN-alpha-2a and suffered a relapse of the disease at 7 to 24 months of treatment. All nine relapsing patients tested positive for both neutralizing and binding antibodies with titers above 400 INU/mL, while none of the antibody-negative patients relapsed. Six patients with detectable binding antibody titers below 400 INU/mL continued to respond to treatment. By measuring the IFN kinetics and the levels of the IFN-induced Mx-homologous protein in mononuclear cells after a single injection each of rIFN-alpha-2a and nIFN-alpha the IFN antibodies of eight of the nine resistant rIFN-alpha patients were found to be highly specific for rIFN-alpha-2a. Therefore, these eight patients were switched to natural IFN-alpha (nIFN-alpha) therapy at doses of 3 million IU, three times a week. All eight patients responded to treatment with nIFN-alpha, achieving durable objective responses similar to those obtained previously with rIFN-alpha-2a.

Cytologic findings showed a marked morphologic difference between M-BCR+ and M-BCR- patients, especially in the monocytic lineage. Dysmyelopoietic features in CMML and M-BCR- patients were very similar, and the differences were of quantitative order only. Using four criteria (monocytosis, percentage of IMP, basophilia, and percentage of erythroblasts in BM), patients could be divided into typical and atypical CML and this classification correlated well with molecular findings.

This biologic role is in contradiction to reports of elevated expression of the gene in multiple myeloma, a tumor with restricted self-renewal capacity. To more clearly define the role of this gene in plasma cells of myeloma patients, c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or oncoprotein expression were semiquantitatively analyzed on the single cell level in 19 cases of multiple myeloma, among them 1 biclonal case and 1 case with coexistent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Performing anti-sense/mRNA in situ hybridization, mature c-myc gene transcripts were detected in 92% (12 of 13) of cases and could definitely be attributed to the plasma cells by our study. The number of Ki 67-positive plasma cells actively passing the cell cycle was less than 1% and independent of c-myc gene expression. However, because the presence of the 152-c-MYC epitope was correlated to extent of marrow plasmacytosis (r = .64; P = .043) and content of plasmablasts (P = .09), the c-myc gene might serve a function different from proliferative activity, but also associated with tumor cell mass. In CLL cells (21 of 22 cases) and their benign counterparts, ie, bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes, the anti-sense/c-myc mRNA hybridization signals remained below the threshold considered as cutpoint between negative and positive. The low amounts of c-myc transcripts were correlated to neither stage of disease (P = .52) nor lymphocyte counts (P = .24). Because the numbers of peripheral blood lymphoma cells were independent of tumor mass and of c-myc gene transcripts expressed, peripheral blood lymphocytosis might more likely reflect homing processes than proliferative activity in CLL.","['Greil, R', 'Fasching, B', 'Loidl, P', 'Huber, H']","['Greil R', 'Fasching B', 'Loidl P', 'Huber H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, myc/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82994-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 1;78(1):180-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of murine primitive (stem) cells with the ability to repopulate irradiated bone morrow stroma is similar to that of cells able to repopulate the hemopoietic system of potentially lethally irradiated mice. In human bone marrow, cells with in vitro repopulating ability have been estimated as 0.5% to 1% of the CD34+ cells. The increase in primitive cells in the circulation seen after administration of growth factors has been exploited by harvesting those cells for use together with bone marrow in autologous transplants. The ability of primitive cells (harvested after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus chemotherapy) to reconstitute irradiated marrow stromas indicates that their repopulation capacity in vitro is at least as good as that of bone marrow.

Residual tumor cells escaping chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy given in the course of autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are still a barrier to complete eradication of malignancy. Recent experiments in animal models of human disease suggest that minimal residual disease can be controlled by an innovative therapy consisting of the administration of cytokines such as recombinant human interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha. Moreover, graft versus leukemia-like effects are induced in conjunction with autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation by administration of allogeneic immunocompetent lymphocytes and recombinant interleukin-2 following bone marrow transplantation and especially by combined administration of allogeneic lymphocytes and recombinant interleukin-2. Similar approaches are currently being investigated in humans with encouraging preliminary results. Overall, our data suggest that eradication of the last tumor cell is neither feasible nor necessary for achieving operational cure. Control of minimal residual disease by activation of anticancer effector cells today seems closer than ever and we are optimistic that further advances in immunotherapy will be applicable to clinical practice in the near future.","['Slavin, S', 'Nagler, A']","['Slavin S', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Surgery, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*trends', 'Cytokines/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*surgery/therapy']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-199104000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 1991 Apr;3(2):254-71. doi: 10.1097/00001622-199104000-00005.,,,167,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appropriate manipulations of the latter group of mechanisms may result in a better understanding of disease control and make the underlying therapeutic principle universally applicable. Chronic myeloid leukemia patients in the chronic phase appear to have the most optimal risk-to-benefit ratio of all patients transplanted for hemopoietic malignancies.

This approach is based on the amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of specific target sequences from small numbers of microdissected chromosome fragments. This method has been applied to leukaemia-associated translocations affecting the q23 region of chromosome 11. In two independent leukaemias, the t(6;11) translocation was distinguished from the t(9;11) and t(4;11) translocations by demonstrating that the former breakpoint on chromosome 11 lay proximal to the CD3D gene while the latter breakpoints lay distal to CD3D. All three translocation breakpoints were found to lie proximal to ETSI and THYI. The data suggest that although these leukaemia-associated breakpoints on chromosome 11 are cytogenetically identical they may involve disruption of different genes.

This effect was not specific for L1210 cells since 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) strongly increased the binding of various other tumor cell lines. Phorbol esters increased the rate of L1210 cell adhesion to CEC by enhancing their binding capacity without affecting the apparent affinity of L1210 cells for CEC. This stimulation was specific to the phorbol analogs which activate PKC since it was not effected by 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate, known to be inactive for PKC. Down-regulation experiments showed that adhesion enhancement was entirely attributable to an effect on tumor cells without contribution of CEC intracellular PKC. PKC inhibitors like staurosporine, sphingosine and H-7 showed strong antagonistic activity towards TPA-induced L1210 cell adherence to CEC (IC50 = 0.5 nM, 160 nM and 10 microM, respectively). Adhesive proteins such as vitronectin, fibrinogen, fibronectin and the tetrapeptide RGDS, an active sequence from their cell-binding domains, exhibited potent, dose-dependent inhibition of PKC-induced tumor cell adhesion.","['Herbert, J M', 'Maffrand, J P']","['Herbert JM', 'Maffrand JP']","['Unite de Recherche Exploratoire, Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'AC6UDA2MFC (arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Cerebral Cortex/blood supply', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1991/06/21 00:00,1991/06/21 00:01,['1991/06/21 00:00'],"['1991/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(91)90695-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90695-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1991 Jun 21;42(1):163-70. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90695-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study further this metabolic effect, 46 patients receiving high dose methotrexate (5 to 8 g/m2) infusions have been studied. Significant increase in serum phenylalanine was observed in 95% of methotrexate cycles, occurring at the end of infusion. In contrast to the large inter-individual variations, maximal phenylalanine concentrations were of the same magnitude in each individual, suggesting individual predispositions. The hypothesis of an inhibition of dihydropteridine reductase by methotrexate was supported by the parallel course of serum biopterin and phenylalanine levels, but in some way contradicted by the rapid return to baseline values of both, 24 hours after the end of methotrexate infusion. This transient and often moderate hyperphenylalaniemia is probably harmless except if it reflects a more general inhibition of pteridine-dependent hydroxylases. Especially, such an inhibition of cerebral tyrosine- and tryptophan-hydroxylase activities might be the reason for transient neurological disturbances observed in some patients on high-dose methotrexate treatment.","['Dhondt, J L', 'Farriaux, J P', 'Millot, F', 'Taret, S', 'Hayte, J M', 'Mazingue, F']","['Dhondt JL', 'Farriaux JP', 'Millot F', 'Taret S', 'Hayte JM', 'Mazingue F']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte Libre de Medecine, Lille, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Arch Fr Pediatr,Archives francaises de pediatrie,0372421,"['22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopterin/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylation/drug effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Phenylalanine/*blood/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Fr Pediatr. 1991 Apr;48(4):249-51.,,,,,,Methotrexate a haute dose et hyperphenylalaninemie.,,,,,,,,,

The study groups had significantly fewer deaths from most major disease categories compared with other New Jersey residents. Among white male scientists and engineers, age-adjusted overall mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were comparable to white male managers and support staff studied, whereas mortality from leukemia and lymphatic cancer was significantly elevated. Mechanics, however, had a significantly lower leukemia and lymphatic cancer mortality rate than did the comparison group. In a Poisson regression model in which white males and females from the study population were used, and for which the effects of age, smoking, college education category, period of hire, and years employed were controlled, scientists, engineers, and research technicians had elevated (nonsignificantly) mortality rates for leukemia and lymphatic cancer compared with managers and support staff. Smoking was an independent risk factor for leukemia and lymphatic cancer.

Colony formation by CMMoL cells was substantially suppressed by adding either an anti-IL-6 or anti-GM-CSF antibody to the colony assay system. This suppression was abrogated by the treatment of IL-4 with an anti-IL-4 antibody. Furthermore, the production of IL-6 or GM-CSF was markedly inhibited by adding IL-4 to the culture system.

There are three clinical settings in which chemotherapy may be useful, namely, in intraocular retinoblastoma, in cases of micrometastatic spread, and where there are overt extraocular metastases. Clinical trials in all three settings have been impeded by biological, statistical, and ethical limitations. Extensive review of the literature, including case reports, small retrospective series, and occasional prospective studies, does not lead to any clear conclusions. However, responsiveness of retinoblastoma to chemotherapy in each of the above categories has been documented, and cyclophosphamide is consistently the most effective single agent. For small intraocular tumors, there may be a role for a combination of nonoperative treatment modalities. Whether decreased occurrence of extraocular relapse is produced by the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for presumed micrometastatic disease remains controversial A prospective randomized study of stratified high-risk categories of patients needs to be done on an international level. The most widely accepted regimen in this setting is the combination of cyclophosphamide and vincristine. Improving the survival of patients with overt metastases is a major challenge, which is especially relevant to the less developed parts of the world. Several multiagent regimens, particularly in combination with bone marrow transplantation, offer some promise. Experimental models are being used to overcome some of the limitations of clinical studies. Evaluations of responsiveness to chemotherapy, both in cell culture and animal models, are being conducted. Other areas being investigated include pharmacologic enhancement of radiotherapy and hematoporphyrin photodynamic therapy, use of tumor cell targeting techniques, differentiating agents, vitamin D, and immunotherapy. The nude mouse intraocular xenograft model appears to confirm clinical observations for responsiveness to conventional therapeutic agents.","['White, L']",['White L'],"[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Children's Leukemia and Cancer Research Unit, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Eye Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Retinoblastoma/*drug therapy/secondary']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1991 Summer;13(2):189-201.,,,111,,,,,,,,,,,,

This lower infectious complication rate with SP was demonstrated in the entire group of unselected patients and in a cohort of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving intensive chemotherapy, and it was evident in all age groups.

The patients received repetitive cycles of 1-1.25 x 10(6) U/m2/day of IL-2, given as 4 days continuous intravenous infusion followed by a 3-day treatment-free interval for the first 4 weeks. Patients receiving greater than 4 cycles were treated with the same dose of IL-2 continuously for 4 days, followed by a 10-day treatment-free interval. These studies showed that IL-2 treatment resulted in the generation of peripheral blood cytotoxic activity against both NK-susceptible, K-562, and NK-resistant Daudi cell lines. In most patients, enhancement of lytic activity increased with the number of IL-2 infusions. The cytotoxicity in some patients increased as much as 700-fold and 830-fold against K-562 and Daudi cells, respectively. It is of importance that oncolytic activity was also induced in bone marrow compartment (up to 182-fold against K-562). Some decline in cytotoxicity was observed within 14 days after initiation of IL-2 infusion in peripheral blood, but high levels of lytic activity persisted at this time in bone marrow. It is of interest to note that the cytotoxicity of in vivo IL-2 primed lymphocytes was further potentiated by IL-2 in vitro. Importantly, the cytotoxic cells induced in vitro displayed lytic activity against fresh leukemic blasts. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that CD3-, CD56+ NK cells were significantly increased by in vivo IL-2 treatment (34 to 47-fold in absolute numbers), while CD3-, CD56+ T-cell subset remained low. Characterization of cytotoxic cells using the complement-dependent assay and monoclonal antibodies indicated that both the in vivo-induced and ex vivo-potentiated lytic function was mediated by CD3-, CD56+, CD16- -NK cells.","['Lotzova, E', 'Savary, C A', 'Schachner, J R', 'Huh, J O', 'McCredie, K']","['Lotzova E', 'Savary CA', 'Schachner JR', 'Huh JO', 'McCredie K']","['Department of General Surgery, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830370206 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1991 Jun;37(2):88-99. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830370206.,['CA 39632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes co-expressed CD22 and CD11c in less than or equal to 3% of the normal subjects and in less than or equal to 6% of the patients with NLPDs. These markers were expressed in greater than 10% of the lymphocytes of 46% (32/69) of the patients with B-cell CLDs: B-cell chronic-lymphocytic leukemia, 9/41; B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 8/14; HCL, 11/11; B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (NOS), 1/2; and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, 1/1. None (0/6) of the lymphocytes of patients with T-cell CLDs expressed greater than 10% CD22-positive (CD22+) or CD11c-positive (CD11c+) cells. The HCL cases demonstrated a unique CD22+CD11c+ fluorescence histogram pattern, distinct from other lymphoproliferative disorders, that was characterized by uniformly intense CD11c and CD22 fluorescence. Differences in the expression of the CD22+CD11C- and CD22+CD11C+ phenotypes between diagnostic groups were found, most notable was a paucity of CD22+CD11c+ cells in lymphocytes of patients with HCL. CD22 also had more variable expression than CD19 and HLA-DR in the cases of B-cell CLD. This study demonstrates that the CD22+CD11c+ phenotype is not unique to HCL but is a consistent feature of that disorder and that the immunofluorescence pattern of co-expression in HCL is diagnostically useful.","['Miller, M L', 'Fishleder, A J', 'Tubbs, R R']","['Miller ML', 'Fishleder AJ', 'Tubbs RR']","['Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Department of Laboratory Hematology, Ohio 44195-5139.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/*analysis', '*Lectins', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Reference Values', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/96.1.100 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1991 Jul;96(1):100-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/96.1.100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two other similar nucleoside analogs are currently available for commercial use. Cytarabine is used principally as an antileukemic agent, and vidarabine as an antiviral. Unlike vidarabine, fludarabine is resistant to deactivation by adenosine deaminase. Data from Phase I and II trials suggest that fludarabine is potentially effective in a number of leukemias, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unfortunately, the doses required to achieve adequate response in the acute leukemias (greater than 75 mg/m2) were above the maximum tolerated dose, resulting in intolerable granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a life-threatening neurotoxic syndrome. In CLL: however, the dose required to achieve a satisfactory response is well within tolerated limits. Long-term survival statistics are not yet available, but historical perspective strongly correlates response to other agents with increased survival times. Toxicities seen at dose regimens of 15-40 mg/m2/d for five consecutive days include somnolence, metabolic acidosis, confusion, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine and aminotransferase concentrations, and pulmonary and hepatic abnormalities. Mild to severe hematologic toxicity has been observed at all dose levels.","['Hood, M A', 'Finley, R S']","['Hood MA', 'Finley RS']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,DICP,DICP : the annals of pharmacotherapy,8904338,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/classification/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809102500512 [doi]'],ppublish,DICP. 1991 May;25(5):518-24. doi: 10.1177/106002809102500512.,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recommended dose of idarubicin is 12 mg/m2 daily for three days by slow intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine.

Therefore, we studied the structure and expression of p53 in the leukemic cells of a large number of CML patients in acute phase. We found that although the gene is rarely rearranged, one p53 allele is completely deleted in patients with the i(17q) aberration as well as in some patients who do not show karyotypic changes. In all of these patients the remaining allele is inactivated through loss of expression, rearrangement, or point mutation. Detailed analysis of some patients who carry both p53 alleles indicated neither loss of expression nor structural alterations.

This was demonstrated using an anti-kinetochore antibody modification of the micronucleus assay. Treatment with hydroquinone alone or in combination with phenol produced a 3-fold increase in micronucleated cells over background. Treatment with catechol or phenol alone and in combination produced only minor increases in the number of micronucleated cells. In contrast, simultaneous treatment with equimolar (75 microM) concentrations of hydroquinone and catechol resulted in a greater than 16-fold induction of micronucleated cells. Given an additivity model, 20 additional micronucleated cells would be expected (after correcting for background frequencies), yet 140 were observed. Further analysis revealed that over 90% of the micronucleated cells stained positively for kinetochores, indicating a high probability that these micronuclei contain entire chromosomes.

In cases without any allogeneic donors, autologous BMT is another choice. We recently have proposed the flow chart therapy system to select the auto-BMT candidates in CML patients. This system, briefly, consists of (1) bone marrow collection as early stage of CML as possible, (2) IFN-alpha treatment with administration of weekly methotrexate or occasional use of hydroxyurea, (3) early detection of accelerated or blastic phase of CML by using scoring system, (4) conditioning regimens of auto-BMT for CML and (5) post-BMT follow-up with IFN-alpha. Following this system, we have initiated the treatment of CML cases. Our tentative results on one case favorable outcome including complete disappearance of Ph1 positive clone. However, there are several questions to be answered in the auto-BMT for CML, namely, (1) do we need to purge Ph1 progenitor cells or not, if yes, how? (2) does the long term use of IFN affect the bone marrow microenvironment resulting in graft failure?

Analysis of the rearranged chromosome 22 have demonstrated that the DNA breakpoints fall within a 5.8-kilobase (kb) region termed M-bcr. In Ph1-acute lymphocytic leukemia, approximately half of the patients have a breakpoint within M-bcr, whereas the remaining half have the break within the first intron of the BCR gene (m-bcr). We have investigated five cases with CML in the blastic phase to search the molecular mechanism of blastic crisis in CML. Using a method of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have identified both types of breakpoints in samples of the three cases, suggesting the existence of M-bcr/ABL and m-bcr/ABL chimeric mRNAs in the RNA samples derived from blasts of the three cases. We have further analysed for alterations in the p53 gene in those cases. The p53 gene is now considered to be a tumor suppressor gene and its mutations play a role in the development of many human malignancies. We have attempted to determine whether the p53 gene is involved in the mechanism of blastic crisis in CML. Using the methods of RT-PCR and single stand-conformational polymorphism (SSCP), we have detected expression of only a mutated p53 allele in a case with CML blastic crisis, indicating that inactivation of the p53 gene in both alleles may contribute to the blastic crisis in this case.

Remission induction therapy consisted of two courses of daunorubicin, cytarabine (Ara-C), and thioguanine (DAT). Postremission therapy consisted of four sequential courses, each consisting of (1) four doses of HdA (HdA4) followed by asparaginase (L-Asp), (2) etoposide (VP) plus azacytidine (Az), (3) prednisone, vincristine, methotrexate, and mercaptopurine (POMP), and (4) Ara-C daily for 5 days by continuous infusion. Six doses of intrathecal Ara-C were given for CNS prophylaxis. In December 1986, the protocol was amended (group II) to substitute six doses of HdA (HdA6) for the second DAT (two + five) induction course; postinduction, a single course of HdA6 was given instead of four HdA/L-Asp courses, and the remainder of the therapy was unchanged. One hundred forty group I patients and 145 group II patients were assessable. The two groups were similar with regard to clinical prognostic groups. No significant differences were noted in the two groups with regard to remission induction (85% [SE = 2%] in each group), induction deaths (6.5% v 7.0%), or deaths in remission (one in each group). Cerebellar toxicity was reported in three patients in group II (with HdA6) but none in group I (HdA4). At present, patients who received HdA6 (group II) had higher event-free survival than patients in group I (EFS at 3 years, 34% [SE = 11%] v 29% [SE = 4%]), and disease-free survival (DFS at 3 years, 42% [SE = 14%] v 34% [SE = 4%]), but the differences were not statistically significant. In both groups, children less than 2 years and those with WBCs less than 100,000/microL had significantly better outcome (EFS of 55% [SE = 10%] and 36% [SE = 5%] at 3 years, respectively) than children greater than or equal to 2 years and those with WBCs greater than or equal to 100,000/microL (EFS of 27% [SE = 5%] and 20% [SE = 9%] at 3 years, respectively.","['Ravindranath, Y', 'Steuber, C P', 'Krischer, J', 'Civin, C I', 'Ducore, J', 'Vega, R', 'Pitel, P', 'Inoue, S', 'Bleher, E', 'Sexauer, C']","['Ravindranath Y', 'Steuber CP', 'Krischer J', 'Civin CI', 'Ducore J', 'Vega R', 'Pitel P', 'Inoue S', 'Bleher E', 'Sexauer C', 'et al.']","['Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.4.572 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Apr;9(4):572-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.4.572.,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
