At present, imatinib is the only targeted drug for KIT-mutation-bearing melanomas that is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients with KIT mutations, however, are either insensitive or rapidly progress to imatinib insensitivity, which restricts its clinical use. Thus, effective inhibitors of KIT-mutation-bearing melanomas are urgently needed. Methods: A cohort of patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models and corresponding PDX-derived cells (PDCs) from patients with melanomas harboring KIT mutations (KIT (V560D), KIT (K642E) and KIT (D816V)) were established, characterized, and then used to test the in vitro and, subsequently, in vivo inhibitory effects of a panel of known KIT inhibitors. Results: Ponatinib was more potent than imatinib against cells bearing KIT mutations. In vivo drug efficacy evaluation experiments showed that ponatinib treatment caused much stronger inhibition of KIT-mutation-bearing melanomas than did imatinib. Mechanistically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed a plausible atomic-level explanation for the observation that ponatinib has a higher affinity for the KIT (D816V) mutant protein than does imatinib. Conclusions: Our study of KIT-mutation-and KIT (WT)-bearing melanomas demonstrates that ponatinib is a far more potent inhibitor than is imatinib for KIT-mutation-bearing melanomas and thus underscores that ponatinib should be given priority consideration for the design of precision treatments for melanoma patients triaged to have KIT mutations. Moreover, our work provides a rationale for undertaking clinical trials to examine the repurposing of ponatinib, which is already approved for use in leukemia, for use in treating a large subset of melanoma patients.","['Han, Yong', 'Gu, Ziyue', 'Wu, Jing', 'Huang, Xiaojuan', 'Zhou, Rong', 'Shi, Chaoji', 'Tao, Wenjie', 'Wang, Lizhen', 'Wang, Yanan', 'Zhou, Guoyu', 'Li, Jiang', 'Zhang, Zhiyuan', 'Sun, Shuyang']","['Han Y', 'Gu Z', 'Wu J', 'Huang X', 'Zhou R', 'Shi C', 'Tao W', 'Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou G', 'Li J', 'Zhang Z', 'Sun S']","[""Department of Oral and Maxillofacial-Head & Neck Oncology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200011, P.R.

This child had previously undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia and was suspected to have hepatobiliary graft versus host disease. Liver biopsy was performed to confirm the unexpected focal nodular hyperplasia and look for concurrent graft versus host disease. Focal nodular hyperplasia was histologically confirmed on a background of diffuse liver damage in keeping with polypharmacotherapy, steatosis and sepsis. An element of graft versus host disease was not excluded but was not confidently shown in the sample of the lesion. This case report describes and illustrates how contrast-enhanced ultrasound may be of use to further assess hepatic lesions in a complex case of multifactorial hepatic pathology. Radiologists, haematologists and pathologists should be aware that multifocal focal nodular hyperplasia is part of the differential diagnosis of liver lesions in a child with liver damage due to complex disease and treatment. Biopsy remains the gold standard, if there is a concurrent clinical suspicion of graft versus host disease.","['Verhagen, M V', 'Ciocarlie, O', 'Humphries, P', 'Watson, T']","['Verhagen MV', 'Ciocarlie O', 'Humphries P', 'Watson T']","['Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', 'Haematology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', 'Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', 'Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180813,United States,Ultrasound,"Ultrasound (Leeds, England)",101244122,,,,PMC6475970,['NOTNLM'],"['Graft versus host disease', 'Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'contrast-enhanced ultrasound', 'focal nodular hyperplasia', 'post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease']",,2019/05/01 06:00,2019/05/01 06:01,['2019/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1742271X18795328 [doi]', '10.1177_1742271X18795328 [pii]']",ppublish,Ultrasound. 2019 May;27(2):122-126. doi: 10.1177/1742271X18795328.

MTOR-S6K1 and MEK-ERK signals are also transduced to GLI activators through post-translational modifications. The GLI transcription network up-regulates target genes, such as BCL2, FOXA2, FOXE1, FOXF1, FOXL1, FOXM1, GLI1, HHIP, PTCH1 and WNT2B, in a cellular context-dependent manner. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling in tumor cells leads to self-renewal, survival, proliferation and invasion. Paracrine Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which harbors cancer-associated fibroblasts, leads to angiogenesis, fibrosis, immune evasion and neuropathic pain. Hedgehog-related genetic alterations occur frequently in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (85%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma (87%) and less frequently in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Among investigational SMO inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib are approved for the treatment of patients with BCC, and glasdegib is approved for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Resistance to SMO inhibitors is caused by acquired SMO mutations, SUFU deletions, GLI2 amplification, other by-passing mechanisms of GLI activation and WNT/beta-catenin signaling activation. GLI-DNA-interaction inhibitors (glabrescione B and GANT61), GLI2 destabilizers (arsenic trioxide and pirfenidone) and a GLI-deacetylation inhibitor (4SC-202) were shown to block GLI-dependent transcription and tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. By contrast, SMO inhibitors can remodel the immunosuppressive TME that is dominated by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and thus, a Phase I/II clinical trial of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib in BCC patients is ongoing.","['Katoh, Masaru']",['Katoh M'],"['Department of Omics Network, National Cancer Center, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ward, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan mkatoh-kkr@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190429,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Genetic Testing', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Immune-oncology', '*angiogenesis', '*cancer', '*hedgehog', '*therapeutics', '*tumor microenvironments']",,2019/05/01 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/05/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['CS20180845 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20180845 [doi]']",epublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2019 Apr 29;133(8):953-970. doi: 10.1042/CS20180845.

Our previous study has identified 29 miRNAs that are highly expressed in gastric cancer stem cells. One of these miRNAs, miR-1915-3p, has shown great potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the cancers in liver, colon and thyroid, as well as in immune and kidney diseases. Herein, we found that miR-1915-3p exhibited low expression level in differentiated gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues. It was found that the miR-1915-3p inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells and thus promoted cell apoptosis. We discovered that the expressions of miR-1915-3p were significantly correlated to the lymph node metastasis and overall survival of patients with gastric cancer. Further study showed that there was a negative correlation between miR-1915-3p and Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2) expression, suggesting that Bcl-2 was a target gene of miR-1915-3p. Hence, miR-1915-3p possibly contributes to the development and progression of gastric cancer by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The finding provides a potential therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.","['Cui, Hong-Wei', 'Han, Wen-Yan', 'Hou, Li-Na', 'Yang, Ling', 'Li, Xian', 'Su, Xiu-Lan']","['Cui HW', 'Han WY', 'Hou LN', 'Yang L', 'Li X', 'Su XL']","['Department of Cell Biology, Capital Medical University, 10 You An Men Wai Street, Fengtai District, Beijing 100069, China.', 'Clinical Medical Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 Tong Dao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Clinical Medical Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 Tong Dao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Clinical Medical Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 Tong Dao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Clinical Medical Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 Tong Dao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Clinical Medical Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 Tong Dao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Capital Medical University, 10 You An Men Wai Street, Fengtai District, Beijing 100069, China xlsu_cmu@foxmail.com.', 'Clinical Medical Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, 1 Tong Dao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190515,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN1915 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC6522727,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Bcl-2', '*Bcl-XL', '*Gastric cancer', '*miR-1915-3p']",,2019/05/01 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20182321 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20182321 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2019 May 15;39(5). pii: BSR20182321. doi: 10.1042/BSR20182321.

Luciferase-based measurement served as a quantitative read-out for target cell viability. Additionally, we set up a confocal live imaging protocol to monitor effector cell recruitment and cytolytic activity at a single organoid level. As proof of principle, we demonstrated efficient targeting in diverse organoid models using CAR-engineered NK-92 cells directed toward a ubiquitous epithelial antigen (EPCAM). Tumor antigen-specific cytotoxicity was studied with CAR-NK-92 cells targeting organoids expressing EGFRvIII, a neoantigen found in several cancers.

DESIGN: Retrospective case review series from 2004 through 2018 to identify all cases of cytologically proven granulomatous vitritis and to analyze its disease associations and causes. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three patients with a cytologic diagnosis of granulomatous vitritis were identified, 8 of whom demonstrated systemic malignancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To identify a clinical profile of the 8 cases of granulomatous vitritis occurring in the setting of systemic malignancy, focusing on the timing of the eye presentation compared with the timing of the systemic malignancy. METHODS: Patients with a cytologic diagnosis of granulomatous vitritis seeking treatment from 2004 through 2018 were included in this retrospective case series. Case notes were recalled and reviewed for demographic features, medical history, presenting symptoms, investigations, surgical procedures, and follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed cytologically with granulomatous vitritis. Ten of 23 patients (43%) showed autoimmune and infectious causes, 5 of 23 patients (22%) showed were idiopathic causes, and 8 of 23 patients' (35%) disease was associated with systemic malignancy. In the latter group, the median age at presentation was 70 years (range, 55-89 years). Six patients showed bilateral disease, and the remaining 3 showed unilateral disease. Three of 8 patients showed primary systemic malignancy diagnosed after eye symptoms and 5 of 8 showed malignancy before the eye symptoms. These latter 5 patients all demonstrated a major relapse, metastasis, or both at the time of eye symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Paraneoplastic vitritis is primarily a disease of older age, with 67% of those affected older than 65 years. Ophthalmologists should maintain a high index of suspicion of paraneoplastic cause in bilateral posterior segment inflammation of uncertain origin, presenting for the first time, or heralding malignancy recurrence or metastasis in known cases of malignancy.","['McGrath, Lindsay A', 'Mudhar, Hardeep S', 'Sheard, Richard', 'Spiteri-Cornish, Kurt', 'Winder, Stephen', 'Rundle, Paul', 'Rennie, Ian G']","['McGrath LA', 'Mudhar HS', 'Sheard R', 'Spiteri-Cornish K', 'Winder S', 'Rundle P', 'Rennie IG']","['Sheffield Ocular Oncology Service, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'National Specialist Ophthalmic Pathology Service, Department of Histopathology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: To investigate the epidemiology of HBV infection in Goiania, Central Brazil, 322 individuals with oncohematological diseases (leukemias, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) were interviewed and blood samples were collected for the detection of serological markers of HBV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Medical records of participants were also reviewed. RESULTS: Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (n=99) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n=108) were the most frequent oncohematological diseases. The overall prevalence of HBV was 13.97% (45/322). Of the total participants, 8.69% (28/322) presented isolated positivity for anti-HBs, suggesting low vaccine coverage. HBV-DNA was detected in 25% (1/4) of HBsAg positive samples and in 25% (3/12) of anti-HBc isolated, suggesting HBV occult infection. All samples were identified as subgenotype A1. Entries in patient records and the findings of this investigation suggest anti-HBc seroconversion during oncologic treatment. Age 50 years or over and use of a central catheter during therapy were associated with HBV exposure. CONCLUSION: The low frequency of hepatitis B immunized individuals, detection of HBV DNA in HBsAg negative samples, and the suggestion of HBV exposure during treatment evidenced the potential for health-related viral dissemination in people with oncohematological diseases in our region, reinforcing the importance of serological monitoring, vaccination against hepatitis B, and adoption of strict infection control measures in these individuals.","['Pessoni, Grecia C', 'Marinho, Tassia A', 'Carneiro, Megmar M Santos', 'Martins, Regina M', 'Soares, Caroline C', 'Silva, Leandro N', 'Matos, Marcia A', 'Arantes, Adriano M', 'Teles, Juliana A', 'Santos, Nathalia C', 'Araujo Teles, Sheila']","['Pessoni GC', 'Marinho TA', 'Carneiro MMS', 'Martins RM', 'Soares CC', 'Silva LN', 'Matos MA', 'Arantes AM', 'Teles JA', 'Santos NC', 'Araujo Teles S']","['Secretaria Municipal de Saude, Goiania, GO, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG), Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG), Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG), Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG), Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Secretaria Municipal de Saude, Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG), Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Hospital Araujo Jorge, Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Hospital Naval Marcilio Dias, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Goias (PUC Goias), Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG), Goiania, GO, Brazil.

While multiple mutations have been identified which may serve as drivers of the MDS clone, there is accumulating evidence that MDS clones and subclones are subject to modulation by the marrow microenvironment and its inflammatory milieu. There is also a strong link between autoimmune disorders and MDS. In this review, we examine the role of inflammatory cytokines, toll like receptors, pyroptosis, stromal cells, and cellular inflammatory mediators in MDS initiation, propagation, and progression. These contributions in a background of mutational, epigenetic, and aging changes in the marrow are also reviewed. Such inflammatory mediators may be subject to therapeutic agents which will enhance suppression of the MDS clone with potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in this disease which is usually incurable in aged patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation.","['Banerjee, Titas', 'Calvi, Laura M', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Liesveld, Jane L']","['Banerjee T', 'Calvi LM', 'Becker MW', 'Liesveld JL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows detection of low-level kinase domain mutations, but its relevance in clinical practice remains debated. We aimed to examine the clinical effects of low-level kinase domain mutations identified using NGS in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: In this population-based study, we included consecutive patients newly diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and patients identified at the time of resistance to first-line treatment with imatinib at six institutions (teaching hospitals and district hospitals) in southeast England. We screened patients for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations using NGS, irrespective of patient response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. When we detected a mutation with NGS, we retrospectively analysed all previous samples to establish the date of first occurrence and subsequent kinetics of the mutant subclone (or subclones). The primary endpoints of this study were progression-free and event-free survival at 5 years. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2014, we screened 121 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation. 99 consecutive patients were newly diagnosed, with available sequential RNA stored. The remaining 22 patients were diagnosed between June 1, 1999, and June 30, 2006, and were screened at the time of resistance to first-line treatment with imatinib. Imatinib was the first-line treatment for 111 patients, nilotinib for seven patients, and dasatinib for three patients. We detected a kinase domain mutation in 25 (21%) of 121 patients. Low-level kinase domain mutations were first identified in 17 (68%) of 25 patients with mutation. For patients with a complete cytogenetic response, 13 (14%) of 93 patients screened had a mutation. Five (71%) of the seven patients with a clinically relevant mutation lost complete cytogenetic response compared with 15 (17%) of 86 patients without a clinically relevant mutation (80 patients without mutation and six patients with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive mutation, p=0.0031). Patients harbouring a mutant clone had poorer 5-year progression-free survival (65.3% [95% CI 40.5-81.8] vs 86.9% [75.8-93.2]; p=0.0161) and poorer 5-year event-free survival (22.2% [CI 5.6-45.9] vs 62.0% [50.4-71.6]; p<0.0001) than did patients without a mutation. We identified a kinase domain mutation in four (10%) of 41 patients with samples available at 3 months after starting first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment; all four subsequently progressed to accelerated phase disease compared with only three (8%) of 37 without a mutation (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: NGS reliably and consistently detected early appearance of kinase domain mutations that would not otherwise be detected by Sanger sequencing. For the first time, to our knowledge, we report the presence of kinase domain mutations after only 3 months of therapy, which could have substantial clinical implications. NGS will allow early clinical intervention and our findings will contribute to the establishment of new recommendations on the frequency of kinase domain mutation analysis to improve patient clinical care.

In this research as a target we have used human leukemic cell line IM9 (IM9). IM9 was derived from the patient with a multiple myeloma and expressed cluster of differentiation proteins capital ES, CyrillicD19 on the surface of 85-95% here investigated cancer cells. As a control sample healthy human's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used and the expression of CD19 protein was found only in 5-9% of these cells. Two types of antibodies labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were used for the labeling of human leukemic cells: FITC-conjugated mouse antibodies against Human CD19 protein (anti-CD19-FITC*) and FITC-conjugated mouse antibodies against Human IgG1 protein (anti-IgG1-FITC*). In order to demonstrate the applicability of zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO-NRs) based platforms three types of ZnO-NRs-based structures were investigated: (i) ZnO-NRs modified by anti-CD19-FITC*; (ii) ZnO-NRs modified by IM9 cells, which were pre-incubated with anti-CD19-FITC*; (iii) ZnO-NRs modified by PBMC cells, which were pre-incubated with anti-CD19-FITC*. It was demonstrated that IM9 cells after specific interaction with anti-CD19-FITC* bind to ZnO-NRs (ZnO-NRs/IM9+anti-CD19-FITC*) and photoluminescence based signal significantly increase in comparison with that observed in control samples, which contained PBMC cells incubated with anti-CD19-FITC*(ZnO-NRs/PBMC+anti-CD19-FITC*). The photoluminescence results are in good correlation with the data obtained by flow cytometry. This study illustrate that ZnO-NRs exhibit a photoluminescence signal suitable for the determination of anti-CD19-FITC* labeled IM9 cell line at concentrations - from 10 till 500 cells adsorbed per 1mm(2) of ZnO-NRs platform.","['Tamashevski, Alexander', 'Harmaza, Yuliya', 'Viter, Roman', 'Jevdokimovs, Daniels', 'Poplausks, Raimond', 'Slobozhanina, Ekaterina', 'Mikoliunaite, Lina', 'Erts, Donats', 'Ramanaviciene, Almira', 'Ramanavicius, Arunas']","['Tamashevski A', 'Harmaza Y', 'Viter R', 'Jevdokimovs D', 'Poplausks R', 'Slobozhanina E', 'Mikoliunaite L', 'Erts D', 'Ramanaviciene A', 'Ramanavicius A']","['Institute of Biophysics and Cell Engineering of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Akademicheskaya St. 27, Minsk 220072, Belarus.

GATA2 deficiency presents with multi-lineage cytopenia, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections. Patients with GATA2 mutation have a high risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We described a 43 years-old white male with 20-year follow-up of autoimmune and thrombotic phenomena, hypothyroidism, disseminated refractory Mycobacterium kansasii infection and MonoMAC syndrome. GATA2 c.1061 C > T; p.T354 M mutation was identified after he progressed from myelodysplastic pancytopenia to refractory anemia with excess blasts type II. His relatives were also investigated and he underwent unsuccessful haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We discuss the clinical features, genetic diagnosis and treatment of this immunodeficiency disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the challenge how a multidisciplinary disease should be handle. Once usual causes of immunodeficiency were excluded, clinicians should considerGATA2 deficiency in patients with myelodysplasia and long-standing Mycobacterium kansasii infection.","['Mendes-de-Almeida, Daniela Palheiro', 'Andrade, Francianne Gomes', 'Borges, Gustavo', 'Dos Santos-Bueno, Filipe V', 'Vieira, Iracema F', 'da Rocha, Luana Kelly M da S', 'Mendes-da-Cruz, Daniella A', 'Zancope-Oliveira, Rosely M', 'Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Mendes-de-Almeida DP', 'Andrade FG', 'Borges G', 'Dos Santos-Bueno FV', 'Vieira IF', 'da Rocha LKMDS', 'Mendes-da-Cruz DA', 'Zancope-Oliveira RM', 'Calado RT', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Division of Hematology, Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, 6thfloor, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer-INCa, Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, Zip code: 20231- 050, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, 6thfloor, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer-INCa, Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, Zip code: 20231- 050, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, 6thfloor, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer-INCa, Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, Zip code: 20231- 050, Brazil.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital dos Servidores do Estado, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncologia D'Or, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."", 'Laboratory on Thymus Research, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Institute of Science and Technology on Neuroimmunomodulation (INCT-NIM), Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Mycology, Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, 6thfloor, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer-INCa, Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, Zip code: 20231- 050, Brazil. mpombo@inca.gov.br.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190429,England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'GATA2 Deficiency/*genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous/complications/drug therapy/*genetics/*microbiology', 'Mycobacterium kansasii/*isolation & purification', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",PMC6489290,['NOTNLM'],"['*GATA-2 mutation', '*MonoMAC syndrome', '*Mycobacterium kansasii', '*Myelodysplasia', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome']",,2019/05/01 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2019/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12881-019-0799-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12881-019-0799-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2019 Apr 29;20(1):64. doi: 10.1186/s12881-019-0799-6.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1507-004X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of AML is poor, with five-year overall survival rates of less than 10% for the predominant group of patients older than 65 years. One of the main reasons for this poor outcome is that the majority of AML patients will relapse, even after they have attained complete remission by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, supplemented with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients at high risk of relapse, is still the cornerstone of current AML treatment. Both therapies are, however, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These observations illustrate the need for more effective and less toxic treatment options, especially in elderly AML and have fostered the development of novel immune-based strategies to treat AML. One of these strategies involves the use of a special type of immune cells, the dendritic cells (DCs). As central orchestrators of the immune system, DCs are key to the induction of anti-leukemia immunity. In this review, we provide an update of the clinical experience that has been obtained so far with this form of immunotherapy in patients with AML.","['Van Acker, Heleen H', 'Versteven, Maarten', 'Lichtenegger, Felix S', 'Roex, Gils', 'Campillo-Davo, Diana', 'Lion, Eva', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo F', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Anguille, Sebastien']","['Van Acker HH', 'Versteven M', 'Lichtenegger FS', 'Roex G', 'Campillo-Davo D', 'Lion E', 'Subklewe M', 'Van Tendeloo VF', 'Berneman ZN', 'Anguille S']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium. heleen.vanacker@uantwerpen.be.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium. maarten.versteven@uantwerpen.be.', 'Department of Medicine III, LMU Munich, University Hospital, 80799 Munich, Germany.

METHODS: This was a prospective monocentric study including all allo-HSCT patients included in the previous FLAM/FLAL study (Peterlin et al., 2019). Blood samples collected before the start of conditioning then post-transplant were frozen, stored and tested by ELISA. The parameters considered were hematopoietic recoveries, Leukemia Free Survival and Overall Survival, acute and chronic GVHD, grade 3 or 4 acute and/or extensive chronic GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS). RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included, a total of 179 samples were assayed for sFLc. There was no impact of sFLc levels (<=median vs>median) on acute and chronic GVHD incidences, LFS, OS nor GRFS. CONCLUSION: At variance with induction results for AML (Peterlin et al., 2019) endogenous sFLc do not appear to be a prognostic marker at the time of or after allo-HSCT. Even though the results are negatives, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the only prospective series specifically addressing the question of sFLc impact after allo-HSCT in acute leukemias.","['Peterlin, Pierre', 'Gaschet, Joelle', 'Guillaume, Thierry', 'Garnier, Alice', 'Eveillard, Marion', 'Le Bourgeois, Amandine', 'Cherel, Michel', 'Debord, Camille', 'Le Bris, Yannick', 'Theisen, Olivier', 'Mahe, Beatrice', 'Dubruille, Viviane', 'Godon, Catherine', 'Robillard, Nelly', 'Wuilleme, Soraya', 'Touzeau, Cyrille', 'Gastinne, Thomas', 'Blin, Nicolas', 'Lok, Anne', 'Bonnet, Antoine', 'Le Gouill, Steven', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Bene, Marie-C', 'Chevallier, Patrice']","['Peterlin P', 'Gaschet J', 'Guillaume T', 'Garnier A', 'Eveillard M', 'Le Bourgeois A', 'Cherel M', 'Debord C', 'Le Bris Y', 'Theisen O', 'Mahe B', 'Dubruille V', 'Godon C', 'Robillard N', 'Wuilleme S', 'Touzeau C', 'Gastinne T', 'Blin N', 'Lok A', 'Bonnet A', 'Le Gouill S', 'Moreau P', 'Bene MC', 'Chevallier P']","[""Hematology Clinic, CHU Nantes, France; CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.

The cytoplasmic 16-amino acid peptide of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MLV) Env protein, called the R-peptide, also inhibits the membrane fusion activity of the Env protein. However, the molecular mechanism of the inhibition has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we found that R-peptide-containing Env protein of E-MLV binds to the cell surface receptor cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) with weaker affinity than R-peptide-truncated Env protein. Consistent with this result, R-peptide-containing Env protein had less efficient inhibition of E-MLV vector infection than R-peptide-truncated Env protein. R-peptide truncation has been reported to induce conformational change in the surface subunit of E-MLV Env protein that interacts with the receptor. Taken together, our findings indicate that R-peptide truncation induces conformational change in the receptor-binding domain of the E-MLV Env protein and facilitates the Env-receptor interaction.","['Kubo, Yoshinao', 'Izumida, Mai', 'Togawa, Kei', 'Zhang, Fengmin', 'Hayashi, Hideki']","['Kubo Y', 'Izumida M', 'Togawa K', 'Zhang F', 'Hayashi H']","['Program for Nurturing Global Leaders in Tropical Medicine and Emerging Communicable Diseases, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.

We previously demonstrated that SG promoted apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of SG on apoptosis in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with various SG concentrations, and cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptotic signal proteins were detected by western blotting, and cell apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that SG induced nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species production, and increased cell apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. SG also suppressed migration and invasion, likely via blockage of the MAPK pathway. In the apoptotic signaling pathway, SG increased cleaved caspase-8, caspase-3, and caspase-9. SG treatment also decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, increased Bax expression, and prompted release of more cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm in MDA-MB-231 cells.

We aimed to evaluate the genomic ETV6-RUNX1 fusion sites as a single marker for MRD quantification. PROCEDURE: In a representative, uniformly treated cohort of pediatric relapsed ALL patients (n = 52), ETV6-RUNX1 fusion sites were compared to the current gold standard, immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor (Ig/TCR) gene rearrangements. RESULTS: Primer/probe sets designed to ETV6-RUNX1 fusions achieved significantly more frequent a sensitivity and a quantitative range of at least 10(-4) compared to the gold standard with 100% and 73% versus 76% and 47%, respectively. The breakpoint sequence was identical at diagnosis and relapse in all tested cases. There was a high degree of concordance between quantitative MRD results assessed using ETV6-RUNX1 and the highest Ig/TCR marker (Spearman's 0.899, P < .01) with differences >(1/2) log-step in only 6% of patients. A high proportion of ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL relapses (40%) in our cohort showed a poor response to induction treatment at relapse, and therefore had an indication for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, demonstrating the need of accurate identification of this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: ETV6-RUNX1 fusion sites are highly sensitive and reliable MRD markers. Our data confirm that they are unaffected by clonal evolution and selection during front-line and second-line chemotherapy in contrast to Ig/TCR rearrangements, which require several markers per patient to compensate for the observed loss of target clones. In future studies, the genomic ETV6-RUNX1 fusion can be used as single MRD marker.","['Hoffmann, Jana', 'Krumbholz, Manuela', 'Gutierrez, Helia Pimentel', 'Fillies, Marion', 'Szymansky, Annabell', 'Bleckmann, Kirsten', 'Zur Stadt, Udo', 'Kohler, Rolf', 'Kuiper, Roland P', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Metzler, Markus']","['Hoffmann J', 'Krumbholz M', 'Gutierrez HP', 'Fillies M', 'Szymansky A', 'Bleckmann K', 'Zur Stadt U', 'Kohler R', 'Kuiper RP', 'Horstmann M', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Eckert C', 'Metzler M']","['Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Center for Diagnostics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190429,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genomics/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*fusion gene', '*genomic breakpoint', '*minimal residual disease', '*response monitoring']",,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2018/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27780 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Aug;66(8):e27780. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27780.

Despite their clinical success, TKIs are faced with challenges such as treatment resistance, which may be driven by kinase domain mutations, and frequent disease relapse upon the cessation of treatment. The combination of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and interferon-alpha (IFN) was previously demonstrated to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in CML cell lines, prolong the survival of primary wild-type CML mice, and dramatically decrease the activity of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). METHODS: The ATO/IFN combination was tested in vitro on imatinib (IMN)-resistant K562-R and Ar230-R cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assays were used to evaluate proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The acridine orange assay was used to assess autophagy, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the involvement of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway. In vivo, a retroviral transduction/transplantation T315I BCR-ABL CML mouse model was used to assay the effect of the treatment on survival, tumor burden (histopathology and blood counts), and LIC activity (secondary transplantation). RESULTS: In vitro, ATO/IFN synergized to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of IMN-resistant cells with variant modes of resistance. Furthermore, the preclinical effects of ATO/IFN were associated with induction of autophagy along with inhibition of the Hh pathway. Most remarkably, ATO/IFN significantly prolonged the survival of primary T315I-CML mice and displayed a dramatic impairment of disease engraftment in secondary mice, which reflected decreased LIC activity. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the ATO/IFN strategy has been demonstrated to have the potential to lead to durable remissions in TKI-resistant CML preclinical models and to overcome various TKI-specific mechanisms of resistance.","['El Eit, Rabab', 'Itani, Abdul Rahman', 'Nassar, Farah', 'Rasbieh, Nagham', 'Jabbour, Mark', 'Santina, Ahmad', 'Zaatari, Ghazi', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Nasr, Rihab']","['El Eit R', 'Itani AR', 'Nassar F', 'Rasbieh N', 'Jabbour M', 'Santina A', 'Zaatari G', 'Mahon FX', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Nasr R']","['Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'French National Institute of Health and Medical Research Unit 876, Laboratory of Hematology and Department of Blood Diseases, University Hospital Center of Bordeaux, Bordeaux Segalen University, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190429,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/administration & dosage', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*T315I', '*arsenic trioxide (ATO)', '*chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*interferon-alpha (IFN)', '*leukemia-initiating cells (LICs)']",,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32130 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Aug 15;125(16):2818-2828. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32130.

The DNA methylation profiling of the il-10 gene locus revealed a novel epigenetic signature characterizing murine B cells ready to respond through IL-10 synthesis: a demethylated region located 4.5 kb from the transcription starting site (TSS), that we named early IL10 regulatory region (eIL10rr). This feature allows to distinguish B cells that are immediately prone and developmentally committed to IL-10 production from those that require a persistent stimulation to exert an IL-10-mediated regulatory function.

Following the launch of the National Radon Program in 2007, Health Canada completed a long-term radon survey in 33 census metropolitan areas (CMAs), which covers about 70% of the Canadian population. We used this data, together with leukaemia and lymphoma incidence rates among children (0-14 years of age) in the past decade (2006-15), and tried to link the city-level average radon concentrations to the leukaemia and lymphoma incidence rates in 33 major Canadian cities. Analyses were conducted for six subtypes (ALL, AML, CMD, HL, NHL and BL) of leukaemia and lymphoma. Estimated doses to red bone marrow from domestic radon exposure were low and we did not find any association between radon exposure at home and the increased risk for developing leukaemia among children under 15 years of age living in the CMAs. The results indicate a slight positive association for AML among 1-4 year males in CMAs of Peer Group C and NHL among 5-9 year females in CMAs of Peer Group A; however, these should be interpreted with caution owing to the crude exposure assessment and possibilities of other confounding factors.","['Chen, Jing', 'Xie, Lin']","['Chen J', 'Xie L']","['Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada, 775 Brookfield Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Centre for Surveillance and Applied Research, Public Health Agency Canada, 785 Carling Avenue, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation Monitoring/methods', 'Radon/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['5481562 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncz068 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2019 Oct 1;184(3-4):486-492. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncz068.,,"['(c) Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2019.

Probiotics are microorganisms that can restore gut microbiota and may help alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal side effects in children with acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: In this randomized pilot study, patients under 17 years of age diagnosed with AL who were on remission induction or remission reinduction chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive probiotic supplementation (a concentration of 5x109 CFU per sachet was administered at a standard dose twice daily, by mouth) or no probiotic supplementation. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of gastrointestinal side effects. Vomiting, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention were assessed in both groups. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal side effects were less prevalent in the probiotic group, and 3 of the 8 gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension) significantly decreased in the probiotic group (P<0.05). We found for diarrhea a relative risk of 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-1.2; P=0.04); for nausea an RR of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.4-0.8; P=0.04) and for vomiting an RR of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P=0.04).

Transcriptome-wide maps of the A-to-I editing exist, yet functions for the majority of editing sites remain opaque. Herein we discuss how hematology has been applied to determine physiological and malignant functions of A-to-I editing. RECENT FINDINGS: Functional studies have established that A-to-I editing and ADAR1, responsible for the majority of editing in blood cells, are essential for normal blood cell homeostasis. ADAR1 edits endogenous RNA and reshapes its secondary structure, preventing MDA5 from perceiving the cells own RNA as pathogenic. Roles for ADAR1 in human leukaemia, and most recently, cancer cell intrinsic and extrinsic functions of ADAR1 have been identified that highlight ADAR1 as a therapeutic target in cancer. SUMMARY: The studies reviewed have identified the key physiological function of ADAR1 and mechanistic basis for A-to-I editing in normal physiology and have now been extended to cancer. As our understanding of the biology and consequences of A-to-I editing evolve, it may be possible to target ADAR1 function advantageously in a number of settings.","['Heraud-Farlow, Jacki E', 'Chalk, Alistair M', 'Walkley, Carl R']","['Heraud-Farlow JE', 'Chalk AM', 'Walkley CR']","[""St. Vincent's Institute."", ""Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Fitzroy."", ""St. Vincent's Institute."", ""Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Fitzroy."", ""St. Vincent's Institute."", ""Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Fitzroy."", 'Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.37 (ADAR protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/blood/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Deaminase/blood/*metabolism', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inosine/blood/*metabolism', '*RNA Editing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/blood/*metabolism']",,,,,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000514 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Jul;26(4):241-248. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000514.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the potentially unique microenvironmental regulation of LSCs is key to understanding in-vivo leukemogenic mechanisms and developing novel antileukemic therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: When leukemic cells are engrafted in the stem cell niche, the cellular nature of the niche - including mesenchymal stromal cells - is reprogramed. Altered mesenchymal cells selectively support leukemic cells and reinforce the pro-leukemic environment. As the niche plays an active role in leukemogenesis, its remodeling may significantly influence the leukemogenic pattern, and cause differences in clinical prognosis. Notably, niche cells could be stimulated to revert to a pronormal/antileukemic state, creating potential for niche-based antileukemic therapy. SUMMARY: Bone marrow microenvironments are under dynamic regulation for normal and leukemic cells, and there is bi-directional control of leukemic cells in the niche. Leukemic cells are both protected by stroma and able to reprogram stromal cells to transform the niche to a state, which reinforces leukemogenesis. Because of its dynamic nature, the niche could be converted to an environment with antileukemic properties, making it an attractive target for therapy.","['Oh, Il-Hoan', 'Jeong, Seon-Yeong', 'Kim, Jin-A']","['Oh IH', 'Jeong SY', 'Kim JA']","['Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center.', 'Department of Medical Lifescience, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center.', 'Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', '*Stem Cell Niche']",,,,,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000508 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Jul;26(4):249-257. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000508.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proper diagnosis and classification of MPAL is extremely important for patients' outcome. Morphology and flow cytometry recognize two types of MPAL: the ""bilineal"" MPAL with the coexistence of two blast populations of different lineage and truly ""biphenotypic"" MPAL coexpressing markers of more than one lineage in a homogenous blast population, respectively. The WHO 2008 classification further delineated three categories: associated with t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, associated with KMT2A (mixed lineage leukemia) rearrangements, and nonotherwise specified. These categories remained unchanged in the WHO2016 update. Molecular studies have further underlined the heterogeneity of MPAL. In this review, rules for the correct assignment of acute leukemia to the MPAL category are discussed, including both flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry on bone marrow or other tissues biopsies. Comparison of the immunophenotypic classification proposals is provided outlining the explorations mandatory for definitive diagnosis. An extensive review of published data summarizes the reported cytogenetic and molecular anomalies. New developments in the understanding of the early stages of hematopoiesis provide clues to the possible etiopathology of these diseases. Finally, current treatment recommendations are summarized and referenced for clinical use, pointing out that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at an early stage should be considered (at least in adult patients).

The JAK2 V617F is the most common mutation in Philadelphia negative patients and results in a constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, conferring a proliferative advantage and apoptosis inhibition. Recent studies identified a functional crosstalk between the JAK/STAT and mTOR pathways. The identification of an effective therapy is often difficult, so the availability of new therapeutic approaches might be attractive. Previous studies showed that curcumin, the active principle of the Curcuma longa, can suppress JAK2/STAT pathways in different type of cancer and injuries. In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of curcumin in JAK2 V617F-mutated cells. HEL cell line and cells from patients JAK2 V617F mutated have been incubated with increasing concentrations of curcumin for different time. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated. Subsequently, JAK2/STAT and AKT/mTOR pathways were investigated at both RNA and protein levels. We found that curcumin induces apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in HEL cells. Furthermore, we showed that curcumin inhibits JAK2/STAT and mTORC1 pathways in JAK2 V617F-mutated cells. This inhibition suggests that curcumin could represent an alternative strategy to be explored for the treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Petiti, Jessica', 'Rosso, Valentina', 'Lo Iacono, Marco', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Calabrese, Chiara', 'Signorino, Elisabetta', 'Pironi, Lucrezia', 'Cartella, Antonio', 'Bracco, Enrico', 'Pergolizzi, Barbara', 'Beltramo, Tiziana', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Cilloni, Daniela']","['Petiti J', 'Rosso V', 'Lo Iacono M', 'Panuzzo C', 'Calabrese C', 'Signorino E', 'Pironi L', 'Cartella A', 'Bracco E', 'Pergolizzi B', 'Beltramo T', 'Fava C', 'Cilloni D']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'SSD Transfusional Center, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190429,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",PMC6533565,['NOTNLM'],"['*JAK/STAT', '*JAK2 V617F', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*curcumin', '*mTORC1']",,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/07/30 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14326 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2019 Jun;23(6):4349-4357. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14326.

METHODS: Participants included 188 parent-child dyads; children were at least 8 years of age, 5 years postdiagnosis of ALL, and previously treated with chemotherapy only. Parents completed the Parental Protection Scale (PPS), Child Vulnerability Scale (CVS), and Decision-Making Questionnaire (DMQ). Children completed measures of executive functioning and general cognitive abilities. Multivariate multiple regression examined associations between child executive functioning and parenting, while controlling for child age, treatment risk, maternal education, and child intelligence quotient. An exploratory aim identified latent profiles of parenting capacities. RESULTS: Higher child cognitive flexibility (beta = -0.16, P = .02) and planning abilities (beta = -0.16, P = .049) were related to less parental overprotection. No other neurocognitive measures were related to child autonomy in decision making or perceived child vulnerability. For the exploratory aim, we found (a) a large class defined by normative parenting (94.3%) and (b) a small class characterized by higher levels of child vulnerability and overprotection. Class membership was unrelated to executive functioning, but higher maternal education was related to higher odds of class 2 membership (OR = 0.58, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that parents respond to child executive function difficulties with greater overprotection, which may be adaptive but not conducive to the development of independence. Although most parents report normative levels of child vulnerability and overprotection, a small subset demonstrate parenting practices that may place some survivors at risk for adverse outcomes.","['Sharkey, Christina M', 'Clawson, Ashley H', 'Mullins, Larry L', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Sharkey CM', 'Clawson AH', 'Mullins LL', 'Brinkman TM', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR']","['Department of Psychology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma.', 'Department of Psychology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma.', 'Department of Psychology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190429,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', '*Executive Function', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parenting/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Stress, Psychological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC6657494,['NOTNLM'],"['*executive functions', '*leukemia', '*parenting', '*pediatric']",,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27761 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Aug;66(8):e27761. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27761.

METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2010 to June 2017, we collected 15 patients with VRL. Twelve patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); of these, 11 had primary central nervous system (CNS) DLBCL, one had ocular localisation of follicular lymphoma, one had extranodal NK/T-cell nasal type lymphoma and one had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The results of the cytological examination (cell morphology and immunocytochemistry) of the vitreous fluid were available for 9/15 VRL. The interleukin-10/-6 ratio was >1 in eight of 12 DLBCL. Molecular testing was useful in 6/15 cases (clonality evaluation or MYD88 L265P mutation testing). Eight out of 11 primary CNS DLBCL patients had CNS involvement, with 22-month progression-free survival. In our series, only two out of 11 CNS DLBCL patients died of disease after 2 and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The short delay to assert the diagnosis of VRL could explain the quite good prognosis in our series, which highlights the need to consider a diagnosis of DLBCL as first step. The cytological features, as a reliable way to identify VRL, must always guide the choice of techniques for further investigations given the small amount of vitreous fluid available for analysis.","['Quintyn, Jean-Claude', 'Olle, Priscille', 'Courtade-Saidi, Monique', 'Laurent, Camille', 'Oberic, Lucie', 'Quintyn-Ranty, Marie-Laure']","['Quintyn JC', 'Olle P', 'Courtade-Saidi M', 'Laurent C', 'Oberic L', 'Quintyn-Ranty ML']","['Ophthalmology Department, CHU, Purpan University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Ophthalmology Department, CHU, Caen, France.', 'Normandie University, UNICAEN, CHU de Caen Normandie, Unite de recherche, UMR-S 1075 INSERM-UNICAEN, Caen, France.', 'Ophthalmology Department, CHU, Purpan University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Pathology and Cytology Department, CHU, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole, University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Pathology and Cytology Department, CHU, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole, University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematology Department, CHU, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole, University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Pathology and Cytology Department, CHU, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole, University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Pathology Department, CHU, Caen, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190523,England,Cytopathology,Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,9010345,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', '*Cytodiagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Vitreous Body/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cytology', '*diagnosis', '*lymphoma', '*prognosis', '*retina', '*vitreoretinal']",,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2019/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cyt.12711 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytopathology. 2019 Jul;30(4):385-392. doi: 10.1111/cyt.12711.

Although LS usually occurs alone, its coexistence in morphea patients has been reported in 5.7% and 38.0% (genital LS) of cases, in two series (1). A 74-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of multiple asymptomatic, shiny , indurated, brownish large flat plaques located on the abdomen (Figure 1, a-b) and back, intermingled with slightly atrophic, white-colored, guttate, and patchy areas (Figure 1, d-e). Both punch biopsies of the sclerotic plaques on the back and abdomen showed findings consistent with morphea (Figure 1, c, f). Furthermore, the punch biopsy of a well-demarcated white plaque on the back revealed findings compatible with LS (Figure 1, f). Remarkably, there were also multiple white-colored lesions on the sites of pregnancy-induced striae distensae (SD) (Figure 2, a-b) on the lower abdomen and an old appendectomy scar (Figure 2, c). There was no anogenital involvement. A diagnosis of morphea-LS overlap was established and white lesions located on the surgical scar and SD were clinically evaluated as LS. Methotrexate (15 mg/week) achieved a partial regression of morphea plaques in three months. However, white LS lesions remained unchanged. Our patient presented with coexistence of LS and morphea on different sites of the trunk and on the same lesion. Additionally, one of the isolated LS lesions was located on a surgical scar. Occurrence of LS on skin grafts, irradiated areas, injection sites, or burn/surgical scars has been attributed to the Koebner phenomenon, also called isomorphic response, defined as ""the formation of the skin lesions in the same morphology of the existing disease on the areas of various cutaneous injuries"" (2). LS is classified under the Koebner category-III (occasional lesions) (2). However, in a case of morphea with features of LS that developed in 1 month following a herpes zoster infection has been suggested to represent ""Wolf's isotopic response"" (3), which was originally defined as ""the occurrence of a new skin disease at the site of another, unrelated and already healed skin disorder"" with a time interval between the first and second diseases ranging from months to several years (4). Remarkably, typical morphea plaques in our patient did not involve the surgical scar, in contrast to a cohort in which 16% of 329 patients developed initial morphea lesions at sites of prior (surgery) or ongoing/repetitive (chronic friction) skin trauma (5). SD appear on skin as atrophic linear bands mostly due to rapid weight changes, pregnancy, Cushing syndrome, or prolonged use of corticosteroids (6). The mechanism underlying the occurrence of several diseases on striae is still elusive. Blunt trauma occurring during the development of striae has been suggested to cause the Koebner phenomenon in patients with vitiligo, psoriasis, and lichen planus (7), but it has been suggested that the occurrence of leukemia cutis on SD in a patient reflects Wolf's isotopic response (8). Although chronic graft-versus-host disease, urticarial vasculitis, keloid, lupus erythematosus, diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma, and drug-induced cutaneous eruptions have been reported to occur on striae (6,9), such an association with LS as in our patient has not been previously documented in the literature. Concomitant occurrence of LS patches on different previous lesions such as a surgical scar and SD in our patient raises the possibility of a common underlying mechanism.

AML is also characterized by patients with poor long-term survival outcomes due to relapse. Many efforts have been made to understand the biological heterogeneity of AML and the challenges to develop new therapies are therefore enormous. G Protein-coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are a large attractive drug-targeted family of transmembrane proteins, and aberrant GPCR expression and GPCR-mediated signaling have been implicated in leukemogenesis of AML. This review aims to identify the molecular players of GPCR signaling, focusing on the hematopoietic system, which are involved in AML to help developing novel drug targets and therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We undertook an exhaustive and structured search of bibliographic databases for research focusing on GPCR, GPCR signaling and expression in AML. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Many scientific reports were found with compelling evidence for the involvement of aberrant GPCR expression and perturbed GPCR-mediated signaling in the development of AML. The comprehensive analysis of GPCR in AML provides potential clinical biomarkers for prognostication, disease monitoring and therapeutic guidance. It will also help to provide marker panels for monitoring in AML. We conclude that GPCR-mediated signaling is contributing to leukemogenesis of AML, and postulate that mass spectrometrybased protein profiling of primary AML cells will accelerate the discovery of potential GPCR related biomarkers for AML.","['Selheim, Frode', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Ribas, Catalina', 'Aragay, Anna M']","['Selheim F', 'Aasebo E', 'Ribas C', 'Aragay AM']","['The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 87, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular and Centro de Biologia Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" (UAM-CSIC), 28049 Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa, 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'CIBER de Enfermedades Cardiovasculares, ISCIII (CIBERCV), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Celular.

We hypothesized that the natural compound resveratrol (Res) may reverse AML drug resistance through the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. We investigated the in vitro effect of Res using human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and the ADR-resistant cell line (HL-60/ADR) and treated with either Res or ADR + Res. Cellular proliferation inhibition rate, auto-fluorescence intensity of ADR in HL-60/ADR cells and HL-60 cells, mRNA expression of Nrf2 and the drug-resistant gene MRP1, and protein expression of PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, Nrf2, and MRP1 were measured. Results showed ADR + Res had a more significant inhibitory effect than ADR alone on HL-60/ADR cells. Auto-fluorescence intensity of ADR in HL-60/ADR cells treated with ADR + Res significantly increased. No difference of the auto-fluorescence intensity of ADR was observed in HL-60 cells treated with ADR and ADR + Res. mRNA expression of Nrf2 and MRP1 significantly decreased in HL-60/ADR cells treated with both Res and ADR + Res; protein expression of PI3K, p-Akt, Nrf2, and MRP1 significantly decreased in HL-60/ADR cells treated with PI3K inhibitor, Res and ADR + Res. In conclusion, Res reverses the drug resistance of AML HL-60/ADR cells through regulation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway and MRP1 expression.","['Li, Yongjun', 'Guo, Yukai', 'Feng, Zhuang', 'Bergan, Raymond', 'Li, Bo', 'Qin, Yongliang', 'Zhao, Lianmei', 'Zhang, Zhenzhen', 'Shi, Min']","['Li Y', 'Guo Y', 'Feng Z', 'Bergan R', 'Li B', 'Qin Y', 'Zhao L', 'Zhang Z', 'Shi M']","['a Department of Clinical Laboratory , The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei, China.', 'a Department of Clinical Laboratory , The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei, China.', 'b Legacy Health and Cascade Pathology Services , Portland , Oregon, USA.', 'c Division of Hematology/Oncology , Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University , Portland , Oregon, USA.', 'd Department of Emergency , Shijiazhuang Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Shijiazhuang , Hebei, China.', 'a Department of Clinical Laboratory , The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei, China.', 'e Research Center , The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei, China.', 'c Division of Hematology/Oncology , Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University , Portland , Oregon, USA.', 'a Department of Clinical Laboratory , The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190429,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Resveratrol/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,,2019/04/30 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2019.1578387 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2019;71(6):1007-1018. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2019.1578387.

With the current therapies combined with chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, the prognosis of hematologic malignancies improved significantly. However, most hematological malignancies are still incurable. Therefore, research for novel treatment options was continuing with the natural product as one source. Icaritin is a compound extracted from a traditional Chinese herb, Epimedium Genus, and demonstrated an antitumor effect in various neoplasms including hematological malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In hematological malignancies, icaritin showed multiple cytotoxic effects to induce apoptosis, arrest the cell cycle, inhibit proliferation, promote differentiation, restrict metastasis and infiltration, and suppress the oncogenic virus. The proved underlying mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of icaritin are different in various cell types of hematological malignancies but associated with the critical cell signal pathway, including PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT3, and MAPK/ERK/JNK. Although the primary target of icaritin is still unspecified, the existing evidence indicates that icaritin is a potential novel therapeutic agent for neoplasms as with hematological malignancies. Here, in the field of hematology, we reviewed the reported activity of icaritin in hematologic malignancies and the underlying mechanisms and recognized icaritin as a candidate for therapy of hematological malignancies.","['Yang, Xiao-Jing', 'Xi, Ya-Ming', 'Li, Zi-Jian']","['Yang XJ', 'Xi YM', 'Li ZJ']","['Division of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190328,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Flavonoids)', 'UFE666UELY (icaritin)']",,"['Biological Products/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Epimedium/*chemistry', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy']",PMC6458936,,,,2019/04/30 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2018/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4860268 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Mar 28;2019:4860268. doi: 10.1155/2019/4860268. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0577-0907', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7473-7561', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6796-4176']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LDLR family members include LRP5, LRP6, and LRP8. Even though LRP5, 6, and 8 are in the same family, intriguingly, these three proteins have various roles in physiological events, as well as in regulating different mechanisms in various kinds of cancers. LRP5, LRP6, and LRP8 have been shown to play important roles in a broad panel of cancers. LRP5 is highly expressed in many tissues and is involved in the modulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion, bone development, and cholesterol metabolism, as well as cancer progression. Recently, LRP5 has also been shown to play a role in chondroblastic subtype of osteosarcoma (OS) and prostate cancer and also in noncancer case such as osteoporosis. LRP6, which has been previously discovered to share the same structures as LRP5, has also been associated with many cancer progressions such as human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCL), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition to its role in cancer progression, LRP8 (apolipoprotein E receptor 2 [APOER2]) has also been demonstrated to regulate canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway whereby this pathway plays a role in cell migration and development. Therefore, this review aimed to elucidate the role of LRP 5, 6, and 8 in regulating the cancer progression.","['Roslan, Zulaika', 'Muhamad, Mudiana', 'Selvaratnam, Lakshmi', 'Ab-Rahim, Sharaniza']","['Roslan Z', 'Muhamad M', 'Selvaratnam L', 'Ab-Rahim S']","['Institute of Medical and Molecular Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Selangor, Kampus Sungai Buloh, 47000 Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Selangor, Kampus Sungai Buloh, 47000 Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Selangor, Kampus Sungai Buloh, 47000 Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine & Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, 47500 Bandar sunway, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Selangor, Kampus Sungai Buloh, 47000 Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190326,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,PMC6457291,,,,2019/04/30 06:00,2019/04/30 06:01,['2019/04/30 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4536302 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 Mar 26;2019:4536302. doi: 10.1155/2019/4536302. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2147-1616', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4502-3559']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of the PAF1c in normal hematopoiesis is unknown. Here, we discovered that the PAF1c subunit, CDC73, is required for both fetal and adult hematopoiesis. Loss of Cdc73 in hematopoietic cells is lethal because of extensive bone marrow failure. Cdc73 has an essential cell-autonomous role for adult hematopoietic stem cell function in vivo, and deletion of Cdc73 results in cell-cycle defects in hematopoietic progenitors. Gene expression profiling indicated a differential regulation of Hoxa9/Meis1 gene programs by CDC73 in progenitors compared with AML cells, suggesting disease-specific functions. Thus, the PAF1c subunit, CDC73 is essential for hematopoietic stem cell function but exhibits leukemia-specific regulation of self-renewal gene programs in AML cells.","['Saha, Nirmalya', 'Ropa, James', 'Chen, Lili', 'Hu, Hsiangyu', 'Mysliwski, Maria', 'Friedman, Ann', 'Maillard, Ivan', 'Muntean, Andrew G']","['Saha N', 'Ropa J', 'Chen L', 'Hu H', 'Mysliwski M', 'Friedman A', 'Maillard I', 'Muntean AG']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, 7520B Medical Science Research Building I, 1150 W.

However, in prolonged follow-up, relapse has emerged as one of the major obstacles. Dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is a promising treatment to eradicate tumor cells and prevent relapse. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway substrate 8 (Eps8) gene is involved in regulating cancer progression and is considered an attractive target for specific cancer immunotherapy. The purpose of this study was to explore a combinatorial therapy using CAR-T cells and a DC vaccine such as Eps8-DCs to increase leukemia treatment efficacy. METHODS: We pulsed DCs with Eps8-derived peptides to generate Eps8-DCs, engineered T cells to express a second-generation CAR specific for CD19, and analyzed the effects of the Eps8-DCs on the in vitro expansion, phenotype and effector functions of the CD19 CAR-T cells. RESULTS: The Eps8-DCs significantly reduced the activation-induced cell death and enhanced the proliferative potential of CAR-T cells during in vitro expansion. In addition, the expanded T cells co-cultured with the Eps8-DCs exhibited an increased percentage of central memory T cells (Tcms) and a decreased percentage of effector memory T cells (Tems). The Eps8-DCs enhanced CD19 CAR-T cell immune functions, including cytokine production, CD107a degranulation activity and cytotoxicity. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that Eps8-DCs exert synergistic effect on CD19 targeting CAR-T cells and paves the way for clinical trials using the combination of DC vaccination and engineered T cells in relapsed leukemia.","['Wu, Meirong', 'Zhang, Litian', 'Zhang, Hanzhen', 'Ning, Jingxuan', 'Tu, Sanfang', 'He, Yanjie', 'Li, Yuhua']","['Wu M', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang H', 'Ning J', 'Tu S', 'He Y', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hematology, Yuncheng Central Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Yuncheng, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

We evaluated the prognostic value of bone marrow aspiration (BMA) at day 14 (D14) and impact on outcome to asses the timing of a second induction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 303 adult AML patients managed at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, from the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2014. RESULTS: Median age was 34 years (range, 18-67 years). Sixty-six percent had early blast clearance with < 5% blasts and 34% had >/= 5% blasts at BMA D14; 38 patients died early during or shortly after induction. Initial blast load (bone marrow and peripheral blood) and initial platelet count were significantly higher in those with disease that did not respond to therapy compared to those whose disease did respond to therapy at D14 (P < .001, .035, and .006, respectively). The median disease-free survival for early blast clearance at D14 was 18.5 months, versus 18.7 months for those with late response to therapy (day 28), and was only 1.3 months for patients who received immediate second-line therapy on the basis of BMA D14 (P < .001). The median overall survival for early blast clearance was 13.6 months, versus 7.2 months for those with late response to therapy, and only 1.3 months for patients who received immediate second-line therapy on the basis of BMA D14 (P < .001). CONCLUSION: BMA D14 has a significant prognostic impact on the therapeutic outcome of AML patients (complete remission, disease-free survival, and overall survival); however, a second induction in patients with BMA D14 blasts > 5% should be delayed until neutrophil recovery to minimize death in aplasia.","['El Gammal, Mosaad M', 'Owaidat, Hend M', 'Rashed, Reham A', 'Fatah, Raafat Abdel', 'Samra, Mohamed A']","['El Gammal MM', 'Owaidat HM', 'Rashed RA', 'Fatah RA', 'Samra MA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt.

YTHDF2 decreases the half-life of diverse m(6)A transcripts that contribute to the overall integrity of LSC function, including the tumor necrosis factor receptor Tnfrsf2, whose upregulation in Ythdf2-deficient LSCs primes cells for apoptosis. Intriguingly, YTHDF2 is not essential for normal HSC function, with YTHDF2 deficiency actually enhancing HSC activity. Thus, we identify YTHDF2 as a unique therapeutic target whose inhibition selectively targets LSCs while promoting HSC expansion.","['Paris, Jasmin', 'Morgan, Marcos', 'Campos, Joana', 'Spencer, Gary J', 'Shmakova, Alena', 'Ivanova, Ivayla', 'Mapperley, Christopher', 'Lawson, Hannah', 'Wotherspoon, David A', 'Sepulveda, Catarina', 'Vukovic, Milica', 'Allen, Lewis', 'Sarapuu, Annika', 'Tavosanis, Andrea', 'Guitart, Amelie V', 'Villacreces, Arnaud', 'Much, Christian', 'Choe, Junho', 'Azar, Ali', 'van de Lagemaat, Louie N', 'Vernimmen, Douglas', 'Nehme, Ali', 'Mazurier, Frederic', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Gregory, Richard I', ""O'Carroll, Donal"", 'Kranc, Kamil R']","['Paris J', 'Morgan M', 'Campos J', 'Spencer GJ', 'Shmakova A', 'Ivanova I', 'Mapperley C', 'Lawson H', 'Wotherspoon DA', 'Sepulveda C', 'Vukovic M', 'Allen L', 'Sarapuu A', 'Tavosanis A', 'Guitart AV', 'Villacreces A', 'Much C', 'Choe J', 'Azar A', 'van de Lagemaat LN', 'Vernimmen D', 'Nehme A', 'Mazurier F', 'Somervaille TCP', 'Gregory RI', ""O'Carroll D"", 'Kranc KR']","['MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4UU, UK;

Numerous natural products reveal cytotoxicity towards tumor cells. PURPOSE: The present study was aimed to determine the cytotoxicity of a betaine-type alkaloid, ungeremine, towards 9 cancer cell lines including various sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. The mode of action of this compound was further investigated. METHODS: The cytotoxicity, ferroptotic and necroptotic cell death were determined by the resazurin reduction assay. Caspase activation was evaluated using the caspase-Glo assay. Flow cytometry was applied for the analysis of cell cycle analysis (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2DCFH-DA). Apoptotic, necroptotic and autophagic markers were determined by Western blotting. CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were used for all mechanistic studies. RESULTS: Ungeremine displayed cytotoxic activity towards the 9 cancer cell lines tested, including drug-sensitive and MDR phenotypes. The IC50values obtained varied from 3.67microM (in MDA-MB-231-BCRP breast carcinoma cells) to 75.24microM (against in CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) for ungeremine and from 0.02microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin (control drug). Ungeremine induced ferroptosis, necroptosis, autophagy as well as apoptosis mediated by caspase activation, MMP alteration and increase ROS production. CONCLUSION: The present investigation showed that ungeremine is a promising cytotoxic compoundthat could be further explored in the future to develop new anticancer drugs to fight sensitive and resistant phenotypes.","['Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Bitchagno, Gabin T M', 'Kuete, Victor', 'Tane, Pierre', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Mbaveng AT', 'Bitchagno GTM', 'Kuete V', 'Tane P', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.O.

In mice exposed to 24-h feeding/fasting cycles, metformin impaired tumor growth only when administered during fasting-induced hypoglycemia. Synergistic anti-neoplastic effects of the metformin/hypoglycemia combination were mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) activation downstream of PP2A, leading to a decline in the pro-survival protein MCL-1, and cell death. Mechanistically, specific activation of the PP2A-GSK3beta axis was the sum of metformin-induced inhibition of CIP2A, a PP2A suppressor, and of upregulation of the PP2A regulatory subunit B56delta by low glucose, leading to an active PP2A-B56delta complex with high affinity toward GSK3beta.","['Elgendy, Mohamed', 'Ciro, Marco', 'Hosseini, Amir', 'Weiszmann, Jakob', 'Mazzarella, Luca', 'Ferrari, Elisa', 'Cazzoli, Riccardo', 'Curigliano, Giuseppe', 'DeCensi, Andrea', 'Bonanni, Bernardo', 'Budillon, Alfredo', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Janssens, Veerle', 'Ogris, Manfred', 'Baccarini, Manuela', 'Lanfrancone, Luisa', 'Weckwerth, Wolfram', 'Foiani, Marco', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Elgendy M', 'Ciro M', 'Hosseini A', 'Weiszmann J', 'Mazzarella L', 'Ferrari E', 'Cazzoli R', 'Curigliano G', 'DeCensi A', 'Bonanni B', 'Budillon A', 'Pelicci PG', 'Janssens V', 'Ogris M', 'Baccarini M', 'Lanfrancone L', 'Weckwerth W', 'Foiani M', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, via Adamello 16, 20139 Milan, Italy.

Day 7 bovine blastocysts developed in conventional medium were cultured further in embryonic stem cell medium with or without leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) until Day 23. At Day 14, the expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4 (OCT3/4) and VIMENTIN was significantly higher in embryos cultured with than without LIF, but embryonic disc formation was not observed. Although expression of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 17 (SOX17) mRNA was significantly lower in Day 14 embryos cultured with and without LIF than in invivo embryos, hypoblast cells formed just inside the trophoblast cells of the invitro-cultured embryos. On Day 23, expression of placental lactogen (PL) and prolactin-related protein 1 (PRP1) was not affected by LIF in invitro-cultured embryos, levels of both genes were significantly lower in the invitro than invivo embryos. Similar to invivo embryos, binucleate cell clusters seen in Day 23invitro-cultured embryos were composed of PL-negative and -positive cells.

There have been less reports of incidence of these gene mutations in Thailand especially in upper northern Thailand. This study therefore had aims to investigate the frequency and pattern of mutation in mutational hotspot of SF3B1 and SRSF2 genes among MDS patients in upper northern Thailand and to investigate the clinical features associated with the mutations. Methods: Fifty-five MDS patients who underwent treatment at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital participated in this study. The detection of SF3B1 and SRSF2 hotspot mutations was carried out using polymerase chain reaction followed by Sanger sequencing. In addition, clinical features of individual patients with these gene mutations were also investigated. Results: SF3B1 mutations (SF3B1mut) were found in 9 patients (16.4%) including E622D (1/9), R625C (1/9), H662Q (1/9), K700E (5/9), and Q699H co-mutation with K700E (1/9). SRSF2 mutations (SRSF2mut) were found in 4 patients (7.3%) which included P95H (3/4) and P95L (1/4). The SF3B1mut was associated with lower hemoglobin levels (p = 0.023) and higher platelet counts (p = 0.047) when compared with MDS patients without SF3B1mut, while SRSF2mut tended to occur in patients with a higher percentage of bone marrow blasts (p = 0.074). Conclusion: The findings confirmed the difference in frequency of SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations among different populations. Specifically, we found a co-mutation of Q699H and K700E that has not been previously reported in MDS patients in the COSMIC database. It was also found that SF3B1mut was strongly associated with low hemoglobin level, and high platelet counts whereas SRSF2mut was mostly clustered in MDS with excess blasts subsequently increasing the probability of progression to acute myeloid leukemia.","['Yimpak, Phuttirak', 'Tantiworawit, Adisak', 'Rattanathammethee, Thanawat', 'Angsuchawan, Sirinda', 'Laowatthanapong, Sikrai', 'Tasuya, Witoon', 'Bumroongkit, Kanokkan']","['Yimpak P', 'Tantiworawit A', 'Rattanathammethee T', 'Angsuchawan S', 'Laowatthanapong S', 'Tasuya W', 'Bumroongkit K']","['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.

In any case, tranquilize protection has stayed as the primary test against the adequacy of medications. Besides, having different unfriendly impacts, chemotherapy drugs are getting to be traded by characteristic modalities for growth treatment. In such manner, natural segments, for example, resveratrol and prednisolone have been recognized to sharpen the leukemic cells to modified cell demise through an arrangement of complex procedures. In this investigation, we have analyzed effect of 15, 50 and 100muM of resveratrol and 700muM of prednisolone on the human multidrug protection quality 1 (MDR1) as a notable marker for cell sedate protection. We assessed the impact of resveratrol and prednisolone on MDR1 protein expression in the CCRF-CEM cell line as an agent for intense lymphoblastic leukemia. The investigation was planned to clear up whether. Materials and methods: CCRF-CEM cells linage get under drug treatment with use of resveratrol and prednisolone. Western blot use at 24 and 48 hours with different doses of resveratrol and prednisolone to analysis of MDR1 expression changes. Results: Effect of 15, 50, and 100 micro molar of resveratrol and 700 micro molars of prednisolone on CCRF-CEM cells led to the MDR1 decrease. Western blot use for evaluation of MDR1 protein expression changes. Conclusion: In the present study, we observed that resveratrol and prednisolone, with a dose-dependent effect, can reduce the expression of the MDR1 protein. This reduction of expression demonstrates that resveratrol and prednisolone can overcome to drug resistance created by MDR1.","['Talebi, Mehdi', 'Bahar Aghdam, Sina', 'Azimi, Ako', 'Mohammadi, Hamed', 'Karimi Yonjali, Somayyeh', 'Asariha, Maryam', 'Zadi Heydarabad, Milad']","['Talebi M', 'Bahar Aghdam S', 'Azimi A', 'Mohammadi H', 'Karimi Yonjali S', 'Asariha M', 'Zadi Heydarabad M']","['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical sciences, Yasuj, Iran.

Relative to E. coliL-asparaginase, pegaspargase has a prolonged circulation time, thereby offering less frequent administration. Moreover, pegylation of E. coliL-asparaginase may diminish the immunogenicity of the enzyme. Based on extensive evidence, intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration of pegaspargase as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapy is an effective first-line treatment for paediatric and adult patients with ALL, as well as for the treatment of paediatric and adult patients with ALL and hypersensitivity to E. coliL-asparaginase. Pegaspargase had a manageable tolerability profile in paediatric and adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL, with the most commonly occurring adverse events being generally consistent to that seen with E. coliL-asparaginase. Pegaspargase treatment in patients with relapsed ALL and hypersensitivity to E. coliL-asparaginase had a similar tolerability profile to that observed in patients with newly diagnosed ALL. Given the potentially reduced immunogenicity and more convenient dosage regimen over E. coliL-asparaginase, pegaspargase remains an important and effective treatment option for paediatric and adult patients with ALL, including those with hypersensitivity to E. coliL-asparaginase.","['Heo, Young-A', 'Syed, Yahiya Y', 'Keam, Susan J']","['Heo YA', 'Syed YY', 'Keam SJ']","['Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland, 0754, New Zealand. demail@springer.com.', 'Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland, 0754, New Zealand.', 'Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland, 0754, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous/methods', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/methods', 'Escherichia coli/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intramuscular/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6531401,,,,2019/04/29 06:00,2019/11/28 06:00,['2019/04/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40265-019-01120-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s40265-019-01120-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2019 May;79(7):767-777. doi: 10.1007/s40265-019-01120-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Drugs. 2019 May 17;:.

Myeloid sarcoma can occur before, concurrently with, or following acute myeloid leukemia presentation. Few reports have focused on the imaging findings in cases of myeloid sarcoma of the breast, and the existing findings are variable and nonspecific; the present case report aimed to bridge this gap. CASE REPORT A 24-year-old female presented with a palpable lump at the upper outer quadrant of her right breast. She had noticed the mass 2 days prior to presentation. She was first diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia 18 months before the lump presentation and had undergone haploidentical stem cell transplantation 6 months prior. At the time of the breast lump presentation, she was undergoing chemotherapy for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. Ultrasonography of her right breast revealed a circumscribed, oval mass corresponding to the palpable lump. Ultrasonography-guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy was performed on the breast mass, leading to a pathological diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS We reported a case of myeloid sarcoma involving the breast. On sonography, although the internal echotexture resembled that of breast hamartoma, the observed hard elasticity and high vascularity raised suspicions of malignancy.","['Kim, Suk Jung', 'Kim, Woo Gyeong']","['Kim SJ', 'Kim WG']","['Department of Radiology, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190428,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image-Guided Biopsy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Ultrasonography, Mammary/*methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC6501734,,,,2019/04/29 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/04/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['915453 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.915453 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Apr 28;20:612-619. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.915453.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Gene expression dataset including 59 samples from ALL survivals without recurrence (good group) and 114 samples from dead ALL patients died of recurrence (poor group) was downloaded from TCGA database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between good and poor groups, followed by pathway and functional enrichment analyses. Subsequently, logistic regression model and survival analysis were performed. RESULTS: In total, 637 up- and 578 down-regulated DEGs were revealed between good and poor groups. These DEGs were mainly enriched in functions including transcription and pathways like focal adhesion. Genes including alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1), zinc finger protein 695 (ZNF695), actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), calreticulin (CALR), and F-Box and leucine rich repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) were outstanding in survival analysis. CONCLUSION: Transcription and focal adhesion might play important roles in ALL progression. Furthermore, genes including ALPK1, ZNF695, ACTN4, CALR, and FBXL5 might be novel prognostic genes for relapsed ALL.","['Ji, Chai', 'Lin, Shengliang', 'Yao, Dan', 'Li, Mingyan', 'Chen, Weijun', 'Zheng, Shuangshuang', 'Zhao, Zhengyan']","['Ji C', 'Lin S', 'Yao D', 'Li M', 'Chen W', 'Zheng S', 'Zhao Z']","[""Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China."", ""Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China."", ""Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China."", ""Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China."", ""Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China."", ""Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China."", ""Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.

According to the International Prognostic Scoring System and the MD Anderson Global Risk Model, 54% and 77% had higher risk disease, respectively. Overall response was 6% (n = 2), and best response was marrow complete remission with hematologic improvement in both patients. Median OS and median follow-up were 10.4 and 42.8 months, respectively. Drug response/stable disease (SD) resulted in better OS than treatment failure (20.6 [95% CI, 10.4-] vs 3.9 months [95% CI, 0.7-9.1]; P< .0001). Response/SD was confirmed to be an independent covariate for improved OS (P < .0001). Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 11% of patients (n = 4); non-hematologic toxicities were rare. Early mortality (< 30 days) occurred in 11% of patients (n = 4). Glasdegib was well tolerated among HMA-failure MDS patients, although single-agent activity was limited. SD or better resulted in notably superior OS. These results support further investigation of glasdegib, potentially in novel drug combinations, in MDS patients.","['Sallman, David A', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Sweet, Kendra L', 'Mo, Qianxing', 'McGraw, Kathy L', 'Duong, Vu H', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Nardelli, Lisa Ann', 'Padron, Eric', 'List, Alan F', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E']","['Sallman DA', 'Komrokji RS', 'Sweet KL', 'Mo Q', 'McGraw KL', 'Duong VH', 'Zhang L', 'Nardelli LA', 'Padron E', 'List AF', 'Lancet JE']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.

Approximately 5% of children will experience VTE which is treated with anticoagulation. Asparaginase and corticosteroids are etiologic factors for VTE, however other clinical factors may modify this risk. PROCEDURE: We sought to i) assess published pre-treatment VTE risk factors ii) identify early clinical factors that were associated with VTE and iii) determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with VTE in non-cancer patients contributed to VTE in children with ALL. We performed a detailed, retrospective analysis of 1021 ALL patients treated between 1998 and 2013. Individual patient records were reviewed to ascertain VTE incidence and document treatment-related clinical variables. RESULTS: The incidence of VTE was 5.1%. Extremes of weight at diagnosis (<5th or >95th centile) was an independent risk factor in multivariable analysis, when added to published risk factors of age >/=10years and mediastinal mass. When factors during induction/consolidation were considered separately: bacteremia, elevated serum gamma-glutamyl transferase and bilirubin were associated with VTE occurrence. None of the SNPs associated with VTE in non-cancer populations were significantly associated with VTE in our cohort. CONCLUSION: We found two known risk factors (age>/=10years and mediastinal mass) in a large cohort of children treated for ALL and identified other factors associated with VTE such as weight extremes at diagnosis, bacteremia, and abnormal liver function which warrant further study. These VTE risk factors may form the basis of future thromboprophylaxis trials.","['Mateos, M K', 'Trahair, T N', 'Mayoh, C', 'Barbaro, P M', 'Sutton, R', 'Revesz, T', 'Barbaric, D', 'Giles, J E', 'Alvaro, F', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Catchpoole, D', 'Kotecha, R S', 'Dalla-Pozza, L', 'Quinn, M C J', 'MacGregor, S', 'Chenevix-Trench, G', 'Marshall, G M']","['Mateos MK', 'Trahair TN', 'Mayoh C', 'Barbaro PM', 'Sutton R', 'Revesz T', 'Barbaric D', 'Giles JE', 'Alvaro F', 'Mechinaud F', 'Catchpoole D', 'Kotecha RS', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Quinn MCJ', 'MacGregor S', 'Chenevix-Trench G', 'Marshall GM']","[""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia; Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Centre, UNSW, NSW, Australia; School of Women's & Children's Health, UNSW, NSW, Australia.

As2O3-PLGA/PLC NPs presented suitable physical stability, positive charge, high encapsulation efficiency and drug loading, and good biocompatibility. As expected, the NPs can quickly release enough dose of As2O3 in a short time and then sustain the drug concentration. The As2O3-PLGA/PLC NPs showed effective inhibition of SMMC-7721 cells while having lower cytotoxicity against normal human liver cells (LO2 cells). Furthermore, In vivo study showed that the NPs did not present toxic effects on kidney and liver, but showed relatively high growth inhibition effect on liver tumor.

It regulates many signaling pathways related to antioxidative action, growth promotion, anti-apoptosis, cell migration, inflammatory modulation, immune function, etc. The oxidative stress has been proved to promote cancer occurrence and the readjustment of Trx system. Considerable results have demonstrated overexpression of Trx in cancer cells, moreover, the overexpression of Trx is closely related to high risk of cancer recurrence and drug resistance. This review focuses on the relationship between Trx system and acute leukemia (AL). The crux of the development of any useful therapy is a knowledge of disease etiology and progression. The potential of thioredoxin system inhibitors as therapeutic agents for acute leukemia is highlighted. Furthermore, targeting Trx as an anti-leukemic strategy is clinically beneficial to AL patients.","['Xie, Weiling', 'Ma, Weijie', 'Liu, Pan', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Xie W', 'Ma W', 'Liu P', 'Zhou F']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China.

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which leukemia cells are killed by CTX1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 and KG1a cells were treated with CTX1 and the cell death was detected. RESULTS: The viability of HL-60 and KG1a cells decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner after treatment with CTX1. CTX1 mainly induced late apoptosis and necrosis. The cell death induced by CTX1 could be rescued by specific necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 but not by caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in HL-60cells. In addition, CTX1 increased lysosome membrane permeability (LMP) and release of cathepsin B. CONCLUSION: CTX1 could induce necroptosis in leukemia cells, and it is related to LMP increase and cathepsin release. CTX1 could be a promising anti-cancer drug for leukemia therapy.","['Liu, Yamin', 'Ming, Wei', 'Wang, Yan', 'Liu, Sihong', 'Qiu, Yanfen', 'Xiang, Yongxin', 'Hu, Lili', 'Fan, Lingjie', 'Peng, Xiang', 'Wang, Han', 'Kong, Tianhan', 'Dong, Weihua', 'Guo, Qifeng']","['Liu Y', 'Ming W', 'Wang Y', 'Liu S', 'Qiu Y', 'Xiang Y', 'Hu L', 'Fan L', 'Peng X', 'Wang H', 'Kong T', 'Dong W', 'Guo Q']","[""Department of Orthopaedics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510180, China."", 'Medical Humanities Teaching and Research Office, Hetao College, Bayannur City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 015000, China.', ""Department of Orthopaedics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510180, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510180, China."", 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, China.

The living donor was seropositive for human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and the recipient was seronegative for HTLV-1 before transplantation. After transplantation, the recipient developed steroid-resistant acute cellular rejection, which was successfully treated using anti-thymocyte globulin, and he was eventually discharged. He underwent spinal surgery twice after the transplantation for the treatment of cervical spondylosis that had been present for a period of 9 months before the transplantation. The surgery improved his gait impairment temporarily. However, his gait impairment progressed, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple sites of myelopathy. He was diagnosed with HAM 16 months after the transplantation. Pulse steroid therapy (1000mg) was administered over a period of 3 days, and his limb paresis improved. Presently, steroid therapy is being continued, with a plan to eventually taper the dose, and he is being carefully followed up at our institution.

An MRI of the brain showed an enhancing, well-circumscribed mass within the frontal lobe with edema extending to the motor strip. Based on tumor size, focality, location, growth rate, and patient's symptoms, surgeons determined that the patient should undergo surgical resection. Postoperatively, the patient had full resolution of her acute neurological symptoms without post-operative complications. Post-operative MRI showed minimal enhancement suggesting post-surgical changes vs minimal residual tumor. The patient was scheduled to undergo whole brain radiotherapy with supplemental direct radiation to the site of resection.

Little is known about recurrent AOE and the role of secondary prevention in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) with previous AOE, treated with second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2(ndG)/3(rdG) TKIs), nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. METHODS: We identified a real-life cohort of 57 consecutive adult CML patients treated with 2(ndG)/3(rdG) TKI. All patients had a previous history of AOE. Ongoing use of secondary prevention of AOE (including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant therapy, and statins) before starting a 2(ndG)/3(rdG) TKI was recorded, as well as CV risk factors. RESULTS: The 60-month cumulative incidence rate of recurrent AOEs was 47.8+/-10.9%. Despite a history of AOE, 10 patients (16%) were not receiving secondary preventative measures. Patients treated with nilotinib and ponatinib showed a higher incidence of recurrent AOEs (76.7+/-14.3% and 64+/-20.1%, respectively) than those treated with dasatinib and bosutinib (44+/-24.2% and 30.5+/-15.5%, respectively) (p=0.01). Only treatment with a 2(ndG)/3(rdG) TKI given as second or subsequent line therapy showed a significant association with an increased incidence of recurrent AOE (p=0.039). Overall, 17 recurrent AOEs were observed; 3 CV-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: CML patients with a previous history of AOE treated with 2(ndG)/3(rdG) TKI represent a particular patient population with a higher probability of experiencing a recurrent AOE; individualized treatment is needed to optimize secondary prevention.","['Caocci, Giovanni', 'Mulas, Olga', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Orlandi, Ester Maria', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Fozza, Claudio', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Trawinska, Malgorzata Monika', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Scalzulli, Emilia', 'La Nasa, Giorgio', 'Foa, Robin', 'Breccia, Massimo']","['Caocci G', 'Mulas O', 'Bonifacio M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Galimberti S', 'Orlandi EM', 'Iurlo A', 'Annunziata M', 'Luciano L', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gozzini A', 'Stagno F', 'Binotto G', 'Pregno P', 'Albano F', 'Martino B', 'Fozza C', 'Scaffidi L', 'Trawinska MM', 'Barate C', 'Elena C', 'Cattaneo D', 'Scalzulli E', 'La Nasa G', 'Foa R', 'Breccia M']","['Hematology Unit, Businco Hospital, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.

The majority of adult cases are associated with hematological malignancy, including lymphoproliferative (48%) or myeloproliferative (15%) disorders (Federici et al., 2000). Both qualitative and quantitative defects occur, due to antibody-mediated clearance or functional interference, increased proteolysis, absorption to malignant cells or platelets, or increased shear stress due to valvular defects or mechanical vascular devices (Tiede et al., 2011). The predominant mechanism for decreased or absent VWF in malignancy is autoantibodies that are inhibitory to VWF function or shorten VWF survival (Kumar et al., 2002 [3]). Antibody-mediated clearance occurs through inactivating antibody directed towards VWF, antibody binding the non-active sites of VWF, and nonspecific antibodies that form circulating immune complexes with VWF, enhancing clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (Mannucci et al., 1984). Bleeding may be very difficult to treat due to reduced half-life of VWF-concentrates.","['Hegerova, Livia', 'He, Fiona', 'Zantek, Nicole D', 'Vercellotti, Gregory M', 'Holtan, Shernan G', 'Reding, Mark T']","['Hegerova L', 'He F', 'Zantek ND', 'Vercellotti GM', 'Holtan SG', 'Reding MT']","['Center for Blood Disorders and Stem Cell Transplantation, Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA 98104, United States of America.

Failure of the first induction chemotherapy is a hallmark for a poor prognosis. Early recognition of therapy failure is crucial for planning further therapies. Therefore, international guidelines recommend a bone marrow biopsy around day 14 after the beginning of induction therapy. Hypocellular bone marrow on day 14 is still gold standard for therapy assessment and further therapy strategy. Despite this, non-invasive ways for the evaluation of induction therapy were looked for in the past years. METHODS: We collected peripheral blood cell counts and routine laboratory values of patients treated with ""7+3"" induction therapy. Ratios of absolute cell counts of monocytes and neutrophils (MNR) were calculated daily, and the values were compared in patients with failure of the first induction therapy and patients with therapy response. RESULTS: 54 patients were included, 12 of which had failure of first induction therapy. The MNR following therapy was highly correlated with the bone marrow results. With the right cut-off, the MNR provides a valid and reliable tool for identification of patients with failure of first induction therapy with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 87.8% on day 18. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel and non-invasive method for detection of failure of first induction therapy in patients with de novo AML and ""7+3"" induction therapy. The MNR is free of cost since the required cell counts are performed routinely for each patient undergoing intensive chemotherapy.","['Mika, Thomas', 'Ladigan, Swetlana', 'Schork, Karin', 'Turewicz, Michael', 'Eisenacher, Martin', 'Schmiegel, Wolff', 'Schroers, Roland', 'Baraniskin, Alexander']","['Mika T', 'Ladigan S', 'Schork K', 'Turewicz M', 'Eisenacher M', 'Schmiegel W', 'Schroers R', 'Baraniskin A']","['Department of Medicine, Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum-Langendreer, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany; Center of Clinical Research, Department of Molecular GI-Oncology, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany.

The results were evaluated in terms of two classifications: broad spectrum biological activity and filtering of five different drug likeness criteria of the literature including Lipinski's rule of five. We interestingly observed that silicon incorporated compounds exhibited better performance on both criteria by targeting broader spectrum of drug receptors including G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), ion channel modulator, kinase inhibitor, protease and enzyme inhibitor and by satisfying all of five different drug-likeness criteria reported in the literature. Design compound C19 appeared as a potential drug candidate for further pharmacological research.","['Eryilmaz, Esma']",['Eryilmaz E'],"['Selcuk University, Faculty of Technology, Department of Biomedical Engineering, 42031 Konya, Turkey.

In the search of new effective therapies, identification of synthetic lethal partners of AML genetic alterations might represent a suitable approach to tailor patient treatment. Genetic mutations directly affecting DNA repair genes are not commonly present in AML. Nevertheless, several studies indicate that AML cells show high levels of DNA lesions and genomic instability. Leukaemia-driving oncogenes (e.g., RUNX1-RUNXT1, PML-RARA, TCF3-HLF, IDH1/2, TET2) or treatment with targeted agents directed against aberrant kinases (e.g., JAK1/2 and FLT3 inhibitors) have been associated with reduced DNA repair gene expression/activity that would render leukaemia blasts selectively sensitive to synthetic lethality induced by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Thus, specific oncogenic chimeric proteins or gene mutations, rare or typically distinctive of certain leukaemia subtypes, may allow tagging cancer cells for destruction by PARPi. In this review, we will discuss the rationale for using PARPi in AML subtypes characterized by a specific genetic background and summarize the preclinical and clinical evidence reported so far on their activity when used as single agents or in combination with classical cytotoxic chemotherapy or with agents targeting AML-associated mutated proteins.","['Faraoni, Isabella', 'Giansanti, Manuela', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Graziani, Grazia']","['Faraoni I', 'Giansanti M', 'Voso MT', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Graziani G']","['Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.

In this review, we summarize the emerging data for alternative BTKi. RECENT FINDINGS: Second-generation BTKi include acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, and tirabrutinib which offer greater BTK selectivity. While these agents may limit off-target toxicity, they do not overcome common mechanisms of ibrutinib resistance. Reversible BTKi including vecabrutinib and LOXO-305 inhibit BTK in the presence of C481S mutation, and non-selective reversible BTKi, including ARQ-531, may retain activity despite mutations within PLCG2. Early-phase studies are underway to establish the clinical efficacy and toxicity of these agents. A randomized trial of ibrutinib versus acalabrutinib is ongoing, and acalabrutinib may be an option for ibrutinib-intolerant patients. Results from ongoing trials of alternate BTKi will help to define their role in CLL therapy as single agents or in combination therapy.","['Bond, David A', 'Woyach, Jennifer A']","['Bond DA', 'Woyach JA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Arthur G James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, 445D Wiseman Hall CCC, 410 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Arthur G James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, 445D Wiseman Hall CCC, 410 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.

Current treatments for AML are associated with considerable toxicity and are frequently not effective after relapse. Thus, it is important to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapeutics targeting key oncogenes have been proposed as treatments for AML. We recently developed novel siRNA delivery polycations (PCX) based on AMD3100 (plerixafor), an FDA-approved inhibitor of the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Inhibitors of CXCR4 have been shown to sensitize leukemia cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, PCX has the potential to target leukemia cells via two mechanisms: inhibition of CXCR4 and delivery of siRNAs against critical genes. In this report, we show that PCX exerts a cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells more effectively than other CXCR4 inhibitors, including AMD3100. In addition, we show that PCX can deliver siRNAs against the transcription factor RUNX1 to mouse and human leukemia cells. Overall, our study provides the first evidence that dual-function PCX/siRNA nanoparticles can simultaneously inhibit CXCR4 and deliver siRNAs, targeting key oncogenes in leukemia cells and that PCX/siRNA has clinical potential for the treatment of AML.","['Wang, Yiqian', 'Xie, Ying', 'Williams, Jacob', 'Hang, Yu', 'Richter, Lisa', 'Becker, Michelle', 'Amador, Catalina', 'Oupicky, David', 'Hyde, R Katherine']","['Wang Y', 'Xie Y', 'Williams J', 'Hang Y', 'Richter L', 'Becker M', 'Amador C', 'Oupicky D', 'Hyde RK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Center for Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Center for Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Center for Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA. kate.hyde@unmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190426,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Polyelectrolytes)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (polycations)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzylamines/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Cyclams/administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Polyelectrolytes/chemistry', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,,,2019/04/28 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2019/04/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-019-0095-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-019-0095-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2020 Feb;27(1-2):45-55. doi: 10.1038/s41417-019-0095-9.

We found that CXCR5(+)CD8(+) T cells are present in human tonsils and follicular lymphoma, inhibit TFH-mediated B cell differentiation, and exhibit strong cytotoxic activity. Consistent with these findings, adoptive transfer of CXCR5(+)CD8(+) T cells into an animal model of lymphoma resulted in significantly greater antitumor activity than CXCR5(-)CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, RNA-Seq-based transcriptional profiling revealed 77 differentially expressed genes unique to CXCR5(+)CD8(+) T cells. Among these, a signature comprised of 33 upregulated genes correlated with improved survival in follicular lymphoma patients. We also showed that CXCR5(+)CD8(+) T cells could be induced and expanded ex vivo using IL-23 plus TGF-beta, suggesting a possible strategy to generate these cells for clinical application.

However, their potential nuclear functions remain poorly understood. Here we find that a fraction of full length Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor (CSF-1R), an RTK involved in monocyte/macrophage generation, migrates to the nucleus upon CSF-1 stimulation in human primary monocytes. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation identifies the preferential recruitment of CSF-1R to intergenic regions, where it co-localizes with H3K4me1 and interacts with the transcription factor EGR1. When monocytes are differentiated into macrophages with CSF-1, CSF-1R is redirected to transcription starting sites, colocalizes with H3K4me3, and interacts with ELK and YY1 transcription factors. CSF-1R expression and chromatin recruitment is modulated by small molecule CSF-1R inhibitors and altered in monocytes from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients. Unraveling this dynamic non-canonical CSF-1R function suggests new avenues to explore the poorly understood functions of this receptor and its ligands.","['Bencheikh, Laura', ""Diop, M'Boyba Khadija"", 'Riviere, Julie', 'Imanci, Aygun', 'Pierron, Gerard', 'Souquere, Sylvie', 'Naimo, Audrey', 'Morabito, Margot', 'Dussiot, Michael', 'De Leeuw, Frederic', 'Lobry, Camille', 'Solary, Eric', 'Droin, Nathalie']","['Bencheikh L', 'Diop MK', 'Riviere J', 'Imanci A', 'Pierron G', 'Souquere S', 'Naimo A', 'Morabito M', 'Dussiot M', 'De Leeuw F', 'Lobry C', 'Solary E', 'Droin N']","['INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Sud, 94270, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Sud, 94270, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'CNRS UMR9196, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'CNRS UMR9196, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM US23, CNRS UMS 3655, AMMICa, Genomic platform, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1163, CNRS UMR8254, Institut Imagine, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, 75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut Imagine, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Universite Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, 75015, Paris, France.', ""Laboratoire d'excellence GR-Ex, Institut Imagine, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, 75015, Paris, France."", 'INSERM US23, CNRS UMS 3655, AMMICa, Imaging and Cytometry Platform, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Sud, 94270, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France. eric.solary@gustaveroussy.fr.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Sud, 94270, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France. eric.solary@gustaveroussy.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France. eric.solary@gustaveroussy.fr.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France. nathalie.droin@gustaveroussy.fr.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Sud, 94270, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France. nathalie.droin@gustaveroussy.fr.', 'INSERM US23, CNRS UMS 3655, AMMICa, Genomic platform, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, 94805, Villejuif, France. nathalie.droin@gustaveroussy.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190426,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide)', '0 (CSF1 protein, human)', '0 (CSF1R protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Gene Editing', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Maleimides/chemistry', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'THP-1 Cells', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6486619,,,,2019/04/28 06:00,2019/05/09 06:00,['2019/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-09970-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-09970-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Apr 26;10(1):1935. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-09970-9.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7849-4405', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0550-4921', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6099-5324']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dire clinical course of paediatric CML is further exacerbated by the adverse effects of long-term imatinib therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our cohort comprised 14 CML patients who were treated with imatinib between July 2010 and September 2018. The European Leukaemia Net (ELN) standard milestones of response criteria were used to evaluate its therapeutic effectiveness. RESULTS: Complete haematological remission and partial cytogenetic response were achieved in all patients. Complete cytogenetic response was achieved in seven patients. Major molecular response was achieved in six patients. Two patients underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to unsatisfactory response to imatinib. CONCLUSION: Imatinib is effective in treating paediatric CML and limits the progression to advanced stages, however, the quality of life still needs to be optimised.","['Smeding, Cynthia', 'Szydlo, Aleksandra', 'Pieluszczak, Krzysztof', 'Grzeszkiewicz, Katarzyna', 'Pawelec, Katarzyna']","['Smeding C', 'Szydlo A', 'Pieluszczak K', 'Grzeszkiewicz K', 'Pawelec K']","[""Student Scientific Group 'SPHEROCYTE', Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."", ""Student Scientific Group 'SPHEROCYTE', Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."", ""Student Scientific Group 'SPHEROCYTE', Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."", 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland katarzyna.pawelec@litewska.edu.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6559902,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'adolescents', 'children', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'imatinib']",,2019/04/28 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2019/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['33/3/869 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11552 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2019 May-Jun;33(3):869-875. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11552.,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported that C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) is associated with MF invasion and progression. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), a long noncoding RNA, is associated with several cancer types, however, how it interacts with CCL21 to regulate MF progression, remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of long noncoding RNAs MALAT1, antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), Hox antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), highly up-regulated in liver cancer RNA (HULC), and leukemia-associated non-coding insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor activator RNA 1 (LUNAR1) in tissues from MF was studied using polymerase chain reaction and RNA interference in MF cell line MyLa were used to address this question. RESULTS: Expression of MALAT1 was selectively increased in MF tissues. C-C Chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) expression was found to be increased in MyLa cells. CCL21 was found not only to mediate migration, but also to enhance MALAT1 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in MyLa cells. Knockdown of MALAT1 abrogated CCL21-mediated migration, but not mTOR activation. In contrast, mTOR inhibition reduced CCL21-mediated migration and MALAT1 expression. CONCLUSION: CCL21 induced mTOR activation in MyLa cells, followed by expression of MALAT1, causing cell migration. MALAT1 and mTOR are potential therapeutic targets for MF.","['Hong, Chien-Hui', 'Lin, Shang-Hung', 'Lee, Chih-Hung']","['Hong CH', 'Lin SH', 'Lee CH']","['Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Dermatology, National Yang-Ming University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C. dermlee@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (CCL21 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (MALAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,"['Biopsy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Chemokine CCL21/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC6559909,['NOTNLM'],"['MALAT1', 'Mycosis fungoides', 'lncRNA', 'mTOR', 'migration']",,2019/04/28 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2019/04/28 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['33/3/793 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11541 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2019 May-Jun;33(3):793-800. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11541.,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas database and found 71 AML patients with GAS6-mRNA expression and received allo-HSCT treatments. We divided them into two groups based on the median expression of GAS6-mRNA. Patients with GAS6-mRNA(high) (n=36) seemed to have lower bone marrow (BM) blast (P=0.022), lower percentage of type M5 (P=0.034), lower percentage of inv(16)/CBFbeta-MYH11 karyotype (P=0.020), and lower rate of good risk classification (P=0.005) than the group GAS6-mRNA(low) (n= 35). Higher expression level of GAS6-mRNA also brought higher RUNX1 mutations (P=0.003), MLL-PTD mutations (P=0.042), TP53 mutations (P=0.042), and lower NRAS/KRAS mutations (P=0.042). Univariate analyses showed that GAS6-mRNA was unfavorable for overall survival (OS) (P=0.044), as RUNX1 and WT1 also gave negative influences. Multivariate analyses confirmed that GAS6-mRNA cut down the event-free servival (EFS) and OS of AML patients with HSCT (P=0.029, P=0.025). Our study indicated that higher expression of GAS6-mRNA related with adverse effects in AML patients with HSCT treatment.","['Yang, Xinrui', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Zhang, Xinpei', 'Zhang, Gaoqi', 'Zhang, Jilei', 'Yang, Siyuan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Fu, Lin']","['Yang X', 'Shi J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang G', 'Zhang J', 'Yang S', 'Wang J', 'Ke X', 'Fu L']","['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China fulin022@126.com xiaoyank@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190521,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (growth arrest-specific protein 6)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate']",PMC6527924,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Growth arrest-specific 6', '*allo-HSCT', '*next generation sequencing', '*prognosis']",,2019/04/28 06:00,2020/06/26 06:00,['2019/04/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20190389 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20190389 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2019 May 21;39(5). pii: BSR20190389. doi: 10.1042/BSR20190389.

To assess the magnitude of improvement of progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in patients who achieved U-MRD after upfront chemotherapy (CT) or chemo-immunotherapy (CIT), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The screening process adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines. The search strategy yielded 365 records, including 22 articles assessed for eligibility. RESULTS: Eleven studies comprising 2457 patients with CLL treated in upfront with CT or CIT were considered suitable for inclusion in the quantitative meta-analysis. Nine studies (n = 2088) provided data on the impact of MRD on PFS and 6 (n = 1234) on OS. MRD was the main endpoint in only 2 of these studies (n = 213). Tests of heterogeneity revealed significant differences among studies for PFS and OS, which highlights differences across studies. U-MRD status was associated with significantly better PFS overall (P < .001) and in patients who achieved conventional complete remission (P = .01). Regarding OS, U-MRD predicted longer OS globally (P < .001) but not in patients having achieved complete remission (P = .82). CONCLUSIONS: U-MRD status after treatment with CT or CIT in newly diagnosed CLL is associated with long-term survival. These findings provide quantitative evidence to support the integration of MRD assessment as an end point in clinical trials of CLL.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Molica S', 'Giannarelli D', 'Montserrat E']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.

However, the effects of Plzf on brain structures and functions are still not clarified. RESULTS: We showed that Plzf expression was detected as early as embryonic day (E) 9.5 in Pax6(+) cells in the mouse brain, and was completely disappeared in telencephalon before the initiation of cortical neurogenesis. Loss of Plzf resulted in a smaller cerebral cortex with a decrease in the number of Tbr1(+) deep layer neurons due to a decrease of mitotic cell number in the ventricular zone of forebrain at early developmental stage. Microarray, qRT-PCR, and flow cytometry analysis identified dysregulation of Mash1 proneural gene expression. We also observed an impairment of recognition memory in Plzf-deficient mice.

Therefore, allogeneic HSCT (allo HSCT) for adults aged less than 50 years with ALL is performed with myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens. Among the several MAC regimens, a conditioning regimen of 120 mg/kg (60mg/kg for two days) cyclophosphamide (CY) and 12 gray fractionated (12 gray in six fractions for three days) total body irradiation (TBI) is commonly used, resulting in a long term survival rate of approximately 50% when transplanted at the first complete remission. The addition of 30 mg/kg (15 mg/kg for two days) etoposide (ETP) to the CY/TBI regimen revealed an excellent outcome (a long-term survival rate of approximately 80%) in adults with ALL, showing lower relapse and non-relapse mortality rates. It is preferable to perform allo HSCT with a medium-dose ETP/CY/TBI conditioning regimen at the first complete remission in high-risk ALL patients and at the second complete remission (in addition to the first complete remission) in standard-risk ALL patients. The ETP dose and administration schedule are important factors for reducing the relapse and non-relapse mortality rates, preserving a better outcome. The pharmacological study suggests that the prolonged administration of ETP at a reduced dose is a promising treatment.","['Imamura, Masahiro', 'Shigematsu, Akio']","['Imamura M', 'Shigematsu A']","['Former Professor of Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kita-15 Jyo, Nishi-7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan. mimamura@med.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, 6-6-5-1 Higashi-sapporo, Shiroishi-ku, Sapporo 003-0006, Japan. mimamura@med.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, 6-6-5-1 Higashi-sapporo, Shiroishi-ku, Sapporo 003-0006, Japan. shigemap@mac.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190426,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC6572563,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'conditioning regimen', 'cyclophosphamide', 'medium-dose etoposide', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'total body irradiation']",,2019/04/28 06:00,2019/04/28 06:01,['2019/04/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/28 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm8050569 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm8050569 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2019 Apr 26;8(5). pii: jcm8050569. doi: 10.3390/jcm8050569.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5741-6360'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural killer (NK)-cell-based immunotherapies can be incorporated into the therapeutic armamentarium for the eradication of AML cells post allo-HSCT. In recent studies, NK cell-based immunotherapies, the use of adoptive NK cells, NK cells in combination with cytokines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific and trispecific killer cell engagers, and chimeric antigen receptor-engineered NK cells have all shown antitumor activity in AML patients. In this review, we will discuss the current strategies with these NK cell-based immunotherapies as possible therapies to cure AML patients post allo-HSCT.

In cancer, the genome organization may become disturbed due to chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations or deletions, resulting in the repositioning of genes and alteration of gene expression with oncogenic consequences. In this study, we analyzed the nuclear repositioning of HLXB9 (also called MNX1), mapping at 7q36.3, in patients with hematological disorders carrying interstitial deletions of 7q of various extents, with a distal breakpoint in 7q36. We observed that HLXB9 remains at the nuclear periphery, or is repositioned towards the nuclear interior, depending upon the compositional properties of the chromosomal regions involved in the rearrangement. For instance, a proximal breakpoint leading the guanine-cytosine (GC)-poor band 7q21 near 7q36 would bring HLXB9 to the nuclear periphery, whereas breakpoints that join the GC-rich band 7q22 to 7q36 would bring HLXB9 to the nuclear interior. This nuclear repositioning is associated with transcriptional changes, with HLXB9 in the nuclear interior becoming upregulated. Here we report an in cis rearrangement, involving one single chromosome altering gene behavior. Furthermore, we propose a mechanistic model for chromatin reorganization that affects gene expression via the influences of new chromatin neighborhoods.","['Federico, Concetta', 'Owoka, Temitayo', 'Ragusa, Denise', 'Sturiale, Valentina', 'Caponnetto, Domenica', 'Leotta, Claudia Giovanna', 'Bruno, Francesca', 'Foster, Helen A', 'Rigamonti, Silvia', 'Giudici, Giovanni', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Bridger, Joanna M', 'Sisu, Cristina', 'Saccone, Salvatore', 'Tosi, Sabrina']","['Federico C', 'Owoka T', 'Ragusa D', 'Sturiale V', 'Caponnetto D', 'Leotta CG', 'Bruno F', 'Foster HA', 'Rigamonti S', 'Giudici G', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Bridger JM', 'Sisu C', 'Saccone S', 'Tosi S']","['Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences, University of Catania, via Androne 81, 95124 Catania CT, Italy. federico@unict.it.', 'Genome Engineering and Maintenance Network, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Kingston Lane UB8 3PH, UK.

This multiplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay amplifies both e13a2 and e14a2 Major BCR-ABL1 transcripts and the reference target ABL1. The test results are provided in international scale (IS) values by incorporating armored RNA-based calibrators that have defined IS values tied directly to the World Health Organization BCR-ABL1 Primary Reference Materials, without the necessity of determining and maintaining conversion factors. For each batch run, the integrated interpretive software evaluates run and specimen quality control metrics (including a sufficient amount of ABL1 control transcripts to ensure a minimal limit of detection) and calculates both molecular response (MR) and %IS values for each specimen. The test has a limit of detection of MR4.7 (0.002%IS) and a linear range from MR0.3 (50%IS) to MR4.7 (0.002%IS) for both Major transcripts. Single-site and multisite precision studies demonstrated a maximum SD of 0.13 MR (30% CV within the assay range between MR0.7 and MR3.7).

CHIP's implications for stem cell transplantation have been harder to identify due to the high degree of mutational heterogeneity that is present within the genetically distinct subclones. In order to gain a better understanding of CHIP and the impact of clonal dynamics on transplantation outcomes, we created a mathematical model of clonal competition dynamics. Our analyses highlight the importance of understanding competition intensity between healthy and mutant clones. Importantly, we highlight the risk that CHIP poses in leading to dominance of precancerous mutant clones and the risk of donor derived leukemia. Furthermore, we estimate the degree of competition intensity and bone marrow niche decline in mice during aging by using our modeling framework. Together, our work highlights the importance of better characterizing the ecological and clonal composition in hematopoietic donor populations at the time of stem cell transplantation.","['Park, Derek S', 'Akuffo, Afua A', 'Muench, David E', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K', 'Maini, Philip K', 'Anderson, Alexander R A', 'Bonsall, Michael B']","['Park DS', 'Akuffo AA', 'Muench DE', 'Grimes HL', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Maini PK', 'Anderson ARA', 'Bonsall MB']","['Mathematical Ecology Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology, H.

Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to investigate the association between traffic-related air pollution and risk of childhood leukemia. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched by the index words to identify eligible case-control studies, and relevant literature sources were also searched. The latest research was performed in September 2017. Odds ratio (OR) along with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to analyzed the main outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-one case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that in the studies of overall traffic density (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98-1.04), high traffic density (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.91-1.17), moderate exposure to NO2 (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93-1.10), and benzene (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.71-1.37), the risks of childhood leukemia incidence were higher in the case group than the control group, but no significant difference was found. In other analysis, no significant difference was observed in the risk of childhood leukemia in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that childhood leukemia is associated with traffic density, and moderate exposure to NO2 and benzene. However, more high-quality studies are required to confirm the conclusions.","['Gong, Zeng-Hong', 'Li, Jian', 'Wang, Xiao-Yong', 'Yu, Yan', 'Ren, Min-Min', 'Zhou, Jian']","['Gong ZH', 'Li J', 'Wang XY', 'Yu Y', 'Ren MM', 'Zhou J']","['Departments of Hematology.', 'Gastroenterology.', 'Departments of Hematology.', 'Departments of Hematology.', 'Departments of Hematology.', 'Internal Medicine Center Laboratory, Dongtai People Hospital, Dongtai, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Traffic-Related Pollution/*adverse effects']",,,,,2019/04/27 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/04/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001413 [doi]', '00043426-201905000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 May;41(4):267-274. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001413.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the clinical and histological characteristics and the outcomes of HL variant of RT (HvRS) the Polish Lymphoma Research Group performed a nationwide survey which identified 22 patients with histologically proven HvRS diagnosed between 2002 and 2016. There were 16 (73%) males. The median age at CLL/SLL and HvRS diagnosis was 59 (39-77) and 64 (40-77) years, respectively. The median interval between CLL/SLL and HvRS diagnosis was 38 months (range: 0-187). All patients had an advanced stage HL, and majority, 17 (77%), presented with B symptoms. The predominant subtypes of HL were nodular sclerosis (12; 55%) and mixed cellularity (9; 41%). Eighteen patients received non-palliative treatment, including 13 who received driamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) regimen first line. Objective response was: 50%, with 33% complete remissions (61% and 46% for ABVD, respectively). Median overall survival reached 13.3 months (95% CI, 3.7-NA). The only adverse prognostic factor for survival was a higher number (</=1 versus >/=2) of prior lines of treatment given for CLL/SLL with HR 3.57 (95% CI, 1.16-10.92). We conclude, HvRS harbors a poor prognosis, especially in patients heavily pretreated for CLL/SLL. Response to standard first-line anti-HL chemotherapy is unsatisfactory, and new agents should be tested to improve the outcome.","['Drozd-Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Zaucha, Jan Maciej', 'Zoltak, Tomasz', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Grzybowska-Izydorczyk, Olga', 'Witkowska, Magdalena', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Kazmierczak, Maciej', 'Szczepaniak, Andrzej', 'Subocz, Edyta', 'Knopinska-Posluszny, Wanda', 'Holojda, Jadwiga', 'Kopinska, Anna', 'Hus, Iwona', 'Rybka, Justyna', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Kwiatkowski, Jacek', 'Halaburda, Kazimierz', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw']","['Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Zaucha JM', 'Zoltak T', 'Jamroziak K', 'Grzybowska-Izydorczyk O', 'Witkowska M', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Kazmierczak M', 'Szczepaniak A', 'Subocz E', 'Knopinska-Posluszny W', 'Holojda J', 'Kopinska A', 'Hus I', 'Rybka J', 'Wolowiec D', 'Kwiatkowski J', 'Halaburda K', 'Smolewski P', 'Giebel S', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Educational Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Military Institute of Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Independent Public Health Care Ministry of the Interior of Warmia and Mazury Oncology Center, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Specialist District Hospital, Legnica, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Independent Clinical Transplantology Unit, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Hematology-Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute-Cancer Center, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190614,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin lymphoma', 'Hodgkin variant of Richter syndrome', 'HvRS', 'Richter syndrome', 'Richter transformation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,2019/04/27 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2019/04/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2624 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;37(4):383-391. doi: 10.1002/hon.2624.

Polyelectrolyte complexes were formed based on approximately 20 nm cationic nanomicelles of lipo-oligomer 454 with the anionic MTX at the molar ratio of 3:1, resulting in spherical nanoparticles with sizes of 150 nm (454 MTX). Particle formation in the presence of PT, which also interacts with 454, resulted in coloaded micelle complexes (454 PT+MTX) of 170 nm as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements. Both drugs were incorporated to a high extent ( approximately 85% for MTX, approximately 70% for PT). Nanoparticles were stable in up to 20% serum and physiological NaCl solution. Cellular internalization of 454 PT+MTX into L1210 leukemia and KB cervix carcinoma cells was determined by confocal light scattering microscopy. The antitumor activity of the drug combination PT+MTX in both cell lines was strongly increased by drug formulation with 454 with IC50 values of PT+MTX decreasing 11-fold from 0.22 nM to 19 pM on L1210 cells and 6-fold from 2.8 to 0.48 nM on KB cervix carcinoma cells. Systemic treatment of NMRI nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous L1210 tumors with 454 PT+MTX nanoparticles resulted in a more effective delay of tumor growth in comparison to the free drug combination of PT+MTX without 454. Importantly, nanoparticle formulation of PT+MTX with 454 increased the survival of mice by more than 100% compared to that of the buffer treated group and more than 40% compared to that of the free drug group.","['Truebenbach, Ines', 'Kern, Sarah', 'Loy, Dominik M', 'Hohn, Miriam', 'Gorges, Jan', 'Kazmaier, Uli', 'Wagner, Ernst']","['Truebenbach I', 'Kern S', 'Loy DM', 'Hohn M', 'Gorges J', 'Kazmaier U', 'Wagner E']","['Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Center for System-Based Drug Research, and Center for Nanoscience (CeNS) , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat , 81377 Munich , Germany.', 'Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Center for System-Based Drug Research, and Center for Nanoscience (CeNS) , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat , 81377 Munich , Germany.', 'Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Center for System-Based Drug Research, and Center for Nanoscience (CeNS) , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat , 81377 Munich , Germany.', 'Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Center for System-Based Drug Research, and Center for Nanoscience (CeNS) , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat , 81377 Munich , Germany.', 'Institute for Organic Chemistry , Saarland University , P.O.

Further biomarkers related to skin sensitization were also determined under equivalent comparative conditions. In cell viability analyses, potent skin sensitizers exhibited high cytotoxicity, but non-sensitizers did not display this tendency. In biomarker analyses, interleukin-I beta (IL-1beta), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-1beta+iNOS, and THP-1 IL-1beta+Raw 264.7 IL-1beta were found to be suitable for prediction of skin sensitization potency following classification as either skin sensitizers or non-sensitizers (accuracies of 91.7%, 87.5%, 83.3%, and 82.6%, respectively). A significant positive correlation was found between biomarkers and skin sensitization potency, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.7 or more (correlation coefficients of 0.77, 0.72, 0.7, and 0.84, respectively). Finally, the skin sensitization potency effective threefold concentration (EC) 3% was predicted using a biomarker equation, with resulting prediction rates (match rate with actual data) of 58.3%, 54.2%, 62.5%, and 60.9%, respectively. The prediction accuracy for the EC3 value obtained from animal data was calculated as 83.3%, 79.2%, 79.2%, and 73.9%, respectively.

We have assessed cancer incidence among FMF patients with or without amyloidosis to investigate this hypothesis. We performed a retrospective review of FMF patients, diagnosed and treated in Hacettepe University hospitals between 2001 and 2018. We identified patients from the hospital medical records using the ICD-10 code for FMF. We collected data on demographic and clinical features, drug history, the presence of amyloidosis and subsequent diagnosis of cancer. The expected cancer incidence was estimated using age- and gender-specific standardized incidence rates (SIRs) in comparison with the general Turkish population according to Turkish National Cancer Registry data at 2014. Total of 3899 FMF patients (120 patients had also amyloidosis) were included. Median age was 22 and 56% were females. Thirty-eight patients were diagnosed with cancer during 100,283 person-years of follow-up. The most common cancer was breast cancer in females (7/28 patients) and leukemia (2/10 patients) in males. The overall cancer incidence among patients with FMF was significantly lower in both males {SIR 0.42 [95% confidence interval; (CI) 0.21-0.75], p = 0.019} and females [SIR 065 (95% CI 0.44-0.93), p = 0.002].

It is now acknowledged that RNA modifiers play a crucial role in the control of differentiation of stem and progenitor cells and that changes in their levels are a relevant feature of different types of cancer. To date, among more than 160 different RNA chemical modifications, the more relevant in cancer biology is the reversible and dynamic N(6)-methylation of adenosine, yielding N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A). m(6)A is the more abundant internal modification in mRNA, regulating the expression of the latter at different levels, from maturation to translation. Here, we will describe the emerging role of m(6)A modification in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which, among first, has demonstrated how mis-regulation of the m6A modifying system can contribute to the development and progression of cancer. Moreover, we will discuss how AML is paving the way to the development of new therapeutic options based on the inhibition of m(6)A deposition.","['Ianniello, Zaira', 'Paiardini, Alessandro', 'Fatica, Alessandro']","['Ianniello Z', 'Paiardini A', 'Fatica A']","['Department of Biology and Biotechnology ""Charles Darwin,"" Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences ""A.

Current prognostic factors are not accurate predictors of the clinical outcome of adult patients and the stratification of risk groups remains insufficient. For that reason, this study proposes a multifactorial analysis which integrates clinical parameters, ex vivo tumor characterization and behavioral in vivo analysis in zebrafish. This model represents a new approach to understand leukemic primary cells behavior and features associated with aggressiveness and metastatic potential. Xenotransplantation of primary samples from patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia in zebrafish embryos at 48 hpf was used to asses survival rate, dissemination pattern, and metastatic potential. Seven samples from young adults classified in adverse, favorable or intermediate risk group were characterized. Tumor heterogeneity defined by Leukemic stem cell (LSC) proportion, was performed by metabolic and cell membrane biomarkers characterization. Thus, our work combines all these parameters with a robust quantification strategy that provides important information about leukemia biology, their relationship with specific niches and the existent inter and intra-tumor heterogeneity in acute leukemia. In regard to prognostic factors, leukemic stem cell proportion and Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) migration into zebrafish were the variables with highest weights for the prediction analysis. Higher ALDH activity, less differentiated cells and a broader and random migration pattern are related with worse clinical outcome after induction chemotherapy. This model also recapitulates multiple aspects of human acute leukemia and therefore is a promising tool to be employed not only for preclinical studies but also supposes a new tool with a higher resolution compared to traditional methods for an accurate stratification of patients into worse or favorable clinical outcome.","['Gacha-Garay, Maria Jose', 'Nino-Joya, Andres Felipe', 'Bolanos, Natalia I', 'Abenoza, Lina', 'Quintero, Guillermo', 'Ibarra, Humberto', 'Gonzalez, John M', 'Akle, Veronica', 'Garavito-Aguilar, Zayra V']","['Gacha-Garay MJ', 'Nino-Joya AF', 'Bolanos NI', 'Abenoza L', 'Quintero G', 'Ibarra H', 'Gonzalez JM', 'Akle V', 'Garavito-Aguilar ZV']","['Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Biomedical Sciences Group, School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Oncology, Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Oncology, Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Microscopy Core, Vice-Presidency of Research, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Biomedical Sciences Group, School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Laboratory of Neuroscience and Circadian Rhythms, School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190409,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6465644,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'aldehyde dehydrogenase', 'cancer', 'leukemic stem cell', 'patient-derived xenograft', 'translational research', 'zebrafish']",,2019/04/27 06:00,2019/04/27 06:01,['2019/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00245 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Apr 9;9:245. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00245. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro allergic inflammation was accompanied by an increased autophagic flux in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells. 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagic processes, negatively regulated allergic inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. The role of p62, a selective receptor of autophagy, in allergic inflammation was investigated. P62, increased by antigen stimulation, mediated in vitro allergic inflammation, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), and passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA). P62 mediated cellular interactions during allergic inflammation. It also mediated tumorigenic and metastatic potential of cancer cells enhanced by PSA. TargetScan analysis predicted that miR-135-5p was a negative regulator of p62. Luciferase activity assay showed that miR-135-5p directly regulated p62. MiR-135-5p mimic negatively regulated features of allergic inflammation and inhibited tumorigenic and metastatic potential of cancer cells enhanced by PSA. MiR-135-5p mimic also inhibited cellular interactions during allergic inflammation. Extracellular vesicles mediated allergic inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. Extracellular vesicles were also necessary for cellular interactions during allergic inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy showed p62 within extracellular vesicles of antigen-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL2H3). Extracellular vesicles isolated from antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells induced activation of macrophages and enhanced invasion and migration potential of B16F1 mouse melanoma cells in a p62-dependent manner. Extracellular vesicles isolated from PSA-activated BALB/C mouse enhanced invasion and migration potential of B16F1 cells, and induced features of allergic inflammation in RBL2H3 cells. Thus, miR-135-5p-p62 axis might serve as a target for developing anti-allergy drugs.","['Kim, Misun', 'Park, Yeongseo', 'Kwon, Yoojung', 'Kim, Youngmi', 'Byun, Jaehwan', 'Jeong, Myeong Seon', 'Kim, Han-Ul', 'Jung, Hyun Suk', 'Mun, Ji Young', 'Jeoung, Dooil']","['Kim M', 'Park Y', 'Kwon Y', 'Kim Y', 'Byun J', 'Jeong MS', 'Kim HU', 'Jung HS', 'Mun JY', 'Jeoung D']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korean Basic Science Institute, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Structure and Function of Neural Network, Korea Brain Research Institute, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190405,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn135 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/*immunology', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Immunomodulation', 'Inflammation/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis', 'Rats', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6460569,['NOTNLM'],"['*P62', '*allergic inflammation', '*cellular interactions', '*extracellular vesicles', '*miR-135']",,2019/04/27 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.00738 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Apr 5;10:738. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00738. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the susceptibility of Fusarium clinical isolates to antifungals and azole fungicides and identify the species. Forty-three clinical Fusarium isolates were identified by sequencing translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1alpha) gene. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed to the antifungals amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole, and the azole fungicides difenoconazole, tebuconazole, and propiconazole. The isolates were recovered from patients with median age of 36 years (range 2-78 years) of which 21 were female. Disseminated fusariosis was the most frequent clinical form (n = 16, 37.2%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 7; 16.3%) was the most commonly underlying condition. A few species described in Fusarium solani SC have recently been renamed in the genus Neocosmospora, but consistent naming is yet not possible. Fusarium keratoplasticum FSSC 2 (n = 12) was the prevalent species, followed by F. petroliphilum FSSC 1 (n = 10), N. gamsii FSSC 7 (n = 5), N. suttoniana FSSC 20 (n = 3), F. solani sensu stricto FSSC 5 (n = 2), Fusarium sp.

The immense data load published on its dual role in both tumorigenesis and inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic spread has transformed the cannabinoid receptors CB1 (CB1R) and CB2 (CB2R), and other members of the endocannabinoid-like system, into attractive new targets for the treatment of various cancer subtypes. Although the clinical use of cannabinoids has been extensively documented in the palliative setting, clinical trials on their application as anti-cancer drugs are still ongoing. As drug repurposing is significantly faster and more economical than de novo introduction of a new drug into the clinic, there is hope that the existing pharmacokinetic and safety data on the ECS ligands will contribute to their successful translation into oncological healthcare. CB1R and CB2R are members of a large family of membrane proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). GPCRs can form homodimers, heterodimers and higher order oligomers with other GPCRs or non-GPCRs. Currently, several CB1R and CB2R-containing heteromers have been reported and, in cancer cells, CB2R form heteromers with the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4, the G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) and the tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) human V-Erb-B2 Avian Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (HER2). These protein complexes possess unique pharmacological and signaling properties, and their modulation might affect the antitumoral activity of the ECS. This review will explore the potential of the endocannabinoid network in the anti-cancer setting as well as the clinical and ethical pitfalls behind it, and will develop on the value of cannabinoid receptor heteromers as potential new targets for anti-cancer therapies and as prognostic biomarkers.","['Moreno, Estefania', 'Cavic, Milena', 'Krivokuca, Ana', 'Casado, Vicent', 'Canela, Enric']","['Moreno E', 'Cavic M', 'Krivokuca A', 'Casado V', 'Canela E']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190405,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6459931,['NOTNLM'],"['G protein-coupled receptor', 'cannabinoid CB1 receptor', 'cannabinoid CB2 receptor', 'endocannabinoids', 'ethical issues', 'marijuana legalization', 'receptor heteromer']",,2019/04/27 06:00,2019/04/27 06:01,['2019/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00339 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Apr 5;10:339. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00339. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IDH enzymes are mutated in ~20% of human AML, with targeted therapies under clinical evaluation. We here characterize leukaemia evolution from mutant IDH2 (mIDH2)-dependence to independence identifying key targetable vulnerabilities of mIDH2 leukaemia that are retained during evolution and progression from early to late stages. Mechanistically, we find that mIDH2 leukaemia are metastable and vulnerable at two distinct levels. On the one hand, they are characterized by oxidative and genotoxic stress, in spite of increased 1-carbon metabolism and glutathione levels. On the other hand, mIDH2 leukaemia display inhibition of LSD1 and a resulting transcriptional signature of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) sensitization, in spite of a state of suppressed ATRA signalling due to increased levels of PIN1. We further identify GSH/ROS and PIN1/LSD1 as critical nodes for leukaemia maintenance and the combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a key therapeutic modality to target these vulnerabilities. Strikingly, we demonstrate that the combination of ATRA and ATO proves to be a powerfully synergistic and effective therapy in a number of mouse and human mIDH1/2 leukemic models. Thus, our findings pave the way towards the treatment of a sizable fraction of human AMLs through targeted APL-like combinatorial therapies.","['Mugoni, Vera', 'Panella, Riccardo', 'Cheloni, Giulia', 'Chen, Ming', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Guarnerio, Jlenia', 'Monteleone, Emanuele', 'Lee, Jonathan David', 'Mendez, Lourdes', 'Menon, Archita Venugopal', 'Aster, Jon Christopher', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'Stone, Richard Maury', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Zamora, Jose Cervera', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Bhasin, Manoj Kumar', 'Avigan, David', 'Longo, Letizia', 'Clohessy, John Gerard', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Mugoni V', 'Panella R', 'Cheloni G', 'Chen M', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Stroopinsky D', 'Guarnerio J', 'Monteleone E', 'Lee JD', 'Mendez L', 'Menon AV', 'Aster JC', 'Lane AA', 'Stone RM', 'Galinsky I', 'Zamora JC', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Bhasin MK', 'Avigan D', 'Longo L', 'Clohessy JG', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center;

Somatic or germline mutant RUNX1 (mtRUNX1) is associated with poorer outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Knockdown or inhibition of RUNX1 induced more apoptosis of AML expressing mtRUNX1 versus wild-type RUNX1 and improved survival of mice engrafted with mtRUNX1-expressing AML. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing-out of RUNX1 enhancer (eR1) within its intragenic super-enhancer, or BET protein BRD4 depletion by short hairpin RNA, repressed RUNX1, inhibited cell growth, and induced cell lethality in AML cells expressing mtRUNX1. Moreover, treatment with BET protein inhibitor or degrader (BET-proteolysis targeting chimera) repressed RUNX1 and its targets, inducing apoptosis and improving survival of mice engrafted with AML expressing mtRUNX1. Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures 1000-connectivity mapping data sets queried with messenger RNA signature of RUNX1 knockdown identified novel expression-mimickers (EMs), which repressed RUNX1 and exerted in vitro and in vivo efficacy against AML cells expressing mtRUNX1. In addition, the EMs cinobufagin, anisomycin, and narciclasine induced more lethality in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) expressing germline mtRUNX1 from patients with AML compared with HPCs from patients with familial platelet disorder (FPD), or normal untransformed HPCs.

Rates of response, complete remission (CR/CRi), and undetectable minimal residual disease (U-MRD) were analyzed for all patients (n = 436) and for those patients who were planned to receive 400 mg/day monotherapy (n = 347). Univariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to identify the pretreatment factors associated with response rates and duration of response (DoR). Objective responses were documented in 75% of all patients, including 22% CR/CRi. Overall, 27% and 16% of the patients achieved U-MRD in blood and marrow, respectively. Estimated median progression-free survival (PFS), DoR, and time to progression were 30.2, 38.4, and 36.9 months, respectively. Similar efficacy outcomes were observed within the 400 mg/day monotherapy subset. For those who achieved CR/CRi, the 3-year PFS estimate was 83%. DoR was superior for patients achieving CR/CRi or U-MRD in landmark analyses. In multiple regression analyses, bulky lymphadenopathy (>/=5 cm) and refractoriness to B-cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) therapy were significantly associated with lower CR rate and shorter DoR. Fewer prior therapies were associated with higher CR rate, but not DoR. Chromosome 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation and NOTCH1 mutation were consistently associated with shorter DoR, but not probability of response. Thus, both pretreatment factors and depth of response correlated with DoR with venetoclax. Patients without bulky lymphadenopathy, BCRi-refractory CLL, or an adverse mutation profile had the most durable benefit.","['Roberts, Andrew W', 'Ma, Shuo', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Coutre, Steven E', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Byrd, John C', 'Humphrey, Kathryn', 'Zhou, Lang', 'Chyla, Brenda', 'Nielsen, Jacqueline', 'Potluri, Jalaja', 'Kim, Su Young', 'Verdugo, Maria', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Wierda, William G', 'Seymour, John F']","['Roberts AW', 'Ma S', 'Kipps TJ', 'Coutre SE', 'Davids MS', 'Eichhorst B', 'Hallek M', 'Byrd JC', 'Humphrey K', 'Zhou L', 'Chyla B', 'Nielsen J', 'Potluri J', 'Kim SY', 'Verdugo M', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Wierda WG', 'Seymour JF']","['Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Robert H.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study evaluated the burden of geriatric related health issues, assessed feasibility of ""tailored"" Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), and compared treatment duration and survival in older patients with MDS and oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia with and without deficits in CGA domains (n=98). RESULTS: Although only 27 (28%) patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score >/=2, 78% (n=77) patients had deficits in at least one CGA domain. Deficits were spread across all CGA domains, including dependence for instrumental activity of daily living (iADL; n=33, 34%). Importantly, patients who were dependent for iADL (3.7+/-2.6 vs 12.1+/-7.9; p=.009), had cognitive impairment (3.5+/-2.1 vs. 10.9+/-7.9; p=.034) or impaired mobility (3.8+/-2.5 vs. 13.2+/-7.6; p=.001) completed significantly less azacitidine cycles as compared to those without these deficits. Cox-proportional regression showed that iADL dependency (hazard ratio 3.37; p=.008) and higher comorbidities (hazard ratio 4.7; p<.001) were associated with poor prognosis independent of disease related factors. Poor survival of iADL dependent patients was seen in both azacitidine (6 vs 19months; p<.001) and supportive care cohorts (26 vs 48months; p=.01). CONCLUSION: CGA detected geriatric related health issues, predicted poor survival and identified patients less likely to continue and benefit from azacitidine. Hence, CGA should be included in the treatment decision algorithm of older patients with MDS.","['Molga, Angela', 'Wall, Michelle', 'Chhetri, Rakchha', 'Wee, Li Yan', 'Singhal, Deepak', 'Edwards, Suzanne', 'Singhal, Nimit', 'Ross, David', 'To, Luen Bik', 'Caughey, Gillian', 'Shakib, Sepehr', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'To, Timothy', 'Hiwase, Devendra']","['Molga A', 'Wall M', 'Chhetri R', 'Wee LY', 'Singhal D', 'Edwards S', 'Singhal N', 'Ross D', 'To LB', 'Caughey G', 'Shakib S', 'Germing U', 'To T', 'Hiwase D']","['Geriatric Division, Department of Medicine, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Haematology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Haematology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia; Cancer Research, Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Haematology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia; Cancer Research, Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Haematology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia; Cancer Research, Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Public Health,University of Adelaide,Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Department of Medical Oncology, Royal Adelaide Hospital Cancer Centre, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Haematology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Haematology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Division of Rehabilitation, Aged Care and Palliative Care, Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Haematology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia; Cancer Research, Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.

In this high-risk group, the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, particularly bacteria that harbor a transferable antibiotic resistance gene, complicates the management of bacterial infections. In this study, we investigated the presence of the transferable colistin resistance mcr genes in patients with leukemia in Spain. METHODS: 217 fecal samples collected in 2013-2015 from 56 patients with acute leukemia and colonized with MDR Enterobacteriaceae strains, were screened on September 2017 for the presence of the colistin resistance mcr genes (mcr-1 to -5) by multiplex PCR. mcr positive strains selected on LBJMR and MacConkey supplemented with colistin (2 mug/ml) media were phenotypically and molecularly characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, minimum inhibitory concentration, multilocus sequence typing and plasmid characterization. RESULTS: Among 217 fecal samples, 5 samples collected from 3 patients were positive for the presence of the mcr-1 colistin-resistance gene. Four Escherichia coli strains were isolated and exhibited resistance to colistin with MIC = 4 mug/ml. Other genes conferring the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics have also been identified in mcr-1 positive strains, including blaTEM-206 and blaTEM-98. Three different sequence types were identified, including ST1196, ST140 and ST10. Plasmid characterization allowed us to detect the mcr-1 colistin resistance gene on conjugative IncP plasmid type. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, we have identified the mcr-1 gene for the first time in leukemia patients in Spain. In light of these results, strict measures have been implemented to prevent its dissemination.","['Lalaoui, Rym', 'Djukovic, Ana', 'Bakour, Sofiane', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Gonzalez-Barbera, Eva M', 'Salavert, Miguel', 'Lopez-Hontangas, Jose Luis', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Xavier, Karina B', 'Kuster, Bernhard', 'Debrauwer, Laurent', 'Ubeda, Carles', 'Rolain, Jean-Marc']","['Lalaoui R', 'Djukovic A', 'Bakour S', 'Sanz J', 'Gonzalez-Barbera EM', 'Salavert M', 'Lopez-Hontangas JL', 'Sanz MA', 'Xavier KB', 'Kuster B', 'Debrauwer L', 'Ubeda C', 'Rolain JM']","['Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France; IHU-Mediterranee Infection, Marseille, France.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica - FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France; IHU-Mediterranee Infection, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Medicine, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, University of Valencia, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, University of Valencia, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, Valencia, Spain.', 'Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Bavarian Center for Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry (BayBioMS), Technische Universitat Munchen, Gregor-Mendel-Strasse 4, 85354 Freising, Germany.', 'Toxalim, Universite de Toulouse, INRA, INP-ENVT, INP-EI-Purpan, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, F-31027, Toulouse, France; Axiom Platform, UMR 1331 Toxalim, MetaToul-MetaboHUB, National Infrastructure of Metabolomics and Fluxomics, F-31027, Toulouse, France.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica - FISABIO, Valencia, Spain; Centers of Biomedical Research Network (CIBER) in Epidemiology and Public Health, Madrid, Spain.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France; IHU-Mediterranee Infection, Marseille, France.

The use of animal models provides valuable insight into the pathogenesis of viral infections. Experimental infections of sheep have been conducted using blood from BLV-infected cattle, infectious BLV molecular clones or tumor-derived cells. The Fetal Lamb Kidney cell line, persistently infected with BLV (FLK-BLV), is one of the most commonly used long-term culture available for the permanent production of virus. FLK-BLV cells or the viral particles obtained from the cell-free culture supernatant could be used as a source of provirus or virus to experimentally infect sheep. In this report, we aimed to determine the minimum amount of FLK-BLV cells or cell-free supernatant containing BLV needed to produce infection in sheep. We also evaluated the amount of antibodies obtained from a naturally-infected cow required to neutralize this infection. We observed that both sheep experimentally inoculated with 5000 FLK-BLV cells became infected, as well as one of the sheep receiving 500 FLK-BLV cells. None of the animals inoculated with 50 FLK-BLV cells showed evidence of infection. The cell-free FLK-BLV supernatant proved to be infective in sheep up to a 1:1000 dilution. Specific BLV antibodies showed neutralizing activity as none of the sheep became infected. Conversely, the animals receiving a BLV-negative serum showed signs of BLV infection. These results contribute to the optimization of a sheep bioassay which could be useful to further characterize BLV infection.","['Porta, Natalia Gabriela', 'Alvarez, Irene', 'Suarez Archilla, Guillermo', 'Ruiz, Vanesa', 'Abdala, Alejandro', 'Trono, Karina']","['Porta NG', 'Alvarez I', 'Suarez Archilla G', 'Ruiz V', 'Abdala A', 'Trono K']","['Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA) - Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Nicolas Repetto y de los Reseros s/n (1686), Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, CONICET, Godoy Cruz 2290 (C1425FQB), CABA, Argentina.', 'Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA) - Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Nicolas Repetto y de los Reseros s/n (1686), Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, CONICET, Godoy Cruz 2290 (C1425FQB), CABA, Argentina.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared outcome of fludarabine-treosulfan (FT), thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (TBF), and sequential fludarabine, intermediate dose Ara-C, amsacrine, total body irradiation/busulfan, cyclophosphamide (FLAMSA) conditioning in patients with refractory or relapsed AML. RESULTS: Complete remission rates at day 100 were 92%, 80%, and 88% for FT, TBF, and FLAMSA, respectively (p = 0.13). Non-relapse mortality, incidence of relapse, acute (a) and chronic (c) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) rates did not differ between the three groups. Overall survival at 2 years was 37% for FT, 24% for TBF, and 34% for FLAMSA (p = 0.10). Independent prognostic factors for survival were Karnofsky performance score and patient CMV serology (p = 0.01; p = 0.02), while survival was not affected by age at transplant. The use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was associated with reduced risk of grade III-IV aGVHD (p = 0.02) and cGVHD (p = 0.006), with no influence on relapse. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FT, TBF, and FLAMSA regimens provided similar outcome in patients undergoing transplant with active AML. Survival was determined by patient characteristics as Karnofsky performance score and CMV serology, however was not affected by age at transplant. ATG appears able to reduce the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD without influencing relapse risk.","['Saraceni, Francesco', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Eder, Matthias', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Saraceni F', 'Labopin M', 'Brecht A', 'Kroger N', 'Eder M', 'Tischer J', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Einsele H', 'Beelen D', 'Bunjes D', 'Niederwieser D', 'Bochtler T', 'Savani BN', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, AV3, ASUR Marche, Macerata, Italy. francesco.saraceni@libero.it.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party - European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Paris, France. francesco.saraceni@libero.it.', 'EBMT Paris study office- CEREST-TC, Paris, France, Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Deutsche Klinik fuer Diagnostik, KMT Zentrum, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'University Hospital Eppendorf, Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Klinikum Grosshadern Med.

A meta analysis is needed in order to assess the prognostic significance of TET2 mutation in AML. METHODS: Five databases including PubMed, Cochrane, EMBase, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) and Wanfang database were retrieved to search studies that investigated the correlation between TET2 mutations and outcomes of AML patients. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) were used to assess the effects of TET2 mutations. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included. TET2 mutation was an unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival (OS: HR = 1.386; P < 0.001) and event-free survival (EFS: HR = 1.594; P = 0.002) in patients with AML. For patients under 65 years of age, TET2 mutation predicted an inferior OS (HR = 1.310, P = 0.051) and EFS (HR = 1.429, P = 0.027). For patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (IR-AML), mutant TET2 had a significant association with adverse OS (HR = 0.474; P < 0.001). For patients with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML), mutant TET2 also conferred adverse OS (HR = 1.425; P < 0.001) and EFS (HR = 1.450, P < 0.001). Further, among patients with CN-AML, mutant TET2 was associated with inferior OS (HR = 2.034, P < 0.001) and EFS (HR = 2.140, P < 0.001) in the ELN favorable-risk subgroup and an inferior EFS (HR = 1.487; P < 0.001) in the ELN intermediate-Isubgroup. With respect to treatment outcome, TET2 mutation predicted a significantly lower rate of complete remission (CR) in cases with ELN favorable-risk cytogenetics (OR = 0.460, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: TET2 mutation had adverse impacts on survival and treatment response in AML patients and will contribute to risk-stratification, prognosis prediction and therapy guidance.","['Wang, Ruiqi', 'Gao, Xiaoning', 'Yu, Li']","['Wang R', 'Gao X', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Medicine School, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. gaoxn@263.net.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. liyu301@vip.163.com.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Carson International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, 1098 Xueyuan Avenue, Shenzhen, 518060, China. liyu301@vip.163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20190425,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'China/epidemiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6485112,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'TET2 mutation']",,2019/04/27 06:00,2019/08/16 06:00,['2019/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5602-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5602-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Apr 25;19(1):389. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5602-8.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2035-7472'],,,"['81870109, 81670135/National Science Foundation of China']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is, however, no information to show that cardamonin induces cell apoptosis and alters apoptosis associated gene expressions in mouse leukemia cells. Thus, we investigated the effects of cardamonin on the apoptotic cell death and associated gene expression in mouse leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vitro. Results indicated that cardamonin decreased total viable cell number via induced cell morphological changes and apoptotic cell death in WEHI-3 cells that were assay by contrast-phase microscopy and flow cytometry examinations, respectively. The flow cytometry assay indicated that cardamonin increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca 2+ production, decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential ( DeltaPsim) and increased caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities in WEHI-3 cells. Western blotting was performed to analyze expression of relevant pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and results showed that cardamonin decreased anti-apoptotic protein of Bcl-2 but increased pro-apoptotic protein of Bax in WEHI-3 cells. Furthermore, cardamonin increased cytochrome c, AIF and Endo G release, increased GRP78, caspase-12 that were associated with ER stress and increased Fas, Fas-Ligand and FADD expression. Furthermore, cardamonin increased the gene expressions of DAP (death-associated protein), TMBIM4 transmembrane (BAX inhibitor motif containing 4), ATG5 (autophagy related 5) but decreased the gene expression of DDIT3 (DNA-damage inducible transcript 3), DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), BAG6 (BCL2-associated athanogene 6), BCL2L13 [BCL2-like 13 (apoptosis facilitator)] and BRAT1 (BRCA1-associated ATM activator 1) that are associated with apoptosis pathways. Based on those findings, we may suggest cardamonin induced apoptotic cell death through Fas and Fas-Ligand-, caspase- and mitochondria-dependently pathways and also affects the apoptotic gene expression in WEHI-3 cells in vitro.","['Liao, Nien-Chieh', 'Shih, Yung-Luen', 'Chou, Jiann-Shang', 'Chen, Kuo-Wei', 'Chen, Yung-Liang', 'Lee, Mei-Hui', 'Peng, Shu-Fen', 'Leu, Sy-Jye', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Liao NC', 'Shih YL', 'Chou JS', 'Chen KW', 'Chen YL', 'Lee MH', 'Peng SF', 'Leu SJ', 'Chung JG']","['* Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'dagger Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'section sign Department of Clinical Pathology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'double dagger School of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '** Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'daggerdagger School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Fu-Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'paragraph sign Department of Anatomic Pathology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'parallel Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'double daggerdouble dagger Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Yuanpei University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'section sign section sign Department of Genetic Counseling Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan.', 'paragraph sign paragraph sign Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', '* Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'dagger Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'parallel parallel Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', '*** Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190425,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', 'H8KP1OJ8JX (cardamonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cardamonin', 'Gene Expression', 'Mouse Leukemia WEHI-3 Cells', 'cDNA']",,2019/04/27 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2019/04/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1142/S0192415X19500332 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2019;47(3):635-656. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X19500332.

Cytarabine and other nucleoside analogs require activation to the triphosphate form (ara-CTP). Intracellular ara-CTP levels demonstrate significant inter-patient variation and have been related to therapeutic response in AML patients. Inter-patient variation in expression levels of drug transporters or enzymes involved in their activation or inactivation of cytarabine and other analogs is a prime mechanism contributing to development of drug resistance. Since microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to regulate gene-expression, the aim of this study was to identify miRNAs involved in regulation of messenger RNA expression levels of cytarabine pathway genes. We evaluated miRNA and gene-expression levels of cytarabine metabolic pathway genes in 8 AML cell lines and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data base. Using correlation analysis and functional validation experiments, our data demonstrates that miR-34a-5p and miR-24-3p regulate DCK, an enzyme involved in activation of cytarabine and DCDT, an enzyme involved in metabolic inactivation of cytarabine expression, respectively. Further our results from gel shift assays confirmed binding of these mRNA-miRNA pairs. Our results show miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression levels of nucleoside metabolic pathway genes can impact interindividual variation in expression levels which in turn may influence treatment outcomes.","['Bhise, Neha S', 'Elsayed, Abdelrahman H', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Lamba, Jatinder K']","['Bhise NS', 'Elsayed AH', 'Cao X', 'Pounds S', 'Lamba JK']","['Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, Center for Pharmacogenomics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.

They can productively recruit cellular proteins, and the human Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (hBET) proteins have been shown to be co-factors for integration of gamma-retroviruses such as Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) into human cells. By using two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, we showed that IN of the gamma- Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus-A/C (PERV IN) interacts through its C-terminal domain (CTD) with hBET proteins. We observed that PERV IN interacts with the BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 proteins in vitro and that the BRD2 protein specifically binds and co-localizes with PERV IN protein in the nucleus of cells. We further mapped the interaction sites to the conserved Extra-Terminal (ET) domain of the hBET proteins and to several amino acids of the of the C-terminal tail of the PERV IN CTD. Finally, we determined the first experimental structure of an IN CTD - BET ET complex from small-angle X-ray scattering data (SAXS). We showed that the two factors assemble as two distinct modules linked by a short loop which confers partial flexibility. The SAXS-restrained model is structurally compatible with the binding of the PERV intasome to BRD2. Altogether, these data confirm the important role of host BET proteins in the gamma-retroviruses' targeting site and efficiency of integration.","['Gallay, Kathy', 'Blot, Guillaume', 'Chahpazoff, Margaux', 'Yajjou-Hamalian, Halima', 'Confort, Marie-Pierre', 'De Boisseson, Claire', 'Leroux, Aurelie', 'Luengo, Catherine', 'Fiorini, Francesca', 'Lavigne, Marc', 'Chebloune, Yahia', 'Gouet, Patrice', 'Moreau, Karen', 'Blanchard, Yannick', 'Ronfort, Corinne']","['Gallay K', 'Blot G', 'Chahpazoff M', 'Yajjou-Hamalian H', 'Confort MP', 'De Boisseson C', 'Leroux A', 'Luengo C', 'Fiorini F', 'Lavigne M', 'Chebloune Y', 'Gouet P', 'Moreau K', 'Blanchard Y', 'Ronfort C']","['INRA, Universite Lyon 1, UMR754, Viral Infections Compared Pathology, 69007, Lyon, France; Universite de Lyon, 69000, Lyon, France; UMSl3444 Biosciences Gerland Lyon Sud, 69007, Lyon, France.', 'ANSES, Ploufragan/Plouzane Laboratory, Viral Genetics and Bio-Security Unit, Universite Europeenne de Bretagne, Ploufragan, France.', 'Molecular Microbiology and Structural Biochemistry, MMSB-IBCP, UMR 5086 CNRS University of Lyon, 7, passage du Vercors, 69367, Lyon, Cedex 07, France.', 'Molecular Microbiology and Structural Biochemistry, MMSB-IBCP, UMR 5086 CNRS University of Lyon, 7, passage du Vercors, 69367, Lyon, Cedex 07, France.', 'INRA, Universite Lyon 1, UMR754, Viral Infections Compared Pathology, 69007, Lyon, France; Universite de Lyon, 69000, Lyon, France; UMSl3444 Biosciences Gerland Lyon Sud, 69007, Lyon, France.', 'ANSES, Ploufragan/Plouzane Laboratory, Viral Genetics and Bio-Security Unit, Universite Europeenne de Bretagne, Ploufragan, France.', 'ANSES, Ploufragan/Plouzane Laboratory, Viral Genetics and Bio-Security Unit, Universite Europeenne de Bretagne, Ploufragan, France.', 'INRA, Universite Lyon 1, UMR754, Viral Infections Compared Pathology, 69007, Lyon, France; Universite de Lyon, 69000, Lyon, France; UMSl3444 Biosciences Gerland Lyon Sud, 69007, Lyon, France.', 'Molecular Microbiology and Structural Biochemistry, MMSB-IBCP, UMR 5086 CNRS University of Lyon, 7, passage du Vercors, 69367, Lyon, Cedex 07, France.', 'Pasteur Institute, Virology dept., Institut Cochin- Inserm U1016-CNRS UMR8104-Universite Paris Descartes, 27, rue du faubourg Saint Jacques, 75014, Paris, France.', ""Pathogenesis and Lentiviral Vaccination Laboratory, INRA, Univ Grenoble Alpes, 570 rue de la Chimie, 38400, St Martin d'Heres, France."", 'Molecular Microbiology and Structural Biochemistry, MMSB-IBCP, UMR 5086 CNRS University of Lyon, 7, passage du Vercors, 69367, Lyon, Cedex 07, France.', 'INRA, Universite Lyon 1, UMR754, Viral Infections Compared Pathology, 69007, Lyon, France; Universite de Lyon, 69000, Lyon, France; UMSl3444 Biosciences Gerland Lyon Sud, 69007, Lyon, France.', 'ANSES, Ploufragan/Plouzane Laboratory, Viral Genetics and Bio-Security Unit, Universite Europeenne de Bretagne, Ploufragan, France.

Herein, the conformational behaviour of these aptamers has been analysed by multiple biophysical methods. In order to investigate their functional secondary structures, these studies have been carried out in pseudo-physiological buffers mimicking different cellular environments. Both aptamers proved to be highly polymorphic, folding into stable, unimolecular G-quadruplex structures in K(+)-rich buffers. In turn, in buffered solutions containing Na(+)/Mg(2+) ions, R1.2 and R1.3 formed mainly duplex structures. Remarkably, these aptamers were able to effectively bind mIgM on B-cell lymphoma exclusively in the presence of potassium ions. These findings demonstrate the key role of G-quadruplex folding in the molecular recognition and efficient binding of R1.2 and R1.3 to mIgM expressed in lymphoma and leukemia cells, providing a precious rational basis for the design of effective aptamer-based biosensors potentially useful for the detection of cancer-relevant biomarkers.","['Moccia, Federica', 'Platella, Chiara', 'Musumeci, Domenica', 'Batool, Sana', 'Zumrut, Hasan', 'Bradshaw, John', 'Mallikaratchy, Prabodhika', 'Montesarchio, Daniela']","['Moccia F', 'Platella C', 'Musumeci D', 'Batool S', 'Zumrut H', 'Bradshaw J', 'Mallikaratchy P', 'Montesarchio D']","['Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cintia 21, I-80126 Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cintia 21, I-80126 Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cintia 21, I-80126 Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry, City University of New York - Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Blvd. West, Bronx, New York, NY 10468, USA.', 'Ph.D. Program in Chemistry and Biochemistry, CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, City University of New York - Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Blvd. West, Bronx, New York, NY 10468, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, City University of New York - Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Blvd. West, Bronx, New York, NY 10468, USA; Ph.D. Program in Chemistry and Biochemistry, CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA; Ph.D. Program in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.

Standard chemotherapeutic strategies are often ineffective in treating patients with CALM-AF10 fusions. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify molecular pathways dysregulated in CALM-AF10-positive leukemias which may lay the foundation for novel targeted therapies. Here we demonstrate that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 gene BMI1 is consistently overexpressed in adult and pediatric CALM-AF10-positive leukemias. We demonstrate that genetic Bmi1 depletion abrogates CALM-AF10-mediated transformation of murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Furthermore, CALM-AF10-positive murine and human AML cells are sensitive to the small-molecule BMI1 inhibitor PTC-209 as well as to PTC-596, a compound in clinical development that has been shown to result in downstream degradation of BMI1 protein. PTC-596 significantly prolongs survival of mice injected with a human CALM-AF10 cell line in a xenograft assay. In summary, these results validate BMI1 as a bona fide candidate for therapeutic targeting in AML with CALM-AF10 rearrangements.","['Barbosa, Karina', 'Deshpande, Anagha', 'Chen, Bo-Rui', 'Ghosh, Anwesha', 'Sun, Younguk', 'Dutta, Sayantanee', 'Weetall, Marla', 'Dixon, Jesse', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Deshpande, Aniruddha J']","['Barbosa K', 'Deshpande A', 'Chen BR', 'Ghosh A', 'Sun Y', 'Dutta S', 'Weetall M', 'Dixon J', 'Armstrong SA', 'Bohlander SK', 'Deshpande AJ']","['Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ.', 'Peptide Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

HTLV-1 is an oncogenic human retrovirus rare in North America but endemic in the Caribbean and parts of Africa, South America, Asia, and Oceania. While most infected persons do not develop disease, <5% will develop adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or neurological disease. No proven antiviral treatment for established HTLV-1 infection is available. The effect of immunosuppression on the development of HTLV-1-associated disease in asymptomatically infected recipients is not well characterized, and HTLV-1-infected individuals should be counseled that immunosuppression may increase the risk of developing HTLV-1-associated disease and they should be monitored post-transplant for HTLV-1-associated disease. Currently approved screening assays do not distinguish between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, and routine screening of deceased donors without risk factors in low seroprevalence areas is likely to result in significant organ wastage and is not recommended. Targeted screening of donors with risk factors for HTLV-1 infection and of living donors (as time is available to perform confirmatory tests) is reasonable.","['Kaul, Daniel R', 'Sharma, Tanvi S']","['Kaul DR', 'Sharma TS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190512,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Donor Selection/*standards', 'HTLV-I Infections/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Societies, Medical', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Transplant Recipients']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*complication: infectious', '*donors and donation: donor-derived infections', '*infection and infectious agents', '*viral: human T-lymphotropic virus']",,2019/04/26 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/04/26 06:00'],"['2019/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ctr.13575 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2019 Sep;33(9):e13575. doi: 10.1111/ctr.13575.

The model of hepatic hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in Chang liver cells was established. After treatment with ulinastatin at the doses of 10, 100, and 1000 U/mL in H/R liver cells, the cell proliferation was significantly increased, morphological damage was reduced, and the cell apoptosis rate was decreased. The protein levels of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and caspase-3 were upregulated, and C-PARP protein was downregulated. Meanwhile, ulinastatin led to an increase in the messenger RNA and protein levels of autophagy maker Unc-like kinase 1 (ULK1), Beclin-1, and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3) and a decrease in p62. Then, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of autophagy, made morphological damage and cell apoptosis worsen in ulinastatin-treated H/R liver cells. And the expression levels of caspase-3, C-PARP, p62, Beclin-1, and LC-3, proteins were also reversed by 3-MA. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ulinastatin inhibited the hepatic H/R injury in Chang liver cells, which was, to some extent, related to the autophagy activation.","['Zhao, Yiming', 'Cai, Huabo', 'Zhou, Pengmin', 'Lin, Shengping', 'Pan, Yun', 'Liang, Xiao']","['Zhao Y', 'Cai H', 'Zhou P', 'Lin S', 'Pan Y', 'Liang X']","['Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhe Jiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhe Jiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhe Jiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhe Jiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhe Jiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhe Jiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190424,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (P62 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trypsin Inhibitors)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ULK1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'OR3S9IF86U (urinastatin)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog/genetics/metabolism', 'Beclin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reperfusion Injury/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Trypsin Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chang liver cells', '*autophagy', '*hepatic ischemia reperfusion', '*ulinastatin']",,2019/04/26 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.28758 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Sep;120(9):14960-14970. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28758.

However, animal studies have shown that dasatinib exacerbates pulmonary hypertension (PH) in rodent models of PH but not in controls, providing support for a two-hit theory of DASA-PAH pathophysiology. Case summary: A 63-year-old man with worsening dyspnoea was diagnosed with severe DASA-PAH and concomitant scleroderma. He was successfully treated with discontinuation of dasatinib and administration of pulmonary vasodilators.

Genomic sequencing of tumours has permitted targeted treatments in other tumour types such as leukaemia and non-small cell lung cancer. These targeted treatments such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK-4) inhibitors are effective and better tolerated than chemotherapy options. Our case highlights their potential use in cardiac tumours. Case summary: An 18-year-old female patient presented with severe dyspnoea and sinus tachycardia. A computed tomography chest scan identified a large filling defect within the left atrium consistent with a cardiac tumour. The mass was surgically excised and confirmed to be an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Treatment was with doxorubicin and ifosfamide. Tumour genome sequencing was undertaken revealing an amplification of 12q including CDK-4 identifying Palbociclib (a CDK-4 inhibitor) as a potential innovative future therapeutic option in the case of failure of first-line therapy. The patient made a full recovery with no evidence of recurrence at 30 months. Discussion: Cardiac tumours are often identified during investigations for other conditions as their non-specific symptoms mimic other conditions, and a high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose them. To date Palbociclib is not yet licenced for use in cardiac sarcomas. It has been shown to be more tolerable that chemotherapy in breast cancer and offers a viable alternative therapy in cardiac sarcomas. More importantly this case demonstrates the importance of tumour genomic sequencing in identifying tumour-specific mutations that can be targeted.","['Lennerz, Carsten', ""O'Connor, Matthew"", 'Schunkert, Heribert', 'Deutsch, Marcus-Andre']","['Lennerz C', ""O'Connor M"", 'Schunkert H', 'Deutsch MA']","['Deutsches Herzzentrum Munchen, Klinik fur Herz- und Kreislauferkrankungen, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Munchen, Lazarettstr., Munich, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.', 'Wellington Hospital, Department of Cardiology, Wellington, New Zealand.', 'Deutsches Herzzentrum Munchen, Klinik fur Herz- und Kreislauferkrankungen, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Munchen, Lazarettstr., Munich, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.', 'Deutsches Herzzentrum Munchen, Klinik fur Herz- und Gefasschirurgie, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20181207,England,Eur Heart J Case Rep,European heart journal.

Extramedullary relapse is seldom isolated to one site and almost always coexists with extensive marrow disease. Leukaemic infiltration of the myocardium is a well described entity, evident in up to 44% of patients at post-mortem examination; however, ante-mortem diagnosis remains difficult and rare. As a result, myocardial involvement in the absence of any other foci of relapse has only seldom been reported. Case summary: Here, we present an unusual case of isolated gross intracardiac relapse of ALL in a patient presenting with chest pain and fevers. Both cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and endomyocardial biopsy were utilized in the diagnosis and identified leukaemic infiltrate in the absence of peripheral lymphoblasts. Discussion: Despite evidence supporting a positive correlation between peripheral lymphocyte count and myocardial infiltration, our case highlights the rare and hypothesis-driving occurrence of myocardial infiltration with a complete absence of a peripheral lymphoblastosis. The report highlights the utility of modern histopathological and imaging modalities in the diagnosis of isolated myocardial relapse of ALL and provides insight into the aetiologies driving this process.","['Nadel, James', 'Meredith, Tom', 'Anthony, Chris', 'Sivasubramaniam, Vanathi', 'Jabbour, Andrew']","['Nadel J', 'Meredith T', 'Anthony C', 'Sivasubramaniam V', 'Jabbour A']","[""St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria St, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia."", ""St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria St, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia."", ""St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria St, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia."", 'Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', ""St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria St, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia."", ""St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria St, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia."", 'Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180926,England,Eur Heart J Case Rep,European heart journal.

Methods: A total of 200 participants were recruited into a cross-sectional study. In total, 1 mL each of sera and plasma were obtained from 5 mL blood of each participant and analysed for antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus 1/2 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; positive samples confirmed with qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, followed by statistical and meta-analysis. Sociodemographic characteristics and possible risk factors were assessed via questionnaires. Results: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay yielded 1% prevalence which was confirmed to be zero via polymerase chain reaction. A total of 119 (59.5%) of the participants were male, while the mean age was 35.28 +/- 13.61 years. Apart from sex and blood reception/donation, there was generally a low rate of exposure to human T-lymphotropic virus-associated risk factors. Meta-analysis revealed pooled prevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus 1 and 2 to be 3% and 0%, respectively, from Nigerian studies. Conclusion: This study discovered zero prevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus 1/2 from five major hospitals in Nigeria's capital, exposing the importance of confirmatory assays after positive antibody detection assay results. Meta-analysis highlighted the existence of very few reliable Nigerian studies compared to the demography of the nation. Large-scale epidemiological studies and routine screening of risk populations are therefore needed since Nigeria lies in the region of endemicity.","['Anyanwu, Nneoma Confidence JeanStephanie', 'Ella, Elijah Ekah', 'Aminu, Maryam', 'Azam, Maleeha', 'Ajmal, Muhammad', 'Kazeem, Haruna Makonjuola']","['Anyanwu NCJ', 'Ella EE', 'Aminu M', 'Azam M', 'Ajmal M', 'Kazeem HM']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.', 'Department of Biosciences, COMSATS University, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.', 'Department of Biosciences, COMSATS University, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biosciences, COMSATS University, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Public Health, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190416,England,SAGE Open Med,SAGE open medicine,101624744,,,,PMC6469272,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV', 'blood donors', 'haematologic malignancies', 'leukaemia', 'lymphoma', 'lymphoproliferative disorders']","['Declaration of conflicting interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",2019/04/26 06:00,2019/04/26 06:01,['2019/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2050312119843706 [doi]', '10.1177_2050312119843706 [pii]']",epublish,SAGE Open Med. 2019 Apr 16;7:2050312119843706. doi: 10.1177/2050312119843706. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1280-7605'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent successes with BRAF inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, many patients do not respond or become resistant to these drugs. Hence, alternative treatments are still required. Due to the importance of the BCL-2-regulated apoptosis pathway in cancer development and drug resistance, it is of interest to establish which proteins are most important for melanoma cell survival, though the outcomes of previous studies have been conflicting. To conclusively address this question, we tested a panel of established and early passage patient-derived cell lines against several BH3-mimetic drugs designed to target individual or subsets of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, alone and in combination, in both 2D and 3D cell cultures. None of the drugs demonstrated significant activity as single agents, though combinations targeting MCL-1 plus BCL-XL, and to a lesser extent BCL-2, showed considerable synergistic killing activity that was elicited via both BAX and BAK. Genetic deletion of BFL-1 in cell lines that express it at relatively high levels only had minor impact on BH3-mimetic drug sensitivity, suggesting it is not a critical pro-survival protein in melanoma. Combinations of MCL-1 inhibitors with BRAF inhibitors also caused only minimal additional melanoma cell killing over each drug alone, whilst combinations with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was more effective in multiple cell lines. Our data show for the first time that therapies targeting specific combinations of BCL-2 pro-survival proteins, namely MCL-1 plus BCL-XL and MCL-1 plus BCL-2, could have significant benefit for the treatment of melanoma.","['Lee, Erinna F', 'Harris, Tiffany J', 'Tran, Sharon', 'Evangelista, Marco', 'Arulananda, Surein', 'John, Thomas', 'Ramnac, Celeste', 'Hobbs, Chloe', 'Zhu, Haoran', 'Gunasingh, Gency', 'Segal, David', 'Behren, Andreas', 'Cebon, Jonathan', 'Dobrovic, Alexander', 'Mariadason, John M', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Rohrbeck, Leona', 'Haass, Nikolas K', 'Herold, Marco J', 'Fairlie, W Douglas']","['Lee EF', 'Harris TJ', 'Tran S', 'Evangelista M', 'Arulananda S', 'John T', 'Ramnac C', 'Hobbs C', 'Zhu H', 'Gunasingh G', 'Segal D', 'Behren A', 'Cebon J', 'Dobrovic A', 'Mariadason JM', 'Strasser A', 'Rohrbeck L', 'Haass NK', 'Herold MJ', 'Fairlie WD']","['La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia.

With the updated dosing recommendations, select patients with chronic phase myeloid leukemia (CML) taking nilotinib for 3 years or more and whose leukemia has responded with sustained molecular remission (MR4.5, BCR-ABL transcripts of </=0.0032%) as determined by a FDA-approved test may be eligible to discontinue nilotinib. The updated dosing regimen was based on the efficacy results from two trials that measured how long patients could stop taking nilotinib without the leukemia returning (treatment-free remission). Trial results demonstrated that, among selected patients who received nilotinib as first-line therapy or after transition from imatinib, approximately 50% continued to be in remission at 96 weeks after stopping therapy. Relapses continued to occur throughout the study, indicating that long-term monitoring is needed for safety and disease monitoring. Discontinuation of treatment was associated with an increased risk of low grade musculoskeletal adverse events, some of which were prolonged. Overall, the results support the approval of updates to the dosing recommendations with regard to treatment discontinuation in selected patients who have received nilotinib for at least 3 years, are in a sustained molecular remission, and who can undergo appropriate monitoring. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The updated dosing information provides eligibility criteria for treatment discontinuation, strict monitoring criteria after nilotinib discontinuation, and guidance for treatment reinitiation in eligible patients with chronic phase myeloid leukemia. About half of appropriately selected patients remained in remission 96 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Patients may experience musculoskeletal pain on withdrawal of treatment, incidence of which appears to decrease over time; however, some patients may have long lasting events. The decision to withdraw or continue treatment with nilotinib should be based on clinical condition and patient preferences.","['Pulte, E Dianne', 'Wroblewski, Tanya', 'Bloomquist, Erik', 'Tang, Shenghui', 'Farrell, Ann', 'Deisseroth, Albert', 'McKee, Amy E', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Pulte ED', 'Wroblewski T', 'Bloomquist E', 'Tang S', 'Farrell A', 'Deisseroth A', 'McKee AE', 'Pazdur R']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA elizabeth.pulte@fda.hhs.gov.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Oncology Center of Excellence, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Oncology Center of Excellence, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190424,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Labeling', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Young Adult']",PMC6516133,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Drug approvals', '*Treatment-free remission', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']","['Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest may be found at the end of this', 'article.']",2019/04/26 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2018-0759 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0759 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2019 May;24(5):e188-e195. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0759.

In murine chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) CD44 on leukemia cells and E-selectin on bone marrow endothelium are essential mediators for the engraftment of leukemic stem cells. We hypothesized that non-adhesion of CML-initiating cells to E-selectin on the bone marrow endothelium may lead to superior eradication of leukemic stem cells in CML after treatment with imatinib than imatinib alone. Indeed, here we show that treatment with the E-selectin inhibitor GMI-1271 in combination with imatinib prolongs survival of mice with CML via decreased contact time of leukemia cells with bone marrow endothelium. Non-adhesion of BCR-ABL1(+) cells leads to an increase of cell cycle progression and an increase of expression of the hematopoietic transcription factor and proto-oncogene Scl/Tal1 in leukemia-initiating cells. We implicate SCL/TAL1 as an indirect phosphorylation target of BCR-ABL1 and as a negative transcriptional regulator of CD44 expression. We show that increased SCL/TAL1 expression is associated with improved outcome in human CML. These data demonstrate the BCR-ABL1-specific, cell-intrinsic pathways leading to altered interactions with the vascular niche via the modulation of adhesion molecules - which could be exploited therapeutically in the future.","['Godavarthy, Parimala Sonika', 'Kumar, Rahul', 'Herkt, Stefanie C', 'Pereira, Raquel S', 'Hayduk, Nina', 'Weissenberger, Eva S', 'Aggoune, Djamel', 'Manavski, Yosif', 'Lucas, Tina', 'Pan, Kuan-Ting', 'Voutsinas, Jenna M', 'Wu, Qian', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Lausen, Joern', 'Krause, Daniela S']","['Godavarthy PS', 'Kumar R', 'Herkt SC', 'Pereira RS', 'Hayduk N', 'Weissenberger ES', 'Aggoune D', 'Manavski Y', 'Lucas T', 'Pan KT', 'Voutsinas JM', 'Wu Q', 'Muller MC', 'Saussele S', 'Oellerich T', 'Oehler VG', 'Lausen J', 'Krause DS']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine DRK- Blutspendedienst Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessen, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Regeneration, Center for Molecular Medicine, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Regeneration, Center for Molecular Medicine, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Group, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Biostatistics, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Biostatistics, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Division of Hematology, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine DRK- Blutspendedienst Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessen, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany krause@gsh.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190424,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'E-Selectin/genetics', 'Endothelial Cells', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",PMC6939533,,,,2019/04/26 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.212365 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.212365 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jan;105(1):136-147. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.212365.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 28 chromosomal gene translocations/fusion genes, and targeted sequencing analyses were performed on five AMLs with trisomy 4 as the sole chromosomal anomaly. RESULTS: An NPM1 frameshift mutation was found in all leukemic bone marrows, DNMT3A, FLT3, and IDH1 mutations were found in three, KIT and NRAS mutations in two, whereas IDH2 (R140Q), RUNX1, and WT1 mutations were found in only one patient each. The three patients with a DNMT3A (R882H) mutation have died. In contrast, the two patients whose leukemic cells were without this mutation, are alive 55 and 31 months after diagnosis, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a possible association between trisomy 4 and additional mutations that may influence prognosis.","['Torkildsen, Synne', 'Gorunova, Ludmila', 'Heim, Sverre', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E', 'Spetalen, Signe', 'Risberg, Bente', 'Tran, Hoa Thi Tuyet', 'Panagopoulos, Ioannis']","['Torkildsen S', 'Gorunova L', 'Heim S', 'Tjonnfjord GE', 'Spetalen S', 'Risberg B', 'Tran HTT', 'Panagopoulos I']","['Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Haematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Haematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Haematology, Akershus University Hospital, Lorenskog, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ioannis.panagopoulos@rr-research.no.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', '*Trisomy']",PMC6542643,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'NPM1', 'mutations', 'targeted sequencing', 'trisomy 4']",,2019/04/26 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2019/04/26 06:00'],"['2019/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['16/3/175 [pii]', '10.21873/cgp.20123 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2019 May-Jun;16(3):175-178. doi: 10.21873/cgp.20123.,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which mogamulizumab causes skin-related AEs in patients with ATL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated whether autoantibodies were present in patients' sera using flow cytometry to determine binding to keratinocytes and melanocytes (n = 17), and immunofluorescence analysis of tissue sections. We analyzed the IgM heavy chain repertoire in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after mogamulizumab or other chemotherapy by next-generation sequencing (NGS; n = 16). RESULTS: Autoantibodies recognizing human keratinocytes or melanocytes were found in the sera of 6 of 8 patients suffering from mogamulizumab-induced erythema multiforme. In one patient, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) mediated by autoantibodies against keratinocytes or melanocytes was proportionally related to the severity of the erythema multiforme. The presence of autoantibodies in the epidermis was confirmed in all biopsy specimens of mogamulizumab-induced erythema multiforme (n = 12). Furthermore, colocalization of autoantibodies and C1q, suggesting the activation of CDC, was observed in 67% (8/12). In contrast, no autoantibody or C1q was found in ATL tumor skin lesions (n = 13). Consistent with these findings, NGS demonstrated that IgM germline genes had newly emerged and expanded, resulting in IgM repertoire skewing at the time of erythema multiforme. CONCLUSIONS: Mogamulizumab elicits autoantibodies playing an important role in skin-related AEs, possibly associated with regulatory T-cell depletion. This is the first report demonstrating the presence of skin-directed autoantibodies after mogamulizumab treatment.","['Suzuki, Yui', 'Saito, Masato', 'Ishii, Toshihiko', 'Urakawa, Itaru', 'Matsumoto, Asuka', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Suzuki, Susumu', 'Hiura, Masanori', 'Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Morita, Akimichi', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ishida, Takashi']","['Suzuki Y', 'Saito M', 'Ishii T', 'Urakawa I', 'Matsumoto A', 'Masaki A', 'Ito A', 'Kusumoto S', 'Suzuki S', 'Hiura M', 'Takahashi T', 'Morita A', 'Inagaki H', 'Iida S', 'Ishida T']","['R&D Division, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co.

This study was performed to analyze the role of mesenchymal stem cells as an alternative for cellular signaling growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of leukemogenesis in rats. Treatment of rats with 7,12-dimethyl benz [a] anthracene induced leukemogenesis appeared as a significant decrease in hematological parameters with concomitant significant increase in bone marrow oxidative and inflammatory indices (transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-6) in comparison with normal groups. On the contrary, Western immunoblotting showed a significant increase in the signaling growth factors: PI3K, AKT, mTOR proteins and a significant decrease in PTEN in 7,12-dimethyl benz [a] anthracene-treated group. In addition, a significant increase in the transcript levels of B cell lymphoma-2 protein gene in the 7,12-dimethyl benz [a] anthracene group, while that of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor-4 and B cell lymphoma-2 protein associated x-protein were significantly downregulated compared to controls. Meanwhile, therapeutic mesenchymal stem cells treatment predict a significant improvement versus 7,12-dimethyl benz [a] anthracene group through the modulation of growth factors that confront bone marrow dysplasia. In the same direction treatment of 7,12-dimethyl benz [a] anthracene group with mesenchymal stem cells, it induced apoptosis and increased the homing efficacy to bone marrow. In conclusion, mesenchymal stem cells improve hematopoiesis and alleviate inflammation, and modulated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway contributed to experimental leukemogenesis.","['Ahmed, Esraa S A', 'Ahmed, Neamat H', 'Medhat, Amina M', 'Said, Ussama Z', 'Rashed, Laila A', 'Abdel Ghaffar, Abdel Rahman B']","['Ahmed ESA', 'Ahmed NH', 'Medhat AM', 'Said UZ', 'Rashed LA', 'Abdel Ghaffar ARB']","['1 National Center for Radiation Research and Technology, Atomic Energy Authority, Cairo, Egypt.', '1 National Center for Radiation Research and Technology, Atomic Energy Authority, Cairo, Egypt.', '2 Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', '1 National Center for Radiation Research and Technology, Atomic Energy Authority, Cairo, Egypt.', '3 Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Department, Medicine Faculty, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', '2 Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/genetics/pathology/*therapy', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell lymphoma-2 protein', 'B cell lymphoma-2 protein-associated x-protein', 'C-X-C motif chemokine receptor-4', 'Leukemogenesis', 'PI3K', 'mesenchymal stem cells']",,2019/04/26 06:00,2019/05/06 06:00,['2019/04/26 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428319846803 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2019 Apr;41(4):1010428319846803. doi: 10.1177/1010428319846803.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9528-9780', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0774-7540']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently demonstrated that miR-155 sustains aneuploidy at early stages of in vitro cellular transformation. During in vitro transformation of normal human fibroblast, upregulation of miR-155 downregulates spindle checkpoint proteins as the mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 (BUB1), the centromere protein F (CENPF) and the zw10 kinetochore protein (ZW10), compromising the chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate and leading to aneuploidy in daughter cells. Here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL) binds to the polymorphic marker D2S1888 at the 3'UTR of BUB1 gene, impairs the miR-155 targeting, and restores BUB1 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This mechanism occurs at advanced passages of cell transformation and allows the expansion of more favorable clones. Our findings have revealed, at least in part, the molecular mechanisms behind the chromosomal stabilization of cell lines and the concept that, to survive, tumor cells cannot continuously change their genetic heritage but need to stabilize the most suitable karyotype.","['Pagotto, Sara', 'Veronese, Angelo', 'Soranno, Alessandra', 'Balatti, Veronica', 'Ramassone, Alice', 'Guanciali-Franchi, Paolo E', 'Palka, Giandomenico', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Autore, Francesco', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Mariani-Costantini, Renato', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Visone, Rosa']","['Pagotto S', 'Veronese A', 'Soranno A', 'Balatti V', 'Ramassone A', 'Guanciali-Franchi PE', 'Palka G', 'Innocenti I', 'Autore F', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Mariani-Costantini R', 'Laurenti L', 'Croce CM', 'Visone R']","['Ageing Research Center and Translational medicine-CeSI-MeT, 66100 Chieti, Italy. sara.pagotto@unich.it.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. sara.pagotto@unich.it.', 'Ageing Research Center and Translational medicine-CeSI-MeT, 66100 Chieti, Italy. a.veronese@unich.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Aging Sciences, ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. a.veronese@unich.it.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. alessandra.soranno@gmail.com.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.

Tagraxofusp (SL-401) is a CD123-directed cytotoxin consisting of human interleukin-3 fused to truncated diphtheria toxin. METHODS: In this open-label, multicohort study, we assigned 47 patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN to receive an intravenous infusion of tagraxofusp at a dose of 7 mug or 12 mug per kilogram of body weight on days 1 to 5 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary outcome was the combined rate of complete response and clinical complete response among patients who had not received previous treatment for BPDCN. A secondary outcome was the duration of response. RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 32 were receiving tagraxofusp as first-line treatment and 15 had received previous treatment. The median age of the patients was 70 years (range, 22 to 84). Among the 29 previously untreated patients who received tagraxofusp at a dose of 12 mug per kilogram, the primary outcome occurred in 21 (72%), and the overall response rate was 90%; of these patients, 45% went on to undergo stem-cell transplantation. Survival rates at 18 and 24 months were 59% and 52%, respectively. Among the 15 previously treated patients, the response rate was 67%, and the median overall survival was 8.5 months. The most common adverse events were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (64%) and aspartate aminotransferase (60%), hypoalbuminemia (55%), peripheral edema (51%), and thrombocytopenia (49%). Capillary leak syndrome was reported in 19% of the patients and was associated with one death in each of the dose subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN, the use of tagraxofusp led to clinical responses. Serious adverse events included capillary leak syndrome; hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia were common.

Due to their immunoregulatory properties, Breg cells may participate in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study was designed to explore the frequency of Breg cells and the relationship between the Breg cells and clinical data in patients with AML. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 46 (36 in peripheral blood, 10 in bone marrow) AML patients and 15 healthy donors (HD) were included for detection of Breg cells frequency by multicolor flow cytometry. All cases were divided into different groups according to FAB subtypes of leukemia, white blood cell count (WBC) levels, age, cytogenetic characteristics, and molecular abnormalities, and were compared the differences of Breg cell frequency. Survival curve analysis was performed to estimate the value of Breg cell frequency in prognosis among cases with AML. RESULTS We found that the frequency of Breg cells was higher in AML patients both in peripheral blood (PB) and in bone marrow (BM) compared with those in HDs. The AML patients with high WBC levels had higher Breg cell frequency compared with those with low WBC levels. Low-risk patients with had lower Breg cells frequency compared to the medium-risk patients. The patients with high WBC and high Breg cells frequency showed a shorter overall survival. Similarly, the overall survival of AML patients in the older group with high Breg cells frequency was significantly shorter than in the younger group with low Breg cell frequency. CONCLUSIONS For AML patients, the frequency of Breg cells was elevated, and high frequency of Breg cells may reveal poor prognosis.","['Lv, Ying', 'Wang, Hongtao', 'Liu, Zhuogang']","['Lv Y', 'Wang H', 'Liu Z']","['China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China (mainland).', 'China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China (mainland).', 'China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190424,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC6496973,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['915556 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.915556 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Apr 24;25:3026-3031. doi: 10.12659/MSM.915556.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ipomeolides A (1) and B (2) are macrolactone analogues of the rare (11 R)-jalapinolic acid, and macrolactonization occurred at C-2 of the second saccharide moiety. Compounds 1 and 2 show structural variation even in the pentasaccharide core. The structures of 1 and 2 were established by a combination of spectroscopic techniques as well as chemical modifications such as acetyl and acetonide derivatives as well as hydrolysis products. The new glycosidic acid was named ipomeic acid (1c). Compounds 1, 1b, and 2b were evaluated for cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines. Compounds 1b and 2b were not effective on epithelial cells, but affected survival of K-562, which is of hematopoietic origin. A sublethal concentration of compound 1 (4 muM) when used in combination with 1 muM doxorubicin, an anticancer agent, significantly enhanced cytotoxicity to tumor cells. Such combined synergistic potency against leukemia cells and the absence of effects on epithelial cells may be beneficial for chemotherapy with minimal side effects to treat CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) malignancies.","['Sura, Madhu B', 'Ponnapalli, Mangala G', 'Annam, S Ch V A Rao', 'Bobbili, V V Pardhasaradhi']","['Sura MB', 'Ponnapalli MG', 'Annam SCVAR', 'Bobbili VVP']","['Centre for Natural Products and Traditional Knowledge , Indian Institute of Chemical Technology , Hyderabad 500007 , India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Campus , Hyderabad 500007 , India.', 'Centre for Natural Products and Traditional Knowledge , Indian Institute of Chemical Technology , Hyderabad 500007 , India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Campus , Hyderabad 500007 , India.', 'Centre for Natural Products and Traditional Knowledge , Indian Institute of Chemical Technology , Hyderabad 500007 , India.', 'Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology , Hyderabad 500007 , India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190424,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Resins, Plant)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Glycosides/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ipomoea/*chemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Components, Aerial/chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Resins, Plant/*therapeutic use']",,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/08/29 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b01100 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2019 May 24;82(5):1292-1300. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b01100.

We report five cases: four had ALL diagnosed after MDS or MDS/MPN and one had ALL and MDS diagnosed simultaneously. At the onset of ALL, all patients showed co-existing MDS or MDS/MPN. Map-back FISH was performed in four patients, showing that ALL and MDS were cytogenetically related in two patients and unrelated in the other two patients. All five patients were treated with ALL-based chemotherapies, two patients with ALL clonally related to MDS were refractory to the therapies, whereas the other three patients achieved remission. We conclude that ALL developed after MDS is extremely rare. In some patients, ALL is clonally related to MDS and these patients may be refractory to ALL-based chemotherapies. In other patients who have no evidence of clonal relation between ALL and MDS, these patients more likely respond to ALL-based treatment regimens.","['Xie, Wei', 'Chen, Zhining', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Tang, Guiling']","['Xie W', 'Chen Z', 'Wang SA', 'Hu S', 'Li S', 'Miranda RN', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Tang G']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190424,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/etiology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*etiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*Lymphoblastic leukemia', '*MDS', '*MDS/MPN', '*clonally related']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1605509 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Dec;60(12):2993-3001. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1605509.

We found that CWP induced apoptosis in the primary AML cells without affecting the normal PBMCs that were isolated from healthy individuals, as determined by PI/annexin V double staining followed by flow-cytometry analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these primary AML cells exhibited aberrant phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and STAT3. Treatment of AML cells with CWP mediated significant reduction in the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and STAT3. Additionally, we demonstrated that blockade of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by wortmannin (WM) impaired the expression of Bcl-2 and BclXL in the primary AML cells, suggesting an essential cross-talk between PI3K and Bcl-2 that maintains the survival of AML cells. In this context, treatment of AML cells with CWP disrupted the PI3K/Bcl-2 cross-talk; significantly downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and BclXL; markedly upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax; and subsequently sensitized tumor cells to growth arrest. Our data revealed the therapeutic potential of CWP and the underlying mechanisms against leukemia.","['Badr, Gamal', 'Zahran, Asmaa M', 'Omar, Hossam M', 'Barsoum, Martina A', 'Mahmoud, Mohamed H']","['Badr G', 'Zahran AM', 'Omar HM', 'Barsoum MA', 'Mahmoud MH']","['a Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'b Laboratory of Immunology and Molecular Physiology, Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'c King Saud University , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia.', 'd Clinical Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'a Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'e Laboratory of Physiology, Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'a Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'b Laboratory of Immunology and Molecular Physiology, Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'e Laboratory of Physiology, Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Assiut University , Assiut , Egypt.', 'f Deanship of Scientific Research , King Saud University , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia.', 'g Food Science and Nutrition Department , National Research Center , Cairo , Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190424,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Whey Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Camelus', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Whey Proteins/*pharmacology']",,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2019.1595054 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2019;71(6):1040-1054. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2019.1595054.

To the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews have summarized the most recently published evidence and no analyses have examined the dose-response relation. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the extent to which outdoor air pollution, especially as resulting from traffic-related contaminants, affects the risk of childhood leukemia. METHODS: We searched all case-control and cohort studies that have investigated the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to exposure either to motorized traffic and related contaminants, based on various traffic-related metrics (number of vehicles in the closest roads, road density, and distance from major roads), or to measured or modeled levels of air contaminants such as benzene, nitrogen dioxide, 1,3-butadiene, and particulate matter. We carried out a meta-analysis of all eligible studies, including nine studies published since the last systematic review and, when possible, we fit a dose-response curve using a restricted cubic spline regression model. RESULTS: We found 29 studies eligible to be included in our review. In the dose-response analysis, we found little association between disease risk and traffic indicators near the child's residence for most of the exposure range, with an indication of a possible excess risk only at the highest levels. In contrast, benzene exposure was positively and approximately linearly associated with risk of childhood leukemia, particularly for acute myeloid leukemia, among children under 6 y of age, and when exposure assessment at the time of diagnosis was used. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide showed little association with leukemia risk except at the highest levels. DISCUSSION: Overall, the epidemiologic literature appears to support an association between benzene and childhood leukemia risk, with no indication of any threshold effect. A role for other measured and unmeasured pollutants from motorized traffic is also possible. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4381.","['Filippini, Tommaso', 'Hatch, Elizabeth E', 'Rothman, Kenneth J', 'Heck, Julia E', 'Park, Andrew S', 'Crippa, Alessio', 'Orsini, Nicola', 'Vinceti, Marco']","['Filippini T', 'Hatch EE', 'Rothman KJ', 'Heck JE', 'Park AS', 'Crippa A', 'Orsini N', 'Vinceti M']","['1 Environmental, Genetic and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center (CREAGEN), Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena, Italy.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health , Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health , Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', '3 RTI Health Solutions , Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.', '4 Department of Epidemiology, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health , Los Angeles, California, USA.', '4 Department of Epidemiology, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health , Los Angeles, California, USA.', '5 Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm, Sweden.', '6 Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm, Sweden.', '1 Environmental, Genetic and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center (CREAGEN), Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena, Italy.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health , Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Vehicle Emissions']",PMC6785230,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/01/01 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/EHP4381 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2019 Apr;127(4):46002. doi: 10.1289/EHP4381.,,,,['R21 ES018960/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DS is associated with several phenotypes, including intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, childhood leukemia and immune defects. Specific microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) have been described to be associated with DS, although none of them so far have been unequivocally linked to the pathology. The present study focuses to the best of our knowledge for the first time on the miRNAs contained in nanosized RNA carriers circulating in the blood. Fractions enriched in nanosized RNAcarriers were separated from the plasma of young participants with DS and their nontrisomic siblings and miRNAs were extracted. A microarraybased analysis on a small cohort of samples led to the identification of the three most abundant miRNAs, namely miR165p, miR99b5p and miR1443p. These miRNAs were then profiled for 15 pairs of DS and nontrisomic sibling couples by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). Results identified a clear differential expression trend of these miRNAs in DS with respect to their nontrisomic siblings and gene ontology analysis pointed to their potential role in a number of typical DS features, including 'nervous system development', 'neuronal cell body' and certain forms of 'leukemia'. Finally, these expression levels were associated with certain typical quantitative and qualitative clinical features of DS. These results contribute to the efforts in defining the DSassociated pathogenic mechanisms and emphasize the importance of properly stratifying the miRNA fluid vehicles in order to probe biomolecules that are otherwise hidden and/or not accessible to (standard) analysis.","['Salvi, Alessandro', 'Vezzoli, Marika', 'Busatto, Sara', 'Paolini, Lucia', 'Faranda, Teresa', 'Abeni, Edoardo', 'Caracausi, Maria', 'Antonaros, Francesca', 'Piovesan, Allison', 'Locatelli, Chiara', 'Cocchi, Guido', 'Alvisi, Gualtiero', 'De Petro, Giuseppina', 'Ricotta, Doris', 'Bergese, Paolo', 'Radeghieri, Annalisa']","['Salvi A', 'Vezzoli M', 'Busatto S', 'Paolini L', 'Faranda T', 'Abeni E', 'Caracausi M', 'Antonaros F', 'Piovesan A', 'Locatelli C', 'Cocchi G', 'Alvisi G', 'De Petro G', 'Ricotta D', 'Bergese P', 'Radeghieri A']","['Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Biostatistics, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), Unit of Histology, Embryology and Applied Biology, University of Bologna, I40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'CSGI, Research Center for Colloids and Nanoscience, Sesto Fiorentino, I50019 Florence, Italy.', 'CSGI, Research Center for Colloids and Nanoscience, Sesto Fiorentino, I50019 Florence, Italy.', 'Neonatology Unit, St. OrsolaMalpighi Polyclinic, I40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Neonatology Unit, St. OrsolaMalpighi Polyclinic, I40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, I35121 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, I25123 Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190409,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (MIRN144 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN99 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Down Syndrome/blood/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Young Adult']",PMC6488180,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2019.4158 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2019 Jun;43(6):2303-2318. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2019.4158.

METHODS: We aimed to develop a tool that allows straightforward access to the entire information content of any given flow cytometry panel for immunologists without special computational expertise. We used a data analysis approach which accounts for all mathematically possible combinations of markers in a given panel, coded the algorithm and applied the method to mined and self-generated data sets. RESULTS: We developed Flow Plex, a straightforward computational tool that allows unrestricted access to the information content of a given flow cytometry panel, enables classification of human samples according to distinct immune phenotypes, such as different forms of autoimmune uveitis, acute myeloid leukemia vs ""healthy"", ""old"" vs ""young"", and facilitates the identification of cell populations with potential biologic relevance to states of disease and health.

While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been regarded as a favorable treatment option in adult Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL, its benefit is less clear in the era of newer generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like dasatinib. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that analyzed the outcomes of adult patients with Ph+ ALL treated with either combination chemotherapy plus dasatinib or combination chemotherapy plus dasatinib followed by allogeneic HSCT. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were included; 30 (42.9%) underwent allogeneic HSCT while 40 (57.1%) received only chemotherapy plus dasatinib. In comparing overall survival (OS) rates, results between the 2 groups were similar with a 1-year OS of 93.3% versus 100% (P = 0.20), 2-year OS of 89.8% versus 86.2% (P = 0.72), and 3-year OS of 76% versus 71.3% (P = 0.56) in the transplant versus nontransplant groups, respectively. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were also similar at 70.5% in the transplant group and 80.1% in the nontransplant group (P = 0.94). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with specific poor prognostic factors (higher white blood count, older age, positive minimal residual disease status), but results again showed no significant survival difference between transplant and nontransplant patients. CONCLUSIONS: While HSCT has historically led to a survival advantage in Ph+ ALL, the results of our study demonstrate that it may have a less beneficial role in the era of newer generation TKIs such as dasatinib.","['Chang, Jeremy', 'Douer, Dan', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Vahdani, Golnaz', 'Jeong, Ah-Reum', 'Ghaznavi, Zunera', 'Zhang, Sherry', 'Yaghmour, George', 'Lee, Kum-Ja', 'Weissman, Ashley', 'Akhtari, Mojtaba']","['Chang J', 'Douer D', 'Aldoss I', 'Vahdani G', 'Jeong AR', 'Ghaznavi Z', 'Zhang S', 'Yaghmour G', 'Lee KJ', 'Weissman A', 'Akhtari M']","['Los Angeles County - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Norris Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Los Angeles County - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Los Angeles County - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Norris Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Norris Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, Los Angeles, California.', 'University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, Los Angeles, California.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, Norris Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190423,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,['RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6558592,['NOTNLM'],"['*Dasatinib', '*Philadelphia chromosome', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*stem cell transplantation', '*survival']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2153 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Jun;8(6):2832-2839. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2153.

It has the functionality of standard flow cytometry and generates high-resolution digital images of each cell with quantifiable numerical data. We demonstrate the use of an automated high-throughput method for performing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on immunophenotyped whole cells in suspension and analyzed by imaging flow cytometry, a technique called ""Immuno-flowFISH"". The aim of this study was to demonstrate the application of immuno-flowFISH for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities in CLL, specifically trisomy 12 and del(17p). Mononuclear cells were isolated and immunophenotyped with fluorescently conjugated CD3, CD5, and CD19 monoclonal antibodies. Following fixation, cells were permeabilized, dsDNA denatured and hybridized with chromosome 12 or 17 enumeration (CEP 12 and CEP17) and 17p12 locus-specific FISH probes. Cells were analyzed on the Amnis ImageStream(R)X Mark II to assess the number and percent FISH-positive CLL cells and the ratio of FISH spot counts for CD5/CD19-positive CLL cells to CD3/CD5-positive T cells (FISH ""mean spot ratio""). Deletion of 17p was detected in about 8% of cases to date, with del(17p) ranged from 3.5-22.8% and the FISH ""mean spot ratio"" 0.86-0.96. Immuno-flowFISH also detected a minimal residual disease case with +12 with a limit of detection of 0.13% and a rare case that presented with atypical phenotype and cytogenetics. Immuno-flowFISH could detect del(17p) in phenotypically identified CD5/CD19-positive B-cells. The 100-fold increase in analyzed cells, as well as the addition of cell phenotype increased the sensitivity and specificity over current clinical FISH testing. Furthermore, immuno-flowFISH analysis demonstrated specific utility in unique clinical scenarios such as residual disease and atypical biology cases which may be of significant benefit with regards to prognostication and MRD analysis. The method will assist in therapeutic decision making and disease monitoring for many hematological malignancies.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plays an important role in neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In this study, a rat model of autologous blood-induced ICH was used to evaluate the effect of LIF on the neurogenesis and angiogenesis following ICH. After ICH, LIF-positive neurons and dilated vessels were detected in the peri-hematomal region. It was found that LIF levels increased significantly and peaked 14 days after ICH induction. Double immunofluorescence confirmed that LIF was expressed in neurons and endothelial cells. ICH also led to increases of doublecortin (DCX)- and von Willebrand factor (vWF)-positive cells as well as proliferation of cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)+/DCX+ and PCNA+/vWF+ nuclei. All these ICH-induced increases were significantly attenuated by exogenous LIF infusion. These data suggested that LIF was a negative regulator of neurogenesis and angiogenesis after ICH.","['Liu, Chuan-Zhen', 'Zhou, Hua-Jun', 'Zhong, Jian-Hua', 'Tang, Tao', 'Cui, Han-Jin', 'Zhou, Jing-Hua', 'Zhang, Qiang', 'Mei, Zhi-Gang']","['Liu CZ', 'Zhou HJ', 'Zhong JH', 'Tang T', 'Cui HJ', 'Zhou JH', 'Zhang Q', 'Mei ZG']","['Institute of Neurology, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First College of Clinical Medical Sciences, Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China.', 'Institute of Neurology, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China. zhouhuajun02@126.com.', 'Department of Neurology, The First College of Clinical Medical Sciences, Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China. zhouhuajun02@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China. zhouhuajun02@126.com.', 'Department of Intensive Care Unit, The First College of Clinical Medical Sciences, Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China.', 'Institute of Integrative Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Institute of Integrative Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Institute of Neurology, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First College of Clinical Medical Sciences, Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China.', 'Institute of Neurology, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First College of Clinical Medical Sciences, Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443003, China.', 'Medical College of China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443002, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190423,China,Curr Med Sci,Current medical science,101729993,"['0 (Dcx protein, rat)', '0 (Doublecortin Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doublecortin Protein', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'Neurogenesis/*physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,['NOTNLM'],"['angiogenesis', 'intracerebral hemorrhage', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'neurogenesis']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11596-019-2034-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11596-019-2034-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Med Sci. 2019 Apr;39(2):298-304. doi: 10.1007/s11596-019-2034-2.

However, the mechanism is not clear. This study was designed to investigate the effect of Shoutai pills on the levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in rats with stimulated ovulation and the mechanism. The rat model of stimulated ovulation was established by combined injection of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Then the rats were randomly divided into model group (M), Shoutai pills group (S), progesterone group (P) and normal group (N). All the pregnant rats were treated from the first day. The S and P groups were administrated with gavage of Shoutai pills and injection of progesterone respectively, and N and M groups were given the same volume of normal saline and distilled water respectively. After treatment for 7 days, the animals were executed for serum and uterine tissues. The ELISA method was adopted to detect the contents of Th1 cytokines [interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10). The expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) was detected by Western blotting and real-time PCR. As compared with N group, the expression levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2 in M group were significantly increased, and those of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, LIF and LIFR were significantly decreased (P<0.05). As compared with M group, the levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, LIF and LIFR in S group were significantly increased (P<0.05), and those of IFN-gamma and IL-2 were significantly decreased (P<0.05). It was suggested that Shoutai pills can increase the levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, LIF and LIFR as well as reduce the levels of INF-gamma and IL-2 in rats with stimulated ovulation. The Shoutai pills may improve endometrial receptivity and promote embryo implantation by maintaining the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokines.","['Zhang, Juan', 'Chen, Li', 'Zheng, Cui-Hong', 'Wang, Jing', 'Xie, Di', 'Zhou, Yue-Xi']","['Zhang J', 'Chen L', 'Zheng CH', 'Wang J', 'Xie D', 'Zhou YX']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Central Theater General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wuhan, 430070, China. zhangl27@126.com."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Central Theater General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wuhan, 430070, China."", 'Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430065, China.', 'Institute of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Central Theater General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wuhan, 430070, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Central Theater General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wuhan, 430070, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Central Theater General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wuhan, 430070, China."", 'Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430065, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190423,China,Curr Med Sci,Current medical science,101729993,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*blood/*metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional/methods', 'Ovulation/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ovulation Induction/methods', 'Progesterone', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Th1 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Shoutai pills', 'Th1/Th2', 'cytokines', 'rats']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11596-019-2032-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11596-019-2032-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Med Sci. 2019 Apr;39(2):285-290. doi: 10.1007/s11596-019-2032-4.

Indeed, various studies have confirmed the feasibility of discontinuing TKI therapy. In this study, we analyzed data from 45 CML patients who had discontinued TKI therapy. Univariate analysis was performed to predict factors that were potentially related to treatment-free remission (TFR) and identify the differences between early relapse and late relapse. Out of the 45 patients, 20 exhibited molecular relapse after a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 1-54 months), and the estimated TFR at 24 months was 40%. The univariate analysis revealed that a high Sokal score and interruptions or dose reductions during TKI treatment were the only baseline factors associated with poor outcomes.

CNS involvement significantly reduces survival and there are no effective treatments for CNS involvement. Therefore, an appropriate animal model is required to evaluate the inhibitory effects of novel drugs on the progression of ATL with CNS involvement. Here, we established a mouse model of ATL with CNS involvement using NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ mice inoculated with ATL cells intramuscularly in the postauricular region, and these mice showed paraparesis. Of the 10 mice inoculated with ATL cells intramuscularly (I.M.) at 5 weeks of age, 8 (80%) showed paraparesis, whereas none of the 10 mice inoculated with ATL cells subcutaneously (S.C.) showed paraparesis. In the I.M. group, PCR detected HTLV-1-specific genes in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae; however, in the S.C. group, the vertebrae were negative for HTLV-1 genes. Histological analysis revealed a particularly high incidence of tumors, characterized by accumulation of the injected cells, in the thoracic vertebrae of mice in the I.M. group. Tumor cell infiltration was relatively high in the bone marrow. Spinal cord compression caused by invasion of the tumor mass outside the pia mater was observed in the thoracic vertebrae of the spinal cord. In conclusion, we have reported a mouse model of tumor growth with paraparesis that may be used to assess novel therapeutic agents for ATL with CNS involvement.","['Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Tanaka, Shuhei', 'Iwasaki, Keigo', 'Nagano, Yusuke', 'Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Matsuda, Kazuya', 'Hirose, Takuya', 'Takehana, Kazushige']","['Ohsugi T', 'Tanaka S', 'Iwasaki K', 'Nagano Y', 'Kozako T', 'Matsuda K', 'Hirose T', 'Takehana K']","['Department of Laboratory Animal Sciences School of Veterinary Medicine Rakuno Gakuen University Ebetsu Hokkaido Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Animal Sciences School of Veterinary Medicine Rakuno Gakuen University Ebetsu Hokkaido Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Animal Sciences School of Veterinary Medicine Rakuno Gakuen University Ebetsu Hokkaido Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Animal Sciences School of Veterinary Medicine Rakuno Gakuen University Ebetsu Hokkaido Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences Department of Biochemistry Fukuoka University Fukuoka Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology School of Veterinary Medicine Rakuno Gakuen University Ebetsu Hokkaido Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Microanatomy School of Veterinary Medicine Rakuno Gakuen University Ebetsu Hokkaido Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Microanatomy School of Veterinary Medicine Rakuno Gakuen University Ebetsu Hokkaido Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190129,United States,Animal Model Exp Med,Animal models and experimental medicine,101726292,,,,PMC6431123,['NOTNLM'],"['NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice', 'adult T-cell leukemia (ATL)', 'central nervous system (CNS)', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1)', 'mice']",['None.'],2019/04/25 06:00,2019/04/25 06:01,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/ame2.12053 [doi]', 'AME212053 [pii]']",epublish,Animal Model Exp Med. 2019 Jan 29;2(1):64-67. doi: 10.1002/ame2.12053. eCollection 2019 Mar.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7818-6840'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this paper proposes an effective classification model for three types of NHL pathological images, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Methods: There are three main parts with respect to our model. First, NHL pathological images stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) are transferred into blue ratio (BR) and Lab spaces, respectively. Then specific patch-level textural and statistical features are extracted from BR images and color features are obtained from Lab images both using a hierarchical way, yielding a set of hand-crafted representations corresponding to different image spaces. A random forest classifier is subsequently trained for patch-level classification. Second, H&E images are cropped and fed into a pretrained google inception net (GoogLeNet) for learning high-level representations and a softmax classifier is used for patch-level classification. Finally, three image-level classification strategies based on patch-level results are discussed including a novel method for calculating the weighted sum of patch results. Different classification results are fused at both feature 1 and image levels to obtain a more satisfactory result. Results: The proposed model is evaluated on a public IICBU Malignant Lymphoma Dataset and achieves an improved overall accuracy of 0.991 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.998. Conclusion: The experimentations demonstrate the significantly increased classification performance of the proposed model, indicating that it is a suitable classification approach for NHL pathological images.","['Bai, Jie', 'Jiang, Huiyan', 'Li, Siqi', 'Ma, Xiaoqi']","['Bai J', 'Jiang H', 'Li S', 'Ma X']","['Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China.', 'Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China.', 'Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China.', 'School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190321,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,,,"['Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'ROC Curve']",PMC6448331,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1065652 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Mar 21;2019:1065652. doi: 10.1155/2019/1065652. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2773-4138', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1428-8776']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is highly detected in CML patients. Our aim was to explore whether TNF-alpha is a potential target for LSC elimination. Materials and methods: We applied a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique, colony-forming cell assay, subcutaneous tumor models, miRNA-seq and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) on metabonomics to explore the feasibility and mechanism of TNF-alpha as a new therapeutic target for CML. Results: We demonstrated that TNF-alpha knockout remarkably decreased the proliferative, colony-forming and in vivo tumorigenesis capacities of the CML K562 cell line. The apoptosis was increased when TNF-alpha knockout cells were cultured with imatinib. The mechanisms involved in the abovementioned phenomena were that TNF-alpha knockout inhibited the citrate cycle and increased starch, sucrose, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. In addition, differentially expressed miRNAs between TNF-alpha knockout and control cells were involved in the cell cycle, CML, P13K-Akt and pathways in cancer. Conclusion: We identified that TNF-alpha may serve as a new target therapy for CML and described the metabolic pathways associated with TNF-alpha in CML cells for the first time.","['Shen, Na', 'Liu, Songya', 'Cui, Jieke', 'Li, Qing', 'You, Yong', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'Cheng, Fanjun', 'Guo, An-Yuan', 'Zou, Ping', 'Yuan, Guolin', 'Zhu, Xiaojian']","['Shen N', 'Liu S', 'Cui J', 'Li Q', 'You Y', 'Zhong Z', 'Cheng F', 'Guo AY', 'Zou P', 'Yuan G', 'Zhu X']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China, zhuxiaojian@hust.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No 1 Hospital, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang 441000, China, yuanguolin1973@sina.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China, zhuxiaojian@hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190329,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6446984,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'metabolism profile', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'tumorigenesis']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2019/04/25 06:00,2019/04/25 06:01,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S197535 [doi]', 'ott-12-2355 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Mar 29;12:2355-2364. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S197535. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune checkpoint inhibition, for example, by antibody-mediated programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade, is a potent therapeutic modality that improves treatment outcomes in acute myeloid leukaemia. Here, we show that systemically delivered blood platelets decorated with anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD-1) and conjugated to haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) suppress the growth and recurrence of leukaemia in mice. Following intravenous injection into mice bearing leukaemia cells, the HSC-platelet-aPD-1 conjugate migrated to the bone marrow and locally released aPD-1, significantly enhancing anti-leukaemia immune responses, and increasing the number of active T cells, production of cytokines and chemokines, and survival time of the mice. This cellular conjugate also promoted resistance to re-challenge with leukaemia cells. Taking advantage of the homing capability of HSCs and in situ activation of platelets for the enhanced delivery of a checkpoint inhibitor, this cellular combination-mediated drug delivery strategy can significantly augment the therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint blockade.","['Hu, Quanyin', 'Sun, Wujin', 'Wang, Jinqiang', 'Ruan, Huitong', 'Zhang, Xudong', 'Ye, Yanqi', 'Shen, Song', 'Wang, Chao', 'Lu,

Among the leading, biologically active analogs were (Z)-2-((2-((1-ethyl-5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-3-oxo-2,3-dihydrobenzofura n-6-yl)oxy)acetonitrile (5a) and (Z)-6-((2,6-dichlorobenzyl)oxy)-2-(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)benzofuran-3(2H)-one (5b) that inhibited in vitro PC-3 prostate cancer cell proliferation with IC50 values below 100 nM. A xenograft study in nude mice using 10 mg/kg of 5a had no effect on mice weight, and aurone 5a did not inhibit, as desired, the human ether-a-go-go-related (hERG) potassium channel. Cell cycle arrest data, comparisons of the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by aurones and known antineoplastic agents, and in vitro inhibition of tubulin polymerization indicated that aurone 5a disrupted tubulin dynamics. Based on molecular docking and confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry studies, aurone 5a targets the colchicine-binding site on tubulin. In addition to solid tumors, aurones 5a and 5b strongly inhibited in vitro a panel of human leukemia cancer cell lines and the in vivo myc-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in a

Abnormal regulation of gene expression is closely related to carcinogenesis, which is why the assessment of DNA methylation is a key factor in cancer research. Terahertz radiation may play an important role in active demethylation for cancer therapy because the characteristic frequency of the methylated DNA exists in the terahertz region. Here, we present a novel technique for the detection and manipulation of DNA methylation using terahertz radiation in blood cancer cell lines. We observed the degree of DNA methylation in blood cancer at the characteristic resonance of approximately 1.7 THz using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The terahertz results were cross-checked with global DNA methylation quantification using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also achieved the demethylation of cancer DNA using high-power terahertz radiation at the 1.7-THz resonance. The demethylation degrees ranged from 10% to 70%, depending on the type of cancer cell line. Our results show the detection of DNA methylation based on the terahertz molecular resonance and the manipulation of global DNA methylation using high-power terahertz radiation. Terahertz radiation may have potential applications as an epigenetic inhibitor in cancer treatment, by virtue of its ability to induce DNA demethylation, similarly to decitabine.","['Cheon, Hwayeong', 'Paik, Jin Ho', 'Choi, Moran', 'Yang, Hee-Jin', 'Son, Joo-Hiuk']","['Cheon H', 'Paik JH', 'Choi M', 'Yang HJ', 'Son JH']","['Department of Physics, University of Seoul, Seoul, 02504, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seong-Nam, 13620, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Centre, Seoul, 07061, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Centre, Seoul, 07061, Republic of Korea. nsyangdr@gmail.com.', 'Department of Physics, University of Seoul, Seoul, 02504, Republic of Korea. joohiuk@uos.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190423,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*blood/*genetics', 'Demethylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Terahertz Radiation']",PMC6478716,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-42855-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-42855-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Apr 23;9(1):6413. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-42855-x.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6181-7768', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6413-1363']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identity of the molecular mechanisms that govern the R-point decision is one of the fundamental issues in cell biology. We found that early after mitogenic stimulation, RUNX3 binds to its target loci, where it opens chromatin structure by sequential recruitment of Trithorax group proteins and cell-cycle regulators to drive cells to the R-point. Soon after, RUNX3 closes these loci by recruiting Polycomb repressor complexes, causing the cell to pass through the R-point toward S phase. If the RAS signal is constitutively activated, RUNX3 inhibits cell cycle progression by maintaining R-point-associated genes in an open structure. Our results identify RUNX3 as a pioneer factor for the R-point and reveal the molecular mechanisms by which appropriate chromatin modifiers are selectively recruited to target loci for appropriate R-point decisions.","['Lee, Jung-Won', 'Kim, Da-Mi', 'Jang, Ju-Won', 'Park, Tae-Geun', 'Song, Soo-Hyun', 'Lee, You-Soub', 'Chi, Xin-Zi', 'Park, Il Yeong', 'Hyun, Jin-Won', 'Ito, Yoshiaki', 'Bae, Suk-Chul']","['Lee JW', 'Kim DM', 'Jang JW', 'Park TG', 'Song SH', 'Lee YS', 'Chi XZ', 'Park IY', 'Hyun JW', 'Ito Y', 'Bae SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 361-763, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju, 63243, South Korea.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, Singapore, 117599.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Institute for Tumor Research, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, South Korea. scbae@chungbuk.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190423,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', '0 (U 0126)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/cytology/genetics/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6479060,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/05/09 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-09810-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-09810-w [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Apr 23;10(1):1897. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-09810-w.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4613-3517'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), intra-tumoral DNA methylation (DNAme) heterogeneity empowers evolution. Here, to comprehensively study the epigenetic dimension of cancer evolution, we integrate DNAme analysis with histone modification mapping and single cell analyses of RNA expression and DNAme in 22 primary CLL and 13 healthy donor B lymphocyte samples. Our data reveal corrupted coherence across different layers of the CLL epigenome. This manifests in decreased mutual information across epigenetic modifications and gene expression attributed to cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Disrupted epigenetic-transcriptional coordination in CLL is also reflected in the dysregulation of the transcriptional output as a function of the combinatorial chromatin states, including incomplete Polycomb-mediated gene silencing. Notably, we observe unexpected co-mapping of typically mutually exclusive activating and repressing histone modifications, suggestive of intra-tumoral epigenetic diversity. Thus, CLL epigenetic diversification leads to decreased coordination across layers of epigenetic information, likely reflecting an admixture of cells with diverging cellular identities.","['Pastore,

OBI-3424 has entered clinical testing for hepatocellular carcinoma and castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and it represents a potentially novel treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed AKR1C3 expression by RNA-Seq and immunoblotting, and evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of OBI-3424. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of OBI-3424 in mice and nonhuman primates, and assessed the in vivo efficacy of OBI-3424 against a large panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDX). RESULTS: AKR1C3 mRNA expression was significantly higher in primary T-lineage ALL (T-ALL; n = 264) than B-lineage ALL (B-ALL; n = 1,740; P < 0.0001), and OBI-3424 exerted potent cytotoxicity against T-ALL cell lines and PDXs. In vivo, OBI-3424 significantly prolonged the event-free survival (EFS) of nine of nine ALL PDXs by 17.1-77.8 days (treated/control values 2.5-14.0), and disease regression was observed in eight of nine PDXs. A significant reduction (P < 0.0001) in bone marrow infiltration at day 28 was observed in four of six evaluable T-ALL PDXs. The importance of AKR1C3 in the in vivo response to OBI-3424 was verified using a B-ALL PDX that had been lentivirally transduced to stably overexpress AKR1C3. OBI-3424 combined with nelarabine resulted in prolongation of mouse EFS compared with each single agent alone in two T-ALL PDXs. CONCLUSIONS: OBI-3424 exerted profound in vivo efficacy against T-ALL PDXs derived predominantly from aggressive and fatal disease, and therefore may represent a novel treatment for aggressive and chemoresistant T-ALL in an AKR1C3 biomarker-driven clinical trial.","['Evans, Kathryn', 'Duan, JianXin', 'Pritchard, Tara', 'Jones, Connor D', 'McDermott, Lisa', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'Toscan, Cara E', 'El-Zein, Narimanne', 'Mayoh, Chelsea', 'Erickson, Stephen W', 'Guo, Yuelong', 'Meng, Fanying', 'Jung, Donald', 'Rathi, Komal S', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Shia, Chi-Sheng', 'Pearce, Tillman', 'Teicher, Beverly A', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Evans K', 'Duan J', 'Pritchard T', 'Jones CD', 'McDermott L', 'Gu Z', 'Toscan CE', 'El-Zein N', 'Mayoh C', 'Erickson SW', 'Guo Y', 'Meng F', 'Jung D', 'Rathi KS', 'Roberts KG', 'Mullighan CG', 'Shia CS', 'Pearce T', 'Teicher BA', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'Ascentawits Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Nanshan Shenzhen, China.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Department of Pathology and the Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.', 'RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.', 'Ascentawits Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Nanshan Shenzhen, China.', 'Ascentawits Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Nanshan Shenzhen, China.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics and Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pathology and the Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology and the Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'OBI Pharma, Inc.

Genomic regions containing PRDM14 are often amplified leading to misexpression in human cancer. Prdm14 expression in mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) leads to progenitor cell expansion prior to the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), consistent with PRDM14's role in cancer initiation. Here, we demonstrate mechanistic insight into PRDM14-driven leukemias in vivo. Mass spectrometry revealed novel PRDM14-protein interactions including histone H1, RNA-binding proteins, and the master hematopoietic regulator CBFA2T3. In mouse leukemic cells, CBFA2T3 and PRDM14 associate independently of the related ETO family member CBFA2T2, PRDM14's primary protein partner in pluripotent cells. CBFA2T3 plays crucial roles in HSC self-renewal and lineage commitment, and participates in oncogenic translocations in acute myeloid leukemia. These results suggest a model whereby PRDM14 recruits CBFA2T3 to DNA, leading to gene misregulation causing progenitor cell expansion and lineage perturbations preceding T-ALL development. Strikingly, Prdm14-induced T-ALL does not occur in mice deficient for Cbfa2t3, demonstrating that Cbfa2t3 is required for leukemogenesis. Moreover, T-ALL develops in Cbfa2t3 heterozygotes with a significantly longer latency, suggesting that PRDM14-associated T-ALL is sensitive to Cbfa2t3 levels. Our study highlights how an oncogenic protein uses a native protein in progenitor cells to initiate leukemia, providing insight into PRDM14-driven oncogenesis in other cell types. IMPLICATIONS: The pluripotency regulator PRDM14 requires the master hematopoietic regulator CBFA2T3 to initiate leukemia in progenitor cells, demonstrating an oncogenic role for CBFA2T3 and providing an avenue for targeting cancer-initiating cells.","['Tracey, Lauren J', 'Brooke-Bisschop, Travis', 'Jansen, Pascal W T C', 'Campos, Eric I', 'Vermeulen, Michiel', 'Justice, Monica J']","['Tracey LJ', 'Brooke-Bisschop T', 'Jansen PWTC', 'Campos EI', 'Vermeulen M', 'Justice MJ']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Faculty of Science, Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Oncode Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Faculty of Science, Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Oncode Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. monica.justice@sickkids.ca.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190423,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Cbfa2t3 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Prdm14 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC6610658,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/05/02 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['1541-7786.MCR-18-1327 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-1327 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2019 Jul;17(7):1468-1479. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-1327.

Although recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations are important predictors of outcome, 50% to 70% of AMLs harbor normal or risk-indeterminate karyotypes. Therefore, identifying more effective biomarkers predictive of treatment success and failure is essential for informing tailored therapeutic decisions. We applied an artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning approach to a publicly available data set for a discovery cohort of 593 adults with nonpromyelocytic AML. ANN analysis identified a parsimonious 3-gene expression signature comprising CALCRL, CD109, and LSP1, which was predictive of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). We computed a prognostic index (PI) using normalized gene-expression levels and beta-values from subsequently created Cox proportional hazards models, coupled with clinically established prognosticators. Our 3-gene PI separated the adult patients in each European LeukemiaNet cytogenetic risk category into subgroups with different survival probabilities and identified patients with very high-risk features, such as those with a high PI and either FLT3 internal tandem duplication or nonmutated nucleophosmin 1. The PI remained significantly associated with poor EFS and OS after adjusting for established prognosticators, and its ability to stratify survival was validated in 3 independent adult cohorts (n = 905 subjects) and 1 cohort of childhood AML (n = 145 subjects). Further in silico analyses established that AML was the only tumor type among 39 distinct malignancies for which the concomitant upregulation of CALCRL, CD109, and LSP1 predicted survival. Therefore, our ANN-derived 3-gene signature refines the accuracy of patient stratification and the potential to significantly improve outcome prediction.","['Wagner, Sarah', 'Vadakekolathu, Jayakumar', 'Tasian, Sarah K', 'Altmann, Heidi', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Pockley, A Graham', 'Ball, Graham R', 'Rutella, Sergio']","['Wagner S', 'Vadakekolathu J', 'Tasian SK', 'Altmann H', 'Bornhauser M', 'Pockley AG', 'Ball GR', 'Rutella S']","['John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",PMC6482359,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018030726 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018030726 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 23;3(8):1330-1346. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018030726.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5221-9851', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1327-1662', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9593-6431', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1970-7375']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DISCUSSION: They can arise de novo or in association with hematological malignancies, most commonly acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M2). Clinically, it can masquerade as an abscess, cutaneous ulcer, or as a mass lesion. Morphologically, MS can mimic a variety of small round cell tumors including lymphomas, neuroblatoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. The occurrence of this tumor usually heralds AML or the onset of the blastic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. Early recognition of this rare entity is important, because early aggressive chemotherapy and focal irradiation can cause regression of the tumor and thus improve patient longevity. CONCLUSION: The possibility of MS should be considered when dealing with unusual lymphoma like neoplasms that cannot be categorized as any of the Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes and small blue round cell tumors.","['Marwah, Nisha', 'Bhutani, Namita', 'Budhwar, Archana', 'Sen, Rajeev']","['Marwah N', 'Bhutani N', 'Budhwar A', 'Sen R']","['Dept. of Pathology, PGIMS Rohtak, Haryana, India.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated survival outcomes and the efficacy of our fludarabine/melphalan/total body irradiation (TBI) (FMT) regimen. A total of 89 patients had received the FMT regimen from 2007 to 2017. RESULTS: The majority of patients (n = 81; 91%) belonged to the histologic subtype of aggressive NHL. The estimated 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival for the entire cohort during a median follow-up of 31 months were 47.1% (95% confidence interval, 36%-57%) and 45.4% (95% confidence interval, 35%-56%), respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of relapse and non-relapse mortality at 3 years were 33.1% and 13.8%, respectively. In analyses of risk factors affecting survival outcomes, chemosensitive disease status at transplant (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45; P = .010), delayed relapse after first-line chemotherapy (HR, 2.101; P = .009), no grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR, 11.212; P < .001), and mild chronic graft-versus-host disease (HR, 0.448; P = .016) were independent significant predictors of favorable overall survival. Also, similar parameters were related to favorable disease-free survival. All non-hematologic toxicities occurred within 50 days after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and most of the adverse events were tolerable and manageable with a < 30% incidence. CONCLUSION: Our FMT regimen shows favorable transplant outcomes with relatively low-risk toxicities, so it may be a promising strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL.","['Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Yoon, Seugyun', 'Min, Gi June', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Park, Silvia', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Cho, Seok-Goo']","['Jeon YW', 'Yoon S', 'Min GJ', 'Park SS', 'Park S', 'Yoon JH', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Lee JW', 'Cho SG']","[""Division of Lymphoma-Myeloma, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Institute for Translational Research and Molecular Imaging, Catholic Institutes of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Laboratory of Immune Regulation, Convergent Research Consortium for Immunologic Disease, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Division of Lymphoma-Myeloma, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Division of Lymphoma-Myeloma, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Division of Lymphoma-Myeloma, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Division of Lymphoma-Myeloma, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Division of Lymphoma-Myeloma, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Division of Lymphoma-Myeloma, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Institute for Translational Research and Molecular Imaging, Catholic Institutes of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Laboratory of Immune Regulation, Convergent Research Consortium for Immunologic Disease, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) is a key regulator of different types of DNA damage, which is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. The ATR-selective inhibitor VE-822 has proper solubility, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties. In this study, we investigated the anti-leukemic effects of VE-822 alone or combined with Wee1-selective inhibitor AZD1775 in AML cells. Our results showed that VE-822 inhibited AML cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. AZD1775 significantly promoted VE-822-induced inhibition of AML cell proliferation and led to a decreased number of cells in the G2/M phase. VE-822 and AZD1775 decreased the protein levels of ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and M2 (RRM2) subunits, key enzymes in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, which increased DNA replication stress. VE-822 combined with AZD1775 synergistically induced AML cell apoptosis and led to replication stress and DNA damage in AML cell lines. Our study demonstrated that AZD1775 synergistically promotes VE-822-induced anti-leukemic activity in AML cell lines and provides support for clinical research on VE-822 in combination with AZD1775 for the treatment of AML patients.","['Qi, Wenxiu', 'Xu, Xiaohao', 'Wang, Manying', 'Li, Xiangyan', 'Wang, Chaonan', 'Sun, Liping', 'Zhao, Daqing', 'Sun, Liwei']","['Qi W', 'Xu X', 'Wang M', 'Li X', 'Wang C', 'Sun L', 'Zhao D', 'Sun L']","['Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of BioMacromolecules of Chinese Medicine, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital to Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital to Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of BioMacromolecules of Chinese Medicine, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of BioMacromolecules of Chinese Medicine, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of BioMacromolecules of Chinese Medicine, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of BioMacromolecules of Chinese Medicine, Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, Jilin, China.

A total of 231 blood samples were collected from 201 owned cats and 30 stray cats. Serological investigations on T. gondii and N. caninum were performed using the indirect fluorescent antibody test with cutoff points of 1:64 and 1:50, respectively. To diagnose FIV and FeLV, a commercial immunochromatographic kit and a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used. Unconditional logistic regression was performed to assess the factors associated with infection by T. gondii among owned cats. The seropositivity for T. gondii among the owned cats and stray cats was 44.3% (89/201) and 53.3% (16/30), respectively. For N. caninum, the seropositivity among owned cats was 21.4% (43/201) and among stray cats, 23.3% (7/30). The copositivity between the two coccidia were 23.6% (21/201) and 37.5% (6/30), among owned and stray cats respectively. The periurban environment was a risk factor for infection by T. gondii, while infection by FIV was associated with infection by T. gondii (p<0.05) among owned cats. No association was found between T. gondii and FeLV, or between N. caninum and the retroviruses. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the cats of the present study were exposed to the agents T. gondii and N. caninum, which suggests that significant infection of intermediate hosts and or environmental contamination with oocysts was present, and that the cats coinfected with T. gondii and the retroviruses did not present any serological signs of reactivation of infection.","['Munhoz, Alexandre Dias', 'Hage, Samir Batista', 'Cruz, Rebeca Dalety Santos', 'Calazans, Ana Paula Fernandes', 'Silva, Fabiana Lessa', 'Albuquerque, George Rego', 'Lacerda, Luciana Carvalho']","['Munhoz AD', 'Hage SB', 'Cruz RDS', 'Calazans APF', 'Silva FL', 'Albuquerque GR', 'Lacerda LC']","['Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), Campus Soane Nazare de Andrade, Rodovia Jorge Amado, Km 16, Salobrinho, Ilheus, Bahia 45662-000, Brazil..

Methods The clinical data of 15 children who were diagnosed with JMML were collected. Next-generation sequencing was used to detect common gene mutations of JMML. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 6.5:1, and the age of onset was 19 months (range 2-67 months). Of the 15 children, 11 (73%) experienced disease onset before the age of 4 years, with abdominal distension and pyrexia as initial symptoms. All children had hepatosplenomegaly and superficial lymphadenectasis, with a number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of >1.0x109/L and a percentage of juvenile cells of 1%-7% in peripheral blood smear. The percentage of bone marrow blasts + juvenile cells was <20%, and the percentage of monoblasts + promonocytes was 1%-10%. Of the 15 children, 10 (67%) had a higher level of hemoglobin F than the normal level at the corresponding age, with the highest level of 62.5%. All 15 children had the absence of Philadelphia chromosome, and one child had chromosome 7 deletion. All 15 children had a negative result of BCR/ABL fusion gene detection. PTPN11 gene mutation was found in 5 children (33%), NF1 mutation in 4 children (27%), CBL mutation in 3 children (20%), and RAS mutation in 3 children (20%). No children received regular chemotherapy, and one child underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The median follow-up time of 15 children was 18 months (range 1-48 months). Among the 15 children, 8 died (among whom 4 had PTPN11 gene mutation, 3 had NF1 mutation, and 1 had RAS mutation) and 7 survived. The children with PTPN11 mutation had the worst prognosis and the highest mortality rate, and those with CBL or NRAS mutation had a relatively good prognosis. The level of hemoglobin F was negatively correlated with survival time (rs=-7.21, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In children with JMML, the type of gene mutation is associated with prognosis. The children with PTPN11 mutation often have a poor prognosis, and those with CBL or NRAS mutation have a relatively good prognosis.","['Zeng, Min-Hui', 'He, Xiang-Ling', 'Yang, Ming-Hua', 'Zheng, Min-Cui', 'Wan, Wu-Qing', 'Zou, Run-Ying', 'Chen, Ke-Ke']","['Zeng MH', 'He XL', 'Yang MH', 'Zheng MC', 'Wan WQ', 'Zou RY', 'Chen KK']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital/First Hospital of Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410005, China. hexiangl@163.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",PMC7389224,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/04/27 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2019.04.012 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;21(4):365-369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 377 children with ALL who were treated with the CCLG-2008-ALL regimen were retrospectively reviewed. ELISA and PCR were used to measure serum protein levels and mRNA expression of S100A8. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis and a Cox regression analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The children were followed up for 56 months, and the overall survival rate of the 377 children was 89.1%. The prednisone good response group had significantly lower S100A8 protein and mRNA levels than the prednisone poor response group (P<0.01). In the children with standard or median risk, both S100A8 protein and mRNA levels were associated with event-free survival rate (P<0.05). There were significant differences in S100A8 protein and mRNA levels between the children with different risk stratifications (P<0.01). The children who experienced events had significantly higher S100A8 protein and mRNA levels than those who did not (P<0.01). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox regression model suggested that S100A8 overexpression was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of children with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: High S100A8 expression may be associated with the poor prognosis of children with ALL and is promising as a new marker for individualized precise treatment of children with ALL.","['Ouyang, Mei-Fei', 'Wang, Dan', 'Liu, Ying-Ting', 'Xu, Lin-Yong', 'Zhao, Ming-Yi', 'Yin, Xiao-Cheng', 'Xie, Min', 'Yang, Liang-Chun', 'Yang, Ming-Hua']","['Ouyang MF', 'Wang D', 'Liu YT', 'Xu LY', 'Zhao MY', 'Yin XC', 'Xie M', 'Yang LC', 'Yang MH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China. yamahua123@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (S100A8 protein, human)']",IM,"['Calgranulin A/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7389220,,,,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/04/27 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2019.04.011 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;21(4):359-364.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the role of the B cell receptor (BCR) Ca(2+) pathway has been associated with disease progression, the importance of the newly described constitutive Ca(2+) entry (CE) pathway is less clear. In addition, we hypothesized that these differences reflect modifications of the CE pathway and Ca(2+) actors such as Orai1, transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 1, and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the latter being the focus of this study. METHODS: An extensive analysis of the Ca(2+) entry (CE) pathway in CLL B cells was performed including constitutive Ca(2+) entry, basal Ca(2+) levels, and store operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) activated following B cell receptor engagement or using Thapsigargin. The molecular characterization of the calcium channels Orai1 and TRPC1 and to their partner STIM1 was performed by flow cytometry and/or Western blotting. Specific siRNAs for Orai1, TRPC1 and STIM1 plus the Orai1 channel blocker Synta66 were used. CLL B cell viability was tested in the presence of an anti-STIM1 monoclonal antibody (mAb, clone GOK) coupled or not with an anti-CD20 mAb, rituximab. The Cox regression model was used to determine the optimal threshold and to stratify patients. RESULTS: Seeking to explore the CE pathway, we found in untreated CLL patients that an abnormal CE pathway was (i) highly associated with the disease outcome; (ii) positively correlated with basal Ca(2+) concentrations; (iii) independent from the BCR-PLCgamma2-InsP3R (SOCE) Ca(2+) signaling pathway; (iv) supported by Orai1 and TRPC1 channels; (v) regulated by the pool of STIM1 located in the plasma membrane (STIM1PM); and (vi) blocked when using a mAb targeting STIM1PM. Next, we further established an association between an elevated expression of STIM1PM and clinical outcome. In addition, combining an anti-STIM1 mAb with rituximab significantly reduced in vitro CLL B cell viability within the high STIM1PM CLL subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: These data establish the critical role of a newly discovered BCR independent Ca(2+) entry in CLL evolution, provide new insights into CLL pathophysiology, and support innovative therapeutic perspectives such as targeting STIM1 located at the plasma membrane.","['Debant, Marjolaine', 'Burgos, Miguel', 'Hemon, Patrice', 'Buscaglia, Paul', 'Fali, Tinhinane', 'Melayah, Sarra', 'Le Goux, Nelig', 'Vandier, Christophe', 'Potier-Cartereau, Marie', 'Pers, Jacques-Olivier', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Bagacean, Cristina', 'Mignen, Olivier', 'Renaudineau, Yves']","['Debant M', 'Burgos M', 'Hemon P', 'Buscaglia P', 'Fali T', 'Melayah S', 'Le Goux N', 'Vandier C', 'Potier-Cartereau M', 'Pers JO', 'Tempescul A', 'Berthou C', 'Bagacean C', 'Mignen O', 'Renaudineau Y']","['INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, CHRU Brest Morvan, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1069, N2C, 37032, University of Tours, Tours, France.', 'IC-CGO network from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1069, N2C, 37032, University of Tours, Tours, France.', 'IC-CGO network from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Haematology, CHRU Brest Morvan, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Haematology, CHRU Brest Morvan, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, CHRU Brest Morvan, Brest, France.', 'Department of Haematology, CHRU Brest Morvan, Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'IC-CGO network from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'INSERM U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, Brest, France. yves.renaudineau@univ-brest.fr.', 'IC-CGO network from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France. yves.renaudineau@univ-brest.fr.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, CHRU Brest Morvan, Brest, France. yves.renaudineau@univ-brest.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190423,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (ORAI1 Protein)', '0 (ORAI1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STIM1 protein, human)', '0 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1)', '0 (TRPC Cation Channels)', '0 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Calcium/immunology/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'ORAI1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Stromal Interaction Molecule 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'TRPC Cation Channels/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6480884,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*Constitutive Ca2+ entry', '*Disease outcome', '*STIM1']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-019-0591-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-019-0591-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2019 Apr 23;7(1):111. doi: 10.1186/s40425-019-0591-3.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5098-5002'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03294980'],,

The deregulated BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase encoded by the fusion gene resulting from the translocation is considered the pathogenetic driver and can be therapeutically targeted. In both CML and Ph-positive (Ph+) ALL, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved outcomes. In the TKI era, testing for BCR-ABL1 transcript levels by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) has become the gold standard to monitor patient response, anticipate relapse, and guide therapeutic decisions. In CML, key molecular response milestones have been defined that draw the ideal trajectory towards optimal long-term outcomes. Treatment discontinuation (treatment-free remission, TFR) has proven feasible in a proportion of patients, and clinical efforts are now focused on how to increase this proportion and how to best select TFR candidates. In Ph+ ALL, results of trials with second- and third-generation TKIs are challenging the role of intensive chemotherapy and even that of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Additional weapons are offered by the recently introduced monoclonal antibodies. In patients harboring mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain, prompt therapeutic reassessment and individualization based on mutation status are important to regain response and prevent disease progression. Next-generation sequencing is likely to become a precious tool for mutation testing because of the greater sensitivity and the possibility to discriminate between compound and polyclonal mutations. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in treatment and monitoring of CML and Ph+ ALL and the issues that still need to be addressed to make the best use of the therapeutic armamentarium and molecular testing technologies currently at our disposal.","['Soverini, Simona', 'Bassan, Renato', 'Lion, Thomas']","['Soverini S', 'Bassan R', 'Lion T']","[""Hematology/Oncology 'L. e A.

Inhibiting immune checkpoint to enhance anti-tumor response is an attractive strategy for effective leukemia therapeutics. CD73 is a recently recognized immune checkpoint mediator that is highly expressed on tumor cells and stromal cells in tumor microenvironment. The ectonucleotidase activity of CD73 catalyzes AMP to adenosine, which subsequently inhibits anti-tumor immune responses. In this study, we aim to explore the effect of CD73 in AML. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples collected from patients with newly diagnosed AML (n = 27) were used in this study. CD73 expression on each immune cell component was examined by flow cytometry. Phenotypic study of CD73-expressing T cells and analysis of the correlation between CD73 and other immune checkpoints were performed using flow cytometry-based assays. Functional status of CD73(+) vs. CD73(-) T cells was assessed in an in vitro cytokine release assay upon CD3/CD28 antibody stimulation. RESULTS: In contrast to the long recognized immune suppressive effect of CD73-adenosine signaling in tumor tissue, we made a striking observation that in AML, CD73 expression on CD8 T cells associates with an increased immune response. CD73(+) CD8 T cells are more functional, whereas CD73(-) CD8 T cells exhibit features of exhaustion manifested by high expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and TIGIT, increased intracellular expression of Eomes, reduced capacity of cytokine production, and high susceptibility to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the potential of CD73 as a double-edged sword in anti-leukemia immunity and argue strongly for the combinational treatment by adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to the CD73-targeting approaches.","['Kong, Yaxian', 'Jia, Bei', 'Zhao, Chenchen', 'Claxton, David F', 'Sharma, Arati', 'Annageldiyev, Charyguly', 'Fotos, Joseph S', 'Zeng, Hui', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Prabhu, K Sandeep', 'Zheng, Hong']","['Kong Y', 'Jia B', 'Zhao C', 'Claxton DF', 'Sharma A', 'Annageldiyev C', 'Fotos JS', 'Zeng H', 'Paulson RF', 'Prabhu KS', 'Zheng H']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100015, China.', 'Department of Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225000, Jiangsu, China.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100015, China.', 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Penn State University College of Agricultural Sciences, University Park, Harrisburg, PA, 16802, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Penn State University College of Agricultural Sciences, University Park, Harrisburg, PA, 16802, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. hzheng@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190424,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5E protein, human)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics/*immunology"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Transfection']",PMC6480867,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CD73', '*PD-1', '*T cell exhaustion', '*TIGIT']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-019-0728-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-019-0728-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Apr 24;12(1):40. doi: 10.1186/s13045-019-0728-3.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5024-5538'],,,['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, CLL-1 has attracted the researchers' attention due to its high expression in AML while being absent in normal hematopoietic stem cell. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated CLL-1 is an ideal target for AML. In this paper, we will review the expression of CLL-1 on normal cells and AML, the value of CLL-1 in diagnosis and follow-up, and targeting CLL-1 therapy-based antibody and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy as well as providing an overview of CLL-1 as a target for AML.","['Ma, Hongbing', 'Padmanabhan, Iyer Swaminathan', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Gong, Yuping']","['Ma H', 'Padmanabhan IS', 'Parmar S', 'Gong Y']","['Hematology Department, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas University, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas University, Houston, USA. sparmar@mdanderson.org.', 'Hematology Department, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. gongyuping2010@aliyun.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190424,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (CLEC12A protein, mouse)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*genetics']",PMC6480870,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CD371', '*CLEC12A', '*CLL-1', '*DCAL-2', '*hMICL']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-019-0726-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-019-0726-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Apr 24;12(1):41. doi: 10.1186/s13045-019-0726-5.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2437-9348'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise mechanism of its silencing in CML is poorly understood. In the current study, we aimed to query if the gene regulation of CCN3 is mediated by the promoter methylation in the patients with CML. In addition, to clarify whether the epigenetic silencing is affected by BCR-ABL1 inhibition, we assessed the methylation status in the patients at different time intervals following the tyrosine kinase inhibition using imatinib therapy, as the first-line treatment for this type of leukemia. METHODS: To address this issue, we applied bisulfite-sequencing technique as a high-resolution method to study the regulatory segment of the CCN3 gene. The results were analyzed in newly diagnosed CML patients as well as following imatinib therapy. We also evaluated the correlation of CCN3 promoter methylation with BCR-ABL1 levels. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the methylation occurs frequently in the promoter region of CML patients showing a significant increase of the methylated percentage at the CpG sites compared to normal individuals. Interestingly, this hypermethylation was indicated to be independent of BCR-ABL1 titers in both groups, which might suggest a mechanism beyond the BCR-ABL1 function. CONCLUSION: Despite suggesting that the CCN3 hypermethylation acts as a molecular mechanism independent of BCR-ABL1 function in CML patients, this scenario requires further validation by complementary experiments. In the case of acting upstream of BCR-ABL1 signaling, the methylation marker can provide early detection and a novel platform for targeted epigenetic modifiers for efficient treatment in imatinib resistant patients.","['Vatanmakanian, Mousa', 'Tavallaie, Mahmood', 'Ghadami, Shirin']","['Vatanmakanian M', 'Tavallaie M', 'Ghadami S']","['Human Genetics Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Mollasadra Ave., Vanak Square, Tehran, Iran.', 'Human Genetics Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Mollasadra Ave., Vanak Square, Tehran, Iran.', 'Human Genetics Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Mollasadra Ave., Vanak Square, Tehran, Iran.

Prior to the TKI era, we conducted two trials of alpha-interferon (IFN) for post-transplant hematologic and cytogenetic relapse. The complete cytogenetic response rate was 33% and 57% respectively. This report describes a third trial in which 40 patients with molecular relapse between 6 and 12 months post-transplant were treated with IFN. The projected cytogenetic relapse at 4.5 years was 12.6% compared with 42% in the historical control group. Although this data may not apply to most patients with CML today due to the availability of multiple TKIs, the effectiveness of short term IFN in post-transplant molecular relapse is supported by long-term treatment-free-survival in 75% of patients after a median follow-up of 15.6 years. This report suggests that alpha-interferon is potentially useful in the rare patient who has post-transplant molecular relapse who does not tolerate, or is resistant to TKIs.","['Bezerra, Evandro D', 'Flowers, Mary E', 'Onstad, Lynn E', 'Chielens, Deborah', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Higano, Celestia S']","['Bezerra ED', 'Flowers ME', 'Onstad LE', 'Chielens D', 'Radich J', 'Higano CS']","['Department of Medicine Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190424,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",PMC6813875,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*HCT', '*MRD', '*interferon', '*molecular relapse']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2020/08/29 06:00,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1605508 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Nov;60(11):2754-2761. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1605508.

The frequency of leukemic evolution varies according to myeloproliferative neoplasms subtype. It is highest in primary myelofibrosis, where it is estimated to be approximately 10-20% at 10 years, following by polycythemia vera, with a risk of 2.3% at 10 years and 7.9% at 20 years. In essential thrombocythemia, however, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia is considered relatively uncommon. Different factors are associated with leukemic evolution in myeloproliferative neoplasms, but generally include advanced age, leukocytosis, exposure to myelosuppressive therapy, cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as increased number of mutations in genes associated with myeloid neoplasms. The prognosis of these patients is dismal, with a medium overall survival ranging from 2.6-7.0 months. Currently, there is no standard of care for managing the blast phase of these diseases, and no treatment to date has consistently led to prolonged survival and/or hematological remission apart from an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Nevertheless, new targeted agents are currently under development.

Uterine fibroids (UF) are benign growths that are enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of RSV on UF using in vivo and in vitro approaches. In mouse xenograft models, tumors were implanted through the subcutaneous injection of Eker rat-derived uterine leiomyoma cells transfected with luciferase (ELT-3-LUC) in five-week-old female nude (Foxn1(nu)) mice. When the tumors reached a size of 50-100 mm(3), the mice were randomly assigned to intraperitoneal treatment with RSV (10 mg.kg(-1)) or vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide). Tumor tissues were assayed using an immunohistochemistry analysis. We also used primary human leiomyoma cells as in vitro models. Cell viability was determined using the sodium bicarbonate and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The protein expression was assayed using Western blot analysis. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was assayed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell apoptosis was assayed using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) and Hoechst 33342 staining. RSV significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo and decreased the proportion of cells showing expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). In addition, RSV decreased the protein expression of PCNA, fibronectin, and upregulated the ratio of Bax (Bcl-2-associated X) and Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2) in vivo. Furthermore, RSV reduced leiomyoma cell viability, and decreased the mRNA levels of fibronectin and the protein expression of collagen type 1 (COL1A1) and alpha-SMA (ECM protein marker), as well as reducing the levels of beta-catenin protein. RSV induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at sub-G1 phase. Our findings indicated the inhibitory effects of RSV on the ELT-3-LUC xenograft model and indicated that RSV reduced ECM-related protein expression in primary human leiomyoma cells, demonstrating its potential as an anti-fibrotic therapy for UF.","['Chen, Hsin-Yuan', 'Lin, Po-Han', 'Shih, Yin-Hwa', 'Wang, Kei-Lee', 'Hong, Yong-Han', 'Shieh, Tzong-Ming', 'Huang, Tsui-Chin', 'Hsia, Shih-Min']","['Chen HY', 'Lin PH', 'Shih YH', 'Wang KL', 'Hong YH', 'Shieh TM', 'Huang TC', 'Hsia SM']","['School of Nutrition and Health Sciences, College of Nutrition, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. hsin246@gmail.com.', 'School of Nutrition and Health Sciences, College of Nutrition, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. phlin@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan. evashih@asia.edu.tw.', 'Department of Nursing, Ching Kuo Institute of Managemnet and Health, Keelung 20301, Taiwan. kellywang@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Nutrition, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan. yonghan@isu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Dental Hygiene, College of Health Care, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan. tmshieh@mail.cmu.edu.tw.', 'PhD Program for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University and Academia Sinica, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. tsuichin@tmu.edu.tw.', 'School of Nutrition and Health Sciences, College of Nutrition, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. bryanhsia@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Metabolism and Obesity Sciences, College of Nutrition, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. bryanhsia@tmu.edu.tw.', 'School of Food and Safety, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. bryanhsia@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Nutrition Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. bryanhsia@tmu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190412,Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,,,PMC6523898,['NOTNLM'],"['ELT-3-LUC xenograft model', 'extracellular matrix', 'resveratrol', 'uterine fibroids']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2019/04/25 06:00,2019/04/25 06:01,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox8040099 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox8040099 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2019 Apr 12;8(4). pii: antiox8040099. doi: 10.3390/antiox8040099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal DNA methylation is associated with many human diseases. RESULTS: We propose two different approaches to test for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with complex traits, while accounting for correlations among CpG sites in the DMRs. The first approach is a nonparametric method using a kernel distance statistic and the second one is a likelihood-based method using a binomial spatial scan statistic. The kernel distance method uses the kernel function, while the binomial scan statistic approach uses a mixed-effects model to incorporate correlations among CpG sites. Extensive simulations show that both approaches have excellent control of type I error, and both have reasonable statistical power. The binomial scan statistic approach appears to have higher power, while the kernel distance method is computationally faster. The proposed methods are demonstrated using data from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) study.","['Dunbar, Faith', 'Xu, Hongyan', 'Ryu, Duchwan', 'Ghosh, Santu', 'Shi, Huidong', 'George, Varghese']","['Dunbar F', 'Xu H', 'Ryu D', 'Ghosh S', 'Shi H', 'George V']","['Genome Research Center, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA. fengjiao.dunbar@abbvie.com.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. hxu@augusta.edu.', 'Division of Statistics, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL 60115, USA. dryu@niu.edu.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. sghosh@augusta.edu.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. dryu@niu.edu.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. vgeorge@augusta.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190412,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,,IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Models, Statistical', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC6523914,['NOTNLM'],"['*CpG sites', '*DNA methylation', '*binomial scan statistic', '*kernel distance statistic', '*mixed-effects model']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2019/04/25 06:00,2019/04/25 06:01,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['genes10040298 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10040298 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2019 Apr 12;10(4). pii: genes10040298. doi: 10.3390/genes10040298.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the incidence and the prognostic significance of genetic characteristics according to treatment intensity in patients aged 60 years or older. On the 495 patients of our cohort, DNMT3A R882 (25.2%), NPM1 (23.7%) and FLT3-ITD (16.8%) were the most frequent molecular mutations found at diagnosis. In this elderly population, intensive chemotherapy seemed to be a suitable option in terms of early death and survival, except for normal karyotype (NK) NPM1-FLT3-ITD+ patients and those aged over 70 within the adverse cytogenetic/molecular risk group. The FLT3-ITD mutation was systematically associated with an unfavorable outcome, independently of the ratio. NK NPM1+/FLT3-TKD+ genotype tends to confer a good prognosis in patients treated intensively. Regarding minimal residual disease prognostic value, overall survival was significantly better for patients achieving a 4 log NPM1 reduction (median OS: 24.4 vs. 12.8 months, p = 0.013) but did not reach statistical significance for progression free survival. This retrospective study highlights that intensive chemotherapy may not be the most appropriate option for each elderly patient and that molecular markers may help treatment intensity decision-making.","['Heiblig, Mael', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Nicolini, Franck Emmanuel', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Sujobert, Pierre', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Balsat, Marie', 'Paubelle, Etienne', 'Barraco, Fiorenza', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Ducastelle, Sophie', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Heiblig M', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Nicolini FE', 'Michallet M', 'Hayette S', 'Sujobert P', 'Plesa A', 'Balsat M', 'Paubelle E', 'Barraco F', 'Tigaud I', 'Ducastelle S', 'Wattel E', 'Salles G', 'Thomas X']","['Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. mael.heiblig@live.fr.', 'University Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69100 Villeurbanne, France. mael.heiblig@live.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. helene.labussiere-wallet@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Leon Berard, 69008 Lyon, France. franck-emmanuel.nicolini@lyon.unicancer.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. mauricette.michallet@lyon.unicancer.fr.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. sandrine.hayette@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. pierre.sujobert@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Laboratory of Cytology and Immunology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. adriana.plesa@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. marie.balsat@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. etienne.paubelle@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. fiorenza.barraco@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. isabelle.tigaud@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. sophie.ducastelle-lepretre@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. eric.wattel@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. gilles.salles@chu-lyon.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69495 Pierre Benite, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190422,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6520979,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'minimal residual disease', 'molecular markers', 'prognosis']",,2019/04/25 06:00,2019/04/25 06:01,['2019/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11040570 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11040570 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Apr 22;11(4). pii: cancers11040570. doi: 10.3390/cancers11040570.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRAIL resistance may be overcome by agonistic antibodies to TRAIL receptors. In this study, we report the toxic effects of a novel recombinant agonistic human anti-TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4) monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, DR4-4, on various TRAIL-resistant and -sensitive cancer cell lines. The mechanisms of DR4-4 Fab-induced cell death in a human T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat) were investigated using cell viability testing, immunoblotting, immunoassays, flow cytometry, and morphological observation. DR4-4 Fab-induced caspase-independent necrosis was observed to occur in Jurkat cells in association with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein degradation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Increased cytotoxic effects of DR4-4 Fab were observed in combination with TRAIL or gamma-irradiation. Our results indicate that the novel DR4-4 Fab might overcome TRAIL-resistance and induce death in leukemia cells via cellular mechanisms different from those activated by TRAIL.

In the current study, the authors report the incidence, treatment, and outcome after first disease recurrence in young and older adults treated in the ALL Ph08 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01491763). METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 55 years with de novo Ph+ ALL were treated with imatinib concurrently with standard-dose induction and consolidation therapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) when possible. In patients with first disease recurrence, the authors analyzed the type of recurrence, timing, location, presence of kinase domain mutations, type of treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 125 patients, 28 patients (22%) developed disease recurrence before (4 patients) or after (24 patients) HSCT, with the recurrences being molecular in 11 patients (39%) and overt in 17 patients (61%). T315I was the most common mutation noted at the time of disease recurrence. Change in TKI was the most frequent treatment for patients with molecular disease recurrence whereas rescue chemotherapy and TKI change followed by second allo-HSCT when possible were performed for the most part in patients with overt disease recurrence. A total of 20 patients (71%) achieved response. The median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.5 months and 15.3 months, respectively. A trend for better DFS and OS was observed in patients with molecular recurrence compared with those with overt recurrence (median of 16.9 months vs 6.3 months [P = .05] and 28.7 months vs 11.5 months [P = .05] for DFS and OS, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Disease recurrence was frequent in young and older adults with Ph+ ALL who were treated with imatinib and chemotherapy with HSCT. Although the majority of patients responded to rescue therapy, their outcomes were poor, especially with regard to overt disease recurrence.","['Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'Barba, Pere', 'Garcia-Cadenas, Irene', 'Mercadal, Santiago', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Barrios, Manuel', 'Gonzalez-Campos, Jose', 'Martinez-Carballeira, Daniel', 'Gil, Cristina', 'Ribera, Jordi', 'Vives, Susana', 'Novo, Andres', 'Cervera, Marta', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Lavilla, Esperanza', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Amigo, Maria-Luz', 'Artola, Maria-Teresa', 'Genesca, Eulalia', 'Bravo, Pilar', 'Garcia-Belmonte, Daniel', 'Garcia-Guinon, Antoni', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria', 'Feliu, Evarist']","['Ribera JM', 'Garcia O', 'Moreno MJ', 'Barba P', 'Garcia-Cadenas I', 'Mercadal S', 'Montesinos P', 'Barrios M', 'Gonzalez-Campos J', 'Martinez-Carballeira D', 'Gil C', 'Ribera J', 'Vives S', 'Novo A', 'Cervera M', 'Serrano J', 'Lavilla E', 'Abella E', 'Tormo M', 'Amigo ML', 'Artola MT', 'Genesca E', 'Bravo P', 'Garcia-Belmonte D', 'Garcia-Guinon A', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Feliu E']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital of the Virgen de la Victoria, Malaga, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Hematology, Hospital of Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Catalonia, Spain."", 'Department of Hematology, Le Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Carlos Haya Hospital, Malaga, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Central Hospital of Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, General University Hospital of Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Son Espases Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, ICO-Hospital Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Lucus Augusti Hospital, Lugo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, del Mar Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinical Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Morales Meseguer University General Hospital, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Fuenlabrada University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, La Zarzuela Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Arnau de Vilanova Hospital, Lleida, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190423,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*clinical disease recurrence', '*molecular disease recurrence', '*outcome']",,2019/04/24 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/04/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32156 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Aug 15;125(16):2810-2817. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32156.

Since denintuzumab mafodotin has previously shown activity against B-cell malignancies in early-stage clinical trials, it was of interest to test it against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program preclinical models of CD19(+) pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURES: Denintuzumab mafodotin was evaluated against eight B-cell lineage ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), representing B-cell precursor ALL, Ph-like ALL, and mixed-lineage leukemia rearranged infant ALL. Denintuzumab mafodotin was administered weekly for 3 weeks at 3 mg/kg. It was also tested in combination with an induction-type chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, dexamethasone, and l-asparaginase (VXL) against three PDXs. The relationship between cell surface and gene expression of CD19 and drug activity was also assessed. RESULTS: Denintuzumab mafodotin significantly delayed the progression of seven of eight PDXs tested and achieved objective responses in five of eight. There was no apparent subtype specificity of denintuzumab mafodotin activity. No correlations were observed between CD19 mRNA or cell surface expression and denintuzumab mafodotin activity, perhaps due to small sample size, and denintuzumab mafodotin treatment did not select for reduced CD19 expression. Combining denintuzumab mafodotin with VXL achieved therapeutic enhancement compared to either treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: Denintuzumab mafodotin showed single-agent activity against selected B-lineage ALL PDXs, although leukemia growth was evident in most models at 28 days from treatment initiation. This level of activity for denintuzumab mafodotin is consistent with that observed in adults with ALL.","['Jones, Luke', 'McCalmont, Hannah', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'Mayoh, Chelsea', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Jones L', 'McCalmont H', 'Evans K', 'Mayoh C', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Billups CA', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190423,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (monomethylauristatin F)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligopeptides/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6588422,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD19', '*leukemia', '*patient-derived xenograft', '*pediatric oncology']",,2019/04/24 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2019/04/24 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27765 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Aug;66(8):e27765. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27765.

However, current biophysical phenotyping methods largely lack the throughput and specificity required in the majority of cell-based assays that involve large-scale single-cell characterization for inquiring the inherently complex heterogeneity in many biological systems. Further confounded by the lack of reported robust reproducibility and quality control, widespread adoption of single-cell biophysical phenotyping in mainstream cytometry remains elusive. To address this challenge, here we present a label-free imaging flow cytometer built upon a recently developed ultrafast quantitative phase imaging (QPI) technique, coined multi-ATOM, that enables label-free single-cell QPI, from which a multitude of subcellularly resolvable biophysical phenotypes can be parametrized, at an experimentally recorded throughput of >10,000 cells/s-a capability that is otherwise inaccessible in current QPI. With the aim to translate multi-ATOM into mainstream cytometry, we report robust system calibration and validation (from image acquisition to phenotyping reproducibility) and thus demonstrate its ability to establish high-dimensional single-cell biophysical phenotypic profiles at ultra-large-scale (>1,000,000 cells). Such a combination of throughput and content offers sufficiently high label-free statistical power to classify multiple human leukemic cell types at high accuracy (~92-97%). This system could substantiate the significance of high-throughput QPI flow cytometry in enabling next frontier in large-scale image-derived single-cell analysis applied in biological discovery and cost-effective clinical diagnostics.

PROCEDURE: To describe the safety and feasibility of post-transplant azacitidine for relapse prevention, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 18 children undergoing alloHCT for myeloid malignancies. RESULTS: There were 15 evaluable patients since three patients did not receive planned azacitidine due to early relapse or TRM. Azacitidine (32 mg/m(2) /dose for 5 days, in 28-day cycles as tolerated up to 1 year post-transplant) was started at a median of 66 days post-transplant (range 42-118). Two-thirds (10/15) of patients received eight or more cycles. Five patients stopped therapy early, only one attributable to toxicity. Mild myelosuppression was the most common reason for cycle delays. Dose modifications were made in three patients. There were three relapses, two of which occurred in patients in CR2 and one in CR1, with a median follow-up of 20 months (range 12.5-28), and no TRM in patients who received azacitidine. CONCLUSIONS: Post-transplant azacitidine in children is safe and feasible, with most patients successfully receiving all planned cycles. Despite the limitations of a small cohort, low relapse incidence suggests a potential benefit in disease control that warrants further investigation.","['Oshrine, Benjamin R', 'Shyr, David', 'Hale, Gregory', 'Petrovic, Aleksandra']","['Oshrine BR', 'Shyr D', 'Hale G', 'Petrovic A']","[""Cancer and Blood Disorders Institute, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, Florida."", ""Primary Children's Hospital, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."", ""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, Florida."", ""Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190423,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Tacrolimus', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*azacitidine', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*relapse']",,2019/04/24 06:00,2020/04/22 06:00,['2019/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13423 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2019 Jun;23(4):e13423. doi: 10.1111/petr.13423.

METHODS: Three phase 1 open-label studies were performed. Study 1: Japanese and Caucasian subjects received single doses of 250, 500, or 1000 mg ivosidenib (NCT03071770). Part 1 of study 2 (a two-period crossover study): subjects received 500 mg ivosidenib after either an overnight fast or a high-fat meal. Subjects received 1000 mg ivosidenib after an overnight fast in the single period of part 2 (NCT02579707). Study 3: in period 1, subjects received 250 mg ivosidenib; then, in period 2, subjects received oral itraconazole (200 mg once daily) on days 1-18, plus 250 mg ivosidenib on day 5 (NCT02831972). RESULTS: Ivosidenib was well tolerated in all three studies. Study 1: pharmacokinetic profiles were generally comparable, although AUC and Cmax were slightly lower in Japanese subjects than in Caucasian subjects, by ~ 30 and 17%, respectively. Study 2: AUC increased by ~ 25% and Cmax by ~ 98%, when ivosidenib was administered with a high-fat meal compared with a fasted state. Study 3: co-administration of itraconazole increased ivosidenib AUC by 169% (90% CI 145-195) but had no effect on ivosidenib Cmax. CONCLUSIONS: No ivosidenib dose adjustment is deemed necessary for Japanese subjects. High-fat meals should be avoided when ivosidenib is taken with food. When co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitoring for QT interval prolongation (a previously defined adverse event of interest) is recommended and an ivosidenib dose interruption or reduction may be considered.

Thrombotic risk factors in ALL are asparaginase and steroids. However, within the ALL populations treated on the same regimen, it is less clear which other risk factors play a role. Furthermore, few data are available on the effect of VTE on ALL outcomes. Methods: In 778 children (1-18 years) with newly diagnosed precursor-B-lineage or T-lineage ALL, treated in the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL-10 protocol in the Netherlands (October 2004 to April 2013), we conducted a nested case control study with 59 VTE cases and 118 controls to identify risk factors for VTE. Results: Fifty-nine of 778 ALL patients developed VTE (7.6%), with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in 26 of 59 patients (44.1%). VTE occurred during induction treatment in 59.3% (n = 35) and in 40.7% (n = 24) during medium risk intensification. Conditional multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age and ALL subtype were significantly associated with VTE (age >/=7 years: OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.33-5.57; ALL subtype T-ALL: OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.02-8.57). A multivariable Cox model showed no association between the occurrence of VTE and event free survival. In CVST patients, permanent disability was present in 34.6%. Conclusion: Within this large pediatric ALL cohort, we demonstrated a high morbidity in CVST patients. Age >/=7 years at diagnosis and T-ALL subtype were the main risk factors for VTE, and should be considered in preventive strategies.","['Klaassen, Irene L M', 'Lauw, Mandy N', 'Fiocco, Marta', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Middeldorp, Saskia', 'van de Wetering, Marianne D', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester A', 'van Ommen, C Heleen']","['Klaassen ILM', 'Lauw MN', 'Fiocco M', 'van der Sluis IM', 'Pieters R', 'Middeldorp S', 'van de Wetering MD', 'de Groot-Kruseman HA', 'van Ommen CH']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Academic Medical Center Amsterdam the Netherlands.', 'Department of Vascular Medicine Academic Medical Center Amsterdam the Netherlands.', 'Department of Vascular Medicine Academic Medical Center Amsterdam the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology Academic Medical Center Amsterdam the Netherlands.', 'Medical Statistics Department of Biomedical Data Sciences Leiden University Medical Center Leiden the Netherlands.', 'Mathematical Institute Leiden University Leiden the Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group The Hague the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology Utrecht the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology Utrecht the Netherlands.', 'Department of Vascular Medicine Academic Medical Center Amsterdam the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology Academic Medical Center Amsterdam the Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group The Hague the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190227,United States,Res Pract Thromb Haemost,Research and practice in thrombosis and haemostasis,101703775,,,,PMC6462738,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'incidence', 'pediatric', 'risk factors', 'venous thromboembolism']",,2019/04/24 06:00,2019/04/24 06:01,['2019/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/rth2.12182 [doi]', 'RTH212182 [pii]']",epublish,Res Pract Thromb Haemost. 2019 Feb 27;3(2):234-241. doi: 10.1002/rth2.12182. eCollection 2019 Apr.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0398-3164'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study provided evidence that BaP had anti-AML activity and improved haemopoiesis; absence of haematological toxicity allowed continuous daily administration. Similarly a previous trial in endemic Burkitt lymphoma demonstrated anti-B cell lymphoma activity of low and high dose BaP again in the absence of toxicity. We conducted a study to further evaluate the safety and activity of high dose BaP therapy in adults with AML (and high risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (BHNL). Eighteen patients were recruited to the study over 20 months, 16 AML/MDS, 1 CLL, and 1 BNHL. Although MPA was well tolerated throughout the study, only 2 patients were able to tolerate Bez treatment for their whole trial duration, indicating that Bez escalation is not feasible in the setting of adult AML/MDS. Thus there has been no obvious benefit in improved haemopoiesis or overt anti-leukaemia activity from the attempts to escalate BaP dose over previous published studies. Since current therapeutic options in MDS are restricted it may be now of value to continue to evaluate low dose BaP based approaches in low risk MDS rather than AML/high risk MDS. Furthermore, screening of low dose BaP against libraries of other already available dugs may identify an addition to BaP that augments the anti-neoplastic efficacy without significant toxicity.","['Murray, Jim', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Jacob, Abe', 'Clark, Fiona', 'Blundred, Rachel', 'Fox, Sonia', 'Bishop, Rebecca', 'Wheatley, Keith', 'Khanim, Farhat', 'Bunce, Chris', 'Drayson, Mark']","['Murray J', 'Pratt G', 'Jacob A', 'Clark F', 'Blundred R', 'Fox S', 'Bishop R', 'Wheatley K', 'Khanim F', 'Bunce C', 'Drayson M']","['Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK.', 'Heartlands Hospital, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK.', 'New Cross Hospital, The Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals Trust, UK.', 'Worcestershire Royal Hospital, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190410,Netherlands,Contemp Clin Trials Commun,Contemporary clinical trials communications,101671157,,,,PMC6463739,['NOTNLM'],"['Bezafibrate', 'Clinical trials', 'Lymphoid malignancies', 'Myeloid leukaemia', 'Progesterone', 'Therapy']",,2019/04/24 06:00,2019/04/24 06:01,['2019/04/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.conctc.2019.100361 [doi]', 'S2451-8654(18)30184-4 [pii]', '100361 [pii]']",epublish,Contemp Clin Trials Commun. 2019 Apr 10;14:100361. doi: 10.1016/j.conctc.2019.100361. eCollection 2019 Jun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), by concurrently recognizing two targets, can partly circumvent these problems. Serial killing of tumor cells by bsAb-redirected T cells, simultaneous blocking of two antigens involved in the HIV-1 infection, and concurrent targeting of the activating and inhibitory receptors on B cells to modulate autoimmunity are part of the capabilities of bsAbs. After designing and developing a large number of bsAbs for years, catumaxomab, a full-length bsAb targeting EpCAM and CD3, was approved in 2009 to treat EpCAM-positive carcinomas besides blinatumomab, a bispecific T cell engager antibody targeting CD19 and CD3, which was approved in 2014 to treat relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Limited viral replication and immune-negative feedback are the major hurdles to effective viro-immunotherapy. In this study, we found that use of an adjuvant of fludarabine, a chemotherapeutic drug for chronic myeloid leukemia, increased the replication of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which led to enhanced oncolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Moreover, fludarabine accelerated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation by enhancing ubiquitylation rather than proteasomal activity. This resulted in accelerated degradation of phosphorylated STAT3 and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), whose expression was induced by NDV infection. In addition, fludarabine significantly increased the NDV-induced infiltration of NK cells and decreased the number of NDV-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment.

Here a global analysis of exon usage in AML samples revealed distinct molecular subsets containing alternative spliced isoforms of inflammatory and immune genes. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) was the dominant alternatively spliced isoform in MDS and AML and is characterized by a longer isoform that retains exon 4, which encodes IRAK4-long (IRAK4-L), a protein that assembles with the myddosome, results in maximal activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of B cells (NF-kappaB) and is essential for leukaemic cell function. Expression of IRAK4-L is mediated by mutant U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) and is associated with oncogenic signalling in MDS and AML. Inhibition of IRAK4-L abrogates leukaemic growth, particularly in AML cells with higher expression of the IRAK4-L isoform.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3K-delta) inhibitor idelalisib has been approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but the mechanisms conferring resistance in a subset of patients are unknown. Here, we modeled resistance to PI3K-delta inhibitor in vivo using a serial tumor transfer and treatment scheme in mice. Whole-exome sequencing did not identify any recurrent mutation explaining resistance to PI3K-delta inhibitor. In the murine model, resistance to PI3K-delta inhibitor occurred as a result of a signaling switch mediated by consistent and functionally relevant activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), resulting in enhanced MAPK signaling in the resistant tumors. Overexpression of IGF1R in vitro demonstrated its prominent role in PI3K-delta inhibitor resistance. IGF1R upregulation in PI3K-delta inhibitor-resistant tumors was mediated by functional activation and enhanced nuclear localization of forkhead box protein O1 transcription factors and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. In human CLL, high IGF1R expression was associated with trisomy 12. CLL cells from an idelalisib-treated patient showed decreased sensitivity to idelalisib in vitro concomitant with enhanced MAPK signaling and strong upregulation of IGF1R upon idelalisib exposure. Thus, our results highlight that alternative signaling cascades play a predominant role in the resistance and survival of cancer cells under PI3K-delta inhibition. We also demonstrate that these pathway alterations can serve as therapeutic targets, because inhibition of IGF1R offered efficacious salvage treatment of PI3K-delta inhibitor-resistant tumors in vitro and in vivo.","['Scheffold, Annika', 'Jebaraj, Billy Michael Chelliah', 'Tausch, Eugen', 'Bloehdorn, Johannes', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Yahiaoui, Anella', 'Dolnik, Anna', 'Blatte, Tamara Jacqueline', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dheenadayalan, Rashmi Priyadharshini', 'Li, Li', 'Schneider, Christof', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Seiffert, Martina', 'Tannheimer, Stacey', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Scheffold A', 'Jebaraj BMC', 'Tausch E', 'Bloehdorn J', 'Ghia P', 'Yahiaoui A', 'Dolnik A', 'Blatte TJ', 'Bullinger L', 'Dheenadayalan RP', 'Li L', 'Schneider C', 'Chen SS', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Dietrich S', 'Seiffert M', 'Tannheimer S', 'Dohner H', 'Mertens D', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, Department of Onco-Hematology, Istituto Di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, CA.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, CA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY; and.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY; and.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, CA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190422,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IGF1R protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC8212352,,,,2019/04/24 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2019/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42361-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2018881029 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Aug 8;134(6):534-547. doi: 10.1182/blood.2018881029.

In the present study, we have developed a cytarabine (Ara-C)-resistant REH cell line (REH/Ara-C) as a chemoresistance model. REH/Ara-C 1) was not crossresistant to vincristine or methotrexate; 2) showed a similar proliferation rate and cell surface marker expression as parental REH; 3) demonstrated decreased chemotaxis toward bone marrow stromal cells; and 4) expressed higher transcript levels of cytidine deaminase (CDA) and mitoNEET (CISD1) than the parental REH cell line. Based on these findings, we tested NL-1, a mitoNEET inhibitor, which induced a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability with a comparable IC50 value in REH and REH/Ara-C. Furthermore, NL-1 decreased cell viability in six different ALL cell lines and showed inhibitory activity in a hemosphere assay. NL-1 also impaired the migratory ability of leukemic cells, irrespective of the chemoattractant used, in a chemotaxis assay. More importantly, NL-1 showed specific activity in inducing death in a drug-resistant population of leukemic cells within a coculture model that mimicked the acquired resistance and de novo resistance observed in the bone marrow of relapsed patients. Subsequent studies indicated that NL-1 mediates autophagy, and inhibition of autophagy partially decreased NL-1-induced tumor cell death. Finally, NL-1 showed antileukemic activity in an in vivo mouse ALL model. Taken together, our study demonstrates that mitoNEET has potential as a novel antileukemic drug target in treatment refractory or relapsed ALL.","['Geldenhuys, Werner J', 'Nair, Rajesh R', 'Piktel, Debbie', 'Martin, Karen H', 'Gibson, Laura F']","['Geldenhuys WJ', 'Nair RR', 'Piktel D', 'Martin KH', 'Gibson LF']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy (W.J.G.), Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, School of Medicine (R.R.N., K.H.M., L.F.G.), Robert C.

Recently, a posttranslational modification of proteins with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) has been notably implicated in a wide spectrum of diseases, especially cancers. Ubc9, as the sole E2-conjugating enzyme in SUMOylation cascade, particularly has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. 2-D08, a small molecular agent, functions by blocking the transfer of SUMO from the Ubc9 thioester to SUMO substrates without any effects on other individual steps in this process. However, both the effects and mechanisms of 2-D08 on AML cells are still unknown. In this study, we found that 2-D08 significantly suppressed cell viability and colony formation ability. Additionally, it induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis with dramatic accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could be almost completely rescued by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Furthermore, we confirmed that the fatal accumulation of ROS was due to its aberrant generation instead of defective scavenging. In summary, our results suggest that 2-D08, as a specific SUMOylation inhibitor, induces ROS accumulation-mediated intrinsic apoptosis of AML cells possibly through deSUMOylation of NOX2. Therefore, 2-D08 might be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of AML in the future.","['Zhou, Pan', 'Chen, Xing', 'Li, Mengke', 'Tan, Jiaqi', 'Zhang, Yicheng', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Wang, Gaoxiang']","['Zhou P', 'Chen X', 'Li M', 'Tan J', 'Zhang Y', 'Yuan W', 'Zhou J', 'Wang G']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.

However, 15-20% of children still experience relapses. Relapses can either occur in the bone marrow or at extramedullary sites, such as gonads or the central nervous system (CNS), formerly referred to as ALL-blast sanctuaries. The reason why ALL cells migrate to and stay in these sites is still unclear. In this review, we have attempted to assemble the evidence concerning the microenvironmental factors that could explain why ALL cells reside in such sites. We present criteria that make extramedullary leukemia niches and solid tumor metastatic niches comparable. Indeed, considering extramedullary leukemias as metastases could be a useful approach for proposing more effective treatments. In this context, we conclude with several examples of potential niche-based therapies which could be successfully added to current treatments of ALL.","['Gaudichon, Jeremie', 'Jakobczyk, Helene', 'Debaize, Lydie', 'Cousin, Elie', 'Galibert, Marie-Dominique', 'Troadec, Marie-Berengere', 'Gandemer, Virginie']","['Gaudichon J', 'Jakobczyk H', 'Debaize L', 'Cousin E', 'Galibert MD', 'Troadec MB', 'Gandemer V']","['CNRS, IGDR (Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes), Univ Rennes, UMR 6290, Rennes F-35000, France; Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, University Hospital, Caen, France.

However, inhibitory antibodies to alphaIIbbeta3 are widely associated with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), occur in secondary ITP associated with leukemia and related disorders, solid cancers and myeloma, other autoimmune diseases, following organ transplantation while cytoplasmic dysregulation of alphaIIbbeta3 function features in myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes. Antibodies to alphaIIbbeta3 occur during viral and bacterial infections, while drug-dependent antibodies reacting with alphaIIbbeta3 are a special case.

This study focused on the investigation of the antitumor effect of the antioxidative ethanolic extract of R. cymosa fruits (RCE) along with its underlying mechanism of action. RCE showed a potent cytotoxic effect against Sup-T1 and Molt-4 lymphoblastic leukemia cells. In the xenograft animal model, the tumor size was significantly reduced to about 59.42% in the RCE-treated group in comparison with the control group. The use of RCE (37.5, 75, or 150 mug/mL) triggered apoptosis by 26.52-83.49%, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 10.44-58.60%, and promoted calcium release by 1.29-, 1.44-, and 1.71-fold compared with the control group. The extract induced redox oxygen species (ROS) generation through the elimination of Nrf2/Keap1/P62-mediated oxidative stress response. The loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) activation by RCE impaired PI3K/Akt/Foxo and Jak/Stat activation pathways, which contributed to tumorigenesis.

The arsenic speciation analysis of urine is critical to reveal the metabolic mechanism and the relationship between arsenic species and the clinical response. To characterize the arsenic species in urine, a simple and robust HPLC-HG-AFS method was developed and validated to quantify the levels of arsenic species [As(III) and its metabolites, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)), and arsenate (As(V))] in urine samples from 66 patients with APL. Patients received As2O3 (0.16 mg/kg/day) via continuous slow-rate infusion or conventional infusion. Urine samples were collected at steady state before the start of the next daily administration. The relative proportions (median) of arsenic species in urine were: As(III), 33.00% (IQR: 24.34%-46.82%); DMA(V), 36.42% (IQR: 25.82%-51.98%); MMA(V), 23.89% (IQR: 19.52%-27.19%); and As(V), 2.22% (IQR: 1.293%-3.665%). The levels and proportions of arsenic species vary widely among individual patients. DMA(V) and un-metabolized As(III) were the dominant arsenic compounds excreted from the urine of patients with APL treated with As2O3. As(V) was the least abundant arsenic species in all urine samples. Good positive correlations were found between the levels and proportions of arsenic species in urine and those in plasma; thus, urinary arsenic can reflect the levels of arsenic in plasma. Urinary arsenic is a critical biomarker to evaluate the metabolism and toxicity of arsenic in the clinical application of As2O3.","['Guo, Meihua', 'Li, Jing', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Liu, Wensheng', 'Wang, Bin', 'Gao, Chunlu', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Hai, Xin']","['Guo M', 'Li J', 'Fan S', 'Liu W', 'Wang B', 'Gao C', 'Zhou J', 'Hai X']","['Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China; Heilongjiang Institute of Hematology & Oncology, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China; Heilongjiang Institute of Hematology & Oncology, Harbin, China.

Genomically-defined personalized therapies are only applicable for a minority of patients. Therapies without identifiable targets can be effective but patient selection is challenging. The sequential combination of azacitidine with high-dose lenalidomide has shown activity; we aimed to determine the efficacy of this genomically-agnostic regimen in patients with R/R AML, with the intention of applying sophisticated methods to predict responders. METHODS: Thirty-seven R/R AML/myelodysplastic syndrome patients were enrolled in a phase 2 study of azacitidine with lenalidomide. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) rate. A computational biological modeling (CBM) approach was applied retrospectively to predict outcomes based on the understood mechanisms of azacitidine and lenalidomide in the setting of each patients' disease. FINDINGS: Four of 37 patients (11%) had a CR/CRi; the study failed to meet the alternative hypothesis. Significant toxicity was observed in some cases, with three treatment-related deaths and a 30-day mortality rate of 14%. However, the CBM method predicted responses in 83% of evaluable patients, with a positive and negative predictive value of 80% and 89%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Sequential azacitidine and high-dose lenalidomide is effective in a minority of R/R AML patients; it may be possible to predict responders at the time of diagnosis using a CBM approach. More efforts to predict responses in non-targeted therapies should be made, to spare toxicity in patients unlikely to respond and maximize treatments for those with limited options.","['Stevens, Brett', 'Winters, Amanda', 'Gutman, Jonathan A', 'Fullerton, Aaron', 'Hemenway, Gregory', 'Schatz, Derek', 'Miltgen, Nicholas', 'Wei, Qi', 'Abbasi, Taher', 'Vali, Shireen', 'Singh, Neeraj K', 'Drusbosky, Leylah', 'Cogle, Christopher R', 'Hammes, Andrew', 'Abbott, Diana', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Smith, Clayton', 'Pollyea, Daniel A']","['Stevens B', 'Winters A', 'Gutman JA', 'Fullerton A', 'Hemenway G', 'Schatz D', 'Miltgen N', 'Wei Q', 'Abbasi T', 'Vali S', 'Singh NK', 'Drusbosky L', 'Cogle CR', 'Hammes A', 'Abbott D', 'Jordan CT', 'Smith C', 'Pollyea DA']","['University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.', ""University of Colorado Children's Hospital, Aurora CO, United States."", 'University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.', ""University of Colorado Children's Hospital, Aurora CO, United States."", ""University of Colorado Children's Hospital, Aurora CO, United States."", 'Cellworks Group Inc, CA, United States.', 'Cellworks Group Inc, CA, United States.', 'Cellworks Group Inc, CA, United States.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville FL, United States.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville FL, United States.', 'Center for Innovative Design and Analysis, Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Center for Innovative Design and Analysis, Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'University of Colorado Division of Hematology, Aurora, CO, United States.

Such persisting IR-induced foci (pIRIF) co-associate with PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and are among the characteristics of cellular senescence. Here we addressed some fundamental questions concerning the nature and determinants of this co-association, the role of PML-NBs at such sites, and the reason for the persistence of DNA damage in human primary cells. We show that the persistent DNA lesions are devoid of homologous recombination (HR) proteins BRCA1 and Rad51. Our super-resolution microscopy-based analysis showed that PML-NBs are juxtaposed to and partially overlap with the pIRIFs. Notably, depletion of 53BP1 resulted in decreased intersection between PML-NBs and pIRIFs implicating the RNF168-53BP1 pathway in their interaction. To test whether the formation and persistence of IRIFs is PML-dependent and to investigate the role of PML in the context of DNA repair and senescence, we genetically deleted PML in human hTERT-RPE-1 cells. Unexpectedly, upon high-dose IR treatment, cells displayed similar DNA damage signalling, repair dynamics and kinetics of cellular senescence regardless of the presence or absence of PML. In contrast, the PML knock-out cells showed increased sensitivity to low doses of IR and DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C, cisplatin and camptothecin that all cause DNA lesions requiring repair by HR. These results, along with enhanced sensitivity of the PML knock-out cells to DNA-PK and PARP inhibitors implicate PML as a factor contributing to HR-mediated DNA repair.","['Vancurova, Marketa', 'Hanzlikova, Hana', 'Knoblochova, Lucie', 'Kosla, Jan', 'Majera, Dusana', 'Mistrik, Martin', 'Burdova, Kamila', 'Hodny, Zdenek', 'Bartek, Jiri']","['Vancurova M', 'Hanzlikova H', 'Knoblochova L', 'Kosla J', 'Majera D', 'Mistrik M', 'Burdova K', 'Hodny Z', 'Bartek J']","['Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.

In human cells, NPM occurs mainly in oligomers. It functions as a chaperone, undergoes numerous interactions and forms part of many protein complexes. Although NPM role in carcinogenesis is not fully elucidated, a variety of tumor suppressor as well as oncogenic activities were described. NPM is overexpressed, fused with other proteins, or mutated in various tumor types. In the acute myeloid leukemia (AML), characteristic mutations in NPM1 gene, leading to modification of NPM C-terminus, are the most frequent genetic aberration. Although multiple mutation types of NPM are found in AML, they are all characterized by aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the mutated protein. In this review, current knowledge of the structure and function of NPM is presented in relation to its interaction network, in particular to the interaction with other nucleolar proteins and with proteins active in apoptosis. Possible molecular mechanisms of NPM mutation-driven leukemogenesis and NPM therapeutic targeting are discussed. Finally, recent findings concerning the immunogenicity of the mutated NPM and specific immunological features of AML patients with NPM mutation are summarized.","['Brodska, Barbora', 'Sasinkova, Marketa', 'Kuzelova, Katerina']","['Brodska B', 'Sasinkova M', 'Kuzelova K']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.

In this study we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib combined with other therapeutic strategies as salvage therapy for these patients. Eighty-three AML patients with FLT3-ITD relapsing after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. Fifty-three patients received salvage therapy containing sorafenib and 30 patients did not. Salvage therapy containing sorafenib was superior to that without sorafenib with respect to complete remission rates, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) (66.0% versus 30.0%, 46.8% versus 20.0%, and 44.9% versus 16.7%, respectively; P=.002, P=.003, and P=.001). Further subgroup analysis revealed that the OS and PFS of patients who received sorafenib combined with chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) were superior to those receiving other therapeutic regimens, including sorafenib combined with chemotherapy, chemotherapy followed by DLI, and monochemotherapy (P=.003, P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that salvage therapy including sorafenib was the only protective factor for longer OS (P=.035; hazard ratio [HR], .526); salvage therapy including sorafenib and DLI were the protective factors for longer PFS (P=.011, HR, .423; P=.019, HR, .508). Our data suggest that sorafenib therapy is associated with improved outcomes for FLT3-ITD AML relapsing after allo-HSCT, and whether sorafenib combined with chemotherapy followed by DLI reveals an optimal efficacy merits further study.","['Xuan, Li', 'Wang, Yu', 'Chen, Jia', 'Jiang, Erlie', 'Gao, Li', 'Wu, Bingyi', 'Deng, Lan', 'Liang, Xinquan', 'Huang, Fen', 'Fan, Zhiping', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Sun, Jing', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Han, Mingzhe', 'Wu, Depei', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Liu, Qifa']","['Xuan L', 'Wang Y', 'Chen J', 'Jiang E', 'Gao L', 'Wu B', 'Deng L', 'Liang X', 'Huang F', 'Fan Z', 'Tang X', 'Sun J', 'Zhang X', 'Han M', 'Wu D', 'Huang X', 'Liu Q']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'The first affiliated hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, First People's Hospital of Chenzhou, Southern Medical University, Chenzhou, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The first affiliated hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'The first affiliated hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Construction and Detection in Tissue Engineering, Guangzhou, China.

Therapies engaging MSCs are showing increasing promise in the cancer treatment and anticancer drug screening applications. A multitude of growth factors and cytokines secreted from these cells are known to give such multifunctional properties, but details of their role are yet to be absolutely demonstrated. In this study, we have evaluated the influence of BMSCs on K562 cell line as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, with the use of a cytokine antibody array recognizing 34 cytokines. For this purpose, BMSCs were isolated and co-cultured with K562 cells; thereafter, cultured K562 alone and co-cultured K562 with BMSCs (10:1) were collected at day 7 and subjected to cell cycle distribution assay as well as annexin/PI analysis and Ki/caspase-3 assay for apoptosis assessment. In the following, the gene and protein expression levels of BAX and BCL-2 as pro- and anti-apoptotic agents were investigated. Furthermore, after 7 days' treatment, culture medium was collected from both control and experimental groups for cytokine antibody array. It was found that BMSCs resulted in a robust increase in the number of cells at G0/G1 phase and arrest the G0/G1 phase as well as significantly inducing late apoptosis in K562 cells. The significant presence of TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1), and moderate elevated signals for CINC-1 (cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1) were obvious in the co-cultured conditioned media, but no significant increase was found in 32 other cytokines. It is concluded that co-culture of BMSCs with K562 cells could secrete a substantial amount of TIMP-1 and CINC-1. These cytokines could be involved in the inhibition of the K562 cell proliferation via BAX and caspase-3 cascade pathways.","['Fathi, Ezzatollah', 'Farahzadi, Raheleh', 'Valipour, Behnaz', 'Sanaat, Zohreh']","['Fathi E', 'Farahzadi R', 'Valipour B', 'Sanaat Z']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190422,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL1)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL1/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6476492,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/04/23 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/04/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0215678 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-36506 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Apr 22;14(4):e0215678. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0215678. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3159-9522'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a decrease in adherence leads to undesired therapeutic outcomes. In this study, the relationships among adherence, pharmacokinetics, response, and adverse effects for dasatinib treatment were prospectively investigated. METHODS: This study was a prospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed CML at 4 general hospitals and 1 university hospital. Patients started to receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily. A Medication Event Monitoring System was used to assess medication adherence and the medication possession ratio during the 12 months. Plasma concentrations of dasatinib were measured using liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and therapy responses were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: Ten patients were included. An extremely high medication adherence for dasatinib was observed; the median medication possession ratio was 99.4%. All 9 CML patients with breakpoints in the major BCR-ABL achieved major molecular response (MMR; major BCR-ABL transcript level below 0.1% on the International Scale) within 12 months, and 5 achieved MMR within 6 months. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the cutoff value for the dasatinib area under the concentration-time curve was 336.1 ng x h/mL (accuracy 88.9%, sensitivity 80.0%, specificity 100%, and receiver operating characteristic curve-area under the concentration-time curve 0.800) for achieving MMR within 6 months. Two patients had interrupted dasatinib treatment because of pleural effusion and diarrhea with intestinal edema, respectively. These edematous adverse events developed after plasma dasatinib Cmin surpassed 3.0 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: A Medication Event Monitoring System was applied for the direct evaluation of oral dasatinib adherence for the first time, and the clinical effect of dasatinib was investigated under the strict monitoring of patient adherence. Although this study had a small sample size, the plasma concentration monitoring of dasatinib is considered to be useful to predict an earlier molecular response with fewer edematous adverse events.","['Iwamoto, Takuya', 'Monma, Fumihiko', 'Ohishi, Kohshi', 'Umino, Akira', 'Suzuki, Kei', 'Oka, Koji', 'Kawakami, Keiki', 'Sekine, Takao', 'Okuda, Masahiro', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Iwamoto T', 'Monma F', 'Ohishi K', 'Umino A', 'Suzuki K', 'Oka K', 'Kawakami K', 'Sekine T', 'Okuda M', 'Katayama N']","['Department of Pharmacy, Mie University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Mie University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokkaichi Municipal Hospital.', 'Department of Emergency and Critical Care Center, Mie University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Suzuka Kaisei Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, JA Mie Suzuka General Hospital.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Matsusaka Chuo General Hospital, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Mie University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Dasatinib/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods']",,,,,2019/04/23 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/04/23 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FTD.0000000000000639 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2019 Oct;41(5):575-581. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000639.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, assessment of FPGS catalytic activity relies on assays using radioactive substrates that are labor-intensive and require relatively large numbers of cells. Here, we describe a nonradioactive, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS)-based method allowing for sensitive and accurate measurements of FPGS activity in low cell numbers (ie, 1-2 x 10) of biological specimens, including leukemic blast cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with RA. METHODS: The UHPLC-MS/MS assay was validated with 2 CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells, one proficient and one deficient in FPGS activity. Linearity of time and protein input were tested by measuring FPGS activity at 30-180 minutes of incubation time and 10-300 mcg protein extract. In addition, FPGS enzyme kinetic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: The FPGS enzymatic assay showed a linear relation between FPGS activity and protein input (R >/= 0.989) as well as incubation time (R >/= 0.996). Moreover, the UHPLC-MS/MS method also allowed for evaluation of FPGS enzyme kinetic parameters revealing Km values for the substrates MTX and L-glutamic acid of 64 micromol/L and 2.2 mmol/L, respectively. The mean FPGS activity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia blast cells (n = 4) was 3-fold higher than that of CCRF-CEM cells and 44-fold and 88-fold higher than that of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MTX-naive (n = 9) and MTX-treated RA patients (n = 6), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, given its sensitivity with low cell numbers and avoidance of radioactive substrates, UHPLC-MS/MS-based analysis of FPGS activity may be eligible for routine therapeutic drug monitoring of MTX in RA and leukemia for therapy (non)response evaluations.","['Muller, Ittai B', 'Lin, Marry', 'Struys, Eduard A', 'Heydari, Paniz', 'Hebing, Renske C F', 'Nurmohamed, Mike T', 'van der Laken, Conny', 'Lems, Willem F', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'de Jonge, Robert']","['Muller IB', 'Lin M', 'Struys EA', 'Heydari P', 'Hebing RCF', 'Nurmohamed MT', 'van der Laken C', 'Lems WF', 'Cloos J', 'Jansen G', 'de Jonge R']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Location Reade.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Location Reade.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Location Reade.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location VUmc.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods']",,,,,2019/04/23 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/04/23 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FTD.0000000000000638 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2019 Oct;41(5):598-606. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000638.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These wounds may reflect an underlying systemic or malignant disease; therefore, an accurate diagnosis and initiation of the appropriate treatment are necessary. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old man presented with an atypical chronic ulcer on his left shin of 2 years' duration. The ulcer was associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Initially, the surgeon treated the chronic wound with wide debridement and biopsy for pathohistological investigation. Leukemia cutis with accumulation of blast cells in the area of the ulcer was recognized by histological examination. Further, an absorbent cellulose-based core dressing with activated carbon was used, which appeared to be useful in reducing wound pain, odor, and exudate. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemia cutis is a specific sign of systemic leukemia and the result of dissemination of leukemic cells to the skin. Treatment should be directed towards eradication of the systemic disease, which also improves local manifestation of the disease.","['Semenic, Danijela', 'Aleksovska, Natasa']","['Semenic D', 'Aleksovska N']","['Department of Surgical Infections, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia and Medical Faculty, University in Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Surgical Infections, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia and Medical Faculty, University in Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Wounds,Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,9010276,['16291-96-6 (Charcoal)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Bandages', 'Charcoal', 'Debridement', 'Exudates and Transudates', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ulcer/*pathology/therapy', 'Wound Healing/*physiology']",,,,,2019/04/23 06:00,2019/11/22 06:00,['2019/04/23 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Wounds. 2019 Apr;31(4):E25-E28.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to perform an informed consent is considered one of the Association of American Medical College's Core Entrustable Professional Activities for entering residency. This case provides learners with the opportunity to obtain informed consent for a lumbar puncture procedure and to receive immediate structured feedback on their performance. This is a formative assessment, which has been used with both senior medical students and first-year residents at our institution. Methods: The case involves a standardized patient with a history of leukemia who presents to the emergency department with a headache, fever, and lethargy. The learner is charged with the task of compassionately, honestly, and confidently explaining the process of a lumbar puncture in order to appropriately obtain informed consent. Results: This case was well received, with the vast majority of learners rating the instructions as clear and the tasks of the station as appropriate for the level of learner. Comments provided by the learners regarding the standardized patients' feedback indicate that this is a useful exercise to assist with the development of the crucial skill of obtaining informed consent. Discussion: Overall, learners are able to perform this task and find it a meaningful exercise. We are able to measure both content and communication skills. In our cohort, learners are able to perform above the targeted passing score. This provides some evidence of competency in terms of both content and communication skills.","['Kempner, Samantha', 'Morgan, Helen', 'Stern, David', 'Colletti, Lisa', 'Goold, Susan', 'Lypson, Monica L', 'Hopson, Laura', 'Ross, Paula']","['Kempner S', 'Morgan H', 'Stern D', 'Colletti L', 'Goold S', 'Lypson ML', 'Hopson L', 'Ross P']","['Clinical Instructor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Clinical Assistant Professor, Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, New York University School of Medicine.', 'Professor, Department of General Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Professor of Internal Medicine and Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Assistant Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School.', 'Director of Advancing Scholarship, University of Michigan Medical School.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160721,United States,MedEdPORTAL,MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,101714390,,,,PMC6464558,['NOTNLM'],"['Counseling', 'Decision Making', 'Informed Consent', 'Lumbar Puncture', 'Shared Decision Making', 'Standardized Patient']",['None to report.'],2016/07/21 00:00,2016/07/21 00:01,['2019/04/23 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/21 00:01 [medline]']",['10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10427 [doi]'],epublish,MedEdPORTAL. 2016 Jul 21;12:10427. doi: 10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10427.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In summary, many independent single- and multicenter studies showed a significant benefit of MP-guided treatment regarding response rates and survival. However, in the only randomized trial conducted so far, no benefit of MP-guided targeted therapy was observed. Notably, various profiling approaches were conducted in the respective studies: some studies used a single analytic approach (i.e. next-generation sequencing), others applied multiple analytic methods to perform comprehensive molecular profiling. It seems that multiplatform profiling analyses, detected an increased number of druggable molecular targets or signaling pathway alterations and that a higher proportion of patients was treated according to the molecular cancer profile. Even though no randomized study has shown a benefit of molecular profiling so far, many studies indicate that MP-guided treatment can be beneficial in patients with relapsed and/or refractory cancer. Currently ongoing large randomized trials (i.e. NCI-MATCH, TAPUR) will add evidence to the role of profiling-guided cancer treatment.","['Zimmer, Kai', 'Kocher, Florian', 'Spizzo, Gilbert', 'Salem, Mohamed', 'Gastl, Guenther', 'Seeber, Andreas']","['Zimmer K', 'Kocher F', 'Spizzo G', 'Salem M', 'Gastl G', 'Seeber A']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Levine Cancer Institute, Carolinas HealthCare System, Charlotte, USA.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190326,Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,,,PMC6453774,['NOTNLM'],"['ASCO, American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Abl, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1', 'Bcr, Breakpoint cluster region', 'CGH, Comparative genomic hybridization', 'CISH, Chromogenic in-situ hybridization', 'CR, Complete response', 'DNA, Deoxyribonucleic acid', 'FDA, Food and Drug Administration', 'FGFR, Fibroblast growth factor receptor', 'FISH, Fluorescence in-situ hybridization', 'HER2, Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2', 'HR, Hazard Ratio', 'IHC, Immunohistochemistry', 'MEK, Mitogen-activated protein kinase', 'MP, Molecular profile', 'MSI, Microsatellite Instability', 'Metastatic cancer', 'Molecular profiling', 'NCI, National Cancer Institute', 'NGS, Next generation sequencing', 'ORR, Overall response rate', 'OS, Overall Survival', 'PCR, Polymerase chain reaction', 'PFS, Progression-free survival', 'PIK3CA, Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha', 'PR, Partial Response', 'PTEN, Phosphatase and tensin homolog', 'Personalized medicine', 'Precision oncology', 'R/R, Refractory/Relapsed', 'RAF, Rapidly growing fibrosarcoma - protein', 'RNA, Ribonucleic acid', 'SD, Stable Disease', 'TTF, Time to treatment failure', 'WES, Whole-exome sequencing', 'mTOR, Mammalian target of Rapamycin']",,2019/04/23 06:00,2019/04/23 06:01,['2019/04/23 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2019.03.012 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(18)30308-8 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2019 Mar 26;17:447-453. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2019.03.012. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NUDT15 genotyping should therefore be performed prior to the administration of thiopurine, the dosage of which requires adjustment.","['Cheng, Juan', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Ma, Hai-Zhen', 'Li, Juan']","['Cheng J', 'Zhang H', 'Ma HZ', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

Hemolysis in aTTP is mechanical; thus, direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is usually negative. Multiple autoimmune conditions and various auto-antibodies have been described in the context of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In this paper, we describe the first case of CMML with auto-antibodies to ADAMTS13, presenting initially as plasmapheresis-refractory Coombs-positive aTTP. Results: Although our patient was not treated for CMML, a complete remission of aTTP was eventually achieved with rituximab. Conclusion; We propose that aTTP should be in the differential diagnosis of CMML patients with thrombocytopenia and anemia (Coombs positive or not) who develop signs of thrombotic microangiopathy. Further studies are much needed to decipher the immune-mediated processes in CMML.","['Krecak, Ivan', 'Medic, Marijana Grgic', 'Gveric-Krecak, Velka', 'Roncevic, Pavle', 'Basic Kinda, Sandra', 'Babel, Jaksa', 'Radonic, Radovan']","['Krecak I', 'Medic MG', 'Gveric-Krecak V', 'Roncevic P', 'Basic Kinda S', 'Babel J', 'Radonic R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, General Hospital of Sibenik - Knin County , Sibenik, Croatia.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, General Hospital of Sibenik - Knin County , Sibenik, Croatia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Zagreb , Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190422,England,Acta Clin Belg,Acta clinica Belgica,0370306,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.24.87 (ADAMTS13 Protein)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['ADAMTS13 Protein/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Coombs Test', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', '*Plasmapheresis', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'rituximab']",,2019/04/23 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2019/04/23 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17843286.2019.1608395 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Clin Belg. 2020 Oct;75(5):357-361. doi: 10.1080/17843286.2019.1608395.

Among them, seven compounds sensitized paclitaxel-resistant cervical cancer cells HeLa/PTX to paclitaxel. Piperine was a major component obtained from Piper nigrum, and its sensitization mechanism was investigated. Combination treatment enhanced cell apoptosis, which was mediated by downregulation of phospho-Akt and Mcl-1. Piperine (50 muM) combined with paclitaxel (200 nM) downregulated Mcl-1 protein expression with a decrease of 35.9 +/- 9.5% ( P < 0.05). Moreover, overexpression of Mcl-1 attenuated the inhibitory effect of this combination. Furthermore, combination treatments of six dimeric amide alkaloids and paclitaxel all downregulated Mcl-1 protein expression with a decrease ranging from 23.5 +/- 9.7% to 41.7 +/- 7.2% ( P < 0.05).

Many countries have developed specialist age-appropriate cancer services believing them to be of value. In England, 13 specialist principal treatment centres (PTCs) deliver cancer care to young people. Despite this expansion of specialist care, systematic investigation of associated outcomes and costs has, to date, been lacking. The aim of this paper is to describe recruitment and baseline characteristics of the BRIGHTLIGHT cohort and the development of the bespoke measures of levels of care and disease severity, which will inform the evaluation of cancer services in England. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal, observational study. SETTING: Ninety-seven National Health Service hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1114 participants were recruited and diagnosed between July 2012 and December 2014: 55% (n=618) were men, mean age was 20.1 years (SD=3.3), most (86%) were white and most common diagnoses were lymphoma (31%), germ cell tumour (19%) and leukaemia (13%). RESULTS: At diagnosis, median quality of life score was significantly lower than a published control threshold (69.7 points); 40% had borderline to severe anxiety, and 21% had borderline to severe depression. There was minimal variation in other patient-reported outcomes according to age, diagnosis or severity of illness. Survival was lower in the cohort than for young people diagnosed during the same period who were not recruited (cumulative survival probability 4 years after diagnosis: 88% vs 92%). CONCLUSIONS: Data collection was completed in March 2018. Longitudinal comparisons will determine outcomes and costs associated with access/exposure to PTCs. Findings will inform international intervention and policy initiatives to improve outcomes for young people with cancer.","['Taylor, Rachel M', 'Fern, Lorna A', 'Barber, Julie', 'Alvarez-Galvez, Javier', 'Feltbower, Richard', 'Morris, Stephen', 'Hooker, Louise', 'McCabe, Martin G', 'Gibson, Faith', 'Raine, Rosalind', 'Stark, Dan P', 'Whelan, Jeremy S']","['Taylor RM', 'Fern LA', 'Barber J', 'Alvarez-Galvez J', 'Feltbower R', 'Morris S', 'Hooker L', 'McCabe MG', 'Gibson F', 'Raine R', 'Stark DP', 'Whelan JS']","['Cancer Clinical Trials, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Biotechnology and Public Health, University of Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain.', 'School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Applied Health Research, University College London, London, UK.', 'Wessex Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Service, University Hospital Southhamptom, Southampton, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'ORCHID, Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK.', 'Institute of Epidemiology & Health, University College London, London, UK.', 'Leeds Insitute of Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190420,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders/etiology', 'Biomedical Research/*organization & administration', 'Delivery of Health Care/*organization & administration', 'Depressive Disorder/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'State Medicine', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC6500338,['NOTNLM'],"['*brightlight', '*cancer', '*cohort', '*observational research', '*recruitment', '*teenagers and young adults']",['Competing interests: None declared.'],2019/04/22 06:00,2020/04/18 06:00,['2019/04/22 06:00'],"['2019/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2018-027797 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027797 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2019 Apr 20;9(4):e027797. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027797.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0853-0925', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6793-5722']","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

These patients are routinely excluded from participation in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: In this phase II study, we determined the activity and toxicity of ofatumumab, a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, in older patients with CLL, poor performance status and comorbidities. METHODS: Treatment-naive patients with CLL aged >/=65years with an ECOG performance status of 2-3 or Charlson comorbidity index >/=2 were eligible. Ofatumumab was administered intravenously weekly for the first month, then monthly for a total of 12months. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled. Median age was 73years, and 29% had another cancer diagnosis. Among 32 patients evaluable for response, the overall response rate was 72%. We observed complete responses in 19% of patients and partial responses in 53%. The median progression-free survival duration was 21months, and the estimated proportion of patients alive at 36months was 87%. All 34 patients were evaluable for toxicity. Treatment was well tolerated, with infusion-related reactions being the most common treatment-related adverse event. Only one patient had a grade 3 infection. Additional grade 3 adverse events that may have been related to ofatumumab were diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, hyperglycemia, pulmonary embolism, and hypersensitivity reaction, each in one patient. No grade 4 adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: Single-agent ofatumumab is a well-tolerated and effective therapeutic approach for treatment-naive older patients with CLL; it can be safely administered to patients with significant comorbidities and other cancer diagnoses.","['Vitale, Candida', 'Falchi, Lorenzo', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Burger, Jan', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra']","['Vitale C', 'Falchi L', 'Ciccone M', 'Burger J', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Borthakur G', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Ferrajoli A']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Thiopurine metabolism varies among individuals because of differences in the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT, EC 2.1.1.67), and to avoid severe adverse reactions caused by incorrect dosing it is recommended that the patient's TPMT status be determined before the start of thiopurine treatment. This study describes the concordance between genotyping for common TPMT alleles and phenotyping in a Swedish cohort of 12,663 patients sampled before or during thiopurine treatment. The concordance between TPMT genotype and enzyme activity was 94.5%. Compared to the genotype, the first measurement of TPMT enzyme activity was lower than expected for 4.6% of the patients. Sequencing of all coding regions of the TPMT gene in genotype/phenotype discrepant individuals led to the identification of rare and novel TPMT alleles. Fifteen individuals (0.1%) with rare or novel genotypes were identified, and three TPMT alleles (TPMT*42, *43, and *44) are characterized here for the first time. These 15 patients would not have been detected as carrying a deviating TPMT genotype if only genotyping of the most common TPMT variants had been performed. This study highlights the benefit of combining TPMT genotype and phenotype determination in routine testing. More accurate dose recommendations can be made, which might decrease the number of adverse reactions and treatment failures during thiopurine treatment.","['Zimdahl Kahlin, Anna', 'Helander, Sara', 'Skoglund, Karin', 'Soderkvist, Peter', 'Martensson, Lars-Goran', 'Appell, Malin Lindqvist']","['Zimdahl Kahlin A', 'Helander S', 'Skoglund K', 'Soderkvist P', 'Martensson LG', 'Appell ML']","['Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, SE-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Chemistry, Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Linkoping University, SE-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.

Cell physiology and homeostasis is regulated by microRNAs in diverse microenvironment. In this investigation we have identified conserved miR-193a target sites within the 3'-UTR of MLL1 gene transcript. Utilizing wild type and mutated 3'-UTR constructs and luciferase reporter assays we have clearly demonstrated that miR-193a directly targets the 3'-UTR region of the MLL1 mRNA. Ectopic expression of miR-193a modulated global H3K4 mono-, di- and tri-methylation levels and affects the expression of CAV1, a gene which is specifically modulated by H3K4me3. To determine the implications of this in vitro finding in aberrant physiological conditions we analyzed prostate cancer tissue samples. In this context miR-193a RNA was undetectable and MLL1 was highly expressed with concomitantly high levels of H3K4me, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoters of MLL1 responsive genes. Finally, we showed that prolonged ectopic expression of miR-193a inhibits growth and cell migration, and induces apoptosis. Thus, while our study unveils amplitude of the epigenome, including miRnome it establishes that; (i) miR-193a directly target MLL1 mRNA, (ii) miR-193a impair MLL1 protein production, (iii) miR-193a reduces the overall methylation marks of the genome.","['Sengupta, Dipta', 'Deb, Moonmoon', 'Kar, Swayamsiddha', 'Parbin, Sabnam', 'Pradhan, Nibedita', 'Patra, Samir Kumar']","['Sengupta D', 'Deb M', 'Kar S', 'Parbin S', 'Pradhan N', 'Patra SK']","['Epigenetics and Cancer Research Laboratory, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Life Science, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha 769008, India.', 'Epigenetics and Cancer Research Laboratory, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Life Science, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha 769008, India.', 'Epigenetics and Cancer Research Laboratory, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Life Science, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha 769008, India.', 'Epigenetics and Cancer Research Laboratory, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Life Science, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha 769008, India.', 'Epigenetics and Cancer Research Laboratory, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Life Science, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha 769008, India.', 'Epigenetics and Cancer Research Laboratory, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Group, Department of Life Science, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha 769008, India.

However, autologous CAR T therapies have limitations that may impact clinical use, including lengthy vein-to-vein time and manufacturing constraints. Allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T) therapies may overcome these innate limitations of autologous CAR T therapies. Unlike autologous cell therapies, AlloCAR T therapies employ healthy donor T cells that are isolated in a manufacturing facility, engineered to express CARs with specificity for a tumor-associated antigen, and modified using gene-editing technology to limit T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated immune responses. Here, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) gene editing of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR Ts was used to confer lymphodepletion resistance and reduced graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) potential. The safety profile of allogeneic BCMA CAR Ts was further enhanced by incorporating a CD20 mimotope-based intra-CAR off switch enabling effective CAR T elimination in the presence of rituximab. Allogeneic BCMA CAR Ts induced sustained antitumor responses in mice supplemented with human cytokines, and, most importantly, maintained their phenotype and potency after scale-up manufacturing. This novel off-the-shelf allogeneic BCMA CAR T product is a promising candidate for clinical evaluation.","['Sommer, Cesar', 'Boldajipour, Bijan', 'Kuo, Tracy C', 'Bentley, Trevor', 'Sutton, Janette', 'Chen, Amy', 'Geng, Tao', 'Dong, Holly', 'Galetto, Roman', 'Valton, Julien', 'Pertel, Thomas', 'Juillerat, Alexandre', 'Gariboldi, Annabelle', 'Pascua, Edward', 'Brown, Colleen', 'Chin, Sherman M', 'Sai, Tao', 'Ni, Yajin', 'Duchateau, Philippe', 'Smith, Julianne', 'Rajpal, Arvind', 'Van Blarcom, Thomas', 'Chaparro-Riggers, Javier', 'Sasu, Barbra J']","['Sommer C', 'Boldajipour B', 'Kuo TC', 'Bentley T', 'Sutton J', 'Chen A', 'Geng T', 'Dong H', 'Galetto R', 'Valton J', 'Pertel T', 'Juillerat A', 'Gariboldi A', 'Pascua E', 'Brown C', 'Chin SM', 'Sai T', 'Ni Y', 'Duchateau P', 'Smith J', 'Rajpal A', 'Van Blarcom T', 'Chaparro-Riggers J', 'Sasu BJ']","['Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., 210 E.

The present work aimed to explore the antitumor effect of ALT in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). MAIN METHODS: B-ALL cells were treated with various concentrations of ALT, and then trypan blue assay, Annexin V/PI staining assay, PI staining assay, western blot analysis were employed to measure the effect of ALT on viability, apoptosis and cell cycle in B-ALL cells. In addition, a synthetic bioinformatics method was used to predict the underlying mechanism of antitumor effect of ALT. Then Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) probe Dihydroethidium (DHE) and 2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) were used to detect accumulation of cellular ROS. Meanwhile, DNA damage was identified by 8-oxoG, p-ATM1987, gamma-H2AX and comet assay. In addition, activity of glutathione reductase (GR), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and catalase were measured and overexpressed in SEM and RS4;11 cells to study the inhibition on these enzymes. Finally, B-ALL NOD-SCID mouse model was used to test its performance in vivo. KEY FINDINGS: ALT showed good antitumor effect in B-ALL in vivo and in vitro through inducing ROS overload, which led to DNA damage. In addition, we found ROS overload caused by ALT was due to its direct inhibition on reductase. SIGNIFICANCE: We found that ALT, a natural product, showing a promising tactic in the therapy of B-ALL by targeting ROS pathway.","['Xu, Xiaoguang', 'Huang, Lei', 'Zhang, Zilu', 'Tong, Jia', 'Mi, Jianqing', 'Wu, Yingli', 'Zhang, Chenli', 'Yan, Hua']","['Xu X', 'Huang L', 'Zhang Z', 'Tong J', 'Mi J', 'Wu Y', 'Zhang C', 'Yan H']","['Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Practice, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Practice, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.

Despite a comparable overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival using this approach, some evidence suggests that haploidentical allo-HSCT recipients have a higher incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, though this has not been clearly established. METHODS: This study retrospectively compared the cumulative incidence of CMV DNAemia, 2-year OS, and leukemia-free survival rates in acute leukemia patients with MSD (n = 41), MUD (n = 18), and haploidentical donor allografts (n = 21). RESULTS: The cumulative incidences of CMV DNAemia at day 180 in the MSD, MUD, and haploidentical groups were 39.0, 55.6, and 85.7%, respectively (P < 0.000). As less than 50% of patients in the MSD group were detected to have CMV DNAemia, the median time to CMV DNAemia detection in patients allografted with MSD could not be obtained. However, it was 42 and 29 days, respectively, for the MUD and haploidentical groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that haploidentical allo-HSCT (MSD vs. haploidentical: HR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.09-0.78; P = 0.017) and age (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06; P = 0.011) increased CMV infection. Finally, MSD, MUD, and haploidentical allo-HSCT provided comparable 2-year OS rates (52.1%, 65.5%, and 65.6%; P = 0.425) and 2-year leukemia-free survival rates (67.1%, 68.3%, and 80.7%, P = 0.837). CONCLUSION: The CMV incidence was higher for haploidentical allo-HSCT than for MSD and MUD allo-HSCT; this could be explained by graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis by multiple immunosuppressants.","['Lin, Cheng-Hsien', 'Su, Yi-Jiun', 'Hsu, Chiann-Yi', 'Wang, Po-Nan', 'Teng, Chieh-Lin Jerry']","['Lin CH', 'Su YJ', 'Hsu CY', 'Wang PN', 'Teng CJ']","['Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan.', 'Biostatistics Task Force, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190511,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*complications/mortality', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/adverse effects', 'Unrelated Donors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['allo-HSCT', 'cytomegalovirus', 'haploidentical', 'leukemia-free survival', 'overall survival']",,2019/04/21 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/04/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.13096 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2019 Aug;21(4):e13096. doi: 10.1111/tid.13096.

In approximately 90% of cases the TP53 gene is in its wildtype state at diagnosis of this malignancy. As mouse double-minute-2 homolog (MDM2) is a primary repressor of p53, targeting this protein is an attractive therapeutic approach for non-genotoxic reactivation of p53. Since the discovery of the first MDM2 inhibitor, Nutlin-3a, newer potent and bioavailable compounds have been developed. In this study we tested the second-generation MDM2 inhibitor, RG7388, in patient-derived CLL cells and normal cells, examining its effect on the induction of p53-transcriptional targets. RG7388 potently decreased viability in p53-functional CLL cells, whereas p53-non-functional samples were more resistant to the drug. RG7388 induced a pro-apoptotic gene expression signature with upregulation of p53-target genes involved in the intrinsic (PUMA, BAX) and extrinsic (TNFRSF10B, FAS) pathways of apoptosis, as well as MDM2 Only a slight induction of CDKN1A was observed and upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes dominated, indicating that CLL cells are primed for p53-dependent apoptosis. Consequently, RG7388 led to a concentration-dependent increase in caspase-3/7 activity and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Importantly, we observed a preferential pro-apoptotic signature in CLL cells but not in normal blood and bone marrow cells, including CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. These data support the further evaluation of MDM2 inhibitors as a novel additional treatment option for patients with p53-functional CLL.","['Ciardullo, Carmela', 'Aptullahoglu, Erhan', 'Woodhouse, Laura', 'Lin, Wei-Yu', 'Wallis, Jonathan P', 'Marr, Helen', 'Marshall, Scott', 'Bown, Nick', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Lunec, John']","['Ciardullo C', 'Aptullahoglu E', 'Woodhouse L', 'Lin WY', 'Wallis JP', 'Marr H', 'Marshall S', 'Bown N', 'Willmore E', 'Lunec J']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Department of Haematology, Freeman Hospital, The Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Department of Haematology, Freeman Hospital, The Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Department of Haematology, City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Trust, Sunderland.', 'Northern Genetics Service, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne john.lunec@ncl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190419,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (RG7388)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (para-Aminobenzoates)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'para-Aminobenzoates/*pharmacology']",PMC6959162,,,,2019/04/21 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2019/04/21 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.206631 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.206631 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Dec;104(12):2429-2442. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.206631.

A PB assay that accurately rules out MDS would have major benefits. The diagnostic accuracy of the intra-individual robust coefficient of variation (RCV) for neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression measured by flow cytometric analysis in PB was evaluated in a retrospective derivation study (44 MDS cases and 44 controls) and a prospective validation study (68 consecutive patients with suspected MDS). Compared with controls, MDS cases had higher median RCV values for neutrophil MPO expression (40.2% vs 30.9%; P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve estimates were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-0.97] and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.76-0.94) in the derivation and validation studies, respectively. A RCV lower than 30% ruled out MDS with 100% sensitivity (95%CI: 78-100%) and 100% negative predictive value (95%CI: 83-100%) in the prospective validation study.

We conducted a nested analysis in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study blood subcohorts, with up to 22 years of follow up to investigate associations of clonal mutations of >/=0.0001 allele frequency with future risk of AML. We identified 35 cases with AML that had pre-diagnosis peripheral blood samples and matched two controls without history of cancer per case by sex, age, and ethnicity. We conducted blinded error-corrected sequencing on all study samples and assessed variant-associated risk using conditional logistic regression. We detected AML-associated mutations in 97% of all participants (598 mutations, 5.8/person). Individuals with mutations >/=0.01 variant allele fraction had a significantly increased AML risk (OR 5.4, 95%CI: 1.8-16.6), as did individuals with higher-frequency clones and those with DNMT3A R882H/C mutations. The risk of lower-frequency clones was less clear. In the 11 case-control sets with samples banked ten years apart, clonal mutations rarely expanded over time. Our findings are consistent with published evidence that detection of clonal mutations >/=0.01 VAF identifies individuals at increased risk for AML.

It is now clear that malignant clones evolve, expand and change even during what seem to be clinically healthy or ""cured"" periods. This opens a wide window for new therapeutic and monitoring opportunities. Moreover, prediction and even early prevention have become possible goals to be pursued. The aim of this review is to shed light upon recent observations in leukemia evolution and their clinical implications.

However, the use of several different immunosuppressive regimens, the lack of high-quality studies, and the absence of validated predictive biomarkers pose important challenges. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, COCHRANE registry of clinical trials (CENTRAL), and the Web of Science without language restriction from inception through September 2018, as well as relevant conference proceedings and abstracts, for prospective cohort studies or clinical trials investigating IST in MDS. Fixed and Random-effects models were used to pool response rates. We identified nine prospective cohort studies and 13 clinical trials with a total of 570 patients. Overall response rate was 42.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 36.1-49.2%] including a complete remission rate of 12.5% (95%CI: 9.3-16.6%) and red blood cell transfusion independence rate of 33.4% (95% CI: 25.1-42.9%). The most commonly used forms of IST were anti-thymocyte globulin alone or in combination with cyclosporin A with a trend towards higher response rates with combination therapy. Progression rate to acute myeloid leukemia was 8.6% per patient year (95%CI: 3.3-13.9%). Overall survival and adverse events were only inconsistently reported. We were unable to validate any biomarkers predictive of a therapeutic response to IST. IST for treatment of lower-risk MDS patients can be successful to alleviate transfusion burden and associated sequelae.","['Stahl, Maximilian', 'Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Giri, Smith', 'Wang, Rong', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Stahl M', 'Bewersdorf JP', 'Giri S', 'Wang R', 'Zeidan AM']","['Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT amer.zeidan@yale.edu.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Systematic Review']",20190419,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC6939518,,,,2019/04/21 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/04/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.219345 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.219345 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jan;105(1):102-111. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.219345.

A substantial proportion of these patients have a concomitant FLT3-ITD. While outcomes are dismal with intensive chemotherapy, limited evidence suggests allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) may improve survival if performed early during first complete remission. We report on a cohort of 178 patients with t(6;9)(p22;q34) within an international, multicenter collaboration. Median age was 46 years (range: 16-76), AML was de novo in 88%, FLT3-ITD was present in 62%, and additional cytogenetic abnormalities in 21%. Complete remission was achieved in 81% (n=144), including 14 patients who received high-dose cytarabine after initial induction failure. With a median follow up of 5.43 years, estimated overall survival at five years was 38% (95%CI: 31-47%). Allo-HCT was performed in 117 (66%) patients, including 89 in first complete remission. Allo-HCT in first complete remission was associated with higher 5-year relapse-free and overall survival as compared to consolidation chemotherapy: 45% (95%CI: 35-59%) and 53% (95%CI: 42-66%) versus 7% (95%CI: 3-19%) and 23% (95%CI: 13-38%), respectively. For patients undergoing allo-HCT, there was no difference in overall survival rates at five years according to whether it was performed in first [53% (95%CI: 42-66%)], or second [58% (95%CI: 31-100%); n=10] complete remission or with active disease/relapse [54% (95%CI: 34-84%); n=18] (P=0.67). Neither FLT3-ITD nor additional chromosomal abnormalities impacted survival. In conclusion, outcomes of t(6;9)(p22;q34) AML are poor with chemotherapy, and can be substantially improved with allo-HCT.","['Kayser, Sabine', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Luskin, Marlise R', 'Brunner,

A BCL2-targeting drug, venetoclax, has promising anticancer activity in MCL. We analyzed molecular mechanisms of venetoclax resistance in MCL cells and tested strategies to overcome it. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We confirmed key roles of proapoptotic proteins BIM and NOXA in mediating venetoclax-induced cell death in MCL. Both BIM and NOXA are, however, differentially expressed in cell lines compared with primary cells. First, NOXA protein is significantly overexpressed in most MCL cell lines. Second, deletions of BIM gene harbored by three commonly used MCL cell lines (JEKO-1, MINO, and Z138) were not found by array comparative genomic hybridization using a validation set of 24 primary MCL samples. RESULTS: We demonstrated that MCL1 and NOXA play important roles in mediating resistance to venetoclax. Consequently, we tested an experimental treatment strategy based on cotargeting BCL2 with venetoclax and MCL1 with a highly specific small-molecule MCL1 inhibitor S63845. The combination of venetoclax and S63845 demonstrated synthetic lethality in vivo on a panel of five patient-derived xenografts established from patients with relapsed MCL with adverse cytogenetics.

We aimed to understand TLS prophylaxis, rates of select adverse events (AE), and impact of dosing modifications in routine clinical practice. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 297 CLL venetoclax-treated patients outside of clinical trials in academic and community centers. Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, venetoclax dosing, TLS risk and prophylaxis, and AEs were collected. RESULTS: The group was 69% male, 96% had relapsed/refractory CLL, 45% had deletion chromosome 17p, 84% had unmutated IGHV, 80% received venetoclax monotherapy, and median age was 67. TLS risk was categorized as low (40%), intermediate (32%), or high (28%), and 62% had imaging prior to venetoclax initiation. Clinical TLS occurred in 2.7% of patients and laboratory TLS occurred in 5.7%. Pre-venetoclax TLS risk group and creatinine clearance independently predict TLS development in multivariable analysis. Grade 3/4 AEs included neutropenia (39.6%), thrombocytopenia (29.2%), infection (25%), neutropenic fever (7.9%), and diarrhea (6.9%). Twenty-two patients (7.4%) discontinued venetoclax due to an AE. Progression-free survival was similar regardless of number of dose interruptions, length of dose interruption, and stable venetoclax dose. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide insights into current use of venetoclax in clinical practice, including TLS rates observed in clinical practice. We identified opportunities for improved adherence to TLS risk stratification and prophylaxis, which may improve safety.","['Roeker, Lindsey E', 'Fox, Christopher P', 'Eyre, Toby A', 'Brander,

The structures of all new compounds were established by spectroscopic methods ((1)H- and, (13)C-NMR, ESI MS), and elemental analyses. Their cytotoxicity was evaluated against K562 (leukemia), MOLT-4 (leukemia), HeLa (cervix carcinoma), and normal cells (HUVEC). Five compounds (1c, 1e, 2d, 3a, 3d) showed significant cytotoxic activity against all tested cell lines and selectivity for cancer cell lines. The SAR analysis (structure-activity relationship analysis) indicated that the presence of bromine introduced to a methyl or acetyl group that was attached to the benzofuran system increased their cytotoxicity both in normal and cancer cells.","['Napiorkowska, Mariola', 'Cieslak, Marcin', 'Kazmierczak-Baranska, Julia', 'Krolewska-Golinska, Karolina', 'Nawrot, Barbara']","['Napiorkowska M', 'Cieslak M', 'Kazmierczak-Baranska J', 'Krolewska-Golinska K', 'Nawrot B']","['Chair and Department of Biochemistry, Medical University of Warsaw, 1 Banacha Str., 02-097 Warsaw, Poland. mariola.napiorkowska@wum.edu.pl.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland. marcin@cbmm.lodz.pl.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland. julia@cbmm.lodz.pl.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland. kkrolews@cbmm.lodz.pl.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, 112 Sienkiewicza Str., 90-363 Lodz, Poland. bnawrot@cbmm.lodz.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190418,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'LK6946W774 (benzofuran)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzofurans/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50']",PMC6514909,['NOTNLM'],"['HeLa', 'K562', 'MOLT-4', 'benzofurans', 'chemical synthesis', 'cytotoxic properties']",,2019/04/21 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2019/04/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24081529 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24081529 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Apr 18;24(8). pii: molecules24081529. doi: 10.3390/molecules24081529.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1174-2208', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4084-4334']",,,['NCN OPUS UMO-2014/15/B/NZ7/00966/Polish Ministry of Science'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent FDA approval of 8 new drugs for AML has increased therapeutic armamentarium and also provides effective low-intensity treatment options. Rational therapy selection strategies that consider individual's risk of therapy-related toxicities and probability of disease control can maximize benefits of available treatments. Studies have demonstrated that fitness level, measured by geriatric assessment can predict therapy-related toxicities, whereas cytogenetic and mutation results correlate with the probability of responses to standard chemotherapy.

Lyme arthritis, the most common, serious and harmful manifestation during the late stages of Lyme disease, is closely associated with the Borrelia burgdorferi basic membrane protein A (BmpA). Chemokines are also reported to have an important role in Lyme arthritis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize and bind to pathogen-associated molecules which are structurally conserved among microbes, to activate transcriptional events, including cytokine production, inflammation, and tissue damage. We speculated that BmpA could induce a storm of proinflammatory chemokines via TLRs and downstream moleculars, and that TLR1, TLR2, TLR5, TLR6 and the adaptor protein, MyD88, may be involved in this process. We explored this hypothesis using the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, and recombinant BmpA (rBmpA). Cell surface TLR1 and TLR2 were neutralized using specific antibodies before stimulation with rBmpA and analysis of chemokine secretion using a chemokine chip. Further, the expressions level of the four TLRs and MyD88 were analyzed following stimulation with rBmpA. Stimulation with rBmpA resulted in elevated levels of seven cytokines. Further, TLR1 and TLR2 antibody treated cells exhibited an overall reduction in rBmpA-induced chemokine expression. TLR1, TLR2, and MyD88 expression levels (both mRNA and protein) increased after stimulation with rBmpA.

In addition, the side population (SP), characterized by high Hoechst 33342 efflux, reflecting therapy resistance, has leukemia initiating ability. The purpose of this study is, in both CD34-positive and CD34-negative AML, to integrate both types of LSC compartment into a new more restricted definition. Different CD34/CD38/SP defined putative LSC and normal hematopoietic compartments, with neoplastic or normal nature, respectively, were thus identified after cell sorting, and confirmed by FISH/PCR. Stem cell activity was assessed in the long-term liquid culture stem cell assay. SP fractions harbored the strongest functional stem cell activity in both normal and neoplastic cells in both CD34-positive and CD34-negative AML. Overall, inclusion of SP fraction decreased the size of the putative CD34/CD38 defined LSC compartment by a factor >500. For example, for the important CD34+CD38- LSC compartment, the median SP/CD34+CD38- frequency was 5.1 per million WBC (CD34-positive AML), and median SP/CD34-CD38+ frequency (CD34-negative AML) was 1796 per million WBC. Improved detection of LSC may enable identification of therapy resistant clones, and thereby identification of novel LSC specific, HSC sparing, therapies.","['Moshaver, Bijan', 'Wouters, Rolf F', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Westra, Guus A H', 'Kwidama, Zinia', 'Rutten, Arjo R', 'Kaspers, Gert J L', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['Moshaver B', 'Wouters RF', 'Kelder A', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Westra GAH', 'Kwidama Z', 'Rutten AR', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Zweegman S', 'Cloos J', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

One of the epigenetic marks that has been implicated in memory formation is histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), and this modification is found at the promoters of actively transcribed genes. The total levels of H3K4me3 are increased in the CA1 region of the hippocampus during memory formation, and genetic perturbation of the K4 methyltransferases and demethylases interferes with forming memories. Previous chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses failed to detect changes in H3K4me3 levels at the promoters of memory-linked genes. Since the breadth of H3K4me3 marks was recently reported to be associated with the transcriptional outcome of a gene, we re-analyzed H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data sets to identify the role of H3K4me3 broad domains in CA1 neurons, as well as identify differences in breadth that occur during contextual fear conditioning. We found that, under baseline conditions, broad H3K4me3 peaks mark important learning and memory genes and are often regulated by super-enhancers. The peaks at many learning-associated genes become broader during novel environment exposure and memory formation. Furthermore, the important learning- and memory-associated lysine methyltransferases, Kmt2a and Kmt2b, are involved in maintaining H3K4me3 peak width. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing H3K4me3 peak shape, and demonstrate that breadth of H3K4me3 marks in neurons of the hippocampus is regulated during memory formation.","['Collins, Bridget E', 'Sweatt, J David', 'Greer, Celeste B']","['Collins BE', 'Sweatt JD', 'Greer CB']","['Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.

The anti-tumor activities of AIL have been reported in various solid tumors. This study aimed to reveal the in vitro effect of AIL on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: The effects of AIL on five AML cell lines (KG1, HL60, U-937, THP-1 and OCI-AML2) as well as myeloid progenitor cells were evaluated by performing CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay and Western blotting. KG1 and HL60 cells were transfected with miR-449a inhibitor or its negative control, and then were treated by AIL. The above mentioned assays were performed again to study the involvement of miR-449a in AIL's function. RESULTS: AIL dose-dependently inhibited the viability of AML cells and myeloid progenitor cells. The IC50 value of AIL towards KG1 and HL60 cells was 0.58 and 0.57muM, respectively. AIL with concentration of 0.5muM significantly induced the apoptosis of AML cells rather than myeloid progenitor cells. Meanwhile, 0.5muM AIL significantly reduced migration and invasion of AML cells. miR-449a was highly expressed in response to the treatment of 0.5muM AIL. Besides this, the anti-tumor activities of AIL in AML cells were attenuated by miR-449a silence. Further, the blockage of Notch and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways induced by AIL was reversed by miR-449a silence. CONCLUSION: AIL restrained AML cells growth, migration and invasion through up-regulation of miR-449a, and deactivation of Notch and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.","['Zhang, Yang', 'Zhang, Chunzhi', 'Min, Dejin']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang C', 'Min D']","[""Department of Hematology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining 272000, Shandong, China.; Affiliated Jining No.1 People's Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining Medical University, Jining 272067, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining 272000, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining 272000, Shandong, China.

Here we describe a fully automated system to digitally count the intron, mRNA, and protein content of up to five genes of interest simultaneously in single-cells. Full system automation of 3D microscope scans and custom image analysis routines allows hundreds of individual cells to be automatically segmented and the mRNA-protein content to be digitally counted. Single-molecule intron and mRNA content is measured by single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH), while protein content is quantified though the use of antibody probes. To mimic immune response to bacterial infection, human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the expression of two inflammatory genes, IL1beta (interleukin 1beta) and TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha), were simultaneously quantified by monitoring the intron, mRNA, and protein levels over time. The simultaneous labeling of cellular content allowed for a series of correlations at the single-cell level to be explored, both in the progressive maturation of a single gene (intron-mRNA-protein) and comparative analysis between the two immune response genes. In the absence of LPS stimulation, mRNA expression of IL1beta and TNF-alpha were uncorrelated. Following LPS stimulation, mRNA expression of the two genes became more correlated, consistent with a model in which IL1beta and TNF-alpha upregulation occurs in parallel through independent mechanistic pathways. This smFISH methodology can be applied to different complex biological systems to provide valuable insight into highly dynamic gene mechanisms that determine cell plasticity and heterogeneity of cellular response.","['Kalb, Daniel M', 'Adikari, Samantha H', 'Hong-Geller, Elizabeth', 'Werner, James H']","['Kalb DM', 'Adikari SH', 'Hong-Geller E', 'Werner JH']","['Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States of America.', 'Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States of America.', 'Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States of America.', 'Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190419,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (IL1B protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Indoles/chemistry', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6474627,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/04/20 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0215602 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-02835 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Apr 19;14(4):e0215602. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0215602. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7616-8913'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their lipid composition was quantified.Measurements and Main Results: Free cholesterol was largely increased by 60-fold and cholesteryl esters were increased by 24-fold. There was an excessive, more than 130-fold increase in ceramide and other sphingolipids. In particular, the long-chain ceramides d18:1/20:0 and d18:1/24:0 were elevated and likely contributed to the proapoptotic environment observed in PAP. Cellular debris lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine were only moderately increased, by four- to sevenfold. The surfactant lipid class phosphatidylcholine expanded 17-fold, lysophosphatidylcholine expanded 54-fold, and the surfactant proteins A, B, and C expanded 144-, 4-, and 17-fold, respectively. These changes did not differ among the various diseases that cause PAP.Conclusions: This insight into the alveolar lipidome may provide monitoring tools and lead to new therapeutic strategies for PAP.","['Griese, Matthias', 'Bonella, Francesco', 'Costabel, Ulrich', 'de Blic, Jacques', 'Tran, Nguyen-Binh', 'Liebisch, Gerhard']","['Griese M', 'Bonella F', 'Costabel U', 'de Blic J', 'Tran NB', 'Liebisch G']","[""German Center for Lung Research, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany."", 'Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases, Department of Pneumology, Ruhrlandklinik University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases, Department of Pneumology, Ruhrlandklinik University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France; and.', ""German Center for Lung Research, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany."", 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Regensburg University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,9421642,"['0 (CSF2RA protein, human)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (NPC2 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A)', '0 (Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein B)', '0 (Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein C)', '0 (Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '39382-08-6 (phosphatidylethanolamine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 6.1.1.10 (MARS1 protein, human)', 'EC 6.1.1.10 (Methionine-tRNA Ligase)', 'EC 6.1.1.20 (Phenylalanine-tRNA Ligase)', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis, Acquired', 'Surfactant Metabolism Dysfunction, Pulmonary, 4']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/metabolism', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Cholesterol Esters/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', '*Lipid Metabolism', '*Lipidomics', 'Male', 'Methionine-tRNA Ligase/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenylalanine-tRNA Ligase/genetics', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/etiology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein B/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein C/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BAL', '*lipids', '*pulmonary alveolar proteinosis']",,2019/04/20 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1164/rccm.201901-0086OC [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2019 Oct 1;200(7):881-887. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201901-0086OC.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0113-912X'],,,,,,,,,,,,['Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2019 Oct 1;200(7):800-802.

Most primary cell cultures and cell lines are adherent cells which grow in monolayers on surfaces. However, other cells such as hematopoietic cells, certain tumor cells, and cells of the immune system are suspension cells which are anchorage-independent which grow and divide in solution. THP-1 cells are a commercially available, spontaneously immortalized monocyte-like cell line derived from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia. These cells are an excellent model for suspension cell culture and studies of the immune system. Researchers have used THP-1 cells to study the host response to implantable devices and biomaterials in vitro. Tissue contacting surfaces of implantable materials initiate a host inflammatory response characterized by many events, one of which includes macrophage attachment to the surface, which ultimately leads to degradation and failure of the material. Using the THP-1 adhesion assay embedded in this CURE, students can participate in the scientific process by testing substances which may prevent the host inflammatory response to implantable devices and biomaterials.

In the present study, RTqPCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of the MTRR and MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) genes in the bone marrow of 20 ALL patients and 20 age and sexmatched controls with normal bone marrow. The methylation pattern of the MTRR promoter region in eligible DNA samples was quantitatively analyzed using MALDITOF MS. The results indicated that the mRNA expression level of MTRR in the bone marrow from children with ALL was lower than that in the control samples (P<0.05), but no significant difference was detected in the MTHFR gene between the two groups (P>0.05). According to the risk classification of ALL in children with high, medium and low risk, the lowrisk group had a higher methylation rate of CpG_6 compared to the mediumrisk group. However, the mediumrisk group had a higher CpG_46.47 methylation rate compared to the lowrisk group. The methylation rates of CpG_26 and CpG_46.47 in the highrisk group were higher than these rates in the lowrisk group, while the CpG_42.23.44 methylation rate was lower in the highrisk group than in the lowrisk group (P<0.05). The methylation rates at CpG_1, CpG_10, CpG_48 sites, score and the average methylation rate in the ALLH (high) group (>/=50x109/l) were lower than these in the ALLNH (not high) group (<50x109/l) and the control group (P<0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Relative expression levels of HOTTIP, microRNA-608 and DDA1 in AML patients were determined by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Meanwhile, the expressions of these genes in AML cell lines were detected as well. The regulatory effects of HOTTIP, microRNA-608 and DDA1 on the proliferative ability and cell cycle progression of AML cells were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to confirm the binding condition of microRNA-608 to HOTTIP and DDA1. Finally, the specific role of HOTTIP/microRNA-608/DDA1 axis in the development of AML was verified through a series of rescue experiments. RESULTS: HOTTIP was highly expressed in AML-M5 patients than normal controls. No significant difference in HOTTIP expression was found between patients with other subtypes of AML (M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 and M6) and normal controls. HOTTIP expression was significantly up-regulated in AML cell lines U-937 and THP-1. Up-regulation of HOTTIP remarkably promoted the proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of AML cells. Dual-luciferase reporter gene indicated that HOTTIP could bind to microRNA-608, which was lowly expressed in AML-M5 patients. Overexpression of microRNA-608 significantly inhibited the proliferative ability and cell cycle progression of U-937 and THP-1 cells. More importantly, microRNA-608 could partially reverse the regulatory effect of HOTTIP on AML cells. Meanwhile, DDA1 was verified as the target of microRNA-608. Subsequent experiments elucidated that DDA1 significantly accelerated the proliferation and cell cycle of AML cells. Furthermore, DDA1 could reverse the inhibitory effect of microRNA-608 on proliferative ability and cell cycle progression of AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: HOTTIP accelerated the proliferative ability and cell cycle of AML cells via up-regulating DDA1 expression by sponging microRNA-608.","['Zhuang, M-F', 'Li, L-J', 'Ma, J-B']","['Zhuang MF', 'Li LJ', 'Ma JB']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Second People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Linqing, China. 573727123@qq.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (DDA1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN608 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long noncoding RNA HOTTIP, human)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,2019/04/20 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201904_17569 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Apr;23(7):2908-2915. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201904_17569.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine whether the reproductive hormone fluctuation affect the ALV-J viremia at the early egg-laying phase in chicken. Total 8 suspected ALV-J-infected Chinese yellow chickens in the early egg-laying phase were collected from 2 different farms, and further confirmed by PCR and immunofluorescence assay. Plasma samples were collected from experimental chickens for 5 to 10 consecutive weeks at a settled time in each week. ALV-J viremia and reproductive hormone levels were monitored by ELISA or radioimmunoassay. The results showed that fluctuations in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and progesterone might have an impact on the disappearance of ALV-J viremia in chickens with intermittent viremia, but not in chickens with persistent viremia. These results suggest that reproductive hormone changes during the early egg-laying phase will affect the detection of positive ALV-J-infected chickens in the ALV-J eradication procedures.","['Dai, Manman', 'Feng, Min', 'Xie, Tingting', 'Li, Yuanfang', 'Zhang, Xiquan']","['Dai M', 'Feng M', 'Xie T', 'Li Y', 'Zhang X']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.', 'Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/metabolism/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/physiology', 'Chickens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/*blood', 'Luteinizing Hormone/*blood', 'Poultry Diseases/metabolism/*virology', 'Progesterone/*blood', 'Viremia/metabolism/*veterinary/virology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALV-J', 'FSH', 'LH', 'progesterone', 'viremia']",,2019/04/20 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)30645-5 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pez195 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2019 Sep 1;98(9):3533-3538. doi: 10.3382/ps/pez195.,,['(c) 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients were recruited within 1 month of hospital admission and randomized to EASE plus usual care (UC) or UC alone. EASE includes (1) EASE-psy, a tailored psychotherapy delivered over 8 weeks, and (2) EASE-phys, weekly physical symptom screening over 8 weeks to trigger early palliative care. The primary outcome was traumatic stress symptoms; secondary outcomes included physical symptom burden and quality of life. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Between-group differences were evaluated using multilevel modeling. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were randomized to EASE (n = 22) or UC (n = 20), with 76% retention at 12 weeks. Predefined feasibility outcomes were met: 86% (19/22) of EASE participants completed >/= 50% of EASE-psy sessions (goal >/= 64%); 100% received Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS, modified for AL) screenings, 64% (14/22) of whom completed >/= 50% of planned screenings (goal >/=50%); and 100% with scores >/= 4/10 on any physical ESAS-AL item had >/= 1 meeting with the EASE-phys team (goal 100%). Significant treatment-group differences favoring EASE were observed in traumatic stress symptoms at 4 and 12 weeks, and pain intensity and interference at 12 weeks (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: EASE is feasible in patients newly diagnosed with AL and shows promise of effectiveness. These results warrant a larger RCT to provide evidence for its more routine use as a standard of care.","['Rodin, Gary', 'Malfitano, Carmine', 'Rydall, Anne', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Marmar, Charles M', 'Mah, Kenneth', 'Lo, Christopher', 'Nissim, Rinat', 'Zimmermann, Camilla']","['Rodin G', 'Malfitano C', 'Rydall A', 'Schimmer A', 'Marmar CM', 'Mah K', 'Lo C', 'Nissim R', 'Zimmermann C']","['Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada. gary.rodin@uhn.ca.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 250 College Street, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5T 1R8, Canada. gary.rodin@uhn.ca.', 'Global Institute of Psychosocial, Palliative and End-of-Life Care (GIPPEC), University of Toronto and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada. gary.rodin@uhn.ca.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 7th Floor, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, 101 College Street, Suite 15-701, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, New York University Langone Medical Center, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 250 College Street, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5T 1R8, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Guelph-Humber, 207 Humber College Blvd., Toronto, Ontario, M9W 5L7, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 250 College Street, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5T 1R8, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 250 College Street, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5T 1R8, Canada.', 'Global Institute of Psychosocial, Palliative and End-of-Life Care (GIPPEC), University of Toronto and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, 610 University Avenue, 16th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, 190 Elizabeth Street, R.

This heightened interest was sparked by the seminal discoveries that (1) TET2 mutation is associated with development of hematological malignancies and that (2) the TET family of proteins is critical in promoting DNA demethylation and immune homeostasis. Since then, additional studies have begun to unravel the question ""Does TET2 have additional biological functions in the regulation of hematopoiesis?"" Here, we present a mini-review focused on the current understanding of TET2 in hematopoiesis, hematological malignancies, and immune regulation. Importantly, we highlight the critical function that TET2 facilitates in maintaining the stability of the genome. Based on our review of the literature, we provide a new hypothesis that loss of TET2 may lead to dysregulation of the DNA repair response, augment genome instability, and subsequently sensitize myeloid leukemia cells to PARP inhibitor treatment.","['Feng, Yimei', 'Li, Xiaoping', 'Cassady, Kaniel', 'Zou, Zhongmin', 'Zhang, Xi']","['Feng Y', 'Li X', 'Cassady K', 'Zou Z', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences of City of Hope, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Henry E.

The goal of this study was to develop an aggressive, trackable swine tumor cell line in mice for adoptive transfer into MHC matched swine. Two tumor cell lines, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) 13271 and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 14736, were previously established from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) miniature swine herd. PTLD 13271 is a swine B-cell lymphoma line originating from an animal that developed PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), while CML 14736 was generated from a swine that spontaneously developed CML. In order to select for aggressive tumor variants, both lines were passage into NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor gamma(-/-) (NSG) mice. Tumor induced mortality in mice injected with CML14736 was 68% while 100% of mice injected with PTLD 13271 succumbed to PTLD by day 70. Based on aggressiveness, PTLD 13271 was selected for further development and re-passage into NSG mice resulting in increased tumor burden and metastasis. Transduction of the PTLD 13271 cell line with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing lentivirus facilitated tumor tracking when re-passaged in mice. Utilizing a tolerance induction strategy, GFP+ tumors were injected into an MHC matched miniature swine and successfully followed via flow cytometry for 48 h in circulation, although tumor engraftment was not observed. In summary, we report the development of an aggressive GFP+B-cell lymphoma cell line which has the potential for facilitating development of a large animal tumor model.","['Schenk, Marian', 'Matar, Abraham J', 'Hanekamp, Isabel', 'Hawley, Robert J', 'Huang, Christene A', 'Duran-Struuck, Raimon']","['Schenk M', 'Matar AJ', 'Hanekamp I', 'Hawley RJ', 'Huang CA', 'Duran-Struuck R']","['Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, United States.', 'Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, United States.', 'Department of Surgery, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States.', 'Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, United States.', 'Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, United States.', 'Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, United States.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Colorado-Denver, Denver, CO, United States.', 'Center for Transplantation Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, United States.', 'Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190402,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6454861,['NOTNLM'],"['GFP+ tumor cell line', 'MHC defined miniature swine', 'large animal tumor model', 'swine lymphoma tumor cell line', 'transplantable swine tumors']",,2019/04/20 06:00,2019/04/20 06:01,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00209 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Apr 2;9:209. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00209. eCollection 2019.,,,,['K01 RR024466/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant Notch signaling in T-ALL occurs by NOTCH1 gain-of-function mutations and by NOTCH3 overexpression. Although NOTCH3 is assumed as a Notch1 target, machinery driving its transcription in T-ALL is undefined in leukemia subsets lacking Notch1 activation. Here, we found that the binding of the intracellular Notch3 domain, as well as of the activated Notch1 fragment, to the NOTCH3 gene locus led to the recruitment of the H3K27 modifiers JMJD3 and p300, and it was required to preserve transcriptional permissive/active H3K27 marks and to sustain NOTCH3 gene expression levels. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of JMJD3 by GSKJ4 treatment or of p300 by A-485 decreased the levels of expression of NOTCH3, NOTCH1 and of the Notch target genes DELTEX1 and c-Myc and abrogated cell viability in both Notch1- and Notch3-dependent T-cell contexts. Notably, re-introduction of exogenous Notch1, Notch3 as well as c-Myc partially rescued cells from anti-growth effects induced by either treatment. Overall our findings indicate JMJD3 and p300 as general Notch1 and Notch3 signaling co-activators in T-ALL and suggest further investigation on the potential therapeutic anti-leukemic efficacy of their enzymatic inhibition in Notch/c-Myc axis-related cancers and diseases.","['Tottone, Luca', 'Zhdanovskaya, Nadezda', 'Carmona Pestana, Alvaro', 'Zampieri, Michele', 'Simeoni, Fabrizio', 'Lazzari, Sara', 'Ruocco, Valeria', 'Pelullo, Maria', 'Caiafa, Paola', 'Felli, Maria Pia', 'Checquolo, Saula', 'Bellavia, Diana', 'Talora, Claudio', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Palermo, Rocco']","['Tottone L', 'Zhdanovskaya N', 'Carmona Pestana A', 'Zampieri M', 'Simeoni F', 'Lazzari S', 'Ruocco V', 'Pelullo M', 'Caiafa P', 'Felli MP', 'Checquolo S', 'Bellavia D', 'Talora C', 'Screpanti I', 'Palermo R']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnology, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190403,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6456714,['NOTNLM'],"['A-485', 'GSKJ4', 'JMJD3', 'Notch signaling', 'T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia', 'epigenetics', 'gene regulation', 'p300']",,2019/04/20 06:00,2019/04/20 06:01,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2019/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00198 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Apr 3;9:198. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00198. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If patients are diagnosed late or proper treatment is not applied, it may lead to harmful results. Several methods could be used for the diagnosis of leukemia; some of these include complete blood count (CBC), immunophenotyping, lymph node biopsy, chest X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, and ultrasound. Most of these methods are time-consuming and an application of more than one method will result as intended. This acknowledgment stresses the necessity of rapid and proper diagnosis for leukemia based on clinical and medical findings, inasmuch as it was decided to apply the artificial neural network (ANN) in order to identify a molecular biomarker for rapid leukemia diagnosis from blood samples and evaluate its potential for the detection of cancer. Materials & methods The independent sample t-test was applied with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, US) software on the microarray gene expression data of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE22529); 12 genes that had shown the highest differences (among parameters whose p-value was less than 0.01) were selected for further ANN analysis. The selected genes of 53 patients were applied to the training network algorithm, with a learning rate of 0.1. Results The results showed a high accuracy of the relationship between the output of the trained network and the test data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.991, which provides proof of the precision and the relationship with identifying Gelsolin as a potential biomarker for this research. Conclusions With these results, it was concluded that the training process of the ANN could be applied to rapid CLL diagnosis and finding a potential biomarker.

Clinical, immunophenotypic and genetic data is limited and it is uncertain if acute undifferentiated leukemia is biologically distinct from acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation, which also shows limited myeloid marker expression and has been reported to have a poor prognosis. We identified 92 cases initially diagnosed as acute undifferentiated leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation from pathology databases of nine academic institutions with available diagnostic flow cytometric data, cytogenetic findings, mutational and clinical data. Outcome analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier test for the 53 patients who received induction chemotherapy. Based on cytogenetic abnormalities (N = 30) or history of myelodysplastic syndrome (N = 2), 32 cases were re-classified as acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia related changes. The remaining 24 acute undifferentiated leukemia patients presented with similar age, blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, and blast percentage as the remaining 30 acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation patients. Compared to acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation, acute undifferentiated leukemia cases were characterized by more frequent mutations in PHF6 (5/15 vs 0/19, p = 0.016) and more frequent expression of TdT on blasts (p = 0.003) while acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation cases had more frequent CD123 expression (p = 0.042). Outcome data showed no difference in overall survival, relapse free survival, or rates of complete remission between acute undifferentiated leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation groups (p > 0.05). Acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes patients showed shorter survival when censoring for bone marrow transplant as compared to acute undifferentiated leukemia (p = 0.03) and acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation (p = 0.002). In this largest series to date, the acute undifferentiated leukemia group shows distinct characteristics from acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation, including more frequent PHF6 mutations and expression of TdT.","['Weinberg, Olga K', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Baraban, Ezra', 'Ok, Chi Young', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'Philip, John K S S', 'Kurzer, Jason H', 'Rogers, Heesun J', 'Nardi, Valentina', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Garcia, Jacqueline S', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Arber, Daniel A']","['Weinberg OK', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Baraban E', 'Ok CY', 'Geyer JT', 'Philip JKSS', 'Kurzer JH', 'Rogers HJ', 'Nardi V', 'Stone RM', 'Garcia JS', 'Hsi ED', 'Bagg A', 'Wang SA', 'Orazi A', 'Arber DA']","[""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

Although genetic alterations are difficult to target, the epigenome is intrinsically dynamic and readily offers new therapeutic strategies. Thus, identifying cancer-specific context-dependent targets and unraveling their biological function may open up new therapeutic perspectives. Here we identify bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) as a critical target required in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that BRD9 is overexpressed in AML cells including ex vivo primary blasts compared with CD34(+) cells. By targeting BRD9 expression in AML, we observed an alteration in proliferation and survival, ultimately resulting in the induction of apoptosis. Intriguingly, genome-wide profiling revealed that BRD9 binds enhancer regions in a cell type-specific manner, regulating cell type-related processes. We unveil a novel BRD9-sustained STAT5 pathway activation via regulation of SOCS3 expression levels. Our findings identify a previously undescribed BRD9-STAT5 axis as critical for leukemia maintenance, suggesting BRD9 as a potential therapeutic target.","['Del Gaudio, Nunzio', 'Di Costanzo, Antonella', 'Liu, Ning Qing', 'Conte, Lidio', 'Migliaccio, Antimo', 'Vermeulen, Michiel', 'Martens, Joost H A', 'Stunnenberg, Hendrik G', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Altucci, Lucia']","['Del Gaudio N', 'Di Costanzo A', 'Liu NQ', 'Conte L', 'Migliaccio A', 'Vermeulen M', 'Martens JHA', 'Stunnenberg HG', 'Nebbioso A', 'Altucci L']","['Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Vico L.

For example, BAP1 encodes a widely expressed deubiquitinase for histone H2A, but germline mutations are predominantly associated with uveal melanomas and mesotheliomas. We show that BAP1 inactivation causes apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, liver, and pancreatic tissue but not in melanocytes and mesothelial cells. Ubiquitin ligase RNF2, which silences genes by monoubiquitinating H2A, promoted apoptosis in BAP1-deficient cells by suppressing expression of the prosurvival genes Bcl2 and Mcl1. In contrast, BAP1 loss in melanocytes had little impact on expression of prosurvival genes, instead inducing Mitf Thus, BAP1 appears to modulate gene expression by countering H2A ubiquitination, but its loss only promotes tumorigenesis in cells that do not engage an RNF2-dependent apoptotic program.","['He, Meng', 'Chaurushiya, Mira S', 'Webster, Joshua D', 'Kummerfeld, Sarah', 'Reja, Rohit', 'Chaudhuri, Subhra', 'Chen, Ying-Jiun', 'Modrusan, Zora', 'Haley, Benjamin', 'Dugger, Debra L', 'Eastham-Anderson, Jeffrey', 'Lau, Shari', 'Dey, Anwesha', 'Caothien, Roger', 'Roose-Girma, Merone', 'Newton, Kim', 'Dixit, Vishva M']","['He M', 'Chaurushiya MS', 'Webster JD', 'Kummerfeld S', 'Reja R', 'Chaudhuri S', 'Chen YJ', 'Modrusan Z', 'Haley B', 'Dugger DL', 'Eastham-Anderson J', 'Lau S', 'Dey A', 'Caothien R', 'Roose-Girma M', 'Newton K', 'Dixit VM']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Physiological Chemistry, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Physiological Chemistry, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Discovery Oncology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Department of Physiological Chemistry, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. dixit@gene.com knewton@gene.com.', 'Department of Physiological Chemistry, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. dixit@gene.com knewton@gene.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190418,United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (BAP1 protein, human)', '0 (BAP1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Rnf2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'Uveal melanoma']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Melanocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mesothelioma/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Uveal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",,,,,2019/04/20 06:00,2019/05/17 06:00,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2018/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['364/6437/283 [pii]', '10.1126/science.aav4902 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2019 Apr 19;364(6437):283-285. doi: 10.1126/science.aav4902.

Therefore, it is important to monitor the dynamics of DNA repair in patient samples during the course of their treatment, in order to determine whether a particular drug regimen perturbs the DNA repair networks in cancer cells and provides therapeutic benefits. Quantitative measurement of proteins and/or their posttranslational modification(s) at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by laser microirradiation provides an applicable diagnostic approach to examine DNA repair and its dynamics. However, its use is restricted to adherent cell lines and not employed in suspension tumor cells that include the many hematological malignancies. METHODS: Here, we report the development of an assay to laser micro-irradiate and quantitatively measure DNA repair transactions at DSB sites in normal mononuclear cells and a variety of suspension leukemia and lymphoma cells including primary patient samples. FINDINGS: We show that global changes in the H3K27me3-ac switch modulated by inhibitors of Class I HDACs, EZH2 methyltransferase and (or) H3K27me3 demethylases do not reflect the dynamic changes in H3K27me3 that occur at double-strand break sites during DNA repair. INTERPRETATION: Results from our mechanistic studies and proof-of-principle data with patient samples together show the effectiveness of using the modified micro-laser-based assay to examine DNA repair directly in suspension cancer cells, and has important clinical implications by serving as a valuable tool to assess drug efficacies in hematological cancer cells that grow in suspension.","['Johnson, Danielle P', 'Spitz-Becker, Gabriella S', 'Chakraborti, Korak', 'Bhaskara, Srividya']","['Johnson DP', 'Spitz-Becker GS', 'Chakraborti K', 'Bhaskara S']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.

There were four gastric cancers (two poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, one signet ring cell carcinoma with adenocarcinoma, one histology not available), 3 leukemia (two acute myeloid leukemia, one aggressive NK cell leukemia), two ureteral cancers (histology not available), one malignant lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with translocation), one brain tumor (gliomatosis cerebri), and one cervical cancer (glassy cell carcinoma). Two gastric cancer patients had chronic gastric pain before conception. In two cases the physicians commented that they had avoided computed tomography and the brain biopsy needed for diagnosis because the patient was pregnant. At diagnosis, the clinical stages were II-IV in 9, and the performance status was 3-5 in 8. Indication for delivery was exacerbated maternal condition in 5, for treatment in 3, spontaneous labor in 3, and one patient declined elective delivery. Median [interquartile rage] (range) gestational weeks of delivery was 29 [24-30] (19-40). One cervical cancer patient had a radical hysterectomy and chemotherapy for 10 months. However, three leukemia and one gastric cancer patients had chemotherapy within 10 d because they deteriorated rapidly. Another seven cases did not have any treatment because of poor general condition or because they remained undiagnosed. In all cases, the Committee considered that there was no evidence of substandard care.Conclusion: In these cases, both the clinical stages and biological degree of malignancy were high. In two-thirds of cases, early termination of the pregnancy was indicated because of deteriorating maternal condition. Chemotherapy was not effective because of short available time for therapy and the advanced stage of the cancers when diagnosed. Encouraging women to have a thorough medical assessment before conception, and early diagnosis and treatment before pregnancy, appears to be the only practical way to reduce deaths from malignancy while a woman is pregnant.","['Katsuragi, Shinji', 'Tanaka, Hiroaki', 'Hasegawa, Junichi', 'Kanayama, Naohiro', 'Nakata, Masahiko', 'Murakoshi, Takeshi', 'Osato, Kazuhiro', 'Nakamura, Masamitsu', 'Tanaka, Kayo', 'Sekizawa, Akihiko', 'Ishiwata, Isamu', 'Yamamoto, Yoshiko', 'Wakasa, Tomoko', 'Takeuchi, Makoto', 'Yoshimatsu, Jun', 'Ikeda, Tomoaki']","['Katsuragi S', 'Tanaka H', 'Hasegawa J', 'Kanayama N', 'Nakata M', 'Murakoshi T', 'Osato K', 'Nakamura M', 'Tanaka K', 'Sekizawa A', 'Ishiwata I', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Wakasa T', 'Takeuchi M', 'Yoshimatsu J', 'Ikeda T']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sakakibara Heart Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St Marianna University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Toho University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Perinatology, Maternal and Perinatal Care Center, Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Ishiwata Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Health Policy, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Nara Hospital, Ikoma, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Izumi, Japan.', 'Department of Perinatology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190502,England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Maternal Death/etiology/prevention & control', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Pregnancy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Malignancy', 'maternal mortality', 'pregnancy', 'preventability']",,2019/04/20 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14767058.2019.1609930 [doi]'],ppublish,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2021 Feb;34(3):432-438. doi: 10.1080/14767058.2019.1609930.

In this way, CAR-T cells deliver their cytotoxic hit to cancer cells expressing targeted tumor antigens, bypassing the limitation of HLA-restricted antigen recognition. Expanding technologies have proposed a wide repertoire of soluble and cellular ""immunological weapons"" to kill tumor cells; they include monoclonal antibodies recognizing tumor associated antigens on tumor cells and immune cell checkpoint inhibition receptors expressed on tumor specific T cells. Moreover, a wide range of formidable chimeric antigen receptors diversely conceived to sustain quality, strength and duration of signals delivered by engineered T cells have been designed to specifically target tumor cells while minimize off-target toxicities. The latter immunological weapons have shown distinct efficacy and outstanding palmares in curing leukemia, but limited and durable effects for solid tumors. General experience with checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell immunotherapy has identified a series of variables, weaknesses and strengths, influencing the clinical outcome of the oncologic illness. These aspects will be shortly outlined with the intent of identifying the still ""missing strategy"" to combat epithelial cancers.","['Sacchetti, Benedetto', 'Botticelli, Andrea', 'Pierelli, Luca', 'Nuti, Marianna', 'Alimandi, Maurizio']","['Sacchetti B', 'Botticelli A', 'Pierelli L', 'Nuti M', 'Alimandi M']","['Department of Science, University Roma Tre, 00146 Rome, Italy. benedetto.sacchetti@uniroma3.it.', 'Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy. andrea.botticelli@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy. luca.pierelli@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy. marianna.nuti@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy. maurizio.alimandi@uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190417,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Escape']",PMC6514830,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T', 'CD16-CR', 'chimeric antigen receptors', 'immunotherapy', 'solid tumors', 'universal CAR']",,2019/04/20 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2019/04/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20081903 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20081903 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Apr 17;20(8). pii: ijms20081903. doi: 10.3390/ijms20081903.,,,,['RG 1133/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, molecular mechanisms of the malignant transformation of these peripheral tissues induced by obesity remain unclear. Adipose tissue secretes factors with hormone-like functions, the adipokines, and is therefore categorized as an endocrine organ. Current research demonstrates the ability of adipose tissue to alter DNA methylation and gene expression in peripheral tissues, probably affecting microRNA (miR) expression. METHODS: Literature was analyzed for adipokine-regulated miRs. Many of these adipokine upregulated or downregulated miRs exert either oncogenic or anti-tumoral potential. RESULTS: The three selected and analyzed adipokines, adiponectin, leptin, and resistin, induce more strongly oncogenic miRs and simultaneously reduce anti-tumoral miRs than vice versa. This effect is not only true for the pure number of regulated miRs, it is also the case by consideration of the abundance of the respective miR expression based on actual data sets derived from next-generation sequencing. CONCLUSION: The link of obesity and cancer is analyzed under the aspect of adipokine-regulated miRs. At the same time the impact of miR abundance is considered as a regulatory variable. This context offers new strategies for tumor therapy and diagnostics.","['Jasinski-Bergner, Simon', 'Kielstein, Heike']","['Jasinski-Bergner S', 'Kielstein H']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany, simon.jasinski@uk-halle.de.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190418,Switzerland,Obes Facts,Obesity facts,101469429,"['0 (Adipokines)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adipokines/*pharmacology', 'Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leptin/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/drug effects/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Obesity/complications/metabolism', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects/genetics']",PMC6547259,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adipokines', '*Cancer', '*MicroRNA', '*Obesity']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['000496625 [pii]', '10.1159/000496625 [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Facts. 2019;12(2):211-225. doi: 10.1159/000496625.

HIV widely spread in Spain during the 80 s through injection drug use and sex, and nowadays HIV rates in Spain account for one of the largest in Europe. In contrast, HTLV-1 is not endemic in Spain, despite hosting huge numbers of migrants from highly endemic regions. Herein, we report the rate and main features of the HIV-HTLV co-infected population in Spain. METHODS: A national registry exists in Spain for HTLV since year 1989. Data from standardized case report forms and one centralized lab repository were reviewed, especially for the subset with HTLV-HIV co-infection. RESULTS: Up to December 2018, a total of 369 individuals with HTLV-1 had been diagnosed in Spain. 64% of the population were females, and Latin American individuals accounted for 64.5%. Classical HTLV-associated illnesses were found in 12.7% (myelopathy) and 7.6% (leukemia). HIV coinfection was found in 12 (3.2%). Of those, 3 patients (25%) were female and 39 (75%) were of non-Spanish origin. All but two harbored HIV-1 subtype B, being non-B variants found in the two West Africans. Exposure had been sexual in most cases, being 4 homosexual men. Seven HTLV-HIV co-infected patients had developed AIDS and two had developed myelopathy. There was no evidence for increased HTLV-1 clinical pathogenicity due to HIV coinfection. CONCLUSION: HIV coinfection is infrequent (<5%) among HTLV-1 carriers in Spain. More than half of co-infected patients come from Latin America. Sexual contact is the most frequent risk behavior, being MSM one third of cases. Late diagnosis explains the high rate (9/12) of clinical manifestations in our HIV-HTLV co-infected population.","['de Mendoza, Carmen', 'Caballero, Estrella', 'Aguilera, Antonio', 'Benito, Rafael', 'Macia, Dolores', 'Garcia-Costa, Juan', 'Soriano, Vicente']","['de Mendoza C', 'Caballero E', 'Aguilera A', 'Benito R', 'Macia D', 'Garcia-Costa J', 'Soriano V']","['Puerta de Hierro Research Institute & University Hospital, Madrid, Spain; Microbiology Department, CEU-San Pablo University, Madrid, Spain.', ""Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario, Santiago, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Hospital Son Llatzer, Mallorca, Spain.', 'Complejo Hospitalario Universitario, Orense, Spain.', 'UNIR Health Sciences School & Medical Center, Madrid, Spain.

The main objective of our study was to evaluate the frequency of hematologic and solid malignancies in the family history of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by using a systemic pedigree interview. The family history was taken of 50 patients between 24 and 80 years. FINDINGS: 8/50 (16%) patients with AML had family members with hematologic malignancies. 2/50 (4%) patients had family members of first degree with hematologic malignancies. Furthermore in 42/50 (84%) of AML patients solid malignancies were documented in family members of any degree and in 31/50 (62%) in family members of first degree. The most commonly occurring malignancies in our cohort were breast and colorectal cancer. We analyzed the pedigrees for cancer syndromes that can be associated with acute leukemia like Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Lynch syndrome and hereditary breast cancer. 2/50 (4%) patients fulfilled the criteria for familial breast and ovarian cancer from the German consortium and 1/50 (2%) patients fulfilled the Bethesda Guidelines criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. No pedigree met the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In 29 cases we compared the patient history obtained in the routine work-up with our data. The accuracy of the obtained family history was 23%, outlining that in the clinical routine information about family histories often escapes notice. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that though generally considered a sporadic disease, the presence of hematologic and solid malignancies in the family history of AML patients is relatively high. One should keep in mind that cancer syndromes like hereditary breast cancer are associated with a higher incidence of leukemia. These data are relevant in the context of family donor search for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, genetic counseling and testing as well as cancer prevention.","['Sandner, Anne-Sophie', 'Weggel, Ramona', 'Mehraein, Yasmin', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Sandner AS', 'Weggel R', 'Mehraein Y', 'Schneider S', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich-Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich-Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich-Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich-Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich-Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190418,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', '*Medical History Taking', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/epidemiology/genetics', '*Pedigree']",PMC6472770,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/04/19 06:00,2020/01/08 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0215453 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-27949 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Apr 18;14(4):e0215453. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0215453. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2465-3028'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The lentiviral particles containing GFP and mLIF and puromycin-resistance gene were constructed and transduced into STO cell lines. The cell lines stably expressing GFP and mLIF genes were screened out. The expression level of the inserted exogenous LIF gene was tested by Western blot and ELISA. The STO-GFP-mLIF cells were treated with different concentrations of mitomycin C (5, 10, 15, 20 microg/ml) for different time (1.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5 hours) to prepare feeder layers and the cell proliferation level on feeder layer was observed. Mouse embryonic stem cells were cultured on mitomycin C-treated feeder layer and the growth of cell colonies was observed. RESULTS: The expression level of LIF protein in STO-GFP-mLIF cells was up-regulated, as compared with STO cells (P0.05). It was confirmed that the optimal concentration and time for inhibiting the proliferetion of STO-GFP-mLIF cells by mitomycin C were 10 microg/ml and 3 hours respectively. The observation also found that the embryonic stem cells could develop into typic ""birdnest"" shaped stem cell colony on mitomycin C-treated feeder layer. CONCLUSION: The stable STO cell lines effectively expressing green fluorescent protein and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor have been established successfully, which can maintain the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells.","['Liu, Chuan-Miao', 'Li, Hong-Jun', 'Yang, Tian-Hua', 'Yang, Xiao-Huai', 'Li, Zheng-Hong', 'Li, Yong-Hai']","['Liu CM', 'Li HJ', 'Yang TH', 'Yang XH', 'Li ZH', 'Li YH']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233004, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Urinary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, Anhui Province, China .com E-mail: lizhbbmc@163.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, Anhui Province, China E-mail: bbmcexperiment@gmail.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Separation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Feeder Cells', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0606-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn1009-2137.2019.02.048 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):606-612. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn1009-2137.2019.02.048.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, WanFang Data and CNKI databases were searched to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of decitabine combined with CAG regimen for intermediate or high risk MDS and AML from inception to March, 2018. The quality of each RCT was evaluated by the Cochrane collaboration s tool for assessing the risk of bias.Then, the data were analyzed by using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, containing 1 557 patients with intermediate or high-risk MDS and AML, of whom 594 were AML patients and 590 were MDS patients. The patients treated with the DCAG regimen were enrolled in DCAG group, and the patients treated with single-agent decitabine or CAG regimen were enrolled in control group. RESULTS: The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with other therapies, the complete remission rate of DCAG regimen in patients with intermediate or high-risk MDS and AML was high (RR=1.6395% CI=1.43-1.85P0.000 01), and the overall response rate was also high (RR=1. 3595% CI=1.24-1.46P0.000 01); Subgroup analysis results showed that DCAG regimen was better than CAG regimen in the complete remission rate (RR=1.7195% CI=1.49-1.97P0.000 01), and slightly better than single-agent decitabine group (RR=1.4395% CI=1.08-1.91P=0.01). In terms of adverse reactions, there was no statistically significant difference in the rates of myelosuppression, pulmonary infection, gastrointestinal reactions, and bleeding events between the 2 groups (P0.05). CONCLUSION: DCAG regimen has significant efficacy in the treatment of intermediate or high-risk MDS and AML, and is superior to CAG regimen and single-agent dicitabine regimen. As compared with control group, there was no significant difference in adverse events. Due to limited quantity and quality of the included studies, more high quality studies are needed to verify above mentioned conclusion.","['Zhang, Jing-Ling', 'Cao, Ying-Ping', 'Li, Jing-Gang']","['Zhang JL', 'Cao YP', 'Li JG']","['Department of Clinical Laboratorial Examination, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratorial Examination, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China,E-mail: caoyingping@aliyun.com.', 'Fujian Institute of HematologyFujian Provincial Key Laboratory on HematologyFujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine', 'Decitabine', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0494-10 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):494-503. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty patients with ALL were selected in our hospital from April 2017 to April 2018, and 60 healthy persons subjected to physical examination were selected as control. The venous blood was taken from the subjects, and then the mononuclear cells were separated. The ROCK1 gene expression level in the samples was detected by RT-PCR, and the expression level of ROCK1 protein was detected by Western blot. The correlation between ROCK1 gene expression and clinical characteristics of ALL patients was analyzed by using statistical methots. RESULTS: The RT-PCR showed that the relative expression level of ROCK1 gene in ALL patients was 1.37 (1.28-1.46), which was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). Western blot showed that the protein expression level of ROCK1 in ALL patients was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). The expression level of ROCK1 gene correlated with age, WBC count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, peripheral blood immature cell count, and risk stratification of ALL patients (P<0.05). The expression level of ROCK1 gene did not correlate with sex, hemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet count and immunophenotype in ALL patients (P>0.05). The standard risk ratio of B-ALL and T-ALL patients with low ROCK1 expression was significantly higher than that in patients with high ROCK1 expression (P<0.05). The high risk ratio of B-ALL and T-ALL patients with low ROCK1 expression was significantly lower than those with high ROCK1 expression (P<0.05). The ratio of CR in the group with low ROCK1 expression patients was significantly higher than that in patients with high ROCK1 expression (P<0.05). The Relapse rate of the group with low ROCK1 expression was significantly lower than that of the group with high ROCK1 expression (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that OS and DFS in ALL patients with low ROCK1 expression were superior to those in ALL patients with high ROCK1 expression (P<0.05). Multiple factor Cox regression analysis showed that age and ROCK1 gene were independent influencing factors for OS (P<0.05); leukocyte count and ROCK1 gene were independent influencing factors for DFS (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression level of ROCK1 gene in ALL patients is high, which may stimulate the genesis of ALL, and the down-regulation of ROCK1 gene expression may help improve the therapeutic effect for ALL patients.","['He, Wen-Hua']",['He WH'],"['Department of Hematology, Suining Central Hospital of Sichuan, Suining 629000, Sichuan Province, China,E-mailhewenhua1972@126.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (ROCK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*metabolism']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0415-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):415-420. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 40 elderly patients with relapsed/refractory AML 69-85 years old admitted to our hospital from January 2014 to August 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. 40 patients were divided into combination therapy group and CAG group according to different treatment methods. 20 patients of the combination therepy group were treated with decitabine combined with low-dose CAG decitabine, 15 mg/m(2), d 1; aclarithromycin, 10 mg/m(2), d 3-6; Cytidine, 10 mg/m(2), d 1-14; recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor G-CSF for injection, 200 mug/m(2).d, d 1-14. 20 patients of CAG group were treated by the standard CAG protocol acralmycin 20 mg/m(2), d 1-4; cytarabine for injection, 15 mg/m(2), d 1-14; G-CSF 400 mug/m(2).d, d 1-14. One course of treatment lasted for 2 weeks, after 2 courses of continuous medication, the complete remission rate CR, overall remission rate ORR, overall survival OS, 1-year survival rate, hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets improvement, and incidence of adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: In combination therapy group the CR was 55.00% 11/20, OR was 85.00% 17/20, but in the CAG group CR was 30.00% 6/20, and OR was 50.00% 10/20. Till to February 2018, out of 40 patients 17 survived, 20 died, and 3 failed to be followed-up. The median follow-up time was 12 2 to 35 months; the median survival time in the comtination therapy group was 13 2-35 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 70.00%, and the median survival time of the CAG group was 10 2-31 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 50.00%, without staistical significance between the 2 groups P>0.05. After treatment, the WBC and Plt counts in the combination therapy group were higher than those in the CAG group, but the Hb level was lower than that in the CAG group with statistically significant difference P<0.05. In the combination therapy group, the incidence of lung infection, nausea and vomiting was higher than that of the CAG group 65.00% vs 25.00%, 50.00% vs 20.00%, with statistically significant difference P<0.05. CONCLUSION: Decitabine combined with low-dose CAG regimen is effective for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML in the elderly. Compared with the standard CAG regimen, the long-term efficacy of this regimen is not different significantly, but its adverse reactions are increase, thus the preventive treatment should be given in time.","['Chen, Dong', 'Lu, Ying', 'Yan, Ren-Zh', 'Ye, Pei-Pei', 'Zhang, Yu-Sheng', 'Ma, Jun-Xia']","['Chen D', 'Lu Y', 'Yan RZ', 'Ye PP', 'Zhang YS', 'Ma JX']","['Department of Hematology, Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315105, Zhejiang Province, China,E-mail: zjyzyycd@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315105, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315105, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315105, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315105, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Yinzhou Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315105, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0390-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):390-395. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The effects of different concentration of mangiferin on proliferation of MV4-11 cells were detected by CCK8 method. Apoptosis, cell cycle and FLT3 transmembrane protein expression were detected by flow cytometry. FLT3 mRNA expression was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . RESULTS: Mangiferin obviously inhibited MV4-11 proliferation in a concentration and time dependent manner (48 hr=0.92272 hr=0.95996 hr=0.973). The ratio of G0/G1 phase in cell cycle increased with the enhancement of concentration of mangiferin in MV4-11 cells for 48 h, and the ratio of S phase decreased with enhasment of concentration. The increase of apoptosis was more obvious. The expression of FLT3 transmembrane protein significantly decreased after the actior of IC50 concentration of mangiferin in MV4-11 cells for 48 h. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression of FLT3 mRNA significantly decreased after treatment of MN4-11 cells with mangiferin (P0.05). CONCLUSION: Mangiferin inhibits MV4-11 cell proliferation, arrests cell cycle progression and promotes apoptosis, which may be related with the inhibition of FLT3 activity by mangiferin and the subsequent signaling pathways involved in apoptosis and proliferation of cells.","['Xiao, Liang', 'Peng, Zhi-Gang', 'Luo, Bin', 'Yao, Yi-Bin']","['Xiao L', 'Peng ZG', 'Luo B', 'Yao YB']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China,E-mail: Drpzg001@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Xanthones)', '1M84LD0UMD (mangiferin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation', 'Xanthones', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0385-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):385-389. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy-three patients with newly diagnosed adult NPM1(+)AML were selected. The mutations of 22 genes were detected by second generation sequencing and 43 fusion genes of AML were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox multivariate regression analysis were used to study the prognostic factors. RESULTS: A total of 74 NPM1 site mutations were detected in 73 patients with NPM1(+)AML. The incidence rates were 92.0% L287fs, 2.7% Q289fs and W288fs, 1.4% L258fs and Q289H, among which 1 patient had 2 NPM1 mutations; the different mutation sites had no effect on the prognosis of NPM1(+)AML. The median value of NPM1 variant allele frequency (VAF) was 35.4% (1.8%-56.6%). Based on the uppermost quartile of 38.4%, the patients were classified as NPM1 VAF>38.4% (NPM1(high)AML) and NPM1 VAF</=38.4% (NPM1(low)AML). Compared with NPM1(low)AML, the early mortality rate was statistically significantly higher (33.3% vs 7.3%, P<0.05), and median EFS (148 d95%CI 58-238 d vs 372 d95%CI 264-480 d) (P<0.01) and median OS (179 d 95%CI 6-352 d vs 444 d) (P<0.01) were significantly shorter in NPM1(high) AML. A total of 126 accompanying gene mutation sites were detected in 87.7% of patients with NPM1(+)AML. The patients with NRAS gene mutation displayed a higher rate of complete remission (100% vs 58%) (P<0.05) and longer median OS (not reached to 320 d, 95%CI 150-490 d) (P<0.05). The 43 fusion genes were examined in 65 out of 73 cases of NPM1(+)AML, and in all the patients the fusion gene test was negative.

METHODS: Ten young AML patients of low and middle risk who did not want to accept allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantationallo-HSCTand underwent auto-PBHSCT in CR1 during May 2013 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. From 3 months after auto-PBHSCT, the maintenance therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-2 combined with histamine dihydrochloride was performed for these patients in the next 18 months. The side effects of the conditioning regimen, hematopoietic recovery time, transplant-related mortality (TRM) within 100 days and 1 year after auto-PBHSCT, relapse rate, leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate at 2 years and 3 years, overall survival (OS) were evaluated at 3 years and 4 years. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal side effects were the major non-hematologic toxicity reaction, among which, 7 cases relatively mild and 3 cases displayed moderate, just one case suffered from severe reaction. In 4 cases, the mild liver damage occurred, but no hemorrhagic cystitis occurred. All the patients experienced different kinds of infection, including 5 cases of bloodstream infection, 2 cases of gastrointestinal infection, 3 cases of crissum infection and 2 cases of oral infection. The myeloablative effect occurred in all ten patients. The median times for absolute neutrophil count (ANC)<0.5x10(9)/L and for platelet count <20.0x10(9)/L were 1.5 (0-3) days and 3 (2-5) days after transplantation, respectively. The patients achieved ANC>0.5x10(9)/L at 10 to 19 days, median was 13 days after auto-PBHSCT. The patients achieved platelet count >20x10(9)/L at 10 to 72 days; median was 32 days after auto-PBHSCT. The TRM within 100 days and 1 year after transplantation was 0. The relapse occurred in 2 cases at 6 and 14 months after auto-PBHSCT raspectively. The median follow-up time was 48.1 months, and the median survival time was 54.7 months after transplantation. The 2-year and 3-year LFS were 100% (10 cases) and 80% (8 cases), respectively. The 3-year and 4-year OS were 80% (8 cases) and 70% (7 cases), respectively. CONCLUSION: Modified BU/CY as conditioning regimen for auto-PBHSCT can achieve the myeloablative effect without raising TRM and obtain good LFS and OS. As for young AML patients without high risk, it is a valuable therapeutic option, especially for those lacking the chance of allo-HSCT.","['Zhang, Jian-Hua', 'Zhang, Ao-Li', 'Dong, Chun-Xia', 'Qin, Xiao-Qi', 'Zhang, Rui-Juan', 'Ge, Xiao-Yan', 'Kang, Jian-Min', 'Hou, Yan-Fei', 'Zhang, Yao-Fang', 'Guo, Jian-Li', 'Yang, Lin-Hua']","['Zhang JH', 'Zhang AL', 'Dong CX', 'Qin XQ', 'Zhang RJ', 'Ge XY', 'Kang JM', 'Hou YF', 'Zhang YF', 'Guo JL', 'Yang LH']","['Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Second Clinical College, Shanxi Metical University; Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi Province, China,E-mail: yanglh5282@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0360-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):360-364. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The morphological, immunological, cytogenetic, and molecular features of 33 in patients with Ph(+) MPAL were retrospectively analyzed in our center from June 2002 to June 2016 according to the scoring proposal of European Group for the Classification of Acute Leukemia(EGIL )1998 and WHO 2008 criteria. All the cases were either treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) induction regimen or combined chemotherapy regimens for both acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia,part of which also received tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI) and 5 cases underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after complete remission. RESULTS: Ph(+) MPAL occurred predominantly in male patients (ratio of M/F was 1.75ratio1), and a high WBC counts at diagnosis; the WBC count was higher than 30x10(9)/L in 25 patients( 75.8% ) and appeared higher than 100 x10(9)/L in 13 patients ( 39.4%). Among all the 33 Ph(+)MPAL patients, 32 (97.0%) had a myeloid / B-lymphoid (M/B) phenotype and 1 case(3.0%) had a myeloid/ B-lymphoid/ T-lymphoid/ (M/B/T) phenotype. There was no patients displayed myeloid / T-lymphoid (M/T) or B-lymphoid/ T-lymphoid/ (B/T) phenotype. 19 of all cases(57.6%) met the diagnosis criteria of Ph(+)MPAL based on EGIL 1998 criteria, while the remaining 14 cases can be diagnosed as Ph(+) MPAL by WHO 2008 classification,but excluded as Ph(+)MAPL by EGIL 1998.Karyotype analysis was successfully performed in 31 cases, and out of them 13 (41.9%) had a sole Ph chromosome, 10 (32.3%) had additional chromosome aberration and Ph chromosome was not found in 8 cases (25.8%) .In 31 patients the fusion gene BCR/ABL (P190P210) was detected,including 17 (54.8%) cases with the p190 BCR/ABL transcript, 8 (25.8%) cases with the p210 BCR/ABL transcript, 4 (12.9%) expressing both transcripts and 2 (6.5%) without any one of these 2 transcripts. 24 out of 33 patients (77.4%) achieved complete remission after induction therapy. The median time achieving CR was 43(26-98)days. The CR rate of patients treated with and without imatinib after the first inducion treatment was 81.3% and 46.7%,respectively (P(+)0.05). Within the 17 patients treated with imatinib at induction stage2 of which became BCR/ABLnegativeAt consolidation chemotherapy stage, 9 out of 16 patients became BCR/ABL negative, including 3 patients already subjected to HSCT. The median time reached to BCR/ABL negative was 2.871.13-9.20months. CONCLUSION: Ph(+) MPAL is more common in male, and inclined to high WBC counts at diagnosis. Myeloid/B lymphoid phenotype is more common, and the prognosis of patients with Ph(+)MPAL is poor. Imatinib and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may improve survival of patients with Ph(+)MPAL.","['Jia, Yan-Nan', 'Li, Yan', 'Gong, Xiao-Yuan', 'Liu, Kai-Qi', 'Ye, Lei', 'Wang, Hui-Jun', 'Li, Qing-Hua', 'Li, Cheng-Wen', 'Wang, Ying', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang', 'Mi, Ying-Chang']","['Jia YN', 'Li Y', 'Gong XY', 'Liu KQ', 'Ye L', 'Wang HJ', 'Li QH', 'Li CW', 'Wang Y', 'Wang JX', 'Mi YC']","['Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China.', 'Blood Diseases Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020 China,E-mail:miyingch@126.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0354-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):354-359. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was applied to detect the expression level of E-cadherin in bone marrow samples from 135 child patients diagnosed as AL, and its relevance with clinical indicators was statistically analyzed. The expression levels of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and Akt/p-Akt were detected by using Western blot. The bone marrow samples from 22 children with non-malignant hematological diseases were used as controls. RESULTS: The expression level of E-cadherin significantly decreased in newly diagnosed patients with all 3 types of AL as compared with bone marrow samples from control group (P<0.01). In B-ALL group, compared with standard risk group, E-cadherin expression level significantly decreased in intermediate risk group (P<0.05). Moreover,the expression level of E-cadherin mRNA was also reduced in splenomegaly group (P<0.01). However, the correlation of E-cadherin level with clinical characteristics was not found in T-ALL and AML (P>0.05). The expression level of E-cadherin in the patients from Common-B-ALL group was higher than B-ALL patients with other immunophenotypes (P<0.01), while no significant difference was found among patients grouped by FAB classification. By the correlation analysis of measured data, lower E-cadherin expression level was found to be related with high WBC count and serum lactic dehydrogenase level (LDH) (r=-0.419, r=-0.269), but with low blood platelet count in B-ALL (r=0.335). In T-ALL, expression of E-cadherin was found to be negatively correlated with LDH and percentage of immature cells in the bone marrow (r=-0.567, r=-0.557). In addition, the lower expression of E-cadherin was also found to be related with WBC count and percentage of immature cells in the bone marrow in newly diagnosed AML patients (r=-0.368, r=-0.391). Compared with control group, the expression of E-cadherin was down-regulated significantly (P<0.01), while beta-catenin, Akt significantly was up-regulated in 3 types of AL patients (P<0.01). The expression of p-Akt and p-Akt/Akt was up-regulated significantly in T-ALL (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Lower expression of E-cadherin is related factor of unfavourable prognosis in children with acute leukemia. The expression deficiency or down-regulation of E-cadherin may activate Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/ Akt signaling pathways to promote the genesis and progress of haematological malignancies, thus resulting in a series of malignant biological behaviors in cells. E-cadherin may be a new prognostic indicator for pediatric acute leukemia, thus to guide individualized hemotherapy.","['Bao, Bin-Xia', 'An, Xi-Zhou', 'Li, Peng-Fei', 'Li, Yong-Jing', 'Cui, Ying-Hui', 'Tang, Xue', 'Liu, Qi-Hui', 'Hu, Yan-Ni', 'Liu, Wei', 'Liang, Shao-Yan', 'Yu, Jie']","['Bao BX', 'An XZ', 'Li PF', 'Li YJ', 'Cui YH', 'Tang X', 'Liu QH', 'Hu YN', 'Liu W', 'Liang SY', 'Yu J']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Childhrens Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China,E-mail: 1808106657@qq.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (Cadherins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cadherins', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0339-09 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):339-347. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: Changes of T lymphocyte subsets, B lymphocytes and NK cells in the patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia are significant, thus the detection of T lymphocyte cell subsets, B lymphocytes and NK cells can provide some evidences. for evaluation of the disease severity, curative efficiency and prognosis of patients with acute leukemia.","['Cheng, Juan', 'Ma, Hai-Zhen', 'Zhang, Hao']","['Cheng J', 'Ma HZ', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Laznhou 730000, Gansu Province, China,E-mail: chenggu029@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Laznhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Laznhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0327-04 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):327-330. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Transplantation experiments were performed to establish non-radiated MLL-AF9 AML model; the half-bone immunofluorescence staining and tile-scan imaging of two-photon confocal microscopy were used to obtain the data of 3 main bone marrow niche cells; flow cytometry analysis was performed to characterize leukemia cells in different anatomical sites. RESULTS: In the early stage of MLL-AF9 AML, the proportion of leukemia cells in the metaphysis of the femur was significantly higher than that in the diaphysis. The detection of apoptosis and proliferation rate of leukemia cells showed that the percentage of leukemia cells in metaphysis significantly decreased, and the proliferation (S/G2/M phase) was also significantly more active. These different features of leukemia cells may relate with different bone marrow microenvironment. The image data of 3 major components of bone marrow niche (endothelial cells, endosteum, megakaryocytes) showed different distribution of blood vessels in metaphysis and diaphysis. Furtherly comparing the spatial distance between leukemia cells and endothelial cells, endosteum, megakaryocytes indicated that leukemia cells are closer to the blood vessels, suggesting the important role of blood vessels in the development of leukemia. Glucose uptake assays and intracellular ROS detection showed that the supportive role of blood vessels for leukemia cells did not related with nutrient metabolism pathway. CONCLUSION: The vascular niche plays an important role in the development of leukemia, and does not relate with the transport of nutrients and the elimination of metabolic waste, instead, which may relate with perivascular cytokines or other vascular functions.","['Zhao, Mei', 'Gong, Yue-Min', 'Yang, Wan-Zhu', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Cheng, Tao']","['Zhao M', 'Gong YM', 'Yang WZ', 'Cheng H', 'Cheng T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.E-mail: chenghui@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.E-mail: chengtao@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', '*Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0318-09 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):318-326. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The gene expression profiling chip related with BM-MSCs in AML patients in our hospital and the gene chip GSE84881 selected from NCBI database GEO were used for data analysis and exploration. The DAVID analysis software was used to perform gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the differentially expressed genes related with aging of BM-MSCs in AML patients were identified. Bone marrow samples were collected and MSCs were amplified in vitro, and RT-PCR was used to verify the differentially expressed genes, which should be further identified with senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and MTT cell proliferation assays. RESULTS: A total of 247 differentially expressed genes were screened out by bioinformatics methods, including genes of 132 up-regulated expression and 115 down-regulated expression. Six differentially expressed genes related with aging of BM-MSCs in AML patients were screened out, including the genes of up-regulated expression, COL3A1 (P<0.05), CRYAB (P<0.01), DCN (P<0.05), and the genes of down-regulated expression, including CCL2 (P<0.05), CTSC (P<0.01) and IL6 (P<0.05). These 6 differentially expressed genes were consistent with data from chip assays, and which was significantly correlated with aging of BM-MSCs in AML patients. Meanwhile, the positive rate of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining in BM-MSCs of AML patients was significantly different from that of healthy donors (P<0.01). MTT cell proliferation assay showed that BM-MSCs in AML patients had proliferative ability lower than the healthy donors' BM-MSCs. CONCLUSION: The data here suggest novel clues for the clinical research and treatment of BM-MSCs aging in AML patients.","['Liu, Shi-Qi', 'Cheng, Jing-Ying', 'Jiang, Ya-Jing', 'Li, Ying', 'Li, Qing-Hua', 'Pang, Tian-Xiang']","['Liu SQ', 'Cheng JY', 'Jiang YJ', 'Li Y', 'Li QH', 'Pang TX']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China,E-mail: pang@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Computational Biology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/05/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)02-0311-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr;27(2):311-317. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.02.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of proinflammatory cytokines, namely, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-18, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 on VCZ trough concentration (VCZ-Cmin ) in Chinese patients with different forms of hematologic disorders. A total of 250 plasma samples from 113 patients were analyzed for VCZ-Cmin and proinflammatory cytokines using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods, respectively. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained from hospital records. VCZ-Cmin was significantly correlated with IL-18 in acute myeloid leukemia (r = 0.456; P < .0001), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r = 0.317; P = .019), and chronic myeloid leukemia (r = 0.737; P = .004) while VCZ-Cmin and TGF-beta1 were correlated (r = 0.436; P < .001) in acute myeloid leukemia patients only. VCZ-Cmin at different concentration range showed significant inhibitory effect of IL-6. A backward multiple linear regression model revealed patient age (coefficient [beta] = 0.025; P = .04), gamma-glutamyl transferase (beta = 0.003; P = .023), IL-6 (beta = -0.001; P = .024), proton pump inhibitor coadministration (beta = 1.518; P = .002), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism as predictors of VCZ-Cmin ; however, these factors explained only 29% of VCZ-Cmin variation. In conclusion, IL-18 and TGF-beta1 have correlation with VCZ-Cmin in Chinese patients with leukemia. Apparently, VCZ may have an inhibitory effect on IL-6 levels. Furthermore, patient age, gamma-glutamyl transferase, IL-6, PPI coadministration, and cytochrome P450 2C19 polymormorphism partially predicted the VCZ-Cmin . Therapeutic drug monitoring of VCZ in Chinese patients is highly encouraged.","['Mafuru, Magesa', 'Wu, Sanlan', 'He, Sijie', 'Lu, Xuan', 'Huang, Jiangeng', 'Jiang, Hongliang']","['Mafuru M', 'Wu S', 'He S', 'Lu X', 'Huang J', 'Jiang H']","['School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190418,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*blood/*therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Voriconazole/*blood/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CYP-450 downregulation', '*hematologic disorders', '*inflammation', '*proinflammatory cytokines', '*voriconazole-Cmin']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.1422 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Oct;59(10):1340-1350. doi: 10.1002/jcph.1422.

Cytogenetics is a well-established prognostic factor. Recent discovery of molecular mutations has gained momentum with some being potential therapeutic targets. FLT3 mutation seen in approximately one third of the cytogenetically normal AML confers high risk of relapse and poor survival. Quizartinib is the first drug developed specifically as a FLT3 inhibitor. It has confirmed safety and efficacy in phase I and II clinical trials and has shown survival benefit over conventional chemotherapy in patients with FLT3 ITD mutated relapsed/refractory AML. Despite such promise, disease relapses are still seen. Besides the complex nature of AML itself, resistance mechanisms blunting the efficacy of quizartinib have been identified and are being investigated including TKD mutations, alternate signaling pathways and the bone marrow microenvironment. Strategies using combination of quizartinib with other TKIs/agents like crenolinib, PIM kinase, and MEK inhibitors should be further explored.","['Naqvi, Kiran', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Naqvi K', 'Ravandi F']","['a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190418,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzothiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Studies as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Development', 'Drug Discovery', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* inhibitors', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*quizartinib']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/08/12 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1602263 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Aug;60(8):1866-1876. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1602263.

Appropriate awareness and safety precautions concerning fluoroscopy are necessary and likely should be a focus during training. We sought to assess radiation safety knowledge among Urology residents in the United States. Methods: A 19-question survey was constructed to assess radiation safety training, knowledge, behavior, and attitudes. The survey was sent through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) to all Urology program directors and coordinators in the United States with a request to distribute to their residents. The survey was closed after 3 weeks. Results: One hundred thirty-six urology trainees responded during the study period. Thirteen percent learned fluoroscopic radiation safety formally, 46% informally, 35% both informally and formally, and 6% no education. Forty-six percent reported radiation safety being part of their curriculum. When asked about directional X-ray travel and exposure, only 54% answered correctly. Regarding conditions related to radiation exposure, 94% believe infertility is potentially related, 83% cataracts, 93% leukemia and lymphoma, 57% central nervous system tumors, 77% birth defects, and 4% diabetes. Regarding protection, 9% wear lead-lined glasses, 30% dosimeters, 99% thyroid shields, 0% lead gloves, 97% lead apron, 26% lead shield, and 0% nothing. Regarding fluoroscopy machine settings, 7% knew the machine used was set to continuous, 73% pulse, and 21% were unsure. Sixty-six percent had awareness of the directional travel of the machine routinely used. Regarding safety techniques, 99% knew decreasing time and 100% knew wearing protective materials decrease exposure. However, when asked about distance and exposure, 55% answered incorrectly. Most respondents believe radiation safety is important (89%) and desire more formal education (64%). Conclusions: Trainees lack sufficient knowledge in several key areas regarding radiation safety. Formal education may be considered during training and is desired by trainees. This education is likely needed to ensure trainees learn methods to keep them safe during their career.","['Harris, Andrew M', 'Loomis, John', 'Hopkins, Marilyn', 'Bylund, Jason']","['Harris AM', 'Loomis J', 'Hopkins M', 'Bylund J']","['Department of Urology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Department of Urology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Department of Urology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Department of Urology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190517,United States,J Endourol,Journal of endourology,8807503,,IM,"['Curriculum', 'Fluoroscopy/adverse effects', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Internship and Residency', 'Occupational Exposure/*prevention & control', 'Radiation Exposure/*prevention & control', 'Radiation Protection/*methods', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States', 'Urology/*education', 'X-Rays']",PMC6588117,['NOTNLM'],"['*fluoroscopy', '*radiation safety', '*resident education']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/08/20 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/end.2019.0133 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endourol. 2019 Jun;33(6):492-497. doi: 10.1089/end.2019.0133.

Methods A total of 107 cases (73 males, 34 females; mean age 57.4, range 30-88 years) with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, who underwent mediastinoscopy between 12 September 2012 and 29 November 2018 were examined retrospectively. The cases were evaluated in terms of age, gender, complaint, operation time, histopathological diagnosis, postoperative morbidity and mortality parameters. Results Upon histopathological examination 32 (30%) patients were diagnosed with lung cancer metastasis (N2 stage), which was the most common diagnosis. With this diagnosis unnecessary thoracotomy was prevented. In patients with pathological lymphadenopathy found by imaging histopathological results were examined to evaluate the presence of N2 stage. In 25 (23.5%) cases biopsy results were reported as reactive lymph nodes. In addition, 23 (21.4%) patients had sarcoidosis, 16 (15%) had tuberculosis lymphadenitis, seven (6.5%) had lymphoma, one of each (0.9%) had benign epithelial cyst (0.9%), malign epithelial tumour (invasive ductal carcinoma of breast), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and adenocarcinoma metastasis (renal cell cancer). Conclusion When other non-invasive procedures are ineffective, mediastinoscopy is an efficient diagnostic method with high diagnostic value, which is applicable also in places other than advanced centres, with low morbidity and mortality.","['Oguz Kapicibasi, Hasan']",['Oguz Kapicibasi H'],"['Department of Thoracic Surgery, School of Medicine, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Med Glas (Zenica),"Medicinski glasnik : official publication of the Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina",101250177,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*lung cancer', '*lymphadenopathy', '*mediastinal staging', '*thoracic surgery']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/04/19 06:01,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.17392/1001-19 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Glas (Zenica). 2019 Aug 1;16(2). doi: 10.17392/1001-19.,,['Copyright(c) by the Medical Assotiation of Zenica-Doboj Canton.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators and prognostic factors involved in AML. To determine the clinical role of miR-338 in AML, a total of 164 adults with de novo AML were collected. These patients were classified into a chemotherapy group and an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) group according to the clinical treatment, and then each group was divided into two subgroups based on the median miR-338 expression values. We found that upregulated miR-338 positively correlates with higher frequencies of complex karyotype, RUNX1 mutation, and poor risk status. In the chemotherapy group, high expression of miR-338 was independently associated with shorter EFS and OS. However, no significant differences were observed between the two subgroups within the allo-HSCT group. We also divided all patients into two groups according to the median miR-338 expression values of the whole cohort. In the miR-338 high expression group, patients receiving allo-HSCT had longer OS and EFS than those receiving chemotherapy only. In contrast, patients receiving different therapies had similar OS and EFS in the miR-338 low expression group. Our study suggests that high expression of miR-338 is an adverse prognostic biomarker in patients with AML undergoing chemotherapy and may guide treatment decisions for AML. Furthermore, allo-HSCT could significantly overcome the negative effect of high miR-338 expression, but it seemed to be unbeneficial and unnecessary for low miR-338 expressions.","['Fu, Lin', 'Qi, Jialei', 'Gao, Xiang', 'Zhang, Ninghan', 'Zhang, Huihui', 'Wang, Rong', 'Xu, Linyan', 'Yao, Yao', 'Niu, Mingshan', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Fu L', 'Qi J', 'Gao X', 'Zhang N', 'Zhang H', 'Wang R', 'Xu L', 'Yao Y', 'Niu M', 'Xu K']","['Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190417,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN338 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*miR-338', '*prognosis']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28676 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Nov;234(11):20704-20712. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28676.

We describe the skeletal phenotype in an 11-year-old boy with chronic bone pain due to TKI-treated CML, including his response to intravenous (IV) pamidronate. This boy was diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML at 4 years of age. He was treated with imatinib for 3 years, followed by dasatinib for 4 years. At age 11 years, he was seen in a bone health clinic with a 4-year history of leg pains that necessitated regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and downward crossing of height percentiles (from the 25th to fifth). The bone volume/tissue volume Z-score was +1.6 for a trans-iliac bone biopsy specimen, with an increase in trabecular number (Z-score, +3.1). Bone formation and resorption parameters on trabecular surfaces were within normal limits. Tibia volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and bone geometry were normal by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, areal BMD Z-scores were average or above average at multiple skeletal sites by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and tibia length Z-score was reduced (-2.3). Growth- and bone-related biochemical studies were unremarkable except a low serum alkaline phosphatase level. His bone pain resolved completely after 9 months of low-dose IV pamidronate. An increase in trans-iliac trabecular number and shortened tibia were the main skeletal features in this patient. Short-term IV pamidronate was effective for mitigating bone pain, allowing this boy to continue receiving dasatinib without the need for chronic NSAID therapy.","['Lavoie, Declan C T', 'Robinson, Marie-Eve', 'Johnston, Donna', 'Page, Marika', 'Konji, Victor N', 'Rauch, Frank', 'Ward, Leanne M']","['Lavoie DCT', 'Robinson ME', 'Johnston D', 'Page M', 'Konji VN', 'Rauch F', 'Ward LM']","[""Pediatric Bone Health Clinical Research Program, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Pediatric Bone Health Clinical Research Program, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Pediatric Bone Health Clinical Research Program, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Pediatric Bone Health Clinical Research Program, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'Shriners Hospital for Children, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Pediatric Bone Health Clinical Research Program, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190311,United States,J Endocr Soc,Journal of the Endocrine Society,101697997,,,,PMC6462212,['NOTNLM'],"['bisphosphonates', 'bone histomorphometry', 'bone pain', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'fractures', 'growth', 'osteomalacia', 'osteoporosis', 'pamidronate', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/04/19 06:01,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1210/js.2018-00268 [doi]', 'js_201800268 [pii]']",epublish,J Endocr Soc. 2019 Mar 11;3(5):857-864. doi: 10.1210/js.2018-00268. eCollection 2019 May 1.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1557-9185'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and consequent development of dense stroma are prominent features accounting for this aggressive biology(1,2). The reciprocal interplay between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) not only enhances tumour progression and metastasis but also sustains their own activation, facilitating a vicious cycle to exacerbate tumorigenesis and drug resistance(3-7). Furthermore, PSC activation occurs very early during PDAC tumorigenesis(8-10), and activated PSCs comprise a substantial fraction of the tumour mass, providing a rich source of readily detectable factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the communication between PSCs and PCCs could be an exploitable target to develop effective strategies for PDAC therapy and diagnosis. Here, starting with a systematic proteomic investigation of secreted disease mediators and underlying molecular mechanisms, we reveal that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a key paracrine factor from activated PSCs acting on cancer cells. Both pharmacologic LIF blockade and genetic Lifr deletion markedly slow tumour progression and augment the efficacy of chemotherapy to prolong survival of PDAC mouse models, mainly by modulating cancer cell differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition status. Moreover, in both mouse models and human PDAC, aberrant production of LIF in the pancreas is restricted to pathological conditions and correlates with PDAC pathogenesis, and changes in the levels of circulating LIF correlate well with tumour response to therapy. Collectively, these findings reveal a function of LIF in PDAC tumorigenesis, and suggest its translational potential as an attractive therapeutic target and circulating marker. Our studies underscore how a better understanding of cell-cell communication within the tumour microenvironment can suggest novel strategies for cancer therapy.","['Shi, Yu', 'Gao, Weina', 'Lytle,

Many causes of IP have been identified including haematological dyscrasias (particularly, sickle cell disease), drugs and rarely malignancy. There are also a large proportion of men, in which no aetiology is identified. Identification of men at risk for malignancy provides a diagnostic challenge to the clinicians looking after these patients. All cases of IP between 2007 and 2017 at a single tertiary andrology unit were identified. The case notes and electronic records of these patients were reviewed to identify cases of malignant priapism. Men with idiopathic IP were used as a control group for comparative statistics. In total, 412 men with IP were identified, 202 of which had idiopathic IP. Within this group, the prevalence of malignant priapism was 3.5% (n = 11). MP secondary to local invasion or penile metastases occurred in seven of the 11 men (bladder x 3, prostate, lung, urethral and chondrosarcoma of the pelvis). MP secondary to haematological malignancy occurred in the remaining four (chronic myeloid leukaemia x 2, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and myelodysplasia). IP was the initial presentation of malignancy in seven of the patients (64%). An abnormally low haemoglobin value (reference range 130-180 g/dl) was found in 82% (n = 9) of the men with MP. The mean haemoglobin value in men with MP was 109.64 +/- 20.30 g/dl compared to the control of 131.87 +/- g/dl. This difference was considered highly significant p = 0.0046. Men with MP also appear to have a very poor prognosis with an 18-month mortality of 64% (n = 7). Malignancy is a rare and important cause of IP. A low haemoglobin is a predictor of malignancy and warrants further investigation in IP.","['James Johnson, Mark', 'Hallerstrom, Marcus', 'Alnajjar, Hussain M', 'Frederick Johnson, Thomas', 'Skrodzka, Marta', 'Chiriaco, Giovanni', 'Muneer, Asif', 'Ralph, David James']","['James Johnson M', 'Hallerstrom M', 'Alnajjar HM', 'Frederick Johnson T', 'Skrodzka M', 'Chiriaco G', 'Muneer A', 'Ralph DJ']","['Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK.', 'Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK.', 'Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK.', 'Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK.', 'Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK.', 'Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK.', 'Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK.', 'Andrology Department, University College, 47 Wimpole St, London, W1G 8PH, UK. david@andrology.co.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190417,England,Int J Impot Res,International journal of impotence research,9007383,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Penis/blood supply', 'Priapism/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41443-019-0141-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41443-019-0141-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Impot Res. 2020 Mar;32(2):195-200. doi: 10.1038/s41443-019-0141-z.

Methods Twenty-two patients (median age: 65 years) with aggressive ATL [acute- (n=16) or lymphoma-type (n=6)] had their characteristics analyzed. All cases were treated with mogamulizumab at our institution from 2012 to 2018. In addition, we subjected 14 specimens of ATL to histological, immunological, and genetic analyses. Results Regarding the patient outcomes, the overall response rates were 68.1% and 31.8% after 4 and 8 courses (or after the final courses), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 95.5 days, while the OS rates at 6 and 12 months were 31.5% and 21.1%, respectively. Concerning patient pathological characteristics, 6 of the 14 patients examined (42.9%) had CCR4 mutations. Regarding the clinicopathological findings related to the mogamulizumab response, notably, the cases with somatic CCR4 mutation tended to have a poorer response (16.7%) than those with wild-type CCR4 (62.5%) after 4 cycles of mogamulizumab. Furthermore, the CCR4 global score tended to be higher in the responder cases than in the non-responder cases. Conclusion The present findings suggest that the CCR4 expression may be related to the mogamulizumab response, although no other significant predictive markers were identified in this study. Further studies will be needed in order to identify more markers related to the mogamulizumab response.","['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Kawano, Sayaka', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Yamada, Kyohei', 'Nakashima, Kazutaka', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Tochigi, Taro', 'Nakaike, Takashi', 'Shimokawa, Tomonori', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Marutsuka, Kousuke', 'Mashiba, Koichi', 'Kikuchi, Ikuo', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Kawano N', 'Yoshida N', 'Kawano S', 'Arakawa F', 'Miyoshi H', 'Yamada K', 'Nakashima K', 'Yoshida S', 'Kuriyama T', 'Tochigi T', 'Nakaike T', 'Shimokawa T', 'Yamashita K', 'Marutsuka K', 'Mashiba K', 'Kikuchi I', 'Ohshima K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Studies, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190417,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6709313,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'NS mutation and FS mutation', 'mogamulizumab', 'overall response rate', 'overall survival', 'somatic CCR4 mutation']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.2513-18 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2019 Aug 1;58(15):2159-2166. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.2513-18.

Five subgroups of FeLV, A to D and T, each with distinct receptor usages, have been described. Recently, we identified a new FeLV Env (TG35-2) gene from a pseudotyped virus that does not belong to any known subgroup. FeLV-A is the primary virus from which other subgroups have emerged via mutation or recombination of the subgroup A env gene. Retrovirus entry into cells is mediated by the interaction of envelope protein (Env) with specific cell surface receptors. Here, phenotypic screening of a human/hamster radiation hybrid panel identified SLC19A1, a feline reduced folate carrier (RFC) and potential receptor for TG35-2-phenotypic virus. RFC is a multipass transmembrane protein. Feline and human RFC cDNAs conferred susceptibility to TG35-2-pseudotyped virus when introduced into nonpermissive cells but did not render these cells permissive to other FeLV subgroups or feline endogenous retrovirus. Moreover, human cells with genomic deletion of RFC were nonpermissive for TG35-2-pseudotyped virus infection, but the introduction of feline and human cDNAs rendered them permissive. Mutation analysis of FeLV Env demonstrated that amino acid substitutions within variable region A altered the specificity of the Env-receptor interaction. We isolated and reconstructed the full-length infectious TG35-2-phenotypic provirus from a naturally FeLV-infected cat, from which the FeLV Env (TG35-2) gene was previously isolated, and compared the replication of the virus in hematopoietic cell lines with that of FeLV-A 61E by measuring the viral RNA copy numbers. These results provide a tool for further investigation of FeLV infectious disease.IMPORTANCE Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a member of the genus Gammaretrovirus, which causes malignant diseases in cats. The most prevalent FeLV among cats is FeLV subgroup A (FeLV-A), and specific binding of FeLV-A Env to its viral receptor, thiamine transporter feTHTR1, is the first step of infection. In infected cats, novel variants of FeLV with altered receptor specificity for viral entry have emerged by mutation or recombination of the env gene. A novel FeLV variant arose from a subtle mutation of FeLV-A Env, which altered the specific interaction of the virus with its receptor. RFC, a folate transporter, is a potential receptor for the novel FeLV variant. The perturbation of specific retrovirus-receptor interactions under selective pressure by the host results in the emergence of novel viruses.","['Miyake, Ariko', 'Kawasaki, Junna', 'Ngo, Ha', 'Makundi, Isaac', 'Muto, Yutaro', 'Khan, Arshad H', 'Smith, Desmond J', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Miyake A', 'Kawasaki J', 'Ngo H', 'Makundi I', 'Muto Y', 'Khan AH', 'Smith DJ', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan kaz@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp.', 'The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190614,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Genes, env/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Feline/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Proviruses', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', '*Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication']",PMC6580973,['NOTNLM'],"['*cats', '*endogenous retrovirus', '*feline leukemia virus', '*retroviruses', '*viral envelope', '*viral infection', '*viral pathogenesis', '*viral receptor']",,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/05/29 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00269-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00269-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Jun 14;93(13). pii: JVI.00269-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00269-19.

In this study, we asked whether clinically apparent CMV infection could be identified prior to hematologic malignancy, using high-quality Swedish population-based registries. METHODS: CMV infection was identified with appropriate ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes in the Patient and Medical Birth Registries, and childhood malignancies below the age of 15 years were identified in the Cancer Registry, among 2,782,507 children born in Sweden 1987 to 2014. RESULTS: Observing all CMV infections registered earlier than 6 months prior to malignancy diagnosis, an increased HR of CMV-related infections, adjusting for congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosome abnormalities, was detected for hematologic malignancies [HR, 11.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.8-21.5], but not for central nervous system tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Higher CMV incidence was detected for children ostensibly exposed through maternal CMV infection during pregnancy with the index child. IMPACT: The data are compatible with a congenital infection of CMV leading to increased risk of childhood hematologic malignancies, but not tumors of the central nervous system, although a cautious interpretation is warranted because of the small numbers.","['Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Talback, Mats', 'Francis, Stephen', 'Feychting, Maria']","['Wiemels JL', 'Talback M', 'Francis S', 'Feychting M']","['Center for Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California. wiemels@usc.edu.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190417,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*epidemiology/pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC7731595,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/08/07 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-19-0044 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0044 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2019 Jun;28(6):1024-1027. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0044.

Due to its high pathogenicity and mortality rates, NiV requires handling in biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment facilities and no effective vaccines or therapeutic agents are currently available. Since current diagnostic tests for detecting serum neutralizing antibodies against NiV mainly employ live viruses, establishment of more safe and robust alternative diagnostic methods is an essential medical requirement. Here, we have developed a pseudotyped NiV and closely related Hendra virus (HeV) expressing envelope attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins using the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) packaging system. We additionally generated polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against NiV-G and HeV-G and assessed their neutralizing activities for potential utilization in the pseudovirus-based neutralization assay and further application in the serum diagnostic test. To enhance the specificity of neutralizing antibody and sensitivity of the serological diagnostic test, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against NiV-G were generated, and among which four out of six mAb clones showed significant reactivity. Specifically, the 7G9 clone displayed the highest sensitivity. The selected mAb clones showed no cross-reactivity with HeV-G and efficient neutralizing activities against pseudotyped NiV. These results validate the safety and specificity of neutralization assays against NiV and HeV and present a useful tool to design effective vaccines and serological diagnosis.","['Bae, Seong Eun', 'Kim, Seong Su', 'Moon, Seong Tae', 'Cho, Yeon Dong', 'Lee, Hansaem', 'Lee, Joo-Yeon', 'Shin, Ha Youn', 'Lee, Hee-Jung', 'Kim, Young Bong']","['Bae SE', 'Kim SS', 'Moon ST', 'Cho YD', 'Lee H', 'Lee JY', 'Shin HY', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim YB']","['Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, 05029, Republic of Korea; Department of Bio-industrial Technologies, Konkuk University, Seoul, 05029, Republic of Korea.

However, the role of XPR1 in human cancers has not yet been characterized. METHODS: Real-time PCR and western blotting assay were used to measure the expression of XPR1 in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) tissues. Expression of XPR1 and p65 in clinical specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemical assay. The function of XPR1 on progression of TSCC was explored using in vitro and in vivo experiments. The molecular mechanism by which XPR1 helps to cancer progression was investigated by luciferase reporter activity, ELISA, PKA activity assay, immunofluorescence, western blotting and qPCR assay. RESULTS: Herein, we find that XPR1 is markedly upregulated in TSCC tissues compared to normal tongue tissues. High expression of XPR1 significantly correlates with the malignant features and poor patient survival in TSCC. Ectopic expression of XPR1 increases, while silencing of XPR1 reduces the proliferation, invasion and anti-apoptosis capacities of TSCC cells. Importantly, silencing of XPR1 effectively inhibits the tumorigenecity of TSCC cells. Moreover, we identified that XPR1 increased the concentration of intracellular cAMP and activated PKA. Thus, XPR1 promoted phosphorylation and activation of NF-kappaB signaling, which is required for XPR1-mediated oncogenic roles and significantly correlates with XPR1 expression in clinical specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover a critical role of XPR1 in TSCC progression via activation of NF-kappaB, and suggest that XPR1 might be a potential prognostic marker or therapeutic target.","['Chen, Wei-Chao', 'Li, Qiu-Li', 'Pan, Qimei', 'Zhang, Hua-Yong', 'Fu, Xiao-Yan', 'Yao, Fan', 'Wang, Jian-Ning', 'Yang, An-Kui']","['Chen WC', 'Li QL', 'Pan Q', 'Zhang HY', 'Fu XY', 'Yao F',

The aim of the current study is to investigate the association between GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) among Sudanese patients. Patients with CML (n = 115) were recruited to the study from the Radiation and Isotope Centre Khartoum (RICK)-Sudan. Healthy individuals (n = 104) were included as controls. Genotyping of GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms was performed using multiplex PCR. Null deletions in the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes are common in the Sudanese population (control group), with frequencies of 33.9% and 38.2%, respectively. The frequencies of GSTT1 (OR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.87-5.65, p < 0.001) and GSTM1 (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.25-3.67, p < 0.005) null genotypes were significantly higher in CML patients vs. controls. The distribution of GSTT1 and GSTM1 null polymorphisms was not different between male and female (p > 0.01) and young and old CML patients (p > 0.05). Hematological parameters were not affected by null polymorphisms in the patient group (p > 0.05). In addition, the frequency of GSTM1 null polymorphism was lower in advanced-phase CML patients compared to chronic-phase patients (p < 0.05). The GSTT1 and GSTM1 null polymorphisms are associated with CML among Sudanese patients, independently of their age and gender.","['Muddathir, Abdel Rahim Mahmoud', 'Abdallah, Elharam Ibrahim', 'Khabour, Omar Falah', 'Abdelgader, Ream Elzain', 'Elgari, Mahmoud Mohamed']","['Muddathir ARM', 'Abdallah EI', 'Khabour OF', 'Abdelgader RE', 'Elgari MM']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Taibah University, Medina, Saudi Arabia; Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Alzaeim Alazhari University, Khartoum, Sudan. abdelrahimm@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190415,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,101200947,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Sex Factors', 'Sudan', 'Young Adult']",PMC6868479,,,,2019/04/19 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/04/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17305/bjbms.2019.4176 [doi]'],epublish,Bosn J Basic Med Sci. 2019 Apr 15;19(4):350-354. doi: 10.17305/bjbms.2019.4176.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugates targeting antigens CD19 and CD22 show greater efficacy and more favourable toxicity profiles than standard salvage chemotherapeutic protocols. Two of these drugs - blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin - have already made their way into clinical practice. Ponatinib and other new generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors allow dose reduction of intensive cytostatic regimens in Ph-positive ALL patients and slowly start to overshadow the importance of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants. For the time being, their use is reserved for relapsed/refractory ALL, but they are already available as a first line therapy in clinical trials. An entirely new group of living drugs is emerging for the treatment of ALL - chimeric antigen receptor T-cells produced by genetic modification of native human cells. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells can be looked upon as in vitro trained professional blast killers. They show an efficacy never seen before for the treatment of relapsed/refractory ALL. On the other hand, this treatment still presents significant risks, mainly due to cytokine release syndrome. Ruxolitinib, mTOR inhibitors, bortezomib, and other drugs for targeted treatment of ALL are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. PURPOSE: The article focuses on current options and news in the field of relapsed and refractory ALL treatment.

AMPK is activated by biguanides, such as metformin and phenformin, and metformin use in diabetics has been associated with reduced cancer risk. However, whether this is mediated by cell-autonomous AMPK activation within tumor progenitor cells has been unclear. We report that T-cell-specific loss of AMPK-alpha1 caused accelerated growth of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) induced by PTEN loss in thymic T cell progenitors. Oral administration of phenformin, but not metformin, delayed onset and growth of lymphomas, but only when T cells expressed AMPK-alpha1. This differential effect of biguanides correlated with detection of phenformin, but not metformin, in thymus. Phenformin also enhanced apoptosis in T-ALL cells both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, AMPK-alpha1 can be a cell-autonomous tumor suppressor in the context of T-ALL, and phenformin may have potential for the prevention of some cancers.","['Vara-Ciruelos, Diana', 'Dandapani, Madhumita', 'Russell, Fiona M', 'Grzes, Katarzyna M', 'Atrih, Abdelmadjid', 'Foretz, Marc', 'Viollet, Benoit', 'Lamont, Douglas J', 'Cantrell, Doreen A', 'Hardie, D Grahame']","['Vara-Ciruelos D', 'Dandapani M', 'Russell FM', 'Grzes KM', 'Atrih A', 'Foretz M', 'Viollet B', 'Lamont DJ', 'Cantrell DA', 'Hardie DG']","['Division of Cell Signalling & Immunology, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling & Immunology, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling & Immunology, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling & Immunology, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.', 'Fingerprints Proteomics Facility, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.', 'Inserm U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France; CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France; CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris cite, Paris, France.', 'Fingerprints Proteomics Facility, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling & Immunology, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling & Immunology, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK.

In previous studies, autologous gene therapy with gamma-retroviral vectors failed to reconstitute B-cell and NK-cell immunity and was complicated by vector-related leukemia. METHODS: We performed a dual-center, phase 1-2 safety and efficacy study of a lentiviral vector to transfer IL2RG complementary DNA to bone marrow stem cells after low-exposure, targeted busulfan conditioning in eight infants with newly diagnosed SCID-X1. RESULTS: Eight infants with SCID-X1 were followed for a median of 16.4 months. Bone marrow harvest, busulfan conditioning, and cell infusion had no unexpected side effects. In seven infants, the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and naive CD4+ T cells and NK cells normalized by 3 to 4 months after infusion and were accompanied by vector marking in T cells, B cells, NK cells, myeloid cells, and bone marrow progenitors. The eighth infant had an insufficient T-cell count initially, but T cells developed in this infant after a boost of gene-corrected cells without busulfan conditioning. Previous infections cleared in all infants, and all continued to grow normally. IgM levels normalized in seven of the eight infants, of whom four discontinued intravenous immune globulin supplementation; three of these four infants had a response to vaccines. Vector insertion-site analysis was performed in seven infants and showed polyclonal patterns without clonal dominance in all seven. CONCLUSIONS: Lentiviral vector gene therapy combined with low-exposure, targeted busulfan conditioning in infants with newly diagnosed SCID-X1 had low-grade acute toxic effects and resulted in multilineage engraftment of transduced cells, reconstitution of functional T cells and B cells, and normalization of NK-cell counts during a median follow-up of 16 months.

Patients in either arm could then enroll in an extension study to receive IDELA monotherapy. Here, we report the long-term efficacy and safety data for IDELA-treated patients across the primary and extension studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive rituximab in combination with either IDELA 150 mg twice daily (IDELA/R; n = 110) or placebo (placebo/R; n = 110). Key end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: The long-term efficacy and safety of treatment with IDELA was assessed in 110 patients who received at least one dose of IDELA in the primary study, 75 of whom enrolled in the extension study. The IDELA/R-to-IDELA group had a median PFS of 20.3 months (95% CI, 17.3 to 26.3 months) after a median follow-up time of 18 months (range, 0.3 to 67.6 months). The ORR was 85.5% (94 of 110 patients; n = 1 complete response). The median OS was 40.6 months (95% CI, 28.5 to 57.3 months) and 34.6 months (95% CI, 16.0 months to not reached) for patients randomly assigned to the IDELA/R and placebo/R groups, respectively. Prolonged exposure to IDELA increased the incidence of all-grade, grade 2, and grade 3 or greater diarrhea (46.4%, 17.3%, and 16.4%, respectively), all-grade and grade 3 or greater colitis (10.9% and 8.2%, respectively) and all-grade and grade 3 or greater pneumonitis (10.0% and 6.4%, respectively) but did not increase the incidence of elevated hepatic aminotransferases. CONCLUSION: IDELA improved PFS and OS compared with rituximab alone in patients with relapsed CLL. Long-term IDELA was effective and had an expected safety profile. No new IDELA-related adverse events were identified with longer exposure.","['Sharman, Jeff P', 'Coutre, Steven E', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Pagel, John M', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Zelenetz, Andrew D', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Eradat, Herbert', 'Ervin, Thomas', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Coiffier, Bertrand', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Ma, Shuo', 'Tausch, Eugen', 'Cramer, Paula', 'Huang, Julie', 'Mitra, Siddhartha', 'Hallek, Michael', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Sharman JP', 'Coutre SE', 'Furman RR', 'Cheson BD', 'Pagel JM', 'Hillmen P', 'Barrientos JC', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Kipps TJ', 'Flinn IW', 'Ghia P', 'Eradat H', 'Ervin T', 'Lamanna N', 'Coiffier B', 'Pettitt AR', 'Ma S', 'Tausch E', 'Cramer P', 'Huang J', 'Mitra S', 'Hallek M', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Stilgenbauer S']","['1 Willamette Valley Cancer Institute and Research Center, US Oncology Research, Springfield, OR.', '2 Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', '3 Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', '4 Georgetown University Hospital, Washington DC.', '5 Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.', ""6 St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", '7 Zucher School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New Hyde Park, NY.', '8 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', '9 University of California, San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA.', '10 Sarah Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, TN.', '11 Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and Istituto Di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', '12 David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', '13 Venice Regional Bayfront Health, Venice, FL.', '14 Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', '15 Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre Benite, France.', 'dagger Deceased.', '16 University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', '17 Robert H.

Almost inevitably, tumors develop resistance to targeted therapy, either from pre-existence or by evolving new genotypes and traits. Intratumor heterogeneity serves as a reservoir for resistance, which often occurs as a result of the selection of minor cellular subclones. On the level of gene expression, clonal heterogeneity can only be revealed using high-dimensional single-cell methods. We propose using a general diversity index (GDI) to quantify heterogeneity on multiple scales and relate it to disease evolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We focused on individual patient samples that were probed with single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing to describe heterogeneity. We developed a pipeline to analyze single-cell data via sample normalization, clustering, and mathematical interpretation using a generalized diversity measure, as well as to exemplify the utility of this platform using single-cell data. RESULTS: We focused on three sources of patient scRNA sequencing data: two healthy bone marrow (BM) donors, two patients with acute myeloid leukemia-each sampled before and after BM transplantation, four samples of presorted lineages-and six patients with lung carcinoma with multiregion sampling. While healthy/normal samples scored low in diversity overall, GDI further quantified the ways in which these samples differed. Whereas a widely used Shannon diversity index sometimes reveals fewer differences, GDI exhibits differences in the number of potential key drivers or clonal richness. Comparison of pre- and post-BM transplantation acute myeloid leukemia samples did not reveal differences in heterogeneity, although biological differences can exist. CONCLUSION: GDI can quantify cellular heterogeneity changes across a wide spectrum, even when standard measures, such as the Shannon index, do not. Our approach can be widely applied to quantify heterogeneity across samples and conditions.","['Ferrall-Fairbanks, Meghan C', 'Ball, Markus', 'Padron, Eric', 'Altrock, Philipp M']","['Ferrall-Fairbanks MC', 'Ball M', 'Padron E', 'Altrock PM']","['Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,JCO clinical cancer informatics,101708809,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', '*Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Single-Cell Analysis']",PMC6873939,,,,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/CCI.18.00074 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2019 Apr;3:1-10. doi: 10.1200/CCI.18.00074.,,,,['P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to describe the incidence, timing, and outcomes of bradycardia in children with ALL receiving corticosteroids during induction chemotherapy at our center from 2010 to 2016. A total of 153 children were included, with 150 (98%) demonstrating decreased heart rate following steroid administration with a median HR decrease of 23 beats per minute.

No patient experienced adverse events related to bradycardia. Resolution of bradycardia at outpatient follow-up occurred in 62 of 71 (87%). Examination of nadir heart rate during subsequent hospitalizations in which steroids were not being administered did not demonstrate a significant incidence of bradycardia. Corticosteroid-induced bradycardia is common in children with ALL receiving induction chemotherapy. It was not associated with clinical adverse events and self-resolved without intervention. Therefore, further cardiac assessment may not be warranted in the presence of asymptomatic bradycardia suspected to be secondary to steroid administration.","['Duffy, Caitlyn', 'Hall, Laura', 'Godown, Justin', 'Koyama, Tatsuki', 'Borinstein, Scott C']","['Duffy C', 'Hall L', 'Godown J', 'Koyama T', 'Borinstein SC']","['Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology.', 'Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Cardiology.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', ""Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*adverse effects', 'Adult', 'Bradycardia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/04/11 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001483 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;41(7):537-541. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The medical records of 38 cats with relapsed or refractory lymphoma treated with MOPP chemotherapy at three institutions (University of Pennsylvania, the Animal Medical Center, and VCA Western Veterinary Specialist and Emergency Centre) were examined. Information evaluated included patient signalment, feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukemia virus status, anatomic location(s) of lymphoma, prior protocols (type and number), MOPP doses, MOPP response, remission duration, hematologic and biochemical parameters, and owner-reported adverse effects. RESULTS: Overall, 70.3% of cats responded to MOPP chemotherapy. Among the responders, the median remission duration was 166 days. The most common adverse effects were neutropenia and gastrointestinal upset, which were reported in 18.4% of cats. In 55.3% of cats, no adverse effects were reported. In total, 30.8% of responders continued to respond 6 months following the initiation of MOPP, and 15.4% maintained a response 1 year after starting MOPP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MOPP is a safe protocol for the treatment of relapsed or refractory feline lymphoma, with a promising overall response rate and median remission time.","['MaloneyHuss, Martha A', 'Mauldin, Glenna E', 'Brown, Dorothy C', 'Veluvolu, Sridhar M', 'Krick, Erika L']","['MaloneyHuss MA', 'Mauldin GE', 'Brown DC', 'Veluvolu SM', 'Krick EL']","['University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'PetCure Oncology, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Martingale Consulting, Media, PA, USA.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Mount Laurel Animal Hospital, Mount Laurel, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190417,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cat Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Cats', '*Lymphoma/drug therapy/veterinary', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chemotherapy', '*MOPP', '*lymphoma', '*rescue']",,2019/04/18 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X19841916 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2020 Apr;22(4):299-304. doi: 10.1177/1098612X19841916.

They occur either isolated or as part of a complex karyotype and are associated with unfavorable prognosis in certain disease entities. We performed detailed cytogenetic analysis, molecular analysis, and array comparative genomic hybridization in a cohort of 81 patients with a variety of myeloid malignancies and del(7q) as sole chromosomal alteration. In 70% (57/81) of patients, we identified a commonly deleted region (size: 18 Mb) involving the genomic region 101 912.442 (7q22.1)-119 608.824 (7q31.31). Furthermore, in 80 patients, we analyzed 17 genes commonly mutated in myeloid neoplasms and identified high mutation frequencies in ASXL1 34% (27/80), TET2 33% (26/80), RUNX1 25% (20/80), DNMT3A 25% (20/80), while TP53 was rarely affected (5%, 4/80). ASXL1 and TET2 showed similar mutation frequencies across all analyzed entities while RUNX1, CBL, and JAK2 were specifically mutated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms, respectively. We detected a significantly higher frequency of RUNX1 (42% vs 13%, P = .0001) and ASXL1 (32% vs 14%, P = .008) mutations in AML patients with del(7q) compared to other AML patients in the Medical Research Council unfavorable risk group (n = 464), indicating a cooperative leukemogenic potential.

Since the implementation of the new comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system for MDS, chromosome 7 anomalies are no longer generally assigned to poor risk features but are thoroughly separated. However, der(1;7)(q10;p10), hereinafter der(1;7), is merged into the group labeled ""any other single"" and belongs to the intermediate risk group, just by definition due to lack of adequate clinical data. The aim of our international collaborative was to clarify the ""real"" prognostic impact of der(1;7) on a homogenous and well-documented data base. We performed detailed analysis of 63 MDS patients with isolated der(1;7) constituting the largest cohort hitherto reported. Furthermore, clinical data are compared with those of patients with isolated del(7q) and isolated monosomy 7. Median overall survival (OS) of patients with der(1;7) is 26 months (hazard ratio (HR) 0.91 for del(7q) vs der(1;7) and 2.53 for monosomy 7 vs der(1;7)). The der(1;7) is associated with profound thrombocytopenia most probably causing the reduced OS which is in striking contrast to the low risk for AML transformation (HR 3.89 for del(7q) vs der(1;7) and 5.88 for monosomy 7 vs der(1;7)). Molecular karyotyping indicates that der(1;7) is generated in a single step during mitosis and that a chromosomal imbalance rather than a single disrupted gene accounts for malignancy. Thus, the current cytogenetic scoring system assigning isolated der(1;7) to the intermediate risk group is now confirmed by a sufficient data set.","['Ganster, Christina', 'Muller-Thomas, Catharina', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Strupp, Corinna', 'Ogata, Kiyoyuki', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Mallo, Mar', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Muller, Christel', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Gotze, Katharina S', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Steinmetz, Tilman', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Soling, Ulrike', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Shirneshan, Katayoon', 'Schanz, Julie', 'Haase, Detlef']","['Ganster C', 'Muller-Thomas C', 'Haferlach C', 'Strupp C', 'Ogata K', 'Germing U', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Mallo M', 'Lubbert M', 'Muller C', 'Sole F', 'Gotze KS', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Gohring G', 'Steinmetz T', 'Kroger N', 'Platzbecker U', 'Soling U', 'Raynaud S', 'Shirneshan K', 'Schanz J', 'Haase D']","['Clinics of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Metropolitan Research and Treatment Center for Blood Disorders (MRTC Japan), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics and Anthropology, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute (IJC), ICO-Hospital GermansTrias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute (IJC), ICO-Hospital GermansTrias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Center for Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Onkologie Koln, Outpatient Clinic for Hematology and Oncology, Koln, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Outpatient Clinic for Hematology and Oncology, Kassel, Germany.', ""Departement d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pasteur, Nice, France."", 'Clinics of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinics of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinics of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190430,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Duplication', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MDS', '*clinical characterization', '*isolated der(1;7)', '*prognosis']",,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22760 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Oct;58(10):689-697. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22760.

This enzyme is efficiently used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphosarcoma and emerged against ALL in children, neoplasia, and some other malignancies. Cancer cells reduce the expression of l-asparaginase leading to their elimination. The l-asparaginase anticancerous application approach has made incredible breakthrough in the field of modern oncology through depletion of plasma l-asparagine to inhibit the cancer cells growth; particularly among children. High level of l-asparaginase enzyme production by Escherichia coli, Erwinia species, Streptomyces, and Bacillus subtilis species is highly desirable as bacterial alternative enzyme sources for anticancer therapy. Thermal or harsh conditions stability of those from the two latter bacterial species is considerable. Some enzymes from marine bacteria have conferred stability in adverse conditions being more advantageous in cancer therapy. Several side effects exerted by l-asparaginases such as hypersensitivity should be hindered or decreased through alternative therapies or use of immune-suppressor drugs. The l-asparaginase from Erwinia species has displayed remarkable traits in children with this regard. Noticeably, Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase exhibited negligible glutaminase activity representing a promising efficiency mitigating related side effects. Application of software such as RSM would optimize conditions for higher levels of enzyme production. Additionally, genetic recombination of the encoding gene would indisputably help improving enzyme traits. Furthermore, the possibility of anticancer combination therapy using two or more l-asparaginases from various sources is plausible in future studies to achieve better therapeutic outcomes with lower side effects.","['Ghasemian, Abdolmajid', 'Al-Marzoqi, Ali-Hussein', 'Al-Abodi, Hiba Riyadh', 'Alghanimi, Yasemin Khudiar', 'Kadhum, Samah Ahmed', 'Shokouhi Mostafavi, Seyyed Khalil', 'Fattahi, Azam']","['Ghasemian A', 'Al-Marzoqi AH', 'Al-Abodi HR', 'Alghanimi YK', 'Kadhum SA', 'Shokouhi Mostafavi SK', 'Fattahi A']","['Department of Biology, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, College of Science for Women, Babylon University, Hillah, Iraq.', 'Department of Zoonotic Disease, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Department of Life Sciences Hussein, Faculty of Education, Karbala University, Karbala, Iraq.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Babylon, Babylon, Iraq.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Center for Research and Training in Skin Disease and Leprosy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190416,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/biosynthesis/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*bacterial l-asparaginase', '*cancer therapy', '*optimized production']",,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28563 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Nov;234(11):19271-19279. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28563.

Glucocorticoids are one of the factors influencing the implantation window. In this study, 40 female BALB/c mice were used to study the impacts of dexamethasone administration on endometrial receptivity markers during implantation window. The mice mated and were randomly divided into four groups: control (vehicle), dexamethasone (100 mug/kg, IP), PP242 (30 mg/kg, IP), and dexamethasone + PP242 (Dex + PP242). On the Day 4th and 5th of gestation, mice received their respective treatments and were killed on the 5th day. To assess the expression of Muc1, leukemia inflammatory inhibitor (LIF), serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), miRNA 200a, and miRNA 223-3p in the endometrium real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed. Furthermore, using Western blot analysis protein expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) were evaluated. Periodic Acid-Schiff staining was used to examine the histomorphological changes of the uterus. According to the results dexamethasone declined the expression of LIF, whereas upregulated expression of Muc1, SGK1, ENaC mRNA, miRNA 200a, and miRNA 223-3p in the endometrium. In addition, PP242, an mTOR inhibitor, induced mRNA expression of Muc1, miRNA200a, and miRNa223-3p whereas it declined the expression of LIF. Moreover, activity of the ERK1/2-mTOR pathway in the endometrial cells was deterred by dexamethasone and PP242. Nonstop epithelium proliferation and elevated surface glycoproteins layer on epithelium of dexamethasone and/or PP242-received groups were divulged through histochemical analysis. According to the above mentioned results, uterine receptivity during implantation period was declined by dexamethasone, at least in part, through modulation of involved genes in endometrial receptivity and inhibition of the ERK1/2-mTOR pathway.","['Shariati, Mohammad Bakhtiar Hesam', 'Niknafs, Behrooz', 'Seghinsara, Abbas Majdi', 'Shokrzadeh, Naser', 'Alivand, Mohammad Reza']","['Shariati MBH', 'Niknafs B', 'Seghinsara AM', 'Shokrzadeh N', 'Alivand MR']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.', 'Department of Genetic, Facualty of Medcine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190416,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Epithelial Sodium Channels)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn200 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Scnn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (muc1 protein, mouse)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (serum-glucocorticoid regulated kinase)', 'H5669VNZ7V (PP242)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Endometrium/*drug effects', 'Epithelial Sodium Channels/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Mucin-1/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Purines/pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ERK1/2', '*PP242', '*dexamethasone', '*implantation', '*mTOR', '*uterine receptivity']",,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/06/06 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28562 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Nov;234(11):19629-19639. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28562.

We now analyzed the prognostic impact of the donor/recipient CMV serostatus in 6968 patients with chronic hematological malignancies who underwent allo-HSCT. Donor and/or recipient CMV seropositivity was associated with a significantly reduced 2-year progression-free survival (PFS, 50% vs. 52%, p = 0.03) and OS (62% vs. 65%, p = 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed an independent negative prognostic impact of donor and/or recipient CMV seropositivity on PFS (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2; p = 0.03), OS (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2; p = 0.003), and non-relapse mortality (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3; p = 0.02). OS decline was strongest for CMV-seropositive recipients with a CMV-seronegative donor (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), followed by CMV-seropositive patients with a CMV-seropositive donor (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2). Conversely, OS did not differ significantly between CMV-seronegative recipients allografted from a CMV-seropositive donor (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2) and patients with donor/recipient CMV seronegativity (p = 0.001 for the four groups together). Non-relapse mortality was also significantly (p = 0.01) higher for CMV-seropositive patients with a CMV-seronegative graft (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4) than for CMV-seropositive patients with a CMV-seropositive graft (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2) or CMV-seronegative recipients with a CMV-seropositive graft (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2). Donor and/or recipient CMV seropositivity still results in an OS decline in patients with chronic hematological malignancies who have undergone allo-HSCT.

A total of 103 patients developed cGVHD, with a 2-year cumulative incidence of 48.9% (95% CI 42.1-55.7%). The estimated 3-year overall survival was 85.7% (95% CI 75.7-95.7%), 48.8% (95% CI 31.7-66.0%), and 54.1% (95% CI 44.3-63.8%) for patients with limited cGVHD, extensive cGVHD, and without cGVHD (P < 0.001). The 3-year event-free survival were 75.5% (95% CI 63.7-87.4%), 46.0% (95% CI 28.8-63.2%), and 45.0% (95% CI 35.6-54.4%) (P < 0.001), while the 3-year cumulative relapse rates were 22.8% (95% CI 11.0-34.6%), 11.6% (95% CI 5.3-22.6%), and 40.3% (95% CI 31.0-49.6%), respectively (P < 0.001). At the last evaluation, 62 patients relapsed with 17 patients having active cGVHD and 45 without. Compared to patients relapsing without cGVHD, patients who relapsed with cGVHD had a longer duration of remission and a better 2-year post-relapse survival [10.9 months (3.7-42.2) versus 4.4 months (2.2-28.3); P < 0.001]; [32.8% (95% CI 8.2-57.4%) versus 4.5% (95% CI 0-12.8%); P = 0.043]. For patients who relapsed with cGVHD, the remission rates were both 60% after salvage chemotherapy with or without donor lymphocyte infusion (P = 1.000). In conclusion, cGVHD may exert a stronger graft-versus-leukemia effect, which may decrease the post-transplantation relapse rate and may also benefit those patients who eventually relapsed after transplantation in terms of prolong post-relapse survival.","['Wang, Ziwei', 'Yin, Chunrong', 'Zhang, Weiping', 'Tang, Wei', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Ni, Xiong', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Hu, Jiong', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Wang Z', 'Yin C', 'Zhang W', 'Tang W', 'Song X', 'Hu X', 'Ni X', 'Qiu H', 'Yang J', 'Hu J', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. hj10709@rjh.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China. jmwangch@139.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190416,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/therapy', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Chronic graft-versus-host disease', 'Post-relapse overall survival', 'Relapse']",,2019/04/18 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03682-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03682-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Jul;98(7):1765-1773. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03682-2.

Of particular interest, the mechanism identified by the authors for the ability of the malignant cells to evade destruction by host T cells is the loss of cell surface expression of HLA class II molecules based on processes other than mutation. The authors labeled this mechanism for altered cell surface display of HLA class II antigens ""epigenetic."" This study should be of strong interest for immunologists, oncologists and even specialists in infectious diseases for several reasons. First, the results extend the range of examples for which epigenetic mechanisms can play a critical role in resistance to therapy in oncology or infectious disease. Second, findings relating to decreased cell surface display of HLA class II molecules motivate investigation of novel approaches using cytokines to increase the numbers of HLA class II proteins on malignant myeloid cell membranes and reduce the extent of immune escape by these cells. Third, the data presented suggest experimental directions intended to clarify detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the cases of AML post-HCT relapse and raise questions relating to why some mechanisms of somatic cell evolution and not others are operative in different clinical settings.","['Greenspan, Neil S']",['Greenspan NS'],"['Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190227,United States,Pathog Immun,Pathogens & immunity,101683909,,,,PMC6423549,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA class I', 'HLA class II', 'T cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)', 'blasts', 'chemotherapy', 'clone', 'cytotoxicity', 'epigenetic', 'fitness', 'interferon gamma', 'malignancy', 'mutation', 'relapse', 'somatic cell evolution', 'subclone', 'whole exome sequencing']",['Neil S.

In this study, we investigated the effects of ethanol extracts of S. baicalensis roots (EESB) on the growth ofn human leukemia U937 cells. Methods: The effect of EESB on cell viability was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Apoptosis was determined using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyllindile staining and flow cytometry. The effects of EESB on the expression of regulatory proteins of apoptosis and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling were determined by Western blotting. Caspase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured using flow cytometric analysis. Results: EESB significantly inhibited the growth of U937 cells and induced apoptosis, which was associated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax, the loss of MMP and activation of caspase-9 and -3. We also found that EESB enhanced the expression of death receptors (DRs) and their associated ligands and induced the activation of caspase-8 and truncation of Bid. In addition, EESB suppressed PI3K/Akt signaling and EESB-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition were further increased by inhibition of PI3K activity. Conclusions: Our results indicated that the pro-apoptotic effect of EESB was mediated through the activation of DR-mediated intrinsic and mitochondria-mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathways and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling in U937 cells.","['Choi, Eun Ok', 'Hwang, Hye-Jin', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Choi EO', 'Hwang HJ', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dong-Eui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Anti-Aging Research Center, Dong-Eui University, Busan, Korea.', 'Anti-Aging Research Center, Dong-Eui University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, College of Nursing, Healthcare Sciences & Human Ecology, Dong-Eui University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dong-Eui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Anti-Aging Research Center, Dong-Eui University, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190330,Korea (South),J Cancer Prev,Journal of cancer prevention,101615965,,,,PMC6453591,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Caspase', 'PI3K/Akt', 'Scutellaria baicalensis', 'U937 cells']",['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.'],2019/04/18 06:00,2019/04/18 06:01,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.15430/JCP.2019.24.1.11 [doi]', 'jcp-24-011 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Prev. 2019 Mar;24(1):11-19. doi: 10.15430/JCP.2019.24.1.11.

Clinical manifestation in the patient showed that it is a sort of ATRA-insensitive oncogene and is different from the classic PML-RARA in terms of therapeutic reaction. Methods: To reveal the functional characteristics and regulating mechanism of the GTF2I-RARA fusion gene, we established a GTF2I-RARA-transfected HL60 cell model and examined its sensitivity to ATRA by western blot, MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Wright-Giemsa staining. Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy were used to examine the binding of GTF2I-RARA and transcriptional corepressors. We also performed ChIP-seq to search for potential target genes. Immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination assay, western blot, luciferase assay, and real-time PCR were used to analyze the effects of RNF8 on RARA. Flow cytometry and Wright-Giemsa staining were used to study the effect of MG132 and ATRA on the GTF2I-RARA-transfected HL60 cell model. Result: We confirmed resistance of GTF2I-RARA to ATRA. Compared with PML-RARA, GTF2I-RARA has a higher affinity to HDAC3 under ATRA treatment. Using the ChIP-sequencing approach, we identified 221 GTF2I-RARA binding sites in model cells and found that the RING finger protein 8 (RNF8) is a target gene of GTF2I-RARA. RNF8 participates in disease progression and therapy resistance in APL with the GTF2I-RARA transcript. Elevated RNF8 expression promotes the interaction between RARA and RNF8 and induces RARA Lys-48 linkage ubiquitylation and degradation, resulting in attenuated transcriptional activation of RARA. Conclusion: Our results suggest that RNF8 is a key GTF2I-RARA downstream event. Using the combination of MG132 and ATRA to treat GTF2I-RARA-HL60 cells, a synergistic effect leading to GTF2I-RARA-HL60 cell differentiation was confirmed. Taken together, the targeting of RNF8 may be an alternative choice for treatment in variant APL with GTF2I-RARA fusion.","['Yan, Wenzhe', 'Li, Ji', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Yin, Yafei', 'Cheng, Zhao', 'Wang, Jiayi', 'Hu, Guoyu', 'Liu, Sufang', 'Wang, Yewei', 'Xu, Yunxiao', 'Peng, Hongling', 'Zhang, Guangsen']","['Yan W', 'Li J', 'Zhang Y', 'Yin Y', 'Cheng Z', 'Wang J', 'Hu G', 'Liu S', 'Wang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Peng H', 'Zhang G']","['1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '2Department of Oncology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangtan Central Hospital, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.', '1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '4Department of Nephrology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '5Department of Hematology, Zhuzhou No.1 Hospital, Zhuzhou, 410011 Hunan China.grid.501248.a', '1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7', '1Department of Hematology, The Secong Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011 Hunan China.0000 0001 0379 7164grid.216417.7']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190404,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6449960,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'GTF2I-RARA', 'Proteasome inhibitor', 'RARA', 'RNF8']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],2019/04/18 06:00,2019/04/18 06:01,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-019-0803-4 [doi]', '803 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Apr 4;19:84. doi: 10.1186/s12935-019-0803-4. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3812-9892'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate if somatic mutations could represent an additional prognostic value in respect of MRD alone. Method: At baseline, 98 patients were tested for NPM1, FLT3, and for WT1 expression; 31 for ASXL1, TET2, IDH1, IDH2, N-RAS, WT1, c-KIT, RUNX1, and DNMT3A. The same genes have been also tested after induction and consolidation. Results: Overall, 60.2% of our patients resulted mutated: 24.5% carried mutations of FLT3-ITD, 38.7% of NPM1, 48.4% of c-KIT, 25.8% of N-RAS and 19.3% of IDH2. The probability of achieving a complete response (CR) was higher for younger patients, with low ELN risk score, NPM1-mutated, with low WT1 levels, and without FLT3. The presence of additional mutations represented a poor predictive factor: only 19% of these cases achieved CR in comparison to 43% of subjects without any of it. Concerning survival, it was conditioned by a lower ELN risk score, younger age, reduction > 1 log of the NPM1 mutational burden, disappearance of FLT3 mutations and lower WT1 expression. Regarding the role of the additional mutations, they impaired the outcome of 20% of the already MRD-negative patients. Concerning the possibility of predicting relapse, we observed an increase of the NPM1 mutational burden at the time-point immediately preceding the relapse (about 2 months earlier) in 50% of subjects. Similarly concerning WT1, an increase of its expression anticipated disease recurrence in 64% of cases. Conclusions: We demonstrated that additional somatic mutations are able to impair outcome of the already MRD-negative subjects. About MRD, we suggest a prognostic role also for the WT1 expression. Finally, we considered as relevant the assessment of NPM1 quantity clearance instead of the presence/absence of mutations alone. Still remains in doubt the utility in terms of long-term prognosis of a baseline more complex mutational screening; we could hypothesize that it would be useful for those patients where other markers are not available or who reached the MRD negativity.","['Salehzadeh, Serena', 'Guerrini, Francesca', 'Pizzano, Umberto', 'Grassi, Susanna', 'Ciabatti, Elena', 'Iovino, Lorenzo', 'Buda, Gabriele', 'Caracciolo, Francesco', 'Benedetti, Edoardo', 'Orciuolo, Enrico', 'Pelosini, Matteo', 'Consani, Giovanni', 'Carulli, Giovanni', 'Metelli, Maria Rita', 'Martini, Francesca', 'Mazziotta, Francesco', 'Mazzantini, Elisa', 'Rossi, Pietro', 'Tavarozzi, Rita', 'Ricci, Federica', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Galimberti, Sara']","['Salehzadeh S', 'Guerrini F', 'Pizzano U', 'Grassi S', 'Ciabatti E', 'Iovino L', 'Buda G', 'Caracciolo F', 'Benedetti E', 'Orciuolo E', 'Pelosini M', 'Consani G', 'Carulli G', 'Metelli MR', 'Martini F', 'Mazziotta F', 'Mazzantini E', 'Rossi P', 'Tavarozzi R', 'Ricci F', 'Petrini M', 'Galimberti S']","['1Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.0000 0004 1757 3729grid.5395.a', '4University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.0000 0001 2300 0941grid.6530.0', '5Ospedale S.

Medicinal chemistry is essential for elucidating drug mechanism, enabling variation of small molecule structure to gain structure-activity relationships (SARs). However, the development of complementary approaches that systematically vary target protein structure could provide equally informative SARs for investigating drug mechanism and protein function. Here we explore the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to profile the interactions between lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) and chemical inhibitors in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through this approach, termed CRISPR-suppressor scanning, we elucidate drug mechanism of action by showing that LSD1 enzyme activity is not required for AML survival and that LSD1 inhibitors instead function by disrupting interactions between LSD1 and the transcription factor GFI1B on chromatin. Our studies clarify how LSD1 inhibitors mechanistically operate in AML and demonstrate how CRISPR-suppressor scanning can uncover novel aspects of target biology.","['Vinyard, Michael E', 'Su, Cindy', 'Siegenfeld, Allison P', 'Waterbury, Amanda L', 'Freedy, Allyson M', 'Gosavi, Pallavi M', 'Park, Yongho', 'Kwan, Eugene E', 'Senzer, Benjamin D', 'Doench, John G', 'Bauer, Daniel E', 'Pinello, Luca', 'Liau, Brian B']","['Vinyard ME', 'Su C', 'Siegenfeld AP', 'Waterbury AL', 'Freedy AM', 'Gosavi PM', 'Park Y', 'Kwan EE', 'Senzer BD', 'Doench JG', 'Bauer DE', 'Pinello L', 'Liau BB']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA. liau@chemistry.harvard.edu.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. liau@chemistry.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190415,United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",,"['Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/drug effects/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Histone Demethylases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemistry/pharmacology']",PMC7679026,,,,2019/04/18 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41589-019-0263-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41589-019-0263-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2019 May;15(5):529-539. doi: 10.1038/s41589-019-0263-0.

Mutational characterisation of paired BM and PL samples at study entry identified that patients with a higher number of mutations or a higher mutational fractional abundance in PL had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (p = 0.005 and p = 0.018, respectively). A decrease in ctDNA levels at day 5 of cycle 1 of treatment (C1D5) correlated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.017). Evaluation of exRNA transcripts of candidate biomarkers indicated that high CRBN levels coupled with low levels of SPARC at baseline were associated with shorter OS (p = 0.000003). IKZF1 fold-change <0.05 at C1D5 was associated with shorter PFS (p = 0.0051) and OS (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, patients with high baseline CRBN coupled with low fold-change at C1D5 were at the highest risk of progression (p = 0.0001).

However, attempts to establish a causal relationship between somatic mutations and aging have been constrained by the lack of methods to directly identify mutational events in primary human tissues. Here we provide genome-wide mutation frequencies and spectra of human B lymphocytes from healthy individuals across the entire human lifespan using a highly accurate single-cell whole-genome sequencing method. We found that the number of somatic mutations increases from <500 per cell in newborns to >3,000 per cell in centenarians. We discovered mutational hotspot regions, some of which, as expected, were located at Ig genes associated with somatic hypermutation (SHM). B cell-specific mutation signatures associated with development, aging, or SHM were found. The SHM signature strongly correlated with the signature found in human B cell tumors, indicating that potential cancer-causing events are already present even in B cells of healthy individuals. We also identified multiple mutations in sequence features relevant to cellular function (i.e., transcribed genes and gene regulatory regions). Such mutations increased significantly during aging, but only at approximately one-half the rate of the genome average, indicating selection against mutations that impact B cell function. This full characterization of the landscape of somatic mutations in human B lymphocytes indicates that spontaneous somatic mutations accumulating with age can be deleterious and may contribute to both the increased risk for leukemia and the functional decline of B lymphocytes in the elderly.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Dong, Xiao', 'Lee, Moonsook', 'Maslov, Alexander Y', 'Wang, Tao', 'Vijg, Jan']","['Zhang L', 'Dong X', 'Lee M', 'Maslov AY', 'Wang T', 'Vijg J']","['Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461; Jan.Vijg@einstein.yu.edu.', 'Center for Single-Cell Omics, School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190416,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longevity/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Mutation Rate', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Whole Genome Sequencing/*methods']",PMC6500118,['NOTNLM'],"['*B lymphocyte', '*aging', '*functional genome', '*single-cell whole-genome sequencing', '*somatic DNA mutation']","['Conflict of interest statement: L.Z., X.D., M.L., A.Y.M., and J.V. are cofounders', 'of SingulOmics Corp.']",2019/04/18 06:00,2020/03/26 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['1902510116 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1902510116 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Apr 30;116(18):9014-9019. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1902510116.

Chemoresistance is a potential cause of relapse and a key characteristic of CSC, but the development of novel therapeutic approaches for targeting these cells has been limited. We previously established osteosarcoma-initiating (OSi) cells by introducing the gene for c-Myc into bone marrow stromal cells of Ink4a/Arf knockout mice. These OSi cells are composed of two distinct clones: highly tumorigenic cells (AX cells), similar to bipotent committed osteochondral progenitor cells, and tripotent cells of low tumorigenicity (AO cells), similar to mesenchymal stem cells. Here we show that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton induces terminal adipocyte differentiation and suppresses tumorigenesis in chemoresistant OSi cells. In contrast to AX cells, AO cells were highly resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and were thus identified as chemoresistant cells. Inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) elicited terminal adipocyte differentiation in chemoresistant AO cells through negative regulation of the transcriptional coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 associated with actin depolymerization. The clinically administered ROCK inhibitor fasudil significantly suppressed growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo of chemoresistant AO cells as well as of OSi cells. Our findings thus suggest a new therapeutic strategy based on the induction of trans-terminal differentiation via modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics for therapy-resistant osteosarcoma stem cells. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that induction of trans-terminal differentiation through regulation of actin dynamics is a potential novel therapeutic approach for targeting chemoresistant stem-like tumor cells.","['Takahashi, Nobuhiro', 'Nobusue, Hiroyuki', 'Shimizu, Takatsune', 'Sugihara, Eiji', 'Yamaguchi-Iwai, Sayaka', 'Onishi, Nobuyuki', 'Kunitomi, Haruko', 'Kuroda, Tatsuo', 'Saya, Hideyuki']","['Takahashi N', 'Nobusue H', 'Shimizu T', 'Sugihara E', 'Yamaguchi-Iwai S', 'Onishi N', 'Kunitomi H', 'Kuroda T', 'Saya H']","['Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. hsaya@a5.keio.jp nobusue@z2.keio.jp.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Research and Development Center for Precision Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. hsaya@a5.keio.jp nobusue@z2.keio.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190416,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Adipocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/prevention & control', 'Carcinogenesis/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-18-2693 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-2693 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Jun 15;79(12):3088-3099. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-2693.

The proteasome pathway represents a potential therapeutic target. A phase I trial of the second-generation proteasome inhibitor ixazomib in combination with MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine) was conducted in patients with R/R AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dose escalation of ixazomib was performed using a standard 3 x 3 design. Gene-expression profiling was performed on pretreatment and posttreatment bone marrow or blood samples. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose of ixazomib in combination with MEC was 1.0 mg. The dose limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia. Despite a poor risk population, the response rate [complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi)] was encouraging at 53%. Gene-expression analysis identified two genes, IFI30 (gamma-interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase) and RORalpha (retinoic orphan receptor A), which were significantly differentially expressed between responding and resistant patients and could classify CR. CONCLUSIONS: These results are encouraging, but a randomized trial is needed to address whether the addition of ixazomib to MEC improves outcome. Gene-expression profiling also helped us identify predictors of response and potentially novel therapeutic targets.","['Advani, Anjali S', 'Cooper, Brenda', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Elson, Paul', 'Chan, Ricky', 'Carew, Jennifer', 'Wei, Wei', 'Mukherjee, Sudipto', 'Gerds, Aaron', 'Carraway, Hetty', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Hamilton, Betty', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Caimi, Paolo', 'Tomlinson, Benjamin', 'Malek, Ehsan', 'Little, Jane', 'Miron, Alexander', 'Pink, John', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'Unger, Allison', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Advani AS', 'Cooper B', 'Visconte V', 'Elson P', 'Chan R', 'Carew J', 'Wei W', 'Mukherjee S', 'Gerds A', 'Carraway H', 'Nazha A', 'Hamilton B', 'Sobecks R', 'Caimi P', 'Tomlinson B', 'Malek E', 'Little J', 'Miron A', 'Pink J', 'Maciejewski J', 'Unger A', 'Kalaycio M', 'de Lima M', 'Sekeres MA']","['Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio. advania@ccf.org.', 'University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Department of Quantitative Health Science, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, Leon Levy Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Genetics and Genome Science, CWRU School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190416,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '71050168A2 (ixazomib)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Boron Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Glycine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Patient Safety', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6635077,,,,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-3886 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3886 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 15;25(14):4231-4237. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3886.

To determine whether experimentally engineered Bcor mutations would lead to pro-B1 ALL, we used clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 to introduce a Bcor frameshift mutation into NP23 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells through the use of Bcor small guide RNAs (Bcor sgRNAs). Recipient mice transplanted with NP23 bone marrow or fetal liver cells that had been transduced with a Bcor sgRNA developed pro-B1 ALL, characterized by a B-1 progenitor immunophenotype, clonal Igh gene rearrangement, and Bcor indel mutation, whereas control recipients did not. Similar to a subset of human B-cell precursor ALL, the murine pro-B1 ALL had acquired somatic mutations in Jak kinase genes. JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib and tofacitinib) inhibited the growth of pro-B1 ALL cell lines established from Bcor sgRNA/NP23 recipients at clinically achievable concentrations (100 nM). Our results demonstrate that Bcor mutations collaborate with NP23 to induce pro-B1 ALL, and that JAK inhibitors are potential therapies for pro-B1 ALL.","['Yin, Mianmian', 'Chung, Yang Jo', 'Lindsley, R Coleman', 'Walker, Robert L', 'Zhu, Yuelin J', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Yin M', 'Chung YJ', 'Lindsley RC', 'Walker RL', 'Zhu YJ', 'Ebert BL', 'Meltzer PS', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20190416,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bcor protein, mouse)', '0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism/pathology', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics']",PMC6566592,,,,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42491-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2018864173 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Jun 13;133(24):2610-2614. doi: 10.1182/blood.2018864173.

While Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has a broader breadth of detection, it is unable to differentiate sequences from replicating viruses versus background inert sequences. In order to improve NGS specificity, we have designed a new NGS approach which targets subsets of viral RNAs only synthesized during cell infection. In order to evaluate the performance of this approach for detecting low levels of adventitious viruses, we selected two difficult virus/cell systems. This included B95-8cells persistently infected by Human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4) and serially diluted into HHV-4 negative Ramos cells and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells with an early infection produced via a low dose of Bovine viral diarrhea virus. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of our RNA NGS approach was equivalent to targeted PCR with an increased specificity for the detection of viral infection.

In this prospective trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic micafungin during first induction chemotherapy in patients with acute leukemia. We also compared outcomes of prophylactic micafungin with those of prophylactic posaconazole in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Medically fit patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia received 50 mg micafungin intravenously once daily from the initiation of first induction chemotherapy to recovery of neutrophil count, suspected fungal infection, or unacceptable drug-related toxicity ( Clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT02440178). The primary end point was incidence of invasive fungal infection, and the secondary end points were adverse events of prophylactic micafungin and mortality during induction therapy. RESULTS: The 65 patients (median age = 51 years, male:female = 34:31) enrolled in this study had diagnoses of AML (33, 50.8%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (31, 47.7%), and acute biphenotypic leukemia (1, 1.5%). Median duration of micafungin treatment was 24 days (range 1-68), with proven invasive fungal disease in one patient (1.5%) and possible fungal infection in two patients (3.1%). Three of the patients (4.6%) experienced the following adverse events, but all events were tolerable: liver function abnormality (Grade 2, n = 1; Grade 3, n = 1) and allergic reaction (Grade 2, n = 1). Three patients died during induction therapy, and invasive aspergillosis pneumonia was the cause of death for one of those patients. Overall, 19 patients (29.2%) discontinued prophylactic micafungin, and 18 (27.7%) patients switched to another antifungal agent. We observed no fungal infections caused by amphotericin B-resistant organisms. In AML patients, outcomes of prophylactic micafungin during induction chemotherapy did not differ significantly with those of prophylactic posaconazole with regard to incidence of fungal infections, rate of discontinuation, or safety. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that prophylactic micafungin is safe and effective in patients with acute leukemia undergoing induction chemotherapy. Outcomes in patients with AML were similar to those of prophylactic posaconazole, indicating the usefulness of micafungin as a prophylactic antifungal agent during induction chemotherapy for AML.

Although AMegLs are specifically characterized and typically diagnosed by megakaryoblastic expansion, recent advancements in molecular analysis have highlighted the heterogeneity of this disease, with specific cytogenic and genetic alterations characterizing different disease subtypes. Areas covered: This review will focus on describing recurrent molecular variations in both DS and non-DS pediatric AMegL, their role in promoting leukemogenesis, their association with different clinical aspects and prognosis, and finally, their influence on future treatment strategies with a number of specific drugs beyond conventional chemotherapy already under development. Expert opinion: Deep understanding of the genetic and molecular landscape of AMegL will lead to better and more precise disease classification in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and possible targeted therapies. Development of new therapeutic approaches based on these molecular characteristics will hopefully improve AMegL patient outcomes.","['De Marchi, Federico', 'Araki, Marito', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['De Marchi F', 'Araki M', 'Komatsu N']","['a Department of Hematology , Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.', 'b Department of Transfusion Medicine and Stem Cell Regulation , Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.', 'a Department of Hematology , Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190427,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Disease Management', 'Down Syndrome/complications/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AMegL prognosis', '*GATA1', '*Megakaryopoiesis', '*cytogenetic translocations', '*down syndrome', '*novel treatments', '*pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia']",,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/05/22 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1609351 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 May;12(5):285-293. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1609351.

Immunogenic cell death (ICD) may contribute to the efficacy of anthracyclines in solid cancer, but the impact of ICD in AML is only partly explored. We assessed aspects of ICD, as reflected by calreticulin expression, in primary human AML blasts and observed induction of surface calreticulin upon exposure to daunorubicin but not to cytarabine. We next assessed immune phenotypes in AML patients in complete remission (CR), following consolidation chemotherapy with or without anthracyclines. These patients subsequently received immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and IL-2. Patients who had received anthracyclines for consolidation showed enhanced frequencies of CD8(+) TEM cells in blood along with improved survival. We propose that the choice of consolidation therapy prior to AML immunotherapy may determine clinical outcome.","['Aurelius, Johan', 'Mollgard, Lars', 'Kiffin, Roberta', 'Ewald Sander, Frida', 'Nilsson, Staffan', 'Thoren, Fredrik Bergh', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer', 'Martner, Anna']","['Aurelius J', 'Mollgard L', 'Kiffin R', 'Ewald Sander F', 'Nilsson S', 'Thoren FB', 'Hellstrand K', 'Martner A']","['TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190417,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*mortality', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*anthracycline', '*consolidation chemotherapy', '*cytarabine', '*cytotoxic T cells', '*immunotherapy']",,2019/04/18 06:00,2020/08/29 06:00,['2019/04/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1599110 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Nov;60(11):2771-2778. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1599110.

Using structure-based rational design, we have developed two promising FTO inhibitors, namely FB23 and FB23-2, which directly bind to FTO and selectively inhibit FTO's m(6)A demethylase activity. Mimicking FTO depletion, FB23-2 dramatically suppresses proliferation and promotes the differentiation/apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line cells and primary blast AML cells in vitro. Moreover, FB23-2 significantly inhibits the progression of human AML cell lines and primary cells in xeno-transplanted mice. Collectively, our data suggest that FTO is a druggable target and that targeting FTO by small-molecule inhibitors holds potential to treat AML.","['Huang, Yue', 'Su, Rui', 'Sheng, Yue', 'Dong, Lei', 'Dong, Ze', 'Xu, Hongjiao', 'Ni, Tengfeng', 'Zhang, Zijie Scott', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Li, Chenying', 'Han, Li', 'Zhu, Zhenyun', 'Lian, Fulin', 'Wei, Jiangbo', 'Deng, Qiangqiang', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Gao, Zhiwei', 'Pan, Guoyu', 'Zhong, Dafang', 'Zhou, Hu', 'Zhang, Naixia', 'Gan, Jianhua', 'Jiang, Hualiang', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Qian, Zhijian', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Yang, Cai-Guang']","['Huang Y', 'Su R', 'Sheng Y', 'Dong L', 'Dong Z', 'Xu H', 'Ni T', 'Zhang ZS', 'Zhang T', 'Li C', 'Han L', 'Zhu Z', 'Lian F', 'Wei J', 'Deng Q', 'Wang Y', 'Wunderlich M', 'Gao Z', 'Pan G', 'Zhong D', 'Zhou H', 'Zhang N', 'Gan J', 'Jiang H', 'Mulloy JC', 'Qian Z', 'Chen J', 'Yang CG']","['State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China;

Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we found a synthetic lethal interaction between Wnt pathway activation and asparaginase in acute leukemias resistant to this enzyme. Wnt pathway activation induced asparaginase sensitivity in distinct treatment-resistant subtypes of acute leukemia, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Sensitization to asparaginase was mediated by Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-dependent protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, a catabolic source of asparagine. Inhibiting the alpha isoform of GSK3 phenocopied this effect, and pharmacologic GSK3alpha inhibition profoundly sensitized drug-resistant leukemias to asparaginase. Our findings provide a molecular rationale for activation of Wnt/STOP signaling to improve the therapeutic index of asparaginase.","['Hinze, Laura', 'Pfirrmann, Maren', 'Karim, Salmaan', 'Degar, James', 'McGuckin, Connor', 'Vinjamur, Divya', 'Sacher, Joshua', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Orellana, Esteban', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Gregory, Richard I', 'Bauer, Daniel E', 'Wagner, Florence F', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro']","['Hinze L', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Karim S', 'Degar J', 'McGuckin C', 'Vinjamur D', 'Sacher J', 'Stevenson KE', 'Neuberg DS', 'Orellana E', 'Stanulla M', 'Gregory RI', 'Bauer DE', 'Wagner FF', 'Stegmaier K', 'Gutierrez A']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover 30625, Germany."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02445, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02445, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover 30625, Germany.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02445, USA."", 'Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02445, USA; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02445, USA; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

The selectivity was explained by a partial gamma-catenin dependence of MYC expression together with the susceptibility of B-ALL, but not CML, to reduced MYC levels. MYC and gamma-catenin enabled B-ALL maintenance by augmenting BIRC5 and enforced BIRC5 expression overcame gamma-catenin loss.

For this, N-doped carbon nanospheres decorated with palladium were first developed, and subsequently, a molecular imprinted polymer layer was grown onto their surfaces. The so-produced silica-embedded nanocomposite was made hollow by etching silica moieties with hydrofluoric acid. Finally, the whole system was doped on an ionic-liquid-modified pencil graphite electrode. The underlying synergistic effect of hollow carbon nanosphere-supported palladium nanoparticles inculcated electrocatalytic action. Notably, all rebinding sites in solid core-shells were confined within the shell, which hampers the effective diffusion of template. However, in this work, an effective diffusion of template across the hollow structure of inner and outer surfaces was observed. Consequently, this rendered approximately 2-fold heterogeneous rate constant as compared to the solid core-shell-based sensor. Differential pulse voltammetric transduction was used for ultratrace detection of 6-mercaptopurine through anodic stripping method. The hollow imprinted sensor revealed a linear dependence of current with concentration range 0.80-70.748 ng mL(-1). The limits of detection 0.11-0.22 ng mL(-1) were realized in water, human blood plasma, urine, and pharmaceuticals.

Our objective was to test the relevance of cell quality control mechanisms for SCs maintenance, differentiation and resistance to cell death. We compared cell quality control in P19 stem cells (P19SCs) before and after differentiation (P19dCs). Differentiation of P19SCs resulted in alterations in parameters involved in cell survival and protein homeostasis, including the redox system, cardiolipin and lipid profiles, unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal systems, and signaling pathways controlling cell growth. In addition, P19SCs pluripotency was correlated with stronger antioxidant protection, modulation of apoptosis, and activation of macroautophagy, which all contributed to preserve SCs quality by increasing the threshold for cell death activation. Furthermore, our findings identify critical roles for the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway, as well as autophagic flux and apoptosis regulation in the maintenance of P19SCs pluripotency and differentiation potential.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine;

However, the understanding of its contribution to pancreatic cancer (PC) is insufficient. The effects of miR-1225 on PC cell survival and tumorigenesis in vivo as well as on the modulation of cell apoptosis were investigated. The expression of miR-1225 was upregulated in 20 human LC samples from acute myeloid leukemia patients with adverse prognosis and poor responses to therapy as well as in several human PC cell lines, as compared to that in healthy tissues, normal tissues, and normal pancreatic cells. In contrast, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) expression was downregulated in human-derived PC samples and PC cell lines. EdU staining demonstrated that the aberrant expression of miR-1225 impaired the proliferation and survival of these two PC cell lines. The depletion of miR-1225 expression increased the apoptosis of both PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells, as revealed by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry results. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-1225 targeted the 3'-untranslated region of JAK1 for silencing. Silencing of JAK1 expression counteracted the suppressive influence of miR-1225 depletion in PC cells. Thus, these results offer an insight into the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of PC and provide potential strategies for PC treatment.","['Zhong, Ruolei', 'Li, Sheng', 'Fang, Kaifeng', 'Yang, Liu', 'Wang, Li']","['Zhong R', 'Li S', 'Fang K', 'Yang L', 'Wang L']","['a Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'b Department of General Surgery , The Sixth Hospital of Wuhan, Affiliated Hospital of Jianghan University , Wuhan , China.', 'c Department of General Surgery , Hosiptal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'd Department of Emergency Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'e Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'd Department of Emergency Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190424,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN1225 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC6527280,['NOTNLM'],"['*JAK1', '*Pancreatic cancer', '*apoptosis', '*miR-1225-5p']",,2019/04/17 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2019.1608127 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2019 May;18(9):990-1000. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2019.1608127.

Exploration of alternatives production systems like as extracellular expression in microorganisms generally recognized as safe (such as Pichia pastoris Glycoswitch((R))) could be advantageous, in particular, if this system is able to produce homogeneous glycosylation. Here, we evaluated extracellular expression into Glycoswitch((R)) using two different strains constructions containing the asnB gene coding for Erwinia chrysanthemi L-ASNase (with and without His-tag), in order to find the best system for producing the extracellular and biologically active protein. When the His-tag was absent, both cell expression and protein secretion processes were considerably improved. Three-dimensional modeling of the protein suggests that additional structures (His-tag) could adversely affect native conformation and folding from L-ASNase and therefore the expression and cell secretion of this enzyme.","['Effer, Brian', 'Lima, Guilherme Meira', 'Cabarca, Sindy', 'Pessoa, Adalberto', 'Farias, Jorge G', 'Monteiro, Gisele']","['Effer B', 'Lima GM', 'Cabarca S', 'Pessoa A', 'Farias JG', 'Monteiro G']","['a Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Sciences , Universidad de La Frontera , Francisco Salazar , Chile.', 'b Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo , Brazil.', 'b Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo , Brazil.', 'c Department of Microbiology, Laboratory of Applied Structural Biology , University of Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo , Brazil.', 'd Institute of Biology , University of Campinas , Campinas , Brazil.', 'b Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo , Brazil.', 'a Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Sciences , Universidad de La Frontera , Francisco Salazar , Chile.', 'b Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo , Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190416,England,Prep Biochem Biotechnol,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,9607037,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/chemistry/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular/*methods', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/chemistry/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Glycosylation', 'Models, Molecular', 'Pichia/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Glycoswitch', 'His-tag', 'L-Asparaginase', 'extracellular expression']",,2019/04/17 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10826068.2019.1599396 [doi]'],ppublish,Prep Biochem Biotechnol. 2019;49(7):679-685. doi: 10.1080/10826068.2019.1599396.

Assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) was an exploratory objective. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed CP CML were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily bosutinib 400 mg or imatinib 400 mg as first-line therapy. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) and EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires at baseline, every 3 months for the first 24 months of treatment, every 6 months thereafter, and at treatment completion. We report PRO results at month 12 in the mITT population (bosutinib: n = 246; imatinib: n = 241). RESULTS: Mean FACT-Leu combined and subscale scores were similar at baseline in the bosutinib and imatinib arms; at month 12, all scores demonstrated improvement or maintenance of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in both treatment arms. Repeated-measures mixed-effects models showed no significant difference between bosutinib and imatinib for any FACT-Leu score. Functional health status, as measured by EQ-5D, also demonstrated improvement or maintenance with bosutinib and imatinib at month 12. CONCLUSIONS: Similar improvements in PROs compared with baseline were seen after 12 months of treatment with first-line bosutinib or imatinib in the BFORE trial. Newly diagnosed patients with CP CML receiving bosutinib or imatinib can preserve or improve HRQoL during treatment, although clinical efficacy was superior with bosutinib.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Crescenzo, Rocco', 'Mamolo, Carla', 'Reisman, Arlene', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Cortes JE', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Deininger MW', 'Mauro MJ', 'Chuah C', 'Kim DW', 'Milojkovic D', 'le Coutre P', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Crescenzo R', 'Mamolo C', 'Reisman A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Brummendorf TH']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org.', 'University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', ""Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20190415,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage', '*Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Quality of Life', 'Quinolines/*administration & dosage', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bosutinib', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Health-related quality of life', '*Imatinib', '*Patient-reported outcomes']",,2019/04/17 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-019-02894-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-019-02894-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2019 Jun;145(6):1589-1599. doi: 10.1007/s00432-019-02894-3.

METHODS: Herein, we report a 23-year-old woman with severe pancytopenia diagnosed with non-LCH following presentation with pancytopenia and marrow examination showing histiocytosis positive for CD45, CD68, CD136, and lysozyme but negative for CD1a, langerin, and S100. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing showed RUNX1 mutation and NF1 mutation. In the ensuing 6 months, she developed hepatosplenomegaly, and repeat bone marrow evaluation was diagnostic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Repeat mutational analysis showed again presence of RUNX1 mutation. She underwent induction therapy but died of septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of RUNX1 mutation in both non-LCH and AML bone marrow specimens at differing time points is suggestive of a biologic association of both distinct disease entities.","['Al Mugairi, Areej', 'Al Turki, Saeed', 'Salama, Hind', 'Al Ahmadi, Khlood', 'Abuelgasim, Khadeja A', 'Damlaj, Moussab']","['Al Mugairi A', 'Al Turki S', 'Salama H', 'Al Ahmadi K', 'Abuelgasim KA', 'Damlaj M']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Abdul Aziz Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, KSA.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Abdul Aziz Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, KSA.', 'Division of Hematology and HSCT, Department of Oncology, King Abdul Aziz Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, KSA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Abdul Aziz Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.', 'Division of Hematology and HSCT, Department of Oncology, King Abdul Aziz Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, KSA.', 'King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, KSA.', 'Division of Hematology and HSCT, Department of Oncology, King Abdul Aziz Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, KSA.', 'King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, KSA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neurofibromin 1/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* RUNX1', '*AML', '*NF-1', '*Non-LCH']",,2019/04/17 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['5467236 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz018 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 May 3;151(6):638-646. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz018.,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

METHODS: Image analysis was applied to 768 images from 15 different types of lymphoid cells and monocytes to determine four discriminant descriptors. For each descriptor, numerical scales were obtained using 627 images from 79 patients. An assessment of the four descriptors was performed using smears from 209 new patients. RESULTS: Cyan correlation of the nucleus identified clumped chromatin, and standard deviation of the granulometric curve of the cyan of the nucleus was specific for cerebriform chromatin. Skewness of the histogram of the u component of the cytoplasm identified cytoplasmic granulation. Hairiness showed specificity for cytoplasmic villi. In the assessment, 96% of the smears were correctly classified. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative descriptors obtained through image analysis may contribute to the morphologic identification of the abnormal lymphoid cells considered in this article.","['Puigvi, Laura', 'Merino, Anna', 'Alferez, Santiago', 'Boldu, Laura', 'Acevedo, Andrea', 'Rodellar, Jose']","['Puigvi L', 'Merino A', 'Alferez S', 'Boldu L', 'Acevedo A', 'Rodellar J']","['Biomedical Diagnostic Centre, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Mathematics, Barcelona Est Engineering School, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Diagnostic Centre, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Mathematics, Barcelona Est Engineering School, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Diagnostic Centre, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Mathematics, Barcelona Est Engineering School, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Mathematics, Barcelona Est Engineering School, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,['0 (Chromatin)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Chromatin/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/pathology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Blood morphology', '*Computer-based image analysis', '*Hematopathology']",,2019/04/17 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['5467104 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz025 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Jun 5;152(1):74-85. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz025.,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Potentially, these substitutions can affect the 3D structure of these epitopes leading to their diminished immunoreactivity. The aim of this study was to express three gp51 glycoproteins carrying mutated epitopes as recombinant baculovirus proteins in insect cells to test their immunoreactivity with bovine sera. Material and Methods: Env gene chimeras encoding mutated epitopes G and H in the env backbone of BLV FLK strain were constructed, cloned into pFastBac1 vector, and expressed in baculovirus. Results: The presence of recombinant gp51 protein in Sf9 insect cells was confirmed using monoclonal antibodies. ELISA tests were developed to check the immunoreactivity of recombinant protein with bovine sera. Conclusion: Recombinant gp51 proteins with altered G and H epitopes can be used for further studies to analyse the serological response of bovine sera towards BLV antigenic variants.","['Rola-Luszczak, Marzena', 'Grabowska, Agnieszka', 'Szewczyk, Boguslaw', 'Kuzmak, Jacek']","['Rola-Luszczak M', 'Grabowska A', 'Szewczyk B', 'Kuzmak J']","['Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Pulawy Poland.', 'Laboratory for Recombinant Vaccines, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, 80-309 Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Laboratory for Recombinant Vaccines, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, 80-309 Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Pulawy Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190322,Poland,J Vet Res,Journal of veterinary research,101696630,,,,PMC6458546,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine leukaemia virus', 'conformational epitopes', 'recombinant baculovirus protein']","['Conflict of Interest Conflict of Interests Statement: The authors declare that', 'there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.']",2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2478/jvetres-2019-0020 [doi]', 'jvetres-2019-0020 [pii]']",epublish,J Vet Res. 2019 Mar 22;63(1):1-6. doi: 10.2478/jvetres-2019-0020. eCollection 2019 Mar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and immunophenotypic characteristics and survival rate of CLL patients. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Nanakaly Hospital for Blood Diseases & Oncology in Erbil, Iraq, between January 2011 and December 2017. A total of 105 CLL patients were assessed to determine clinical presentation and staging, immunophenotype and survival rate. Results: The median age of the patients was 65 years and 63.8% were male. The main clinical presentations were splenomegaly (64.8%), pallor (61.9%) and lymphadenopathy (60%). More than half of the patients presented at an advanced clinical stage according to the Rai and Binet staging systems (59.1% and 55.2%, respectively). All CLL cases expressed both cluster of differentiation (CD)19 and CD5, 67.6% had monoclonal kappa light chains and 21% expressed CD38. The five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 61.3%. The mean duration of five-year survival was 41.3 months (95% confidence interval: 36.4-46.3 months). There were no correlations between survival and sociodemographic, clinical or laboratory characteristics. Conclusion: In comparison to the existing Western literature, Iraqi CLL patients more frequently presented with hepatosplenomegaly and at a more advanced clinical stage. In addition, the five-year OS rate was much lower.","['Hasan, Kawa M']",['Hasan KM'],"['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Hawler Medical University, Erbil, Iraq.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Nanakaly Hospital for Blood Diseases & Oncology, Erbil, Iraq.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190328,Oman,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,101519915,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Iraq/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/*trends']",PMC6443287,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Iraq', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders', 'Survival Rates']",['CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],2019/04/17 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.18295/squmj.2018.18.04.006 [doi]', 'squmj1811-e461-467 [pii]']",ppublish,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J. 2018 Nov;18(4):e461-e467. doi: 10.18295/squmj.2018.18.04.006.

A retrospective analysis of 207 children with ALL who were admitted to the People's Hospital of Pingyi County from March 2014 to June 2017 was carried out. According to the subtype of the disease, the children were divided into two groups. B-lineage group: ALL occurred in B-lineage lymphocytes (n=128); T-lineage group: ALL occurred in T-lineage lymphocytes (n=79). According to the disease course, the children were divided into three groups. High-risk group: disease course >15 days (n=67); moderate-risk group: disease course >8 and <15 days (n=58); low-risk group: disease course <8 days (n=82). The plasma concentration, calcium formyltetrahydrofolate (CF) rescue times and adverse reactions were compared at 12 h (T1), 48 h (T2), and 72 h (T3) after MTX infusion. The plasma concentration in B-lineage group was significantly higher than that in the T-lineage group at T2 and T3 (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in children with ALL in the B-lineage group was significantly higher than that in the T-lineage group (P<0.05). The CF rescue times in high-risk group were more than that in moderate- and low-risk groups (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the moderate- and low-risk groups (P<0.05), and in the moderate-risk group was significantly higher than that in the low-risk group (P<0.05). Compared with T-lineage ALL children, high-dose MTX causes more toxic injury to B-lineage ALL children. During clinical application of MTX in the treatment of ALL, close attention should be paid to the changes of the vital signs of patients, and timely CF rescue should be performed.","['Gong, Fangwei', 'Meng, Qingjun', 'Liu, Chengjuan', 'Zhao, Yeqi']","['Gong F', 'Meng Q', 'Liu C', 'Zhao Y']","[""Ward 2, Department of Pediatrics, The People's Hospital of Pingyi County, Linyi, Shandong 273300, P.R.

Following viral infection with HTLV-1, certain infected cells exhibit clonal proliferation. Additional genetic and epigenetic changes in these clonally proliferating cells provide them with the selective advantage of growth, which eventually results in ATL. The precise mechanism, however, has yet to be completely elucidated. It has previously been established that APOBEC3 enzymes are potent host-antiviral restriction factors. Conversely, previous studies have reported that the A3B level is increased in tumor virus infections, such as those caused by HBV and HPV, suggesting that A3B exerts a function as a mutagen. Therefore, the present study analyzed the expression of APOBEC3 family members in various HTLV-1 infection states. No significant differences were observed in the expression between healthy donors and patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. Although no significant changes in the expressions of A3C, A3D, A3F and A3G between uninfected and HTLV-1-infected mice were observed, an increased A3B expression was observed in a short-term humanized mouse model following HTLV-1 infection. In a long-term humanized mouse model following HTLV-1 infection, the gene expression array data exhibited an apparent increase in A3B and CADM1, which are indicators of ATL. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that A3B is likely involved in the development of ATL in HTLV-1-infected humanized mice.","['Yao, Jinchun', 'Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Takenouchi, Norihiro', 'Ren, Yihua', 'Lee, Sung-Il', 'Fujisawa, Jun-Ichi']","['Yao J', 'Tanaka M', 'Takenouchi N', 'Ren Y', 'Lee SI', 'Fujisawa JI']","['Department of Microbiology, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka 573-1010, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka 573-1010, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima 890-8544, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka 573-1010, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka 573-1010, Japan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Science, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka 573-1010, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka 573-1010, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190313,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,PMC6447809,['NOTNLM'],"['APOBEC3', 'HTLV-1', 'HTLV-1-associated myelopathy', 'humanized mice model']",,2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2019.7375 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-7375 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2019 May;17(5):3701-3708. doi: 10.3892/etm.2019.7375.

However, recurrence remains a challenge, and reinfusion of CAR-T cells is not always effective. Sequential infusion of humanized CD19-modified and CD22-modified CAR-T cells may overcome this issue and induce remission. Methods: We examined treatment with sequential infusion of humanized CD19-modified and CD22-modified CAR-T cells in a patient with relapsed ALL previously exposed to murine-derived anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. Results: At ~6 weeks after treatment, repeated bone marrow smear and flow cytometry analysis revealed no lymphoblasts. Conclusion: Our results suggest that sequential infusion of humanized CD19-modified and CD22-modified CAR-T cells is a valuable option for relapsed patients with prior infusion of murine-derived, CD19-directed CAR-T cells.","['Yang, Fei', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Zhang, Xinyou', 'Tian, Mengli', 'Wang, Jingjing', 'Kang, Liqing', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Wu, Depei']","['Yang F', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang X', 'Tian M', 'Wang J', 'Kang L', 'Qiu H', 'Wu D']","[""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China, pursueyf08@126.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China, pursueyf08@126.com."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Clinical Medical College of Jinan University (Shenzhen People's Hospital), Jinan University, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China, pursueyf08@126.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China, pursueyf08@126.com."", ""Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China, pursueyf08@126.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China, pursueyf08@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190325,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6438143,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'anti-CD19', 'anti-CD22', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'humanized', 'relapsed']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S189103 [doi]', 'ott-12-2187 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Mar 25;12:2187-2191. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S189103. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission for patients younger than 60 years, who are candidates for standard induction therapy, is achieved in 60%-80% of cases. However, the prognosis is still poor for older patients, who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy, and only a few therapies are available. Hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine, are approved for such patients. The current dosing regimen consists of one administration per day, for 5 days, each 4 weeks. Methods: Here, we present the synthesis of a decitabine prodrug, combined with its encapsulation into a lipid-based nanocapsule formulation. Decitabine (C12)2 was synthetized, then loaded into nanocapsules. Its stability in phosphate buffer ans human plasma was checked. Its activity was evaluated by Cell proliferation assays and cell-cycle analysis on human erythroleukemia cells. Then its pharmacokinetics was determined on a rat model. Results: Decitabine (C12)2 was obtained with a yield of 50%. Drug loading into nanocarriers of 27.45+/-0.05 nm was 5.8+/-0.5 mg/mL. The stability of decitabine was improved and its activity on leukemia cells was not altered. Finally, pharmacokinetics studies showed a prolonged mean residence time of the drug. Conclusion: Decitabine (C12)2 as a prodrug showed high encapsulation efficiency, a good stability in plasma with no impact on its activity on leukemia cells and improved pharmacokinetics.","['Briot, Thomas', 'Roger, Emilie', 'Bou Haidar, Naila', 'Bejaud, Jerome', 'Lautram, Nolwenn', 'Guillet, Catherine', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Legeay, Samuel', 'Lagarce, Frederic']","['Briot T', 'Roger E', 'Bou Haidar N', 'Bejaud J', 'Lautram N', 'Guillet C', 'Thepot S', 'Legeay S', 'Lagarce F']","['Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, University of Angers, MINT IBS-CHU, Larrey, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'University Hospital of Angers, Pharmacy Department, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, University of Angers, MINT IBS-CHU, Larrey, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, University of Angers, MINT IBS-CHU, Larrey, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, University of Angers, MINT IBS-CHU, Larrey, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, University of Angers, MINT IBS-CHU, Larrey, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'University of Angers, Molecular and Cellular Analysis Platform, IBS-CHU, 49933 Angers, France.', 'University Hospital of Angers, Hematology, 49933 Angers, France.', 'INSERM CRCINA, University of Angers, 49933 Angers, France.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, University of Angers, MINT IBS-CHU, Larrey, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, University of Angers, MINT IBS-CHU, Larrey, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.', 'University Hospital of Angers, Pharmacy Department, 49933 Angers, France, frederic.lagarce@univ-angers.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190326,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Nanocapsules)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Decitabine/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Nanocapsules/*administration & dosage', 'Plasma/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6440450,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'decitabine', 'lipid nanocapsules', 'nanomedicines', 'prodrugs']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2019/04/17 06:00,2019/05/31 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S190482 [doi]', 'ijn-14-2091 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2019 Mar 26;14:2091-2102. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S190482. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two tumor necrosis factor family proteins BAFF and APRIL and their receptors BAFF-R, TACI and BCMA are considered to play a critical role in the survival of normal B cells. In order to highlight the pathophysiological role of this complicated biological network, we aimed to analyze the potential prognostic effects of BAFF, APRIL, TACI and BCMA in CLL patients. We investigated the prognostic impact of serum BCMA, TACI, BAFF and APRIL levels in 129 newly diagnosed CLL patients [median age: 64 (39-88) years; male/female: 85/44]. Serum BAFF, TACI and BCMA levels were significantly lower in the patient group compared to the control group (p < 0.001), while serum APRIL level did not differ significantly between two groups (p > 0.05). Serum BCMA [(p = 0.029; r = 0.208)] and TACI levels [(p = 0.011; r = 0.241)] were positively correlated with serum free light chain ratio. Serum BAFF [(p = 0.008; r = - 0.236)] and BCMA [(p = 0.042; r = - 0.183)] levels were negatively correlated with Rai stage. Overall survival (OS) was relatively better in patients with low serum BAFF levels [60 (1-187) months vs 39.5 (0-256) months; p = 0.063]. Probability of OS was higher in patients with low BAFF levels when compared to patients with normal levels, without statistical significance (53.6% vs 23.6%; p > 0.05). Large prospective studies are needed to validate the prognostic role of this essential biological pathway in CLL.","['Berke Mentese, Ilay', 'Yegin, Zeynep Arzu', 'Gokcen, Sanem', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde Nur', 'Yagci, Munci']","['Berke Mentese I', 'Yegin ZA', 'Gokcen S', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Yagci M']","['1Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.0000 0001 2169 7132grid.25769.3f', '2Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.0000 0001 2169 7132grid.25769.3f', '2Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.0000 0001 2169 7132grid.25769.3f', '2Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.0000 0001 2169 7132grid.25769.3f', '2Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.0000 0001 2169 7132grid.25769.3f']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181010,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC6439071,['NOTNLM'],"['APRIL', 'BAFF', 'BCMA', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'TACI']","['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.All procedures', 'performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the', 'ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964', 'Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical', 'standards.This article does not contain any studies with animals performed by any', 'of the authors.Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants', 'included in the study.']",2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-1029-7 [doi]', '1029 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Apr;35(2):265-271. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-1029-7.

The cost of ibrutinib is still prohibitive for most Indian CLL patients. We report here for the first time dose reductions due to the patient preference of financial toxicity. We prospectively followed up patients of CLL receiving ibrutinib at a tertiary referral center in India. The period of study was from April 2016 to April 2018. Reduced dose ibrutinib was defined as a sustained (>/= 12 months) dosing at < 420 mg/day, either at treatment initiation or within 3 months from starting therapy. Progression free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. There were a total of three patients on reduced dose and twelve patients on standard dose ibrutinib. Two patients discontinued standard dose ibrutinib due to adverse events. The patient age, cytogenetics, number of prior therapies and follow-up were not significantly different between the two groups. The rate of >/= grade3 adverse events was significantly different between the two groups. The overall response rate and median PFS were also not significantly different between the two groups. In the limited patient numbers and follow-up period we show that outcomes of reduced dose ibrutinib are comparable to standard dose ibrutinib but with fewer adverse events. This study provides a proof of concept that a subset of patients might do well on reduced dose ibrutinib.","['Lad, Deepesh P', 'Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Khadwal, Alka', 'Prakash, Gaurav', 'Jain, Arihant', 'Varma, Subhash']","['Lad DP', 'Malhotra P', 'Khadwal A', 'Prakash G', 'Jain A', 'Varma S']","['Clinical Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', 'Clinical Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', 'Clinical Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', 'Clinical Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', 'Clinical Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', 'Clinical Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180908,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC6439022,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Financial toxicity', 'Ibrutinib', 'Reduced dose']","['The authors report no conflict of interest.All procedures performed in studies', 'involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the', 'institutional ethics committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its', 'later amendments or comparable ethical standards.Informed consent was obtained', 'from all individual participants included in the study.']",2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-1011-4 [doi]', '1011 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Apr;35(2):260-264. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-1011-4.

The treatment of these patients is quite challenging due to various reasons including the need for extensive supportive care, and high cost of therapy. Reports on outcomes from India are few. METHODS: We analyzed 93 adult patients (>/= 18 years) with AML who were treated with curative intent between 2007 and 2014. Patients received daunorubicin at dose of 60-90 mg/m(2) and cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) during induction and consolidation with 3 courses of high dose cytarabine (1.5-3 g/m(2)per dose for 6 doses per cycle). Only 4 patients underwent consolidation allogenic stem cell transplantation in first remission (CR1). RESULTS: The median age was 37 (18-66) years; males: 52%. Conventional cytogenetics (N = 63) showed 23% (N = 15), 56% (N = 35), 27% (N = 13) in good, intermediate risk and poor risk category respectively. FLT3-ITD was positive in 12/33 (36%) and NPM mutation in 7/23 (30%). Daunorubicin dose was 60 mg/m(2) in 75% (N = 70) and 90 mg/m(2) in 25% (N = 23) patients. Induction mortality was 17% (16/93) [60 mg/m(2):19% (13/70), and 90 mg/m(2):13% (3/23); p = 0.39)]. Complete remission was achieved by 60% (56/93) [60 mg/m(2):53% (37/70), and 90 mg/m(2):83% (19/23); p = 0.09)]. The median overall survival was 9.2 months and the actuarial survival at 2 years was 30%. By univariate analysis, FLT3-ITD positivity, white cell counts higher than 100,000/mm(3) at presentation, and use of lower dose of daunorubicin in induction were associated with poorer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in adult AML are generally poor. Many patients with high risk disease don't receive allogenic transplantation in CR1. Increased availability of allogenic stem cell transplantation may help to improve outcomes.","['Kalaiyarasi, Jayachandran Perumal', 'Ganesan, Prasanth', 'Kannan, Krishnarathinam', 'Ganesan, Trivadi S', 'Radhakrishnan, Venkatraman', 'Dhanushkodi, Manikandan', 'Krupashankar, S', 'Mehra, Nikita', 'Sagar, Tenali Gnana']","['Kalaiyarasi JP', 'Ganesan P', 'Kannan K', 'Ganesan TS', 'Radhakrishnan V', 'Dhanushkodi M', 'Krupashankar S', 'Mehra N', 'Sagar TG']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), 36, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, Tamilnadu India.grid.418600.b']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181001,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC6439037,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Daunorubicin', 'India', 'Mortality', 'Outcomes', 'Risk stratification']","['Compliance with ethical standardsThe authors declare that they have no conflict', 'of interest.']",2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-1023-0 [doi]', '1023 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Apr;35(2):248-254. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-1023-0.

Current treatment approach for Ph + ALL is chemotherapy along with TKI and CNS directed therapy followed by Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT). To analyze outcome of Ph + ALL with or without Allo-SCT in the era of universal TKI uses. Retrospectively reviewed medical records of 267 patients who were diagnosed and treated for ALL during study period at our centre. Fifty-one Ph + ALL patients (males = 31, females = 20) out of a total of 267 ALL patients were eligible for the study. Post induction 48 patients achieved complete remission while 1 died during induction. Forty-six patients received further treatment with TKI + CNS directed therapy and thereafter the consolidation therapy with Allo-SCT (n = 16) or chemotherapy + TKI (n = 30).Overall mortality was 7/51 (13.9%) (6/16 transplant related mortalities due to GVHD and infections and 1 induction death). Fifteen out of 46 patients (32.6%) had relapse (1/10 relapse after Allo-SCT vs. 14/24 after chemotherapy) on or after consolidation therapy. At a median follow-up of 17.5 months (2-58 months) of cohort, the median EFS was 22 months (95% CI 10.4-33.5 months). The estimated 4 year EFS and PFS in Allo-SCT versus chemotherapy only group was 36.0 +/- 17.9 versus 27.3 +/- 9.1% (p = 0.21) and 75 +/- 21.7 versus 34.1 +/- 10.9% (p = 0.02) respectively. Allo-SCT groups has a better progression free survival than chemotherapy group only. Preventing treatment related mortality can further improve outcome after Allo-SCT Ph + ALL.","['Agrawal, Narendra', 'Verma, Priyanka', 'Yadav, Neha', 'Ahmed, Rayaz', 'Mehta, Pallavi', 'Soni, Priyanka', 'Francis, Shinto', 'Bhurani, Dinesh']","['Agrawal N', 'Verma P', 'Yadav N', 'Ahmed R', 'Mehta P', 'Soni P', 'Francis S', 'Bhurani D']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, 110085 India.0000 0004 1767 8280grid.418913.6']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180901,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC6439021,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic stem cell transplant', 'Chemotherapy with TKI', 'Philadelphia positive ALL']","['Narendra Agrawal, Priyanka Verma, Neha Yadav, Rayaz Ahmed, Pallavi Mehta,', 'Priyanka Soni, Shinto Francis, Dinesh Bhurani declare that they have no conflict', 'of interest.The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board.All', 'procedures performed in study involving human participants were in accordance', 'with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research', 'committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or', 'comparable ethical standards.This is a retrospective study hence for this type of', 'study formal consent is not required.']",2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-1005-2 [doi]', '1005 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Apr;35(2):240-247. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-1005-2.

Here, we provide a comprehensive quantitative understanding of AML proteomic heterogeneities and hallmarks by using the AML Proteome Atlas, a proteomics database that we have newly derived from MetaGalaxy analyses, for the proteomic profiling of 205 patients with AML and 111 leukaemia cell lines. The analysis of the dataset revealed 154 functional patterns based on common molecular pathways, 11 constellations of correlated functional patterns and 13 signatures that stratify the outcomes of patients. We find limited overlap between proteomics data and both cytogenetics and genetic mutations. Moreover, leukaemia cell lines show limited proteomic similarities with cells from patients with AML, suggesting that a deeper focus on patient-derived samples is needed to gain disease-relevant insights. The AML Proteome Atlas provides a knowledge base for proteomic patterns in AML, a guide to leukaemia cell line selection, and a broadly applicable computational approach for quantifying the heterogeneities of protein expression and proteomic hallmarks in AML.","['Hu, C W', 'Qiu, Y', 'Ligeralde, A', 'Raybon, A Y', 'Yoo, S Y', 'Coombes, K R', 'Qutub, A A', 'Kornblau, S M']","['Hu CW', 'Qiu Y', 'Ligeralde A', 'Raybon AY', 'Yoo SY', 'Coombes KR', 'Qutub AA', 'Kornblau SM']","['Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. amina.qutub@utsa.edu.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA. amina.qutub@utsa.edu.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. skornblau@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190415,England,Nat Biomed Eng,Nature biomedical engineering,101696896,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proteome/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Proteomics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcriptome']",PMC7051028,,,,2019/04/17 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41551-019-0387-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41551-019-0387-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Biomed Eng. 2019 Nov;3(11):889-901. doi: 10.1038/s41551-019-0387-2.

Some AL patients will undergo ""repeat therapy"" (re-induction or salvage) due to persistent or relapsed disease. We hypothesized that prior injury to the microbiome during induction may influence dysbiosis patterns during repeat therapy. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the bacterial microbiome profiles of thrice-weekly stool samples from 20 intensively treated AL patients (first induction: 13, repeat therapy: 7) by 16S rRNA sequencing. In mixed-effects modeling, repeat therapy was a significant predictor of Enterococcus expansion (P = 0.006), independently of antibiotic exposure, disease type, feeding mode, and week of chemotherapy. Bayesian analysis of longitudinal data demonstrated larger departures of microbial communities from the pre-chemotherapy baseline during repeat therapy compared to induction. This increased ecosystem instability during repeat therapy possibly impairs colonization resistance and increases vulnerability to Enterococcus outgrowth. Microbiota restoration therapies at the end of induction or before starting subsequent therapy warrant investigation.","['Rashidi, Armin', 'Kaiser, Thomas', 'Shields-Cutler, Robin', 'Graiziger, Carolyn', 'Holtan, Shernan G', 'Rehman, Tauseef Ur', 'Wasko, Justin', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Dunny, Gary', 'Khoruts, Alexander', 'Staley, Christopher']","['Rashidi A', 'Kaiser T', 'Shields-Cutler R', 'Graiziger C', 'Holtan SG', 'Rehman TU', 'Wasko J', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Dunny G', 'Khoruts A', 'Staley C']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. arashidi@umn.edu.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'BioTechnology Institute, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Macalester College, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'BioTechnology Institute, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'BioTechnology Institute, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190415,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'DNA, Bacterial/isolation & purification', 'Dysbiosis/chemically induced/diagnosis/*microbiology', 'Enterococcus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Salvage Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",PMC6465677,,,,2019/04/17 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-42652-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-42652-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Apr 15;9(1):6083. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-42652-6.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3205-3188', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2309-0083']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular mechanisms regulating expression of IL-6R are not well understood and current therapies are based on monoclonal antibody to target IL-6 signaling. Small molecule inhibitors targeting IL-6 signaling are highly desirable. Metformin specifically decreased IL-6R expression which is mediated via AMPK, mTOR, and miR34a.

Mutations in profound epigenetic regulators DNMT3A and IDH1/2 often occur concurrently in AML. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to analyze DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation and mRNA expression profiles in AML with mutations in DNMT3A and IDH1/2 (individually and in combinations). METHODS: Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina) covering 850,000 CpGs was utilized. The validation of hydroxy-/methylation data was done by pyrosequencing. HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) was used for expression examination. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering analysis of DNA hydroxy-/methylation data revealed clusters corresponding to DNMT3A and IDH1/2 mutations and CD34+ healthy controls. Samples with concurrent presence of DNMT3A and IDH1/2 mutations displayed mixed DNA hydroxy-/methylation profile with preferential clustering to healthy controls. Numbers and levels of DNA hydroxymethylation were low. Uniformly hypermethylated loci in AML patients with IDH1/2 mutations were enriched for immune response and apoptosis related genes, among which hypermethylation of granzyme B (GZMB) was found to be associated with inferior overall survival of AML patients (P= 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Distinct molecular background results in specific DNA hydroxy-/methylation profiles in AML. Site-specific DNA hydroxymethylation changes are much less frequent in AML pathogenesis compared to DNA methylation. Methylation levels of enhancer located upstream GZMB gene might contribute to AML prognostication models.","['Sestakova, Sarka', 'Krejcik, Zdenek', 'Folta, Adam', 'Cerovska, Ela', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Merkerova, Michaela Dostalova', 'Pecherkova, Pavla', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Remesova, Hana']","['Sestakova S', 'Krejcik Z', 'Folta A', 'Cerovska E', 'Salek C', 'Merkerova MD', 'Pecherkova P', 'Racil Z', 'Mayer J', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Remesova H']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

IL-15, a stromal cell-associated cytokine found within spleens and lymph nodes of B-CLL patients, significantly boosts in vitro cycling of blood-derived B-CLL cells following CpG DNA priming. Both IL-15 and CpG DNA are elevated in microbe-draining lymphatic tissues, and unraveling the basis for IL-15-driven B-CLL growth could illuminate new therapeutic targets. Using CpG DNA-primed human B-CLL clones and approaches involving both immunofluorescent staining and pharmacologic inhibitors, we show that both PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT5 pathways are activated and functionally important for IL-15-->CD122/c signaling in ODN-primed cells expressing activated pSTAT3. Furthermore, STAT5 activity must be sustained for continued cycling of CFSE-labeled B-CLL cells. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments with inhibitors of PI3K and STAT5 show that both contribute to IL-15-driven upregulation of mRNA for cyclin D2 and suppression of mRNA for DNA damage response mediators ATM, 53BP1, and MDC1. Furthermore, protein levels of these DNA damage response molecules are reduced by IL-15, as indicated by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Bioinformatics analysis of ENCODE chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data from cell lines provides insight into possible mechanisms for STAT5-mediated repression. Finally, pharmacologic inhibitors of JAKs and STAT5 significantly curtailed B-CLL cycling when added either early or late in a growth response. We discuss how the IL-15-induced changes in gene expression lead to rapid cycling and possibly enhanced mutagenesis. STAT5 inhibitors might be an effective modality for blocking B-CLL growth in patients.","['Gupta, Rashmi', 'Li, Wentian', 'Yan, Xiao J', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Mongini, Patricia K A']","['Gupta R', 'Li W', 'Yan XJ', 'Barrientos J', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai K', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Mongini PKA']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030; patricia.mongini@nau.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190415,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (MDC1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TP53BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/immunology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/immunology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D2/*immunology', 'DNA Damage/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*immunology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",PMC6548510,,,,2019/04/17 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801142 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801142 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 May 15;202(10):2924-2944. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801142.

However, its role in B-cell malignancies has not been elucidated. To describe the role of Par-4 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis, we developed a B-cell-specific human Par-4-overexpressing mouse model of CLL using the TCL1 leukemia model. While Par-4 transgenic mice did not display any obvious defects in B-cell development or function, disease burden as evidenced by abundance of CD19(+)CD5(+) B cells in the peripheral blood was significantly reduced in Par-4 x TCL1 mice compared with TCL1 littermates. This conferred a survival advantage on the Par-4-overexpressing mice. In addition, a B-cell-specific knockout model displayed the opposite effect, where lack of Par-4 expression resulted in accelerated disease progression and abbreviated survival in the TCL1 model. Histological and flow cytometry-based analysis of spleen and bone marrow upon euthanasia revealed comparable levels of malignant B-cell infiltration in Par-4 x TCL1 and TCL1 individuals, indicating delayed but pathologically normal disease progression in Par-4 x TCL1 mice. In vivo analysis of splenic B-cell proliferation by 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation indicated >50% decreased expansion of CD19(+)CD5(+) cells in Par-4 x TCL1 mice compared with TCL1 littermates. Moreover, reduced nuclear p65 levels were observed in Par-4 x TCL1 splenic B cells compared with TCL1, suggesting suppressed NF-kappaB signaling. These findings have identified an in vivo antileukemic role for Par-4 through an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism in TCL1-mediated CLL-like disease progression.","['Greene, J T', 'Mani, Rajeswaran', 'Ramaswamy, Rahul', 'Frissora, Frank', 'Yano, Max', 'Zapolnik, Kevan', 'Harrington, Bonnie', 'Wasmuth, Ronni', 'Tran, Minh', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'McKenna, Mary', 'Rangnekar, Vivek M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Bondada, Subbarao', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan']","['Greene JT', 'Mani R', 'Ramaswamy R', 'Frissora F', 'Yano M', 'Zapolnik K', 'Harrington B', 'Wasmuth R', 'Tran M', 'Mo X', 'McKenna M', 'Rangnekar VM', 'Byrd JC', 'Bondada S', 'Muthusamy N']","['The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'The James Comprehensive Cancer Center and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (prostate apoptosis response-4 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6482354,,,,2019/04/17 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018025973 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025973 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 23;3(8):1255-1266. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025973.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3482-0958'],['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,"['R01 CA197844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA159296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA165469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively studied 52 adults with biopsy-proven malignant B-cell kidney infiltration, including Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (n=21), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=11), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n=8), other lymphoma (n=11), and multiple myeloma (n=1). Kidney disease varied according to the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. In DLBCL, malignant kidney infiltration was prominent, resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI, 75%) and kidney enlargement (88%). In the other types, associated immunoglobulin-related nephropathy (most commonly AL amyloidosis) was more common (45%), and chronic kidney disease with proteinuria was the primary presentation. All patients received chemotherapy. Over a median follow-up of 31 months, 20 patients died and 21 reached end-stage kidney disease. Renal response, achieved in 25 patients (48%), was associated with higher overall survival (97 vs. 37 months in non-renal responders). In univariate analysis, percentage of sclerotic glomeruli, kidney enlargement, and complete hematological response at 6 months were predictive of renal response. In multivariate analysis, concomitant immunoglobulin-related nephropathy was the sole independent predictor of poor renal outcome. In conclusion, clinical presentation of renal lymphomatous infiltration depends on the nature of the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. In DLBCL, massive renal infiltration manifests with enlarged kidneys and AKI, and the diagnosis primarily relies on lymph node biopsy. In other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, the clinicopathological spectrum is more heterogeneous, with a high frequency of immunoglobulin-related nephropathy that may affect renal outcome; thus kidney biopsy is required for early diagnosis and prognostic assessment.","['Javaugue, Vincent', 'Debiais-Delpech, Celine', 'Nouvier, Mathilde', 'Gand, Elise', 'Chauvet, Sophie', 'Ecotiere, Laure', 'Desport, Estelle', 'Goujon, Jean-Michel', 'Delwail, Vincent', 'Guidez, Stephanie', 'Tomowiak, Cecile', 'Leleu, Xavier', 'Jaccard, Arnaud', 'Rioux-Leclerc, Nathalie', 'Vigneau, Cecile', 'Fermand, Jean-Paul', 'Touchard, Guy', 'Thierry, Antoine', 'Bridoux, Frank']","['Javaugue V', 'Debiais-Delpech C', 'Nouvier M', 'Gand E', 'Chauvet S', 'Ecotiere L', 'Desport E', 'Goujon JM', 'Delwail V', 'Guidez S', 'Tomowiak C', 'Leleu X', 'Jaccard A', 'Rioux-Leclerc N', 'Vigneau C', 'Fermand JP', 'Touchard G', 'Thierry A', 'Bridoux F']","['Department of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; CNRS UMR 7276, INSERM UMR 1262, Universite de Limoges, Limoges, France; INSERM CIC 1402, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Poitiers, France.

Practical challenges such as poor recruitment and inadequate resource allocation can hamper the assessment of such interventions with clinical trial methodology. This paper highlights the challenges encountered during a pilot randomized controlled trial of an m-health medication adherence intervention and offers recommendations for future multi-site, non-drug clinical trials. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were recruited to the study; eight were randomly allocated to the intervention arm. Intervention participants responded to their daily medication-reminder text messages, indicating that medication had been taken or not, and nurses were able to organize their calls around their workload. The trial closed prematurely primarily due to inadequate numbers of eligible patients; however, other potentially resolvable feasibility issues were identified. These included lack of infrastructure at study sites, poor screening data acquisition and management processes, and inexperience in conducting supportive care trials at participating sites. M-health intervention trials are designed to inform implementation of best supportive care practice. Adequate skills and infrastructure are research prerequisites that require careful consideration and sufficient investment for the successful execution of multi-site supportive care trials.

Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine (TCHM) is widely used alone or in combination with chemotherapy to treat cancer, due to its ability to deliver a broad variety of bioactive secondary metabolites as promising sources of novel organic natural agents. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, 29 varieties of medicinal plants were screened for the presence of ADA inhibitors. RESULTS: Extracts from Reynoutria japonica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Lithospermum erythrorhizon, Magnolia officinalis, Gardenia jasminoides, Stephania tetrandra, Commiphora myrrha, Raphanus sativus and Corydalis yanhusuo demonstrated strong ADA inhibition with rates greater than 50%. However, Reynoutria japonica possessed the highest ADA inhibitory activity at 95.26% and so was used in our study for isolating the ADA inhibitor to be further studied. Eight compounds were obtained and their structures were identified. The compound H1 had strong ADA inhibitory activity and was deduced to be emodin by 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopic analysis with an IC50 of 0.629 mM. The molecular docking data showed that emodin could bind tightly to the active site of ADA. Our results demonstrated that emodin displayed a new biological activity which is ADA inhibitory activity with high cytotoxic activity against K562 leukemia cells. The bioactivity of cordycepin was significantly increased when used in combination with emodin. CONCLUSION: Emodin may represent a good candidate anti-cancer therapy and adenosine protective agent.","['Zhang, Xin-Guo', 'Ma, Guo-Yan', 'Kou, Fei', 'Liu, Wen-Jie', 'Sun, Qiao-Yun', 'Guo, Guang-Jun', 'Ma, Xiao-Di', 'Guo, Si-Jia', 'Jian-Ning, Zhu']","['Zhang XG', 'Ma GY', 'Kou F', 'Liu WJ', 'Sun QY', 'Guo GJ', 'Ma XD', 'Guo SJ', 'Jian-Ning Z']","['School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Life Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Drug Screening and Deep Processing for Traditional Chinese and Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'Drug Evaluation and Certification Center of Gansu Food and Drug Administration, Lanzhou 730060, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,9810948,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Emodin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry', 'Polygonaceae/*chemistry']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ADA inhibitors', '*Reynoutria japonica', '*anti-cancer therapy', '*cordycepin', '*lymphoproliferative disorders', '*traditional chinese medicine.']",,2019/04/17 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCHTS-EPUB-98054 [pii]', '10.2174/1386207322666190415100618 [doi]']",ppublish,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2019;22(2):113-122. doi: 10.2174/1386207322666190415100618.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These parameters incompletely account for substantial interindividual susceptibility to CCM. We hypothesized that rare variants in cardiomyopathy genes contribute to CCM. METHODS: We studied 213 patients with CCM from 3 cohorts: retrospectively recruited adults with diverse cancers (n=99), prospectively phenotyped adults with breast cancer (n=73), and prospectively phenotyped children with acute myeloid leukemia (n=41). Cardiomyopathy genes, including 9 prespecified genes, were sequenced. The prevalence of rare variants was compared between CCM cohorts and The Cancer Genome Atlas participants (n=2053), healthy volunteers (n=445), and an ancestry-matched reference population. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were assessed and stratified by genotypes. A prevalent CCM genotype was modeled in anthracycline-treated mice. RESULTS: CCM was diagnosed 0.4 to 9 years after chemotherapy; 90% of these patients received anthracyclines. Adult patients with CCM had cardiovascular risk factors similar to the US population. Among 9 prioritized genes, patients with CCM had more rare protein-altering variants than comparative cohorts ( P</=1.98e-04). Titin-truncating variants (TTNtvs) predominated, occurring in 7.5% of patients with CCM versus 1.1% of The Cancer Genome Atlas participants ( P=7.36e-08), 0.7% of healthy volunteers ( P=3.42e-06), and 0.6% of the reference population ( P=5.87e-14). Adult patients who had CCM with TTNtvs experienced more heart failure and atrial fibrillation ( P=0.003) and impaired myocardial recovery ( P=0.03) than those without. Consistent with human data, anthracycline-treated TTNtv mice and isolated TTNtv cardiomyocytes showed sustained contractile dysfunction unlike wild-type ( P=0.0004 and P<0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Unrecognized rare variants in cardiomyopathy-associated genes, particularly TTNtvs, increased the risk for CCM in children and adults, and adverse cardiac events in adults.

Although clonal cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected by conventional cytogenetics in 50% of patients with MDS, such distinguishing patterns are lacking in the other 50%. Despite the increase in the prognostic value of some biomarkers, none of them is specific and able to discriminate between stable and unstable patients that subsequently progress to acute myeloid leukemia. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential use of the 3D telomere profiling to detect genomic instability in MDS patients with or without clonal cytogenetic evolution. The comparison between different time points in patients with cytogenetic changes showed that in the CD34+ MDS cells, there was a significant decrease in the total number of telomeric signals, the average intensity of signals and the total intensity of telomeres. By contrast, the number of aggregates increased during cytogenetic evolution (p < 0.001). This pattern was observed only for MDS patients with cytogenetic evolution but was absent in patients without cytogenetic changes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the 3D nuclear telomere organization was significantly altered during the MDS disease course, and may have contributed to cytogenetic clonal evolution.","['Rangel-Pozzo, Aline', 'Correa de Souza, Daiane', 'Schmid-Braz, Ana Teresa', 'de Azambuja, Ana Paula', 'Ferraz-Aguiar, Thais', 'Borgonovo, Tamara', 'Mai, Sabine']","['Rangel-Pozzo A', 'Correa de Souza D', 'Schmid-Braz AT', 'de Azambuja AP', 'Ferraz-Aguiar T', 'Borgonovo T', 'Mai S']","['Cell Biology, Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, University of Manitoba, CancerCare Manitoba, The Genomic Centre for Cancer Research and Diagnosis, R3E 0V9 Winnipeg, MB, Canada. aline.rangelpozzo@umanitoba.ca.', 'Arthur Siqueira Cavalcanti Hematology Institute (HEMORIO), Rio de Janeiro 20211-030, Brazil. dcsouzas@gmail.com.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Hospital das Clinicas, Curitiba, Parana 80060-240, Brazil. ana.braz@hc.ufpr.br.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Hospital das Clinicas, Curitiba, Parana 80060-240, Brazil. ana.braz@hc.ufpr.br.', 'Arthur Siqueira Cavalcanti Hematology Institute (HEMORIO), Rio de Janeiro 20211-030, Brazil. ttha_ferraz6@hotmail.com.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Hospital das Clinicas, Curitiba, Parana 80060-240, Brazil. tamaraborgonovo@yahoo.com.br.', 'Cell Biology, Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, University of Manitoba, CancerCare Manitoba, The Genomic Centre for Cancer Research and Diagnosis, R3E 0V9 Winnipeg, MB, Canada. sabine.mai@umanitoba.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190402,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Telomere/*chemistry', 'Young Adult']",PMC6526472,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D nuclear telomere organization', '*cytogenetic evolution', '*genomic instability', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']","['SM is a co-founder of 3D Signatures Inc., a director and chair of the clinical', 'and scientific advisory board.']",2019/04/17 06:00,2019/04/17 06:01,['2019/04/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['cells8040304 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8040304 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Apr 2;8(4). pii: cells8040304. doi: 10.3390/cells8040304.,,,,['321106-341700-2000/CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we extend our previous studies on the discovery of indole-based heterocycles as Bcl-2 inhibitors, to the identification of quinolin-4-yl based oxadiazole and triazole analogues. Target compounds were readily synthesized via a common aryl-substituted quinolin-4-carbonyl-N-arylhydrazine-1-carbothioamide (5a-b) intermediate, through simple variation of the basic cyclisation conditions. Some of the quinoline-based oxadiazole analogues (e.g. compound 6i) were found to exhibit sub-micromolar anti-proliferative activity in Bcl-2-expressing cancer cell lines, and sub-micromolar IC50 activity within a Bcl2-Bim peptide ELISA assay. The Bcl-2 targeted anticancer activity of 6i was further rationalised via computational molecular modelling, offering possibilities to extend this work into the design of further potent and selective Bcl-2 inhibitory heteroaromatics with therapeutic potential.","['Hamdy, Rania', 'Elseginy, Samia A', 'Ziedan, Noha I', 'Jones, Arwyn T', 'Westwell, Andrew D']","['Hamdy R', 'Elseginy SA', 'Ziedan NI', 'Jones AT', 'Westwell AD']","['School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cardiff University, Redwood Building, King Edward VII Avenue, Cardiff, Wales CF10 3NB, UK. rania_hamdy2000@yahoo.com.', 'Sharjah Institute for Medical Research, College of Pharmacy, University of Sharjah, P.O.

RS has an extremely poor prognosis. METHODS: Using the nation-wide database of The Cancer Registry of Norway of 7664 CLL patients registered between 1953-2012, we identified 107 patients experiencing RS. RESULTS: Seventy seven (72%) of RS patients were identified among 2631 CLL patients diagnosed between 2003-2012; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was identified in 65 (84%), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in 12 (16%) patients and the diagnosis was confirmed in 50 (65%) available biopsy specimens. The incidence rate in this period was 4.7/1000 person-years (95% CI: 3.8-5.9). The median survival from CLL diagnosis was 1.7 years (95% CI: 0.34-2.3) for RS patients while it was 10.3 years (95% CI: 9.5-10.9) for the remaining CLL patients. Male gender predominated among RS patients (69%) compared to CLL population (58%) and RS patients were diagnosed with CLL at a significantly younger age than the remaining patients (65 vs. 72 years). Median time from diagnosis of CLL to RS was 2 years (Range, 0-13 years). No CLL treatment was administered in 25 (33%) patients prior RS diagnosis; a median of 1 treatment line was administered to pretreated patients. The median duration of survival after RS diagnosis was 27 months (95% CI; 9-88). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, RS was a rare complication of CLL in the chemoimmunotherapy era, occurred early in the CLL course in younger, and both treatment naive and pretreated patients, and shortened survival substantially.","['Lenartova, Andrea', 'Randen, Ulla', 'Johannesen, Tom Borge', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir Erland']","['Lenartova A', 'Randen U', 'Johannesen TB', 'Tjonnfjord GE']","['Department of Haematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.

Expression of ETV6-RUNX1 induces a preleukemic condition leading to acquisition of secondary driver mutations, but the mechanism is poorly understood. SPI-B (encoded by SPIB) is an important transcriptional activator of B-cell development and differentiation. We hypothesized that SPIB is directly transcriptionally repressed by ETV6-RUNX1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified a regulatory region in the first intron of SPIB that interacts with ETV6-RUNX1. Mutation of the RUNX1 binding site in SPIB intron 1 prevented transcriptional repression in transient transfection assays. Next, we sought to determine to what extent gene expression in REH cells can be altered by ectopic SPI-B expression. SPI-B expression was forced using CRISPR-mediated gene activation and also using a retroviral vector. Forced expression of SPI-B resulted in altered gene expression and, at high levels, impaired cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Finally, we identified CARD11 and CDKN1A (encoding p21) as transcriptional targets of SPI-B involved in regulation of proliferation and apoptosis. Taken together, this study identifies SPIB as an important target of ETV6-RUNX1 in regulation of B-cell gene expression in t(12;21) leukemia.","['Xu, Li S', 'Francis, Alyssa', 'Turkistany, Shereen', 'Shukla, Devanshi', 'Wong, Alison', 'Batista, Carolina R', 'DeKoter, Rodney P']","['Xu LS', 'Francis A', 'Turkistany S', 'Shukla D', 'Wong A', 'Batista CR', 'DeKoter RP']","[""Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada; Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Center of Innovation in Personalized Medicine, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada; Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada."", ""Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada; Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.

Recent findings indicate that PU.1 and CITED2 act in the same gene regulatory network. We therefore examined a potential synergistic effect of simultaneous PU.1 downregulation and CITED2 upregulation on stem cell biology and AML pathogenesis. We found that simultaneous PU.1/CITED2 deregulation in human CD34(+) cord blood (CB) cells, as well as CITED2 upregulation in preleukemic murine PU.1-knockdown (PU.1(KD/KD)) bone marrow cells, significantly increased the maintenance of HSPCs compared with the respective deregulation of either factor alone. Increased replating capacity of PU.1(KD/KD)/CITED2 cells in in vitro assays eventually resulted in outgrowth of transformed cells, while upregulation of CITED2 in PU.1(KD/KD) cells enhanced their engraftment in in vivo transplantation studies without affecting leukemic transformation. Transcriptional analysis of CD34(+) CB cells with combined PU.1/CITED2 alterations revealed a set of differentially expressed genes that highly correlated with gene signatures found in various AML subtypes. These findings illustrate that combined PU.1/CITED2 deregulation induces a transcriptional program that promotes HSPC maintenance, which might be a prerequisite for malignant transformation.","['Mattes, Katharina', 'Geugien, Marjan', 'Korthuis, Patrick M', 'Brouwers-Vos, Annet Z', 'Fehrmann, Rudolf S N', 'Todorova, Tihomira I', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schepers, Hein']","['Mattes K', 'Geugien M', 'Korthuis PM', 'Brouwers-Vos AZ', 'Fehrmann RSN', 'Todorova TI', 'Steidl U', 'Vellenga E', 'Schepers H']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

As a cell cycle nonspecific alkylation agent, busulfan has a severe side effect on germ cells, especially on spermatogonia before meiosis. Studies have revealed that busulfan causes DNA strand crosslinks in spermatogonia and induces apoptosis, and many corresponding strategies have been developed to ameliorate the side effects. However, fertility maintenance after busulfan treatment is still a challenging project in the clinic. Here, we demonstrated that continuous injection of melatonin effectively alleviated germline cytotoxicity both in recipient mice and cultured spermatogonia, and busulfan/melatonin recipient mice produced normal litters. We further revealed that melatonin rescues spermatogonia from apoptosis by neutralizing reactive oxidative species (ROS) induced by busulfan and recovered the phosphorylation of ATM and p53 to normal levels, and as a result apoptosis in spermatogonial progenitor cells was avoided. This study reports that pineal gland hormone melatonin effectively protects spermatogonia from the stress of chemotherapy and oxidation and reveals the underlying molecular mechanisms, which will provide an important hint for fertility protection in clinic.","['Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'Xia, Qin', 'Wei, Rui', 'Song, Hongfei', 'Mi, Jiaqi', 'Lin, Zhaoyu', 'Yang, Yang', 'Sun, Zijie', 'Zou, Kang']","['Zhang X', 'Xia Q', 'Wei R', 'Song H', 'Mi J', 'Lin Z', 'Yang Y', 'Sun Z', 'Zou K']","['College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, 91010, CA, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, MOE Key Laboratory of Model Animal for Disease Study, Model Animal Research Center, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210061, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, 91010, CA, USA.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.

This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of HTLV in five major regions across of China. METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2017, blood samples were collected in 20 blood centers located in different regions of China. These samples were screened for HTLV-1/2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the test samples were reactive, the samples were confirmed with a western blot (WB) assay. If the results of WB were indeterminate, the donor was interviewed after a minimum lapse of 8 weeks. All follow-up samples from donors were tested for anti-HTLV-1/2 with ELISA and WB. RESULTS: There were 875,453 donor samples tested for anti-HTLV-1/2 by ELISA. In all, 365 samples tested negative, 22 samples tested positive by WB, and 14 samples with HTLV status undetermined due to being lost to follow-up. The prevalences were 11.09, 5.96, 3.16, 2.88 and 0.98 per 100,000 in Xiamen, Changsha, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Nanjing blood center, respectively. The prevalences were 0 per 100,000 for all 15 other blood centers. There was significant differences in the prevalence of HTLV in different regions of China (p = 0.0011). CONCLUSION: In China, HTLV-1 confirmed positive donors are mainly from southeastern coastal areas. It may be necessary to conduct HTLV screening in these areas to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted HTLV.","['Li, Ling', 'Ou, Shanhai', 'Huang, Chengyin', 'Zhou, Xueyong', 'Ge, Hongwei', 'Li, Jianping', 'Zeng, Jinfeng', 'Zhou, Alyssa', 'He, Liu', 'Xu, Quming', 'Wu, Jie', 'Li, Longhuo', 'Wang, Chenghui', 'Zang, Liang', 'Huang, Liqin', 'Niu, Libin', 'Han, Hui', 'Zhang, Gang', 'Wan, Jianhua', 'Wang, Fang', 'Xu, Ting', 'Zhao, Binghai', 'Qian, Liqiong', 'Wu, Yanyun', 'Liu, Zhong']","['Li L', 'Ou S', 'Huang C', 'Zhou X', 'Ge H', 'Li J', 'Zeng J', 'Zhou A', 'He L', 'Xu Q', 'Wu J', 'Li L', 'Wang C', 'Zang L', 'Huang L', 'Niu L', 'Han H', 'Zhang G', 'Wan J', 'Wang F', 'Xu T', 'Zhao B', 'Qian L', 'Wu Y', 'Liu Z']","['Clinical Transfusion Research Center, Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Transfusion Adverse Reactions, CAMS, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Xiamen Blood Center, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Jiangsu Blood Center, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Anhui Blood Center, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Beijing Blood Center, Beijing, China.', 'Liaoning Blood Center, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', 'University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California.', 'Hefei Tian Yi Biotech Institute Co., Ltd., Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Maanshan Blood Center, Maanshan, Anhui, China.', 'Wuhu Blood Center, Wuhu, Anhui, China.', 'Anqing Blood Center, Anqing, Anhui, China.', 'Bengbu Blood Center, Bengbu, Anhui, China.', 'Dalian Blood Center, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Beijing Blood Center, Beijing, China.', 'Changzhi Blood Center, Changzhi, Shanxi, China.', 'Hainan Blood Center, Haikou, Hainan, China.', 'Changsha Blood Center, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Urumchi Blood Center, Urumchi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Liaoning Blood Center, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Yili Blood Center, Yili, Xinjiang, China.', 'Nanchong Blood Center, Nanchong, Sichuan, China.', 'Deyang Blood Center, Deyang, Sichuan, China.', 'Clinical Transfusion Research Center, Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Bloodworks Northwest, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Transfusion Research Center, Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Transfusion Adverse Reactions, CAMS, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190415,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Donors', 'China/epidemiology', '*Donor Selection', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', '*HTLV-I Infections/blood/epidemiology', 'HTLV-II Antibodies/*blood', '*HTLV-II Infections/blood/epidemiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence']",,,,,2019/04/16 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15309 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2019 Jul;59(7):2361-2367. doi: 10.1111/trf.15309.

The assay amplifies both e13a2 and e14a2 BCR-ABL1 transcript variants. Observing distinct variant-dependent amplification curves during qPCR, we aimed to determine if this affected quantitation of BCR-ABL1. METHODS: We investigated the qPCR efficiency at three Danish diagnostic centers (Zealand University Hospital [ZUH], Aarhus University Hospital [AU], and Rigshospitalet [RH]) on cell lines expressing either the e13a2 or e14a2 BCR-ABL1 transcript variants and compared %IS values from 219 chronic myeloid leukemia patients from the centers with either the e13a2 (n = 113) or e14a2 (n = 106) transcript variants obtained by qPCR with absolute quantitation by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). RESULTS: Although no significant differences were found in amplification efficiencies of the transcript variants, Bland-Altman analysis of qPCR vs ddPCR values for patient samples revealed a significant average difference in the bias between variants (e3a2/e14a2) of 4.6-, 6.5-, and 1.8-fold for ZUH, AU, and RH, respectively. Furthermore, qPCR %IS values of diagnostic patient samples revealed a significant 4.7-fold difference between the e13a2 and e14a2 variants. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the EAC qPCR assay may underestimate the e14a2 variant compared to the e13a2 variant.","['Kjaer, Lasse', 'Skov, Vibe', 'Andersen, Morten T', 'Aggerholm, Anni', 'Clair, Philippe', 'Gniot, Michal', 'Soeby, Karen', 'Udby, Lene', 'Dorff, Mikkel H', 'Hasselbalch, Hans', 'Pallisgaard, Niels']","['Kjaer L', 'Skov V', 'Andersen MT', 'Aggerholm A', 'Clair P', 'Gniot M', 'Soeby K', 'Udby L', 'Dorff MH', 'Hasselbalch H', 'Pallisgaard N']","['Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Hemodiagnostic Laboratory, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Plateforme PCR, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Surgical Pathology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190501,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Denmark', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'droplet digital PCR', 'molecular response', 'qPCR']",,2019/04/16 06:00,2019/11/28 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13238 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Jul;103(1):26-34. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13238.

The combination of targeted therapy with low-intensity chemotherapy is safe and effective. The objective of the current analysis was to compare the outcome of patients who received a combination of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus low-intensity chemotherapy (mini-hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone [mini-HCVD]) with or without blinatumomab versus the outcome of those who received the standard, intensive, hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (HCVAD) regimen. METHODS: The authors analyzed 135 older patients with newly diagnosed, Ph-negative ALL who were treated prospectively with standard HCVAD (n = 77) or with the combination of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus mini-HCVD with or without blinatumomab (n = 58). A propensity score analysis was conducted using 1:1 matching using the nearest neighbor matching method. RESULTS: Propensity score matching identified 38 patients in each cohort. The antibody plus low-intensity chemotherapy combination induced higher response rates (98% vs 88%), with lower rates of early death (0% vs 8%) and lower rates of death in complete remission (5% vs 17%). With propensity score matching, the 3-year event-free survival rates for patients who received HCVAD and those who received the combination of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus mini-HCVD with or without blinatumomab were 34% and 64%, respectively (P = .003), and the 3-year overall survival rates were 34% and 63%, respectively (P = .004). By multivariate analysis, age (P = .019; hazard ratio, 1.045) and the combination of inotuzumab plus mini-HCVD with or without blinatumomab (P = .020; hazard ratio, 0.550) were identified as independent prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus mini-HCVD with or without blinatumomab is safe and effective in older patients with newly diagnosed, Ph-negative ALL and confers a better outcome compared with standard HCVAD chemotherapy.","['Jabbour, Elias J', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Daver, Naval', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Issa, Ghayas C', 'Jacob, Jovitta', 'Kwari, Monica', 'Thompson, Philip', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Yilmaz, Musa', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Jabbour EJ', 'Sasaki K', 'Ravandi F', 'Short NJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Daver N', 'Kadia T', 'Konopleva M', 'Jain N', 'Cortes J', 'Issa GC', 'Jacob J', 'Kwari M', 'Thompson P', 'Garris R', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Yilmaz M', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California Irvine, Orange, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190415,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Propensity Score', 'Survival Rate']",PMC6625850,['NOTNLM'],"['*blinatumomab', '*inotuzumab', '*mini-hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone', '(mini-HCVD)', '*older acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*outcome']",,2019/04/16 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32139 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Aug 1;125(15):2579-2586. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32139.

CTCF plays an important role in regulating the spatial and temporal expression of HOX genes that control embryonic development, body patterning, hematopoiesis, and leukemogenesis. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how HOX loci associated CTCF boundaries regulate chromatin organization and HOX gene expression. In the current protocol, a specific sgRNA pooled library targeting all CTCF binding sites in the HOXA/B/C/D loci has been generated to examine the effects of disrupting CTCF-associated chromatin boundaries on TAD formation and HOX gene expression. Through CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screening, the CTCF binding site located between HOXA7/HOXA9 genes (CBS7/9) has been identified as a critical regulator of oncogenic chromatin domain, as well as being important for maintaining ectopic HOX gene expression patterns in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, this sgRNA library screening approach provides novel insights into CTCF mediated genome organization in specific gene loci and also provides a basis for the functional characterization of the annotated genetic regulatory elements, both coding and noncoding, during normal biological processes in the post-human genome project era.","['Luo, Huacheng', 'Sobh, Amin', 'Vulpe, Christopher D', 'Brewer, Edmond', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Qiu, Yi', 'Huang, Suming']","['Luo H', 'Sobh A', 'Vulpe CD', 'Brewer E', 'Dovat S', 'Qiu Y', 'Huang S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; hluo1@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Florida.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Florida.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Florida.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; shuang4@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Video-Audio Media']",20190331,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (RNA, Guide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/*metabolism', 'Chromatin', '*Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'DNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Library', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'RNA, Guide']",PMC7607627,,,,2019/04/16 06:00,2020/01/29 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/59382 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2019 Mar 31;(145). doi: 10.3791/59382.,,,,"['R01 CA204044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK110108/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL141950/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1639398'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients were initially diagnosed with CML-CP and received imatinib or nilotinib therapy. Early molecular response (EMR) was assessed based on BCR-ABL (IS: on the international scale) transcript level at 3 and 6 months. Potential factors impacting DMR achievement were identified using Cox proportional hazard regression models. The effects of EMR achievement on the cumulative incidence of MR4.0 were investigated via Kaplan-Meier analysis.Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a BCR-ABL transcript level at 3 and 6 months of TKI therapy was an independent factor for the achievement of MR4.0, which was nevertheless not related to age, gender, Sokal score, hemoglobin level, or white blood cell (WBC) count at the initial time of diagnosis. Patients achieving an EMR (EMR: 3-month BCR-ABL </=10%, 6-month BCR-ABL <1%) were more likely to reach MR4.0 than patients failing to achieve EMR (P1 <.001, P2 <.001). Patients who had 3-month BCR-ABL </=1% were more likely to reach MR4.0 than those who had 3-month BCR-ABL of 1% to 10% or >10% (P1 = .001, P2 <.001). Similarly, patients who had 6-month BCR-ABL </=0.1% were more likely to achieve MR4.0 than those in the 0.1% to 1% and >/=1% groups (P1 <.001, P2 <.001). Also, a higher percentage of patients on nilotinib therapy achieved EMR compared with patients on imatinib therapy (93.3% vs 63.6% on 3-month nilotinib therapy, P = .001; 88.9% vs 59.9% on 6-month nilotinib therapy, P = .004).This study demonstrates that EMR, especially a 3-month BCR-ABL </=1% and 6-month BCR-ABL </=0.1%, have predictive value for DMR achievement. In addition, there is a higher percentage of patients receiving nilotinib therapy achieved EMR than that of those receiving imatinib therapy.","['Wang, Rui', 'Cong, Yue', 'Li, Caili', 'Zhang, Chen', 'Lin, Hai']","['Wang R', 'Cong Y', 'Li C', 'Zhang C', 'Lin H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University.', 'Department of Ocular Fundus Disease, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun.', 'Department of Hematology, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC6485861,,,,2019/04/16 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000015222 [doi]', '00005792-201904120-00085 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Apr;98(15):e15222. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015222.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, primary middle ear DLBCL which presents CD20-negative and coexpression of MYC and BCL-2 has not been reported yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 20-year-old Chinese man complained fever and weakness for 2 months. Subsequently bone marrow morphology and flow cytometry immunophenotype suggested ALL. Administrated with 9 cycles of multiagent combined chemotherapy, he felt right ear progressive hearing loss, otalgia, aural fullness. Otoendoscopic examination revealed a pitchy mass obstructing the right external auditory canal. Then the mass resection was performed for biopsy and immunohistochemistry examination. DIAGNOSIS: The mass was diagnosed as DLBCL which was negative for CD20 and double expression of MYC and BCL-2. INTERVENTIONS: Chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: The patient eventually gave up and died of severe infection. LESSONS: Although intensive chemotherapy has markedly improved the survival of ALL, more and more secondary cancers have been reported. In addition, primary middle ear lymphoma is much rare; hence, it is easy to be misdiagnosed. Furthermore, DLBCL with negative CD20 and double expression of MYC and BCL-2 is aggressive, which is characterized by chemotherapy resistance and inferior survival rates. We discuss this case aiming at raising awareness of tumors secondary to ALL and exploring the appropriate treatment options for the rare DLBCL.","['Ding, Chao', 'Huang, Ying', 'Shi, Mingxia', 'Nie, Bo', 'Li, Yuntao', 'Wu, Kun', 'Yang, Jinrong', 'Zeng, Yun']","['Ding C', 'Huang Y', 'Shi M', 'Nie B', 'Li Y', 'Wu K', 'Yang J', 'Zeng Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Ear Neoplasms/chemistry/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', '*Ear, Middle', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC6485888,,,,2019/04/16 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000015204 [doi]', '00005792-201904120-00077 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Apr;98(15):e15204. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early detection and capture of drug-resistant tumor cells can facilitate the monitoring of the therapy process and improve the prognosis of patients. In this study, novel P-glycoprotein (P-gp) antibody modified porous hydrogel particles are proposed for drug-resistant tumor cells capture. The hydrogel particles employ a highly biocompatible hydrogel, methacrylate gelatin (GelMA), as the carrier and replicate from the silica colloidal crystal beads. By the modification of P-gp antibody probes on their surfaces, the hydrogel particles are endowed with the ability to capture drug-resistant tumor cells, which overexpress specific components of P-gp on their membranes. Additionally, the acquired ordered porous nanostructure of the particles can provide not only more surface area for antibody immobilization but also a nanopatterned platform for highly efficient target cell capture. The above advantages make the porous hydrogel particles ideal for efficient capture and detection of the drug-resistant tumor cells, which can be expected to facilitate the point-of-care pharmacotherapy and promisingly improve the patient outcomes.","['Ma, Xiaoyan', 'Zhao, Ze', 'Wang, Huan', 'Liu, Yuxiao', 'Xu, Yueshuang', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Li, Ling', 'Zhao, Yuanjin']","['Ma X', 'Zhao Z', 'Wang H', 'Liu Y', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang J', 'Chen B', 'Li L', 'Zhao Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190415,Germany,Adv Healthc Mater,Advanced healthcare materials,101581613,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hydrogels)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*chemistry/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gelatin/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogels/*chemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Methacrylates/chemistry', 'Nanostructures/chemistry', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Porosity', 'Silicon Dioxide/chemistry']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*P-glycoprotein (P-gp)', '*colloidal crystals', '*leukemia', '*multidrug resistance (MDR)', '*porous particles']",,2019/04/16 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/adhm.201900136 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Healthc Mater. 2019 Jul;8(13):e1900136. doi: 10.1002/adhm.201900136.

Furthermore, CD71 expression is present in all proliferating cells and can capture target cells without prior knowledge of AML subtype. The use of anti-CD71 as the affinity ligand for AML detection in this work yields a capture efficiency and purity during peak CD71 expression of 92% and 62%, respectively. Additionally, target cells were isolated from lysed, preserved blood samples with a capture purity of 32% at a concentration of 10% myeloblasts in blood, half of the current diagnosis threshold determined by the World Health Organization. Cells isolated using this capture ligand were then subjected to post-separation differentiation therapy. HL60 cells were differentiated into non-proliferating, neutrophil-like cells. After 48 hours of incubation with 1.5% DMSO, there was a decrease in the CD71 antigen expression in differentiated cells. This separation approach can be used to screen blood samples for AML cells, and the effluent of the separation is available for post-separation analyses.","['Lyons, Veronica J', 'Pappas, Dimitri']","['Lyons VJ', 'Pappas D']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA. d.pappas@ttu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/methods', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism']",,,,,2019/04/16 06:00,2019/08/24 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8an02357c [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2019 May 13;144(10):3369-3380. doi: 10.1039/c8an02357c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few evaluations have looked at international pediatric cancer incidence trends in the youngest children. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate trends in cancer incidence in children under 5 years of age, overall and by type, using data from Cancer Incidence in 5 Continents (CI5) from 1988 to 2012 (CI5 volumes VII-XI). Methods: Rates of cancers in children ages 0-4 years were extracted from registries available in CI5 from 1988 to 2012. To overcome small numbers in individual registries, numerators and denominators were aggregated within regions corresponding to the United Nations' geoscheme. Average annual percent change (AAPC) was estimated using Poisson regression. Robust standard errors were used in all models to correct for overdispersion in some regions, and 95% Wald confidence intervals and P values were reported. The top five cancers by increasing AAPC were ranked within each region. Results: Overall, in children under 5 years, increasing incidence was seen in multiple regions for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, ependymal tumors, neuroblastoma, and hepatoblastoma. Hepatoblastoma had the largest AAPC in 11 out of 15 regions and showed an increase in all regions except southern Asia. Astrocytic tumors were the only cancer that decreased over the time period. Conclusions: We evaluated 25 years of cancer incidence in children ages 0-4 years and observed increases in incidence for hepatoblastoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and ependymal tumors. Further etiologic evaluation will be required to explain these increases in incidence.","['Hubbard, Aubrey K', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Fortuna, Giulio', 'Marcotte, Erin L', 'Poynter, Jenny N']","['Hubbard AK', 'Spector LG', 'Fortuna G', 'Marcotte EL', 'Poynter JN']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190409,England,JNCI Cancer Spectr,JNCI cancer spectrum,101721827,,,,PMC6455426,,,,2019/04/16 06:00,2019/04/16 06:01,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jncics/pkz007 [doi]', 'pkz007 [pii]']",ppublish,JNCI Cancer Spectr. 2019 Mar;3(1):pkz007. doi: 10.1093/jncics/pkz007.

Simulation of an oncologic emergency case is a useful way to experience, reflect on, and practice these skills. This case involving a simulated patient in blast crisis was created as part of our Emergency Medicine (EM) Resident Simulation Curriculum at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Methods: This case is based on an actual patient seen in our emergency department and highlights specific teaching points and potential pitfalls in treatment algorithms. It details a 40-year-old female with history of acute myeloid leukemia presenting with fatigue for 2 days, tachycardia, and labored breathing. The patient develops worsening respiratory distress if not intervened upon and progresses to pulseless electrical activity arrest. Lab work is notable for markedly elevated white blood cell count and acidosis. A SimMan or SimMan3G is required for the simulation. The associated debriefing materials are Included in this educational resource. Evaluation of learner performance is mapped to the EM Milestones. Results: Eighteen of the 20 (90%) EM residents that participated in this simulation, responded to the Likert-scale postsession survey. Of those who responded, 83% agreed or strongly agreed that the case was realistic and 89% agreed or strongly agreed that the case was useful. Discussion: The simulation venue offers a unique opportunity to address team dynamics as well as provide a forum for didactic learning as it is often difficult to debrief a critical case while working in real-time patient care settings.","['Conlon, Lauren', 'Gillenwater, Elizabeth']","['Conlon L', 'Gillenwater E']","['Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; Simulation Course Director, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.', 'Emergency Medicine Resident, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161118,United States,MedEdPORTAL,MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,101714390,,,,PMC6440397,['NOTNLM'],"['Blast Crisis', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Graduate', 'Leukemia', 'Simulation']",['None to report.'],2016/11/18 00:00,2016/11/18 00:01,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/18 00:01 [medline]']",['10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10504 [doi]'],epublish,MedEdPORTAL. 2016 Nov 18;12:10504. doi: 10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic regulatory enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases, histone methyltransferases, and histone deacetylases are involved in epigenetic modification. Studies have shown that the dysregulation caused by changes in the amino acid sequence of these enzymes is closely correlated with tumor onset and progression. In addition, certain amino acid changes in the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are linked to altered epigenetic modifications in tumors. Some small molecule inhibitors targeting these aberrant enzymes have shown promising anti-cancer efficacy in preclinical and clinical trials. For example, the small molecule inhibitor ivosidenib, which targets IDH1 with a mutation at R132, has been approved by the FDA for the clinical treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. In this review, we summarize the recurrent ""hotspot"" mutations in these enzymes in various tumors and their role in tumorigenesis. We also describe candidate inhibitors of the mutant enzymes which show potential therapeutic value. In addition, we introduce some previously unreported mutation sites in these enzymes, which may be related to tumor development and provide opportunities for future study.","['Han, Mei', 'Jia, Lina', 'Lv, Wencai', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Cui, Wei']","['Han M', 'Jia L', 'Lv W', 'Wang L', 'Cui W']","['Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190329,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6449417,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT', 'histone modification enzyme', 'mutation', 'small molecule inhibitors', 'tumor']",,2019/04/16 06:00,2019/04/16 06:01,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00194 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Mar 29;9:194. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00194. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow clot analysis increases sensitivity to diagnose hemopathies and offers the possibility of morphological evaluation and anatomopathological study, with the advantage of not needing decalcification processes, hence improving antigenic expression in immunohistochemical and FISH techniques.

They can be stimulated by and exert their effect via specific cytokine axes, whereas Natural Killers (NK) cells are the only known cytotoxic member of this family. ILCs are considered key in linking the innate and adaptive response in physiologic and pathologic environments. In this study, we investigated the properties of non-cytotoxic cardiac ILCs in physiologic, inflammatory, and ischemic conditions. We found that in healthy humans and mice, non-cytotoxic cardiac ILCs are predominantly a type 2-committed population with progenitor-like features, such as an absence of type-specific immunophenotype, intermediate GATA3 expression, and capacity to transiently express Pro-myelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger protein (PLZF) upon activation. During myocarditis and ischemia, in both human and mice, cardiac ILCs differentiated into conventional ILC2s. We found that cardiac ILCs lack IL-25 receptor and cannot become inflammatory ILC2s. We found a strong correlation between IL-33 production in the heart and the ability of cardiac ILCs to become conventional ILC2s. The main producer of IL-33 was a subset of CD29+Sca-1+ cardiac fibroblasts. ILC2 expansion and fibroblast-derived IL-33 production were significantly increased in the heart in mouse models of infarction and myocarditis. Despite its progenitor-like status in healthy hearts, cardiac ILCs were unable to become ILC1 or ILC3 in vivo and in vitro. Using adoptive transfer and parabiosis, we demonstrated that the heart, unlike other organs such as lung, cannot be infiltrated by circulating ILCs in adulthood even during cardiac inflammation or ischemia. Thus, the ILC2s present during inflammatory conditions are derived from the heart-resident and quiescent steady-state population. Non-cytotoxic cardiac ILCs are a resident population of ILC2-commited cells, with undifferentiated progenitor-like features in steady-state conditions and an ability to expand and develop pro-inflammatory type 2 features during inflammation or ischemia.","['Bracamonte-Baran, William', 'Chen, Guobao', 'Hou, Xuezhou', 'Talor, Monica V', 'Choi, Hee Sun', 'Davogustto, Giovanni', 'Taegtmeyer, Heinrich', 'Sung, Jungeun', 'Hackam, David Joel', 'Nauen, David', 'Cihakova, Daniela']","['Bracamonte-Baran W', 'Chen G', 'Hou X', 'Talor MV', 'Choi HS', 'Davogustto G', 'Taegtmeyer H', 'Sung J', 'Hackam DJ', 'Nauen D', 'Cihakova D']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'W.

The unique anatomy and rarity of these cases present challenges in surgical training and preparation. We present a case series illustrating how 3-dimensional (3-D) printed models were used in preoperative planning for 3 cases of pediatric spinal deformity surgery. Case Series: Patient 1 was a 6-year-old male with scoliosis secondary to an L3 hemivertebra and severe congenital heart disease who underwent excision of the L3 hemivertebra and L2-L4 spinal fusion. Patient 2 was an 11-year-old male with an L2 hemivertebra and lumbar kyphosis who underwent excision of the L2 hemivertebra and T12-L4 spinal fusion. Patient 3 was a 6-year-old female with Down syndrome who presented with atlantoaxial instability and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She underwent occipital-cervical spinal fusion and decompression. Prior to surgery, 3-D printed models of the patients' spines were created based on computed tomography (CT) imaging. Conclusion: The anatomic complexity and risk of devastating neurologic consequences in spine surgery call for careful preparations. 3-D models enable more efficient and precise surgical planning compared to the use of 2-dimensional CT/magnetic resonance images. The 3-D models also make it easier to visualize patient anatomy, allowing patients and their families who lack medical training to interpret and understand cross-sectional anatomy, which in our experience, enhanced the consultations.","['Coote, Jeffrey D', 'Nguyen, Theresa', 'Tholen, Kaitlyn', 'Stewart, Caleb', 'Verter, Elizabeth', 'McGee, John', 'Celestre, Paul', 'Sarkar, Korak']","['Coote JD', 'Nguyen T', 'Tholen K', 'Stewart C', 'Verter E', 'McGee J', 'Celestre P', 'Sarkar K']","['The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'Tulane University School of Science and Engineering, New Orleans, LA.', 'The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'Ochsner Medical 3D Laboratory, New Orleans, LA.', 'The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA.', 'The University of Queensland Faculty of Medicine, Ochsner Clinical School, New Orleans, LA.', 'Ochsner Medical 3D Laboratory, New Orleans, LA.', 'Department of Neurology, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,Ochsner J,The Ochsner journal,101125795,,,,PMC6447199,['NOTNLM'],"['Imaging-three dimensional', 'orthopedics', 'pediatrics', 'scoliosis', 'spinal fusion', 'spine']",,2019/04/16 06:00,2019/04/16 06:01,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.31486/toj.18.0117 [doi]', 'toj.18.0117 [pii]']",ppublish,Ochsner J. 2019 Spring;19(1):49-53. doi: 10.31486/toj.18.0117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MH incidence was 1.9/100 person-years (95% CI: 1.8-1.9), with cumulative incidences of 2.3%, 5.2%, and 7.3% by year 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Median time from CLL diagnosis to MH was 2.8 years (range: 0-15.7 years). In multivariate analyses, concurrent anticoagulant and antiplatelet use (HR: 4.2; 95% CI: 3.2-5.6), anticoagulant use only (HR: 2.6; 95% CI: 2.3-3.1), and antiplatelet use only (HR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7) increased MH risk vs not receiving those medications; being nonwhite, male, having MH history, renal impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and alcohol abuse were associated with increased MH risk. These pre-ibrutinib data are important for providing context for interpreting MH risk in ibrutinib-treated patients. As ibrutinib clinical use is increasing, updated analyses of MH risk among ibrutinib-treated VA patients with CLL may provide additional useful insight.","['Georgantopoulos, Peter', 'Yang, Huiying', 'Norris, LeAnn B', 'Bennett, Charles L']","['Georgantopoulos P', 'Yang H', 'Norris LB', 'Bennett CL']","['William Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Southern Network on Adverse Reactions (SONAR), South Carolina Center of Economic Excellence for Medication Safety, College of Pharmacy, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Southern Network on Adverse Reactions (SONAR), South Carolina Center of Economic Excellence for Medication Safety, College of Pharmacy, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'William Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Southern Network on Adverse Reactions (SONAR), South Carolina Center of Economic Excellence for Medication Safety, College of Pharmacy, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190414,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Approval', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Piperidines', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans Health']",PMC6536934,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*hemorrhage', '*ibrutinib']",,2019/04/16 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2018/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2134 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 May;8(5):2233-2240. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2134.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of these systematic reviews was to examine the relation of 1) never versus ever feeding human milk, 2) shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding, 3) shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding, and 4) feeding a lower versus higher intensity of human milk to mixed-fed infants with acute childhood leukemia, generally, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, specifically. METHODS: The Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review team conducted systematic reviews with external experts. We searched CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed for articles published January 1980 to March 2016, dual-screened the results using predetermined criteria, extracted data from and assessed risk of bias for each included study, qualitatively synthesized the evidence, developed conclusion statements, and graded the strength of the evidence. RESULTS: We included 24 articles from case-control or retrospective studies. Limited evidence suggests that never feeding human milk versus 1) ever feeding human milk and 2) feeding human milk for durations >/=6 mo are associated with a slightly higher risk of acute childhood leukemia, whereas evidence comparing never feeding human milk with feeding human milk for durations <6 mo is mixed. Limited evidence suggests that, among infants fed human milk, a shorter versus longer duration of human milk feeding is associated with a slightly higher risk of acute childhood leukemia. None of the included articles examined exclusive human milk feeding or the intensity of human milk fed to mixed-fed infants. CONCLUSIONS: Feeding human milk for short durations or not at all may be associated with slightly higher acute childhood leukemia risk. The evidence could be strengthened with access to broadly generalizable prospective samples; therefore, we recommend linking surveillance systems that collect infant feeding and childhood cancer data.","['Gungor, Darcy', 'Nadaud, Perrine', 'Dreibelbis, Carol', 'LaPergola, Concetta C', 'Wong, Yat Ping', 'Terry, Nancy', 'Abrams, Steve A', 'Beker, Leila', 'Jacobovits, Tova', 'Jarvinen, Kirsi M', 'Nommsen-Rivers, Laurie A', ""O'Brien, Kimberly O"", 'Oken, Emily', 'Perez-Escamilla, Rafael', 'Ziegler, Ekhard E', 'Spahn, Joanne M']","['Gungor D', 'Nadaud P', 'Dreibelbis C', 'LaPergola CC', 'Wong YP', 'Terry N', 'Abrams SA', 'Beker L', 'Jacobovits T', 'Jarvinen KM', 'Nommsen-Rivers LA', ""O'Brien KO"", 'Oken E', 'Perez-Escamilla R', 'Ziegler EE', 'Spahn JM']","['Panum Group, Bethesda, MD.', 'Panum Group, Bethesda, MD.', 'Panum Group, Bethesda, MD.', 'Panum Group, Bethesda, MD.', 'USDA, Food and Nutrition Service, Alexandria, VA.', 'National Institutes of Health Library, Bethesda, MD.', 'Dell Medical School at the University of Texas, Austin, TX.', 'US Food and Drug Administration, contractor, College Park, MD.', 'US Food and Drug Administration, College Park, MD.', 'University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY.', 'University of Cincinnati College of Allied Health Sciences, Cincinnati, OH.', 'Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Division of Chronic Disease Research Across the Lifecourse, Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'USDA, Food and Nutrition Service, Alexandria, VA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,,IM,"['Breast Feeding', 'Child', 'Child Health', '*Diet', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Infant Formula', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia/etiology/prevention & control', '*Milk, Human', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/prevention & control']",PMC6500929,['NOTNLM'],"['*breast milk', '*breastfeeding', '*child', '*human milk', '*infant', '*leukemia', '*systematic review', '*toddler']",,2019/04/16 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['5456700 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcn/nqy306 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2019 Mar 1;109(Suppl_7):757S-771S. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/nqy306.,,['(c) American Society for Nutrition 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were first treated with or without SeMet, sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl IgE and stimulated with the antigen dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin, before the measurement of degranulation, calcium mobilization, mRNA expression and protein secretion of interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The antigen-induced beta-hexosaminidase release, a degranulation marker, was significantly inhibited by SeMet treatment. SeMet also significantly suppressed antigen-induced calcium mobilization. Antigen-induced increases in the mRNA expression and protein secretion of IL-4 and TNF-alpha were both significantly attenuated by SeMet treatment. In addition, SeMet significantly suppressed antigen-induced phosphorylation of Syk, Akt, and MAPKs. These results demonstrate that SeMet suppresses antigen-induced degranulation, and mRNA expression and protein secretion of IL-4 and TNF-alpha, and inhibits antigen-induced mobilization of calcium and activation of Syk, Akt, and MAPKs.

In this study, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) significantly potentiated Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)-mediated cytotoxicity through apoptotic and autophagic cell death induction, but COX-2-inhibitory function was not required for NSAID-induced autophagy in CD44-overexpressing human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 (CD44(high)K562) cells. Importantly, we found that treatment with NSAIDs resulted in a dose-dependent increase in LC3-II level and decrease in p62 level and simultaneous reduction in multiple stemness-related markers including CD44, Oct4, c-Myc, and mutant p53 (mutp53) in CD44(high)K562 cells, suggesting that NSAIDs could induce autophagy, which might mediate degradation of stemness-related marker proteins. Activation of AMPK and inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 participated in NSAID-induced autophagy in CD44(high)K562 cells. In addition, treatment of CD44(high)K562 cells with NSAIDs inhibited expression of HSF1/Hsps, which resulted in suppression of 17-AAG-induced activation of Hsp70, leading to reversal of 17-AAG resistance and sensitization of CD44(high)K562 cells to 17-AAG by NSAIDs. In conclusion, combining NSAIDs with Hsp90 inhibitor may offer one of the most promising strategies for eradication of CD44-overexpressing CSCs.","['Moon, Hyun-Jung', 'Park, So-Young', 'Lee, Su-Hoon', 'Kang, Chi-Dug', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Moon HJ', 'Park SY', 'Lee SH', 'Kang CD', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190408,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC7848457,,,,2019/04/16 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00,['2019/04/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504019X15517850319579 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2019 Jul 12;27(7):835-847. doi: 10.3727/096504019X15517850319579.

However, the role of RREB1 in acute myeloid leukemia has not been studied. We found that RREB1 is overexpressed in AML patients and myeloid leukemia cell lines (NB4 and HL-60), and RREB1 expression was significantly decreased during granulocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Then we performed a RREB1 knockdown assay in NB4 and HL-60 cells; the results showed that knockdown of RREB1 upregulated expression of CD11b, CEBPbeta, and microRNA-145 (miR-145), which hinted that knockdown of RREB1 enhanced granulocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. In addition, inhibitor of miR-145 can offset the enhanced effect on granulocytic differentiation mediated by downregulation of RREB1. These collective findings demonstrated that RREB1 blocks granulocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells by inhibiting the expression of miR-145 and downstream targets of the RAS signal pathway. These may provide a promising therapeutic target for AML patients.","['Yao, Juanjuan', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Zhong, Pengqiang', 'Liu, Dongdong', 'Yuan, Zhen', 'Liu, Junmei', 'Yao, Shifei', 'Zhao, Yi', 'Chen, Min', 'Li, Lianwen', 'Liu, Lu', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Yao J', 'Zhong L', 'Zhong P', 'Liu D', 'Yuan Z', 'Liu J', 'Yao S', 'Zhao Y', 'Chen M', 'Li L', 'Liu L', 'Liu B']","['Central Laboratory of Yong Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, P.R.

We previously reported that microRNA-204 (miR-204) was involved in the regulation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell apoptosis, but its role in chemoresistance is poorly understood. In the present study, we showed that miR-204 was significantly increased in AML cells after ATO treatment. Interestingly, the increased miR-204 level that was negatively correlated with ATO induced the decrease in cell viability and baculoviral inhibition of apoptosis protein repeat-containing 6 (BIRC6) expression. Overexpression of miR-204 potentiated ATO-induced AML cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-204 directly targets to the 3'-UTR of BIRC6. Upregulation of miR-204 decreased BIRC6 luciferase activity and expression, which subsequently enhanced the expression of p53. Restoration of BIRC6 markedly reversed the effect of miR-204 on the regulation of AML cell sensitivity to ATO. Taken together, our study demonstrates that miR-204 decreases ATO chemoresistance in AML cells at least partially via promoting BIRC6/p53-mediated apoptosis. miR-204 represents a novel target of ATO, and upregulation of miR-204 may be a useful strategy to improve the efficacy of ATO in AML treatment.","['Wang, Zhiguo', 'Fang, Zehui', 'Lu, Runzhang', 'Zhao, Hongli', 'Gong, Tiejun', 'Liu, Dong', 'Hong, Luojia', 'Ma, Jun', 'Zhang, Mei']","['Wang Z', 'Fang Z', 'Lu R', 'Zhao H', 'Gong T', 'Liu D', 'Hong L', 'Ma J', 'Zhang M']","[""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi Province, P.R.

A man in his 80s with a past medical history of below-knee amputation of the left leg owing to severe leg ulcers from pyoderma gangrenosum, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and dyslipidemia developed a slowly spreading eruption on the distal stump spreading proximally. On physical examination, he had numerous non-scaly violaceous papules and annular plaques from the stump to the lateral, medial, and anterior thigh. Histology confirmed a diagnosis of GA. The extensive, chronic lesions make this presentation of GA very unusual in that it shares features of both localized and generalized forms. Moreover, the temporal and spatial association with pyoderma gangrenosum is unique and may reflect a related inflammatory pathway.","['Borda, Luis J', 'Mervis, Joshua S', 'Kirsner, Robert S']","['Borda LJ', 'Mervis JS', 'Kirsner RS']","['Department of Dermatology & Cutaneous Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida.

This article presents a summary of the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) independent review of the evidence submission, the committee's deliberations, and the subsequent development of NICE guidance for the use of tisagenlecleucel on the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T) product, the first of this emerging therapeutic class to be considered by NICE in this indication. The company's evidence submission was based upon three single-arm, phase II studies: ELIANA, ENSIGN, and B2101J. These trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of tisagenlecleucel, with significant extensions in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to historical control datasets on blinatumomab and salvage chemotherapy. Adverse events were common; 77% of patients suffered from cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 56% of whom required intensive care unit-level care. The ERG did not consider clofarabine monotherapy an appropriate proxy for salvage chemotherapy. The company presented a hybrid cost-effectiveness model, combining a decision tree and three-state partitioned survival model structure. The majority of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were generated through additional life-years in the extrapolated 'long-term survival' phase of the model, where patients were assumed to be 'cured'. The ERG considered the results to be subject to substantial uncertainty, due in part to immature trial data, unresolved long-term treatment effects, and a lack of appropriate comparator data. The ERG implemented a number of changes to the company's model in an alternative base case, producing deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of pound45,397 per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and pound27,732 versus blinatumomab. The probabilistic model produced ICERs of pound48,265 per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and pound29,501 versus blinatumomab. The committee considered the ERG's analysis to be most closely aligned with their preferred assumptions, and did not consider tisagenlecleucel to meet both of the end-of-life (EoL) criteria. In recognition of the innovative nature of tisagenlecleucel, and the present immaturity of ongoing clinical trials, the committee considered further data collection would be valuable in resolving uncertainties around OS, the technology's novel mechanism of action, and the management of CRS and B-cell aplasia. The committee therefore recommended tisagenlecleucel for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until the conclusion of the ELIANA study (June 2023). This appraisal highlighted the difficulty of interpreting EoL criteria in the context of curative therapies and the valuation of cure versus extension of life. Further clarification of NICE's position in these situations may be necessary to ensure consistency and equity in their decision-making.","['Walton, Matthew', 'Sharif, Sahar', 'Simmonds, Mark', 'Claxton, Lindsay', 'Hodgson, Robert']","['Walton M', 'Sharif S', 'Simmonds M', 'Claxton L', 'Hodgson R']","['Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK. matthew.walton@york.ac.uk.', 'Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, YO10 5DD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/economics', 'Child', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Models, Economic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/economics', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technology Assessment, Biomedical', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/04/15 06:00,2020/07/25 06:00,['2019/04/15 06:00'],"['2019/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40273-019-00799-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s40273-019-00799-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2019 Oct;37(10):1209-1217. doi: 10.1007/s40273-019-00799-0.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1932-3689'],,,['17/141/10/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lentiviral vector-mediated haemopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) gene therapy is a potentially curative treatment that represents an alternative to allogeneic HSPC transplantation. Here, we report safety and efficacy data from an interim analysis of patients with severe Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome who received lentiviral vector-derived gene therapy. METHODS: We did a non-randomised, open-label, phase 1/2 clinical study in paediatric patients with severe Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, defined by either WAS gene mutation or absent Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) expression or a Zhu clinical score of 3 or higher. We included patients who had no HLA-identical sibling donor available or, for children younger than 5 years of age, no suitable 10/10 matched unrelated donor or 6/6 unrelated cord blood donor. After treatment with rituximab and a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen of busulfan and fludarabine, patients received one intravenous infusion of autologous CD34+ cells genetically modified with a lentiviral vector encoding for human WAS cDNA. The primary safety endpoints were safety of the conditioning regimen and safety of lentiviral gene transfer into HSPCs. The primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival, sustained engraftment of genetically corrected HSPCs, expression of vector-derived WASP, improved T-cell function, antigen-specific responses to vaccinations, and improved platelet count and mean platelet volume normalisation. This interim analysis was done when the first six patients treated had completed at least 3 years of follow-up. The planned analyses are presented for the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01515462) and EudraCT (number 2009-017346-32). FINDINGS: Between April 20, 2010, and Feb 26, 2015, nine patients (all male) were enrolled of whom one was excluded after screening; the age range of the eight treated children was 1.1-12.4 years. At the time of the interim analysis (data cutoff April 29, 2016), median follow-up was 3.6 years (range 0.5-5.6). Overall survival was 100%. Engraftment of genetically corrected HSPCs was successful and sustained in all patients. The fraction of WASP-positive lymphocytes increased from a median of 3.9% (range 1.8-35.6) before gene therapy to 66.7% (55.7-98.6) at 12 months after gene therapy, whereas WASP-positive platelets increased from 19.1% (range 4.1-31.0) to 76.6% (53.1-98.4). Improvement of immune function was shown by normalisation of in-vitro T-cell function and successful discontinuation of immunoglobulin supplementation in seven patients with follow-up longer than 1 year, followed by positive antigen-specific response to vaccination. Severe infections fell from 2.38 (95% CI 1.44-3.72) per patient-year of observation (PYO) in the year before gene therapy to 0.31 (0.04-1.11) per PYO in the second year after gene therapy and 0.17 (0.00-0.93) per PYO in the third year after gene therapy. Before gene therapy, platelet counts were lower than 20 x 10(9) per L in seven of eight patients. At the last follow-up visit, the platelet count had increased to 20-50 x 10(9) per L in one patient, 50-100 x 10(9) per L in five patients, and more than 100 x 10(9) per L in two patients, which resulted in independence from platelet transfusions and absence of severe bleeding events. 27 serious adverse events in six patients occurred after gene therapy, 23 (85%) of which were infectious (pyrexia [five events in three patients], device-related infections, including one case of sepsis [four events in three patients], and gastroenteritis, including one case due to rotavirus [three events in two patients]); these occurred mainly in the first 6 months of follow-up. No adverse reactions to the investigational drug product and no abnormal clonal proliferation or leukaemia were reported after gene therapy. INTERPRETATION: Data from this study show that gene therapy provides a valuable treatment option for patients with severe Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, particularly for those who do not have a suitable HSPC donor available.

The activity of Dot1L is stimulated by mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2BK120Ub); however, the detailed mechanism is not understood. We report cryo-EM structures of human Dot1L bound to (1) H2BK120Ub and (2) unmodified nucleosome substrates at 3.5 A and 4.9 A, respectively. Comparison of both structures, complemented with biochemical experiments, provides critical insights into the mechanism of Dot1L stimulation by H2BK120Ub. Both structures show Dot1L binding to the same extended surface of the histone octamer. In yeast, this surface is used by silencing proteins involved in heterochromatin formation, explaining the mechanism of their competition with Dot1. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding conserved crosstalk between histone modifications found at actively transcribed genes and offer a general model of how ubiquitin might regulate the activity of chromatin enzymes.","['Valencia-Sanchez, Marco Igor', 'De Ioannes, Pablo', 'Wang, Miao', 'Vasilyev, Nikita', 'Chen, Ruoyu', 'Nudler, Evgeny', 'Armache, Jean-Paul', 'Armache, Karim-Jean']","['Valencia-Sanchez MI', 'De Ioannes P', 'Wang M', 'Vasilyev N', 'Chen R', 'Nudler E', 'Armache JP', 'Armache KJ']","['Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, USA.', 'Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.

Compared with conventional chemotherapy, mogamulizumab monotherapy displayed more efficacy in relapsed ATL, making mogamulizumab a promising therapeutic agent. However, mogamulizumab could increase graft-versus-host disease, resulting in poor survival outcome in the allogenic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) setting. It is possible that the efficacy of mogamulizumab could be established by the occurrence of skin rashes and/or CCR4 mutational status.

Lung bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a severe complication of PNP. OBJECTIVE: To determine the precise clinical and biologic features of HM-associated PNP and identify factors associated with mortality and survival. METHODS: Systematic review of previously described cases of PNP associated with HMs. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were included. The HMs were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (52.78%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (22.92%), Castleman disease (18.60%), and other underlying hematologic malignancy (5.70%). The mortality rate was 57%, and most deaths occurred within the first year after the diagnosis of PNP. Multivariate analysis showed that (1) the presence of antienvoplakin antibodies and BO were significantly associated with death, and (2) a toxic epidermal necrolysis-like clinical pattern, bullous pemphigoid-like clinical pattern, and BO were significantly associated with decreased survival. LIMITATION: Only case reports with sufficient mortality data were included. CONCLUSION: PNP associated with HM has a high mortality rate. The toxic epidermal necrolysis-like and BO-associated forms are independent survival factors in PNP associated with HMs.","['Ouedraogo, Elise', 'Gottlieb, Jeremy', 'de Masson, Adele', 'Lepelletier, Clemence', 'Jachiet, Marie', 'Salle de Chou, Camille', 'Galicier, Lionel', 'Bagot, Martine', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Bouaziz, Jean-David']","['Ouedraogo E', 'Gottlieb J', 'de Masson A', 'Lepelletier C', 'Jachiet M', 'Salle de Chou C', 'Galicier L', 'Bagot M', 'Chevret S', 'Bouaziz JD']","['Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', ""Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service d'Immuno-Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Sante Publique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.

Thus, the aim of our study was to assess the lifetime risk of Nordic non-CNS childhood cancer survivors for neurologic disorders. We identified 15,967 5-year survivors of non-CNS childhood cancer diagnosed in Denmark, Iceland, Finland and Sweden in 1943-2008, and 151,118 matched population comparison subjects. In-patient discharge diagnoses of neurologic disorders were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs). A neurologic disorder was diagnosed in 755 of the survivors while 370 were expected, yielding a RR of 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-2.2). The highest risks were found among survivors of neuroblastoma (4.1; 95% CI 3.2-5.3) and leukemia (2.8; 95% CI 2.4-3.2). The AER decreased from 331 (278-383) excess neurologic disorders per 100,000 person-years 5-9 years after diagnosis to 82 (46-118) >/= 20 years after diagnosis. Epilepsy was the most common diagnosis (n = 229, 1.4% of all survivors), and significantly increased risks were seen among survivors of eight out of 12 types of childhood cancer. Survivors of neuroblastoma had remarkably high risks (RR >/= 10) for hospitalization for paralytic syndromes and hydrocephalus, while survivors of leukemia had additional high risks for dementia and encephalopathy. In conclusion, survivors of non-CNS childhood cancer are at high risk for neurologic disorders, especially within the first decade after diagnosis. Therefore, intensive follow-up to identify those who require close management is needed.","['Kenborg, Line', 'Linnet, Karen M', 'de Fine Licht, Sofie', 'Bautz, Andrea', 'Holmqvist, Anna S', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Madanat-Harjuoja, Laura M', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Heilmann, Carsten', 'Albieri, Vanna', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Winther, Jeanette F']","['Kenborg L', 'Linnet KM', 'de Fine Licht S', 'Bautz A', 'Holmqvist AS', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Madanat-Harjuoja LM', 'Stovall M', 'Heilmann C', 'Albieri V', 'Hasle H', 'Winther JF']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Icelandic Cancer Registry, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Radiation Physics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Unit of Statistics and Pharmacoepidemiology, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190429,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/*complications/mortality', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*cohort study', '*late effects', '*neurologic disorders']",,2019/04/14 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32341 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Feb 1;146(3):819-828. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32341.

Different regimens have been compared, none of which has been shown to improve overall survival. The use of bendamustine is growing. A number of trials evaluated its efficacy for patients with indolent B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). To evaluate the efficacy of bendamustine in that population we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 randomised controlled trials (2726 patients). Bendamustine was compared to fludarabine-containing regimens, CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone), CHOP (CVP+ doxorubicin) and chlorambucil. Due to insufficient reported data, six of the nine trials were included in analysis of overall survival. Bendamustine was associated with a prolonged overall survival, (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.95). Data regarding quality of life was reported for two trials, therefore too scarce to pool. The risk of neutropenia was reduced with bendamustine treatment compared to other chemotherapy. Bendamustine induction is an efficacious option for patients with indolent lymphoma, and CLL. Maintenance therapy was not evaluated after bendamustine induction, and potentially there is an interaction between the two. Chemotherapy-free approach was shown to be efficacious for patients with CLL, while toxicity with that approach is not negligible.","['Vidal, Liat', 'Gurion, Ronit', 'Shargian, Liat', 'Dreyling, Martin', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat']","['Vidal L', 'Gurion R', 'Shargian L', 'Dreyling M', 'Gafter-Gvili A']","['Syneos Health, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Haematology, Davidoff Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv.', 'Institute of Haematology, Davidoff Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen-Grosshadern, Munchen, Germany.', 'Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv.', 'Department of Medicine A, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20190413,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*mortality', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*bendamustine', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*metaanlysis', '*non-Hodgkin-S lymphoma', '*systematic review']",,2019/04/14 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15901 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Jul;186(2):234-242. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15901.

In this study, we compared transplantation outcomes of 2963 patients with primary refractory or relapsed AML given CBT, 10/10 HLA-matched UD, or 9/10 HLA-matched UD allo-HCT from 2004 to 2015 at EBMT-affiliated centers.

In multivariate Cox analyses, in comparison with CBT (n = 285), UD 10/10 recipients (n = 2001) had a lower incidence of relapse (HR = 0.7, P = 0.001), a lower incidence of non relapse mortality (HR = 0.6, P < 0.001), better GVHD-free and leukemia-free survival (GRFS, HR = 0.8, P < 0.001) and better survival (HR = 0.6, P < 0.001). Further, in comparison with CBT, 9/10 UD recipients (n = 677) also had a lower incidence of relapse (HR = 0.8, P = 0.02), a lower incidence of nonrelapse mortality (HR = 0.7, P = 0.008), better GRFS (HR = 0.8, P = 0.01) and better survival (HR = 0.7, P < 0.001).

We studied the function of natural killer (NK) cells in people living in a malaria-endemic region of Mali. Multi-parameter flow cytometry revealed a high proportion of adaptive NK cells, which are defined by the loss of transcription factor PLZF and Fc receptor gamma-chain. Adaptive NK cells dominated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity responses, and their frequency within total NK cells correlated with lower parasitemia and resistance to malaria. P. falciparum-infected RBCs induced NK cell degranulation after addition of plasma from malaria-resistant individuals. Malaria-susceptible subjects with the largest increase in PLZF-negative NK cells during the transmission season had improved odds of resistance during the subsequent season. Thus, antibody-dependent lysis of P. falciparum-infected RBCs by NK cells may be a mechanism of acquired immunity to malaria. Consideration of antibody-dependent NK cell responses to P. falciparum antigens is therefore warranted in the design of malaria vaccines.","['Hart, Geoffrey T', 'Tran, Tuan M', 'Theorell, Jakob', 'Schlums, Heinrich', 'Arora, Gunjan', 'Rajagopalan, Sumati', 'Sangala, A D Jules', 'Welsh, Kerry J', 'Traore, Boubacar', 'Pierce, Susan K', 'Crompton, Peter D', 'Bryceson, Yenan T', 'Long, Eric O']","['Hart GT', 'Tran TM', 'Theorell J', 'Schlums H', 'Arora G', 'Rajagopalan S', 'Sangala ADJ', 'Welsh KJ', 'Traore B', 'Pierce SK', 'Crompton PD', 'Bryceson YT', 'Long EO']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD hart0792@umn.edu.', 'Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine, Department of Medicine, Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine, Department of Medicine, Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Clinical Chemistry Division, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Malaria Research and Training Center, Department of Epidemiology of Parasitic Diseases, International Center of Excellence in Research, University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Bamako, Mali.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD elong@nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20190412,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Protozoan/immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/parasitology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Malaria, Falciparum/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Plasmodium falciparum/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC6547858,,,,2019/04/14 06:00,2020/04/15 06:00,['2019/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20181681 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20181681 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2019 Jun 3;216(6):1280-1290. doi: 10.1084/jem.20181681.

CD19CAR T-cell therapy has also demonstrated prominent effects in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) patients. However, a subset of patients who relapse after CD19CAR T-cell therapy have outgrowth of CD19(-) tumor cells. Hence, development of alternative CARs targeting other B-cell markers represents an unmet medical need for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-NHL. Here, we confirmed previous data by showing that, overall, B-NHL has high expression of CD37. A second-generation CD37CAR was designed, and its efficacy in T cells was compared with that of CD19CAR. In vitro assessment of cytotoxicity and T-cell function upon coculture of the CAR T cells with different target B-cell lymphoma cell lines demonstrated comparable efficacy between the 2 CARs. In an aggressive B-cell lymphoma xenograft model, CD37CAR T cells were as potent as CD19CAR T cells in controlling tumor growth. In a second xenograft model, using U2932 lymphoma cells containing a CD19(-) subpopulation, CD37CAR T cells efficiently controlled tumor growth and prolonged survival, whereas CD19CAR T cells had limited effect. We further show that, unlike CD19CAR, CD37CAR was not sensitive to antigen masking. Finally, CD37CAR reactivity was restricted to B-lineage cells. Collectively, our results demonstrated that CD37CAR T cells also can effectively eradicate B-cell lymphoma tumors when CD19 antigen expression is lost and support further clinical testing for patients with relapsed/refractory B-NHL.","['Koksal, Hakan', 'Dillard, Pierre', 'Josefsson, Sarah E', 'Maggadottir, Solrun Melkorka', 'Pollmann, Sylvie', 'Fane, Anne', 'Blaker, Yngvild Nuvin', 'Beiske, Klaus', 'Huse, Kanutte', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Holte, Harald', 'Kvalheim, Gunnar', 'Smeland, Erlend B', 'Myklebust, June H', 'Inderberg, Else Marit', 'Walchli, Sebastien']","['Koksal H', 'Dillard P', 'Josefsson SE', 'Maggadottir SM', 'Pollmann S', 'Fane A', 'Blaker YN', 'Beiske K', 'Huse K', 'Kolstad A', 'Holte H', 'Kvalheim G', 'Smeland EB', 'Myklebust JH', 'Inderberg EM', 'Walchli S']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Pathology, and.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; and.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell Malignancies, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Cellular Therapy, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Tetraspanins)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Tetraspanins/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6482360,,,,2019/04/14 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018029678 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029678 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 23;3(8):1230-1243. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029678.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6745-1442', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4812-9159', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9128-670X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9799-9428', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0394-9986', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6147-3536', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5869-1746']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL COURSE: A 17-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia underwent HLA-haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation following fludarabine, busulfan, and total-body irradiation. Graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis was post-transplant cyclophosphamide, followed by intravenous tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. When tacrolimus was switched to oral administration, its blood level declined rapidly, resulting in development of acute graft-vs-host disease, which was ameliorated by switching back to intravenous administration. METHODS/RESULTS: To elucidate if impaired tacrolimus absorption could be related to genetic polymorphism of tacrolimus-metabolizing enzymes, we analyzed gene polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 3A4, cytochrome P450 3A5, and multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1). The patient had wild-type cytochrome P450 3A4 (*1/*1) and variant-type cytochrome P450 3A5 (*3/*3), while MDR1 genes (2677A/G, 3435C/C) were wild-type. CONCLUSION: Wild-type MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein expressed in the intestine reduces drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and may have contributed to low blood levels of tacrolimus in this patient when tacrolimus was orally administered.","['Matsuoka, S', 'Tsutsumi, Y', 'Kikuchi, R', 'Ito, S', 'Teshima, T']","['Matsuoka S', 'Tsutsumi Y', 'Kikuchi R', 'Ito S', 'Teshima T']","['Department of Hematology, Hakodate Municipal Hospital, Hakodate, Japan.

A conditioning regimen involving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-combined high-dose cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation (G-CSF-combined high-dose cytarabine/cyclophosphamide/total-body irradiation [HDCA/CY/TBI]) was reported to improve outcomes after cord blood transplant (CBT) for myeloid malignant neoplasms, but this regimen was not previously evaluated among patients undergoing bone marrow transplant (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT including BMT from a related (1 patient) or unrelated donor (9 patients), PBSCT from a related donor (7 patients), or single-unit CBT from an unrelated donor (11 patients) after a G-CSF-combined HDCA/CY/TBI regimen. RESULTS: All patients achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment, which were significantly more rapid in the BMT/PBSCT group than in the CBT group. Eighteen patients were alive at a median follow-up of 54.3 months. The 3-year relapse and nonrelapse mortality rates were 28.6% and 7.1%, respectively, which were similar between the BMT/PBSCT and CBT groups. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 years after HCT were 62.6% and 64.3%, respectively, which were also similar between the BMT/PBSCT and CBT groups. Only disease status at HCT had a significant impact on overall survival and disease-free survival (86.7% with standard risk vs 38.5% with high risk and 86.7% with standard risk vs 38.5% with high risk, respectively). CONCLUSION: A G-CSF-combined HDCA/CY/TBI regimen is a promising conditioning in patients with myeloid malignant neoplasms who undergo not only CBT but also BMT or PBSCT.","['Nakamura, Y', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Tanaka, M', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Matsuguma, M', 'Kajimura, Y', 'Tokunaga, Y', 'Yujiri, T', 'Tanizawa, Y']","['Nakamura Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tanaka M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Matsuguma M', 'Kajimura Y', 'Tokunaga Y', 'Yujiri T', 'Tanizawa Y']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.

METHODS: Eligible patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, completed therapy, and had no evidence of disease at enrollment. Patients aged 7 or older (N = 13) and at least one parent (N = 23 for 20 total patients) were surveyed and completed assessments at enrollment (Time 1, T1), SCP delivery (Time 2, T2), and follow-up (Time 3, T3) (retention 90.9%). Surveys assessed the delivery process and SCP format. McNemar tests were used to assess change from T2-T3. RESULTS: Satisfaction with the SCP was generally high among parents. At T1 the majority of parents (69.6%) thought the SCP should be delivered after treatment but by T3 most preferred the plan to be delivered before the end of treatment (60.9%). While 95.7% of parents intended to share their child's SCP with another provider, family, or school at T2, only 60.9% had done so by T3 (P < 0.01). At both T2 and T3, 100% of parents agreed that the SCP would help make decisions about their child's future health care. Most patients at T3 (83.3%) felt they had learned something new from their SCP. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric oncology patients and families feel SCPs are useful and will help them make decisions about health care in the future.","['Pannier, Samantha T', 'Mann, Karely', 'Warner, Echo L', 'Rosen, Stephanie', 'Acharya, Akanksha', 'Hacking, Claire', 'Gerdy, Cheryl', 'Wright, Jennifer', 'Wu, Yelena P', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C']","['Pannier ST', 'Mann K', 'Warner EL', 'Rosen S', 'Acharya A', 'Hacking C', 'Gerdy C', 'Wright J', 'Wu YP', 'Kirchhoff AC']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'University of Utah, College of Nursing, 10 2000 E, Salt Lake City, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', ""Primary Children's Hospital, Intermountain Healthcare, 100 N.

However, their entry into inflammation sites is still limited since passive delivery of nanoparticles is often hampered by the presence of endothelial barriers. As leukocytes can pass through the inflamed endothelium via utilizing membrane protein functions, we hypothesized that incorporating leukocyte membrane proteins onto liposomal membranes may impart leukocyte-mimicking functions to liposomes, allowing for their adherence to and active passage through the inflamed endothelium. Herein, we developed leukocyte-mimetic liposomes (LM-Lipo) by leukocyte membrane protein transfer and evaluated their function in vitro. Transfer of membrane proteins from human leukemia cells onto liposomal membranes allowed for significant association of the liposomes with inflamed human endothelial cells, and subsequent passage through inflamed endothelial cell layer. The confocal images showed that LM-Lipo significantly induced vascular endothelial-cadherin displacement.

The symptoms and clinical presentation of SM are the result of both MC proliferation as well as activation and degranulation, causing hyperactive and over-exaggerated hypersensitivity responses, as well as organ infiltration by pathogenic MCs. The clinical presentation and course of SM is varied and organ involvement can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in some cases. The subtypes of SM include indolent SM (ISM), smoldering SM (SSM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) and survival can range from normal in the case of ISM to months in MCL. The treatment of indolent forms of SM is largely focused on addressing symptom burden (B findings), while cytoreductive agents and more recently molecularly targeted agents are employed to reduce MC burden and reverse associated organ dysfunction (C findings). Although the pathogenesis of SM is multi-factorial, the acquisition of KIT D816 V is a relatively frequent mutational event and serves as the target of novel agents. The recent approval of midostaurin for the treatment of advanced SM has brought awareness to this disease and energized further drug development efforts. Expanding our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of SM will continue to inform future therapeutic approaches.","['Coltoff, Alexander', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Coltoff A', 'Mascarenhas J']","['Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.

We randomly assigned patients to continuous versus intermittent pegylated-asparaginase (PEG-asp) treatment, hypothesizing there would be decreased toxicity with unchanged efficacy. METHODS: Children (median age, 4.2 years) treated for non-high-risk ALL according to the Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol received five intramuscular PEG-asp injections (1,000 IU/m(2)) every two weeks and were then randomly assigned to additional three doses (6-week intervals [experimental arm], n = 309) versus 10 doses (2-week intervals [standard arm], n = 316). The primary end point was noninferior (6% margin) disease-free survival. Toxicity reduction was a secondary end point. Occurrence of asparaginase-associated hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, osteonecrosis, and thromboembolism were prospectively registered. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.1 years, the 5-year disease-free survival was 92.2% (95% CI, 88.6 to 95.8) and 90.8% (95% CI, 87.0 to 94.6) in the experimental and standard arms, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of any first asparaginase-associated toxicity (hypersensitivity [n = 13]; osteonecrosis [n = 29]; pancreatitis [n = 24]; thromboembolism [n = 17]) was 9.3% in the experimental arm and 18.1% in the standard arm (P = .001). Asparaginase-associated toxicity reduction was confirmed in sex- and risk-group-adjusted Cox regression analysis stratified by age (>/= 10 and < 10 years; hazard ratio, 0.48; P = .001). The experimental arm had the lowest incidences of all four toxicities, reaching significance for pancreatitis (6-month risk, 5.8% v 1.3%; P = .002). CONCLUSION: The excellent cure rates and reduced toxicity risk support the use of intermittent PEG-asp therapy after the first 10 weeks in future childhood ALL trials that apply prolonged PEG-asp therapy.","['Albertsen, Birgitte Klug', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Lund, Bendik', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Wolthers, Benjamin O', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Albertsen BK', 'Grell K', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Lund B', 'Vettenranta K', 'Jonsson OG', 'Frandsen TL', 'Wolthers BO', 'Heyman M', 'Schmiegelow K']","['1 Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', '2 University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '3 Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '4 University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', '5 Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', '6 Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', '7 Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.', '3 Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '3 Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '8 Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', '2 University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '3 Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190412,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparagine/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/chemically induced', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Thromboembolism/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2019/04/13 06:00,2020/06/06 06:00,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.01877 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Jul 1;37(19):1638-1646. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.01877.

Inhalation of acid ceramidase facilitated the elimination of P. aeruginosa in acutely- or chronically-infected mice with cystic fibrosis. Thus, inhalation of acid ceramidase might be a preventive and/or curative treatment for patients with cystic fibrosis suffering from pneumonia. METHODS: We treated cultured epithelial cells or leukemic T-lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) with purified acid ceramidase and determined intracellular signalling events, proliferation and cell survival. Specifically, we measured the activity of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase using activation-specific phospho-antibodies in western blot studies. Trypan Blue staining served to analyze proliferation and cell survival. RESULTS: Our studies indicate that treatment of Chang epithelial cells or Jurkat T lymphocytes with purified acid ceramidase results in a dose dependent activation of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase, while tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins remains largely unchanged. Acid ceramidase treatment did not change expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, ZO-2 and occludin. Cellular viability and proliferation were not affected by acid ceramidase treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that treatment of epithelial cells and lymphocytes with acid ceramidase results in activation of distinct pathways, in particular AKT- and p38K-dependent pathways, while no global activation or cell death was observed.","['Baduva, Kathe', 'Buchter, Lara', 'Kreyenkamp, Katja', 'Westphal, Linnea', 'Wilker, Barbara', 'Kohnen, Marcus', 'Schuchman, Edward H', 'Edwards, Michael J', 'Becker, Katrin Anne', 'Gulbins, Erich', 'Carpinteiro, Alexander']","['Baduva K', 'Buchter L', 'Kreyenkamp K', 'Westphal L', 'Wilker B', 'Kohnen M', 'Schuchman EH', 'Edwards MJ', 'Becker KA', 'Gulbins E', 'Carpinteiro A']","['Gymnasium Essen-Werden, Essen, Germany.', 'Gymnasium Essen-Werden, Essen, Germany.', 'Gymnasium Essen-Werden, Essen, Germany.', 'Gymnasium Essen-Werden, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Medical School, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Gymnasium Essen-Werden, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics & Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Medical School, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Medical School, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Medical School, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany, alexander.carpinteiro@uk-essen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (ASAH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (Acid Ceramidase)']",IM,"['Acid Ceramidase/*pharmacology', 'Cystic Fibrosis/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acid ceramidase', '*Cystic fibrosis', '*Epithelial cells', '*Lymphocytes', '*Signalling']",['The authors declare to have no conflicts of interest.'],2019/04/13 06:00,2019/05/03 06:00,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.33594/000000074 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2019;52(5):1092-1102. doi: 10.33594/000000074.,,['(c) Copyright by the Author(s).

To this end, a multitude of organic and inorganic nanoparticles have been designed to facilitate drug delivery, sensing, and imaging, some of which are currently in clinical trials or have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the process, the increasing knowledge in understanding how natural particulates, including cells, pathogens, and organelles, interact with body and cellular systems has spurred efforts to mimic their morphology and functions for developing new generations of nanomedicine formulations. In addition, the advances in bioengineering tools, bioconjugation chemistries, and bio-nanotechnologies have further enabled researchers to exploit these natural particulates for theranostic purposes. In this Account, we will discuss the recent progress in our lab on engineering bioinspired and biomimetic synthetic and cellular systems toward rational design of nanomedicine platforms for treating diabetes and cancer. Inspired by the structure and response mechanism of pancreatic beta-cells, we synthesized a series of insulin granule-like vesicles that can respond to high blood or intestinal glucose levels for aiding in transdermal or oral insulin delivery, respectively. Then, to more closely mimic the multicompartmental architecture of beta-cells, we further developed synthetic artificial cells with vesicle-in-vesicle superstructures which can sense blood glucose levels and dynamically release insulin via a membrane fusion process. Meanwhile, clues drawn from the traits of anaerobic bacteria that selectively invade and proliferate in solid tumors inspired the synthesis of a light-tuned hypoxia-responsive nanovesicle for implementing synergistic cancer therapy. In parallel, we also studied how autologous particulates could be recruited for developing advanced drug delivery systems. Through combination of genetic engineering and top-down cell engineering technologies, biomimetic nanomedicines derived from cytoplasmic membrane with programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptors expressed on surfaces were generated and employed for cancer immunotherapy. Based on our earlier study where aPD-L1 (antibodies against PD ligand 1)-conjugated platelets could release aPD-L1-bearing particles in situ and inhibit postsurgical tumor recurrence, we further genetically engineered megakaryocytes, the precursor cells of platelets, to express PD-1 receptors. In this way, platelets born with checkpoint blocking activity could be produced directly in vitro, avoiding post chemical modification processes while exerting similar therapeutic impact. As a further extension, by virtue of the bone marrow-homing ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we recently conceived a cell-combination strategy by conjugating HSCs with platelets decorated with antibodies against PD1 (aPD-1) to suppress the growth and recurrence of leukemia.

In CPS-II, body mass index (BMI) was weakly associated with risk of CML (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1.09 per 1 unit increase in BMI), AML (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98-1.03) and MDS (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99-1.07). After controlling for other anthropometric factors, no clear association was observed for height, BMI at age 18 years or weight change. In the meta-analysis (n = 7117 myeloid leukaemias), BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2) (HRpooled = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.12-1.59) and BMI >/=30 kg/m(2) (HRpooled = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.18-1.69) were associated with higher risk of myeloid leukaemia overall, compared to a BMI <25 kg/m(2) . Likewise, BMI >/=25 kg/m(2) was positively associated with both AML and CML risk individually in the meta-analysis. These results underscore the need for large studies to detect associations with rare cancers, and show a modest, but positive association between excess body weight and myeloid malignancy risk.","['Teras, Lauren R', 'Patel, Alpa V', 'Carter, Brian D', 'Rees-Punia, Erika', 'McCullough, Marjorie L', 'Gapstur, Susan M']","['Teras LR', 'Patel AV', 'Carter BD', 'Rees-Punia E', 'McCullough ML', 'Gapstur SM']","['Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190411,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Body Height', '*Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/pathology/physiopathology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*body mass index', '*haematological malignancies', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*myeloid leukaemia', '*obesity']",,2019/04/13 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15904 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Jul;186(2):243-254. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15904.

The structures of novel compounds were determined using (1)H and (13)C NMR, and GC-APCI-MS analyses. Among the derivatives, compound 2c, 2d, 2e and 2f has very strong activity against biphenotypic B myelomonocytic leukemia MV4-11, with IC50 values from 5.42 to 7.69microg/ml. The cytotoxic activity of compounds 2c-2f against normal human mammary gland epithelial cells MCF-10A is 6-11 times lower than against cancer cell lines. Our results also show that compounds 2c and 2f have very strong activity against DAUDI and HT-29 with IC50 4.91microg/ml and 5.59microg/ml, respectively. Their lipophilicity was determined using reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography and correlated with antiproliferative activity. Our UV-Vis spectroscopic results indicate also that triazene salts tends to interact with negatively charged DNA phosphate chain.

Previously, we have shown that IBTK RNA interference affects the wide genome expression and RNA splicing in cell-type specific manner. Further, the expression of IBTK gene progressively increases from indolent to aggressive stage of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and decreases in disease remission after therapy. However, the role of IBTK in tumorigenesis has not been elucidated. Here, we report that loss of the murine Ibtk gene raises survival and delays tumor onset in Emu-myc transgenic mice, a preclinical model of Myc-driven lymphoma. In particular, we found that the number of pre-cancerous B cells of bone marrow and spleen is reduced in Ibtk(-/-)Emu-myc mice owing to impaired viability and increased apoptosis, as measured by Annexin V binding, Caspase 3/7 cleavage assays and cell cycle profile analysis. Instead, the proliferation rate of pre-cancerous B cells is unaffected by the loss of Ibtk. We observed a direct correlation between Ibtk and myc expression and demonstrated a Myc-dependent regulation of Ibtk expression in murine B cells, human hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines by analysis of ChIP-seq data. By tet-repressible Myc system, we confirmed a Myc-dependent expression of IBTK in human B cells. Further, we showed that Ibtk loss affected the main apoptotic pathways dependent on Myc overexpression in pre-cancerous Emu-myc mice, in particular, MCL-1 and p53. Of note, we found that loss of IBTK impaired cell cycle and increased apoptosis also in a human epithelial cell line, HeLa cells, in Myc-independent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that Ibtk sustains the oncogenic activity of Myc by inhibiting apoptosis of murine pre-cancerous B cells, as a cell-specific mechanism. Our findings could be relevant for the development of IBTK inhibitors sensitizing tumor cells to apoptosis.","['Vecchio, Eleonora', 'Golino, Gaetanina', 'Pisano, Antonio', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Falcone, Cristina', 'Ceglia, Simona', 'Iaccino, Enrico', 'Mimmi, Selena', 'Fiume, Giuseppe', 'Giurato, Giorgio', 'Britti, Domenico', 'Scala, Giuseppe', 'Quinto, Ileana']","['Vecchio E', 'Golino G', 'Pisano A', 'Albano F', 'Falcone C', 'Ceglia S', 'Iaccino E', 'Mimmi S', 'Fiume G', 'Giurato G', 'Britti D', 'Scala G', 'Quinto I']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy. eleonoravecchio@unicz.it.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry ""Scuola Medica Salernitana"", University of Salerno, Baronissi, SA, Italy.', 'Genomix4Life srl, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry ""Scuola Medica Salernitana"", University of Salerno, Baronissi, SA, Italy.', 'Department of Health Science, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Interdepartmental Services Centre of Veterinary for Human and Animal Health, University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy. quinto@unicz.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190411,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (IBtk protein, human)', '0 (IBtk protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6459904,,,,2019/04/13 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1557-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1557-6 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Apr 11;10(4):320. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1557-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated phospho-Akt levels in cancerous tissue were associated with short progression-free survival and overall survival. Cell sensitivity to SC66 was inversely correlated with phospho-Akt and COL11A1 expression levels, as well as resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel. SC66 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effectors 4EBP1 and p70S6 kinase. SC66 also attenuated expression of TWIST1 and Mcl-1, factors important in cell invasiveness and anti-apoptosis, respectively. SC66-sensitized chemoresistant cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment, and promoted apoptosis. In addition, SC66 inhibited COL11A1 expression via decreased binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (c/EBPbeta), reducing chemoresistance and decreasing binding of nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-YA) to COL11A1. A mouse xenograft experiment demonstrated that SC66 treatment caused a reduction in tumor formation and enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. This study demonstrates the role of Akt in ovarian tumor progression and chemoresistance, and supports the application of SC66 as a therapy for ovarian cancer.","['Wu, Yi-Hui', 'Huang, Yu-Fang', 'Chen, Chien-Chin', 'Chou, Cheng-Yang']","['Wu YH', 'Huang YF', 'Chen CC', 'Chou CY']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Chia-Yi Christian Hospital, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.', 'Department of Cosmetic Science, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. chougyn@mail.ncku.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190411,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (COL11A1 protein, human)', '0 (Collagen Type XI)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (SC-66 compound)', '0 (TWIST1 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Collagen Type XI/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclohexanones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6459878,,,,2019/04/13 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1555-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1555-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Apr 11;10(4):322. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1555-8.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9599-0884'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients suffer from adverse effects mandating treatment discontinuation, and cases with TP53 defects more frequently experience early progression of the disease. Development of alternative therapeutic approaches is, therefore, of critical importance. Here we report details of the anti-chronic lymphocytic leukemia single-agent activity of MU380, our recently identified potent, selective, and metabolically robust inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1. We also describe a newly developed enantioselective synthesis of MU380, which allows preparation of gram quantities of the substance. Checkpoint kinase 1 is a master regulator of replication operating primarily in intra-S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints. Initially tested in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, MU380 significantly potentiated efficacy of gemcitabine, a clinically used inducer of replication stress. Moreover, MU380 manifested substantial single-agent activity in both TP53-wild type and TP53-mutated leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived cell lines MEC-1, MEC-2 (both TP53-mut), and OSU-CLL (TP53-wt) the inhibitor impaired cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. In primary clinical samples, MU380 used as a single-agent noticeably reduced the viability of unstimulated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells as well as those induced to proliferate by anti-CD40/IL-4 stimuli. In both cases, effects were comparable in samples harboring p53 pathway dysfunction (TP53 mutations or ATM mutations) and TP53-wt/ATM-wt cells. Lastly, MU380 also exhibited significant in vivo activity in a xenotransplant mouse model (immunodeficient strain NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) ) where it efficiently suppressed growth of subcutaneous tumors generated from MEC-1 cells.","['Boudny, Miroslav', 'Zemanova, Jana', 'Khirsariya, Prashant', 'Borsky, Marek', 'Verner, Jan', 'Cerna, Jana', 'Oltova, Alexandra', 'Seda, Vaclav', 'Mraz, Marek',

First, pre-leukemic mutations, such as t(8;21) that encodes AML1-ETO, are acquired within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, while signaling pathway mutations, including KRAS activating mutations, are late events acquired during transformation of leukemic progenitor cells and are rarely detectable in HSC. This raises the possibility that signaling pathway mutations are detrimental to clonal expansion of pre-leukemic HSC. To address this hypothesis, we used conditional genetics to introduce Aml1-ETO and K-RasG12D into murine HSC, either individually or in combination. In the absence of activated Ras, Aml1-ETO-expressing HSC conferred a competitive advantage. However, activated K-Ras had a marked detrimental effect on Aml1-ETO-expressing HSC, leading to loss of both phenotypic and functional HSC. Cell cycle analysis revealed a loss of quiescence in HSC co-expressing Aml1-ETO and K-RasG12D, accompanied by an enrichment in E2F and Myc target gene expression and depletion of HSC self-renewal-associated gene expression. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the observed absence of KRAS signaling mutations in the pre-malignant HSC compartment.","['Di Genua, Cristina', 'Norfo, Ruggiero', 'Rodriguez-Meira, Alba', 'Wen, Wei Xiong', 'Drissen, Roy', 'Booth, Christopher A G', 'Povinelli, Benjamin', 'Repapi, Emmanouela', 'Gray, Nicki', 'Carrelha, Joana', 'Kettyle, Laura M', 'Jamieson, Lauren', 'Neo, Wen Hao', 'Thongjuea, Supat', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Mead, Adam J']","['Di Genua C', 'Norfo R', 'Rodriguez-Meira A', 'Wen WX', 'Drissen R', 'Booth CAG', 'Povinelli B', 'Repapi E', 'Gray N', 'Carrelha J', 'Kettyle LM', 'Jamieson L', 'Neo WH', 'Thongjuea S', 'Nerlov C', 'Mead AJ']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'WIMM Centre for Computational Biology.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'Computational Biology Research Group, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Computational Biology Research Group, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit.', 'WIMM Centre for Computational Biology.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit claus.nerlov@imm.ox.ac.uk.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit adam.mead@imm.ox.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190411,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Animal', 'Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6821613,,,,2019/04/13 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.205351 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.205351 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Nov;104(11):2215-2224. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.205351.

Here we show that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), homoharringtonine potently inhibits cell growth/viability and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, significantly inhibits disease progression in vivo, and substantially prolongs survival of mice bearing murine or human AML. Strikingly, homoharringtonine treatment dramatically decreases global DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine abundance through targeting the SP1/TET1 axis, and TET1 depletion mimics homoharringtonine's therapeutic effects in AML. Our further 5hmC-seq and RNA-seq analyses, followed by a series of validation and functional studies, suggest that FLT3 is a critical down-stream target of homoharringtonine/SP1/TET1/5hmC signaling, and suppression of FLT3 and its downstream targets (e.g. MYC) contributes to the high sensitivity of FLT3-mutated AML cells to homoharringtonine. Collectively, our studies uncover a previously unappreciated DNA epigenome-related mechanism underlying the potent antileukemic effect of homoharringtonine, which involves suppression of the SP1/TET1/5hmC/FLT3/MYC signaling pathways in AML. Our work also highlights the particular promise of clinical application of homoharringtonine to treat human AML with FLT3 mutations, which accounts for more than 30% of total cases of AML.","['Li,

FLT3-ITD interacts with DOCK2, a G effector protein that activates Rac1/2. Previously, we showed that knockdown of DOCK2 leads to decreased survival of FLT3-ITD leukemic cells. We further investigated the mechanisms by which Rac1/DOCK2 activity affects cell survival and chemotherapeutic response in FLT3-ITD leukemic cells. Exogenous expression of FLT3-ITD led to increased Rac1 activity, reactive oxygen species, phosphorylated STAT5, DNA damage response factors and cytarabine resistance. Conversely, DOCK2 knockdown resulted in a decrease in these factors. Consistent with the reduction in DNA damage response factors, FLT3-ITD cells with DOCK2 knockdown exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to DNA damage response inhibitors. Moreover, in a mouse model of FLT3-ITD AML, animals treated with the CHK1 inhibitor MK8776 + cytarabine survived longer than those treated with cytarabine alone. These findings suggest that FLT3-ITD and Rac1 activity cooperatively modulate DNA repair activity, the addition of DNA damage response inhibitors to conventional chemotherapy may be useful in the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML, and inhibition of the Rac signaling pathways via DOCK2 may provide a novel and promising therapeutic target for FLT3-ITD AML.","['Wu, Min', 'Li, Li', 'Hamaker, Max', 'Small, Donald', 'Duffield, Amy S']","['Wu M', 'Li L', 'Hamaker M', 'Small D', 'Duffield AS']","['Department of Pathology.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Pathology aduffie1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190411,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DOCK2 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (MK-8776)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6959181,,,,2019/04/13 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.208843 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.208843 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Dec;104(12):2418-2428. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.208843.

Adoptive therapy with CAR-T cells has been highly successful in B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. However, in solid tumor settings, CAR-T cells face a particularly hostile tumor microenvironment where multiple immune suppressive factors serve to thwart the anti-cancer immune response. Clinical trials of solid tumor antigen-targeted CAR-T cells have shown limited efficacy, and issues for current CAR-T cell therapies include failures of expansion and persistence, tumor entry, deletion and functional exhaustion. METHODS: We compared our standard protocol for CAR-T cell manufacturing, currently used to generate CAR-T cells for a phase 1 clinical trial, with two alternative approaches for T-cell activation and expansion. The resulting cultures were analyzed using multicolor flow cytometry, cytokine bead array and xCELLigence cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: We have found that by changing the method of activation we can promote generation of CAR-T cells with enhanced CD62L and CCR7 expression, increased interleukin (IL)-2 production and retention of cytolytic activity, albeit with slower kinetics. DISCUSSION: We propose that these phenotypic characteristics are consistent with a central memory phenotype that will better enable CAR-T cell survival and persistence after activation in vivo, and we aim to test this in a continuation of our current phase 1 clinical trial of CAR-T cells in patients with advanced melanoma.","['Gargett, Tessa', 'Truong, Nga', 'Ebert, Lisa M', 'Yu, Wenbo', 'Brown, Michael P']","['Gargett T', 'Truong N', 'Ebert LM', 'Yu W', 'Brown MP']","['Translational Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Biology, University of South Australia and SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

HOX expression is generally reduced in adult cells but is frequently re-established as an early event in tumour formation and supports an oncogenic phenotype. HOX transcription factors are also involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, along with normal adult physiological process including stem cell renewal. There have been extensive studies on the mechanism by which HOX proteins regulate transcription, with particular emphasis on their interaction with cofactors such as Pre-B-cell Leukaemia Homeobox (PBX) and Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 (MEIS). However, significantly less is known of how the activity of HOX proteins is regulated. There is growing evidence that phosphorylation may play an important role in this context, and in this review, we draw together a number of important studies published over the last 20 years, and discuss the relevance of phosphorylation in the regulation and function of HOX proteins in development, evolution, cell cycle regulation, and cancer.","['Primon, Monika', 'Hunter, Keith D', 'Pandha, Hardev S', 'Morgan, Richard']","['Primon M', 'Hunter KD', 'Pandha HS', 'Morgan R']","['Institute of Cancer Therapeutics, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, UK. m.primon@bradford.ac.uk.', 'Unit of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, School of Clinical Dentistry, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK. k.hunter@sheffield.ac.uk.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, UK. h.pandha@surrey.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Cancer Therapeutics, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, UK. r.morgan3@bradford.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190410,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6521248,['NOTNLM'],"['HOX', 'cancer', 'cell cycle', 'embryonic patterning', 'phosphorylation']",,2019/04/13 06:00,2019/04/13 06:01,['2019/04/13 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11040508 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11040508 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Apr 10;11(4). pii: cancers11040508. doi: 10.3390/cancers11040508.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7873-0877', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8721-4479']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, for patients with a KMT2A rearrangement (KMT2A-r), the prognosis appears to depend on the fusion partner gene rather than the karyotype structure. Thus, a precise characterization of KMT2A-r and the fusion partner genes, especially in CKs, is of interest for managing AML. We describe the clinical and molecular features of a child who presented with a large abdominal mass, AML, and a new CK, involving chromosomes 11, 16, and 19 leading to a KMT2A-MLLT1 fusion and 2 extra copies of the ELL gene, thus resulting in the concurrent overexpression of MLLT1 and ELL. Molecular cytogenetic studies defined the karyotype as 47,XY,der(11)t(11;16)(q23.3;p11.2),der(16)t(16;19)(p11.2;p13.3),der(19)t(11;19)(q 23.3;p13.3),+der(19)t(16;19)(16pter-->p11.2::19p13.3-->19q11::19p11-->19p13.3::16 p11.2-->16pter).

Reverse sequence analysis showed that the MLLT1 gene was fused to the 16p11.2 region. RT-qPCR quantification revealed that ELL and MLLT1 were overexpressed (4- and 10-fold, respectively).

In this study, we demonstrated that the coiled-coil-four-helix bundle structure of EB1 that participated in the MLL/EB1 was required for immortalizing mouse bone marrow (BM) cells and producing myeloid, but not lymphoid, cell lines. Compared to MLL/AF10, MLL/EB1 had low leukemogenic ability. The MLL/EB1 cells grew more slowly owing to increased apoptosis in vitro and induced acute monocytic leukemia with an incomplete penetrance and longer survival in vivo.

Analysis of the 318 genes using Gene Ontology-PANTHER overrepresentation test revealed significant differences in several biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation/programmed cell death, and cell homing/recruitment. The Ets1 gene, bound by MLL and MLL/AF9, was involved in several biological processes. We demonstrated that Ets1 was selectively upregulated by MLL/EB1. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of Ets1 in MLL/EB1 cells reduced the expression of CD115, apoptosis rate, competitive engraftment to BM and spleen, and incidence of leukemia and prolonged the survival of the diseased mice. Our results demonstrated that MLL/EB1 upregulated Ets1, which controlled the balance of leukemia cells between apoptosis and BM engraftment/clonal expansion. Novelty and impact of this study The leukemogenic potential of MLL fusion with cytoplasmic proteins containing coiled-coil dimerization domains and the downstream target genes of this type of MLL fusion remain largely unknown. Using a retroviral transduction/transplantation mouse model, we demonstrated that MLL fusion with the coiled-coil-four-helix bundle structure of EB1 has low leukemogenic ability; Ets1, which is upregulated by MLL/EB1, plays a critical role in leukemic transformation by balance between apoptosis and BM engraftment/clonal expansion.","['Fu, Jen-Fen', 'Yen, Tzung-Hai', 'Huang, Ying-Jung', 'Shih, Lee-Yung']","['Fu JF', 'Yen TH', 'Huang YJ', 'Shih LY']","['Department of Medical Research, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

However, the roles played by suppressors of cytokine signaling remain incompletely understood. We examined the regulatory roles of suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) in T-ALL cellular signaling networks and leukemia progression. We found that SOCS5 was differentially expressed in primary T-ALL and its expression levels were lowered in HOXA-deregulated leukemia harboring KMT2A gene rearrangements. Here, we report that SOCS5 expression is epigenetically regulated by DNA methyltransferase-3A-mediated DNA methylation and methyl CpG binding protein-2-mediated histone deacetylation. We show that SOCS5 negatively regulates T-ALL cell growth and cell cycle progression but has no effect on apoptotic cell death. Mechanistically, SOCS5 silencing induces activation of JAK-STAT signaling, and negatively regulates interleukin-7 and interleukin-4 receptors. Using a human T-ALL murine xenograft model, we show that genetic inactivation of SOCS5 accelerates leukemia engraftment and progression, and leukemia burden. We postulate that SOCS5 is epigenetically deregulated in T-ALL and serves as an important regulator of T-ALL cell proliferation and leukemic progression. Our results link aberrant downregulation of SOCS5 expression to the enhanced activation of the JAK-STAT and cytokine receptor-signaling cascade in T-ALL.","['Sharma, Nitesh D', 'Nickl, Christian K', 'Kang, Huining', 'Ornatowski, Wojciech', 'Brown, Roger', 'Ness, Scott A', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Cannon, Judy L', 'Matlawska-Wasowska, Ksenia']","['Sharma ND', 'Nickl CK', 'Kang H', 'Ornatowski W', 'Brown R', 'Ness SA', 'Loh ML', 'Mullighan CG', 'Winter SS', 'Hunger SP', 'Cannon JL', 'Matlawska-Wasowska K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Children's Minnesota Research Institute and Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN."", ""Department of Pediatrics and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190503,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (SOCS5 protein, human)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease Progression', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNAi Therapeutics/methods', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",PMC6549933,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'JAK-STAT', 'T-ALL', 'histone deacetylation', 'signal transduction']",,2019/04/12 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14021 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Jun;110(6):1931-1946. doi: 10.1111/cas.14021.

METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries with CML who were diagnosed between 2007 and 2012 at age >65 years were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (805 beneficiaries). A noncancer Medicare beneficiary sample was frequency-matched based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity (805 individuals). Patients were followed until 5 years from diagnosis, disenrollment, death, or December 31, 2014, whichever came first. Total Medicare spending, service-specific spending, and amount owed by patients was estimated monthly and then summed over 60 months and averaged to generate annual spending. RESULTS: The median age at the time of diagnosis of CML was 76 years (range, 66-102 years). Overall, 51.4% of patients received TKIs (27.8% received imatinib alone), 28% received non-TKI therapy, and 21% received no treatment. The 5-year survival rate for patients with >/=85% time receiving TKIs was 79% compared with 76% for noncancer controls versus 62% for those with <85% time receiving TKIs. Annual Medicare spending was found to be significantly higher for patients treated with TKIs ($143,053) compared with those treated without TKIs ($41,268 vs $10,498 for noncancer controls). Annual patient cost responsibility was $11,712 per patient receiving any TKIs versus $7330 for those receiving non-TKI outpatient chemotherapy versus $3561 for noncancer controls. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with CML with adequate time receiving TKI therapy have 5-year survival rates that are comparable to those of their counterparts without cancer. However, TKI use is accompanied with significant Medicare and patient spending; patients receiving multiple TKIs (ie, dasatinib or nilotinib along with imatinib) constitute the group with the highest spending.","['Kenzik, Kelly M', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Williams, Grant R', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Kenzik KM', 'Bhatia R', 'Williams GR', 'Bhatia S']","['Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190411,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*economics/mortality', 'Male', 'Medicare/*standards', 'SEER Program', 'United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Medicare spending', '*chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*health care use', '*patient spending']",,2019/04/12 06:00,2020/05/13 06:00,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32137 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Aug 1;125(15):2570-2578. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32137.

However, little is known about its incidence, strategies for ophthalmic surveillance, and timely implementation of adequate antiviral treatment in pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients. We provide a retrospective analysis of the epidemiology and clinical features of CMVR in pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients transplanted at our center over a 16-year period. Two patients of this cohort with leukemia are presented. Our analysis is supplemented by a systematic review on pediatric patients with leukemia and CMVR in the setting of allogeneic HSCT. The overall incidence of CMVR in our cohort was 1% (4/338) and 14.2% (3/21) in leukemic patients. In published cases, CMVR occurred at a median of 143 days after transplantation, and, in the majority of patients, was preceded by CMV detection in blood by a median of 93 days. Continued immune suppression following engraftment likely triggers CMVR. Preemptive treatment with ganciclovir as standard is usually successful. Foscarnet is used in case of resistance to ganciclovir or drug-induced granulocytopenia. Overall, CMVR after HSCT in pediatric leukemic patients is rare, but a potentially higher vulnerability of this population for involvement of the eye warrants a standardized ophthalmological examination plan.","['Zollner, Stefan K', 'Herbruggen, Heidrun', 'Kolve, Hedwig', 'Mihailovic, Natasa', 'Schubert, Friederike', 'Reicherts, Christian', 'Rossig, Claudia', 'Groll, Andreas H']","['Zollner SK', 'Herbruggen H', 'Kolve H', 'Mihailovic N', 'Schubert F', 'Reicherts C', 'Rossig C', 'Groll AH']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", 'Pharmacy Department, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20190813,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*virology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'cytomegalovirus', 'leukemia', 'retinitis', 'transplantation']",,2019/04/12 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.13089 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2019 Oct;21(5):e13089. doi: 10.1111/tid.13089.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is frequently complicated by anaemia. The objective was to investigate RBC transfusion practices in CLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective nation-wide study utilized an Icelandic registry of CLL patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2016. Medical records were reviewed and haemoglobin transfusion triggers compared for two periods: Earlier (2003-2012) and latter (2013-2017). RESULTS: Two hundred and thirteen patients were diagnosed with CLL over the period whereof 77 (36.2%) received RBC transfusion(s). Median time from diagnosis to first transfusion was 2.2 years. Higher age, Rai stage 3/4 at diagnosis (P < 0.05) and chemotherapy (P < 0.001) were associated with increased odds of transfusions. Shorter time to first transfusion correlated with higher age (P < 0.001) and Rai stage (P = 0.02) at diagnosis. The mean Hb trigger was 90.4 and 81.2 in the earlier and latter period respectively (P = 0.01). This difference in Hb triggers was most pronounced in patients without documented bone marrow involvement, or 80.5 g/l compared to 93.5 g/l (P = 0.004). The median time from diagnosis to transfusion was longer in the latter period (2.9 years vs. 1.6 years, P = 0.01). After RBC transfusions the survival decreased significantly (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: One-third of CLL patients received RBC transfusions but few were heavily transfused. Older age, Rai stage, and chemotherapy predicted RBC use. The Hb transfusion trigger decreased over time while time to first RBC transfusion increased. RBC transfusions predict poor survival.","['Thorvaldsson, Hrafn Hliddal', 'Vidarsson, Brynjar', 'Sveinsdottir, Signy Vala', 'Olafsson, Gunnar Bjorn', 'Halldorsdottir, Anna Margret']","['Thorvaldsson HH', 'Vidarsson B', 'Sveinsdottir SV', 'Olafsson GB', 'Halldorsdottir AM']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Hematology, Landspitali National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Hematology, Landspitali National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Blood Bank, Landspitali National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190329,England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/complications/*therapy', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*standards', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Iceland', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['epidemiology', 'transfusion medicine (in general)', 'transfusion therapy']",,2019/04/12 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vox.12775 [doi]'],ppublish,Vox Sang. 2019 Jul;114(5):495-504. doi: 10.1111/vox.12775.

Though survival rate in childhood ALL patients is increased up to 80% with recent medical advances, treatment of adults and childhood relapse cases still remains challenging. Here, we have performed bioinformatics analysis of 207 ALL patients' mRNA expression data retrieved from the ICGC data portal with an objective to mark out the decisive genes and pathways responsible for ALL pathogenesis and aggression. For analysis, 3361 most variable genes, including 276 transcription factors (out of 16,807 genes) were sorted based on the coefficient of variance. Silhouette width analysis classified 207 ALL patients into 6 subtypes and heat map analysis suggests a need of large and multicenter dataset for non-overlapping subtype classification. Overall, 265 GO terms and 32 KEGG pathways were enriched. The lists were dominated by cancer-associated entries and highlight crucial genes and pathways that can be targeted for designing more specific ALL therapeutics. Differential gene expression analysis identified upregulation of two important genes, JCHAIN and CRLF2 in dead patients' cohort suggesting their possible involvement in different clinical outcomes in ALL patients undergoing the same treatment.","['Tomar, Anil Kumar', 'Agarwal, Rahul', 'Kundu, Bishwajit']","['Tomar AK', 'Agarwal R', 'Kundu B']","['Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, 110016, India. anilbioinfo@gmail.com.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India.', 'Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, 110016, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190410,Germany,Interdiscip Sci,"Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",101515919,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Gene expression', 'KEGG pathways', 'Leukemia', 'Most variable genes', 'Subtype classification']",,2019/04/12 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12539-019-00325-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12539-019-00325-y [pii]']",ppublish,Interdiscip Sci. 2019 Dec;11(4):668-678. doi: 10.1007/s12539-019-00325-y.

Although the protective effects of MgIG on methotrexate (MTX)-induced liver toxicity have been well-documented, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. MTX was initially used to treat pediatric acute leukemia, and has been widely applied to psoriasis therapy. However, its clinical applications are limited due to hepatotoxicity and intestinal toxicity. Herein, prophylactic administration of MgIG (9 and 18 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in the serum of rats receiving intravenous injection of MTX (20 mg/kg body weight). MgIG also attenuated MTX-induced hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, it better protected against MTX-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and decreased the serum level of malondialdehyde than reduced glutathione (80 mg/kg/day) did. Interestingly, MTX-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, intestinal permeability and inflammation were attenuated after MgIG administration. In addition, MgIG (9 and 18 mg/kg) reduced MTX-induced colocalization of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and connexin 43 (Cx43) in intestinal villi. In conclusion, MgIG exerted beneficial effects on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity and intestinal damage, as a potentially eligible drug for alleviating the hepatic and intestinal side effects of MTX during chemotherapy.","['Cao, Yuzhu', 'Shi, Hang', 'Sun, Zhiguang', 'Wu, Jiawei', 'Xia, Yawen', 'Wang, Yufei', 'Wu, Yuanyuan', 'Li, Xiaoman', 'Chen, Wenxing', 'Wang, Aiyun', 'Lu, Yin']","['Cao Y', 'Shi H', 'Sun Z', 'Wu J', 'Xia Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wu Y', 'Li X', 'Chen W', 'Wang A', 'Lu Y']","['School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of The First College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Prevention and Treatment of Tumor, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Prevention and Treatment of Tumor, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Prevention and Treatment of Tumor, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190325,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6444054,['NOTNLM'],"['COX-2', 'Cx43', 'ZO-1', 'hepatotoxicity', 'inflammation', 'intestinal damage', 'magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate', 'methotrexate']",,2019/04/12 06:00,2019/04/12 06:01,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00119 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Mar 25;10:119. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00119. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since translocation (6;8)(p21;q24) is a recurrent anomaly for BPDCN, we demonstrate that a pDC-specific super-enhancer of RUNX2 is associated with the MYC promoter due to t(6;8). RUNX2 ensures the expression of pDC-signature genes in leukemic cells, but also confers survival and proliferative properties in BPDCN cells. Furthermore, the pDC-specific RUNX2 super-enhancer is hijacked to activate MYC in addition to RUNX2 expression, thereby promoting the proliferation of BPDCN. We also demonstrate that the transduction of MYC and RUNX2 is sufficient to initiate the transformation of BPDCN in mice lacking Tet2 and Tp53, providing a model that accurately recapitulates the aggressive human disease and gives an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of BPDCN.","['Kubota, Sho', 'Tokunaga, Kenji', 'Umezu, Tomohiro', 'Yokomizo-Nakano, Takako',

The specific BCR-ABL inhibitors including imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, are clinically utilized in the treatment with CML and ALL patients. Although these BCR-ABL inhibitors are initially successful in the treatment of leukemia, many patients develop drug resistance due to the appearance of the gatekeeper mutation of BCR-ABL, T315I. Recently, we found that taxodione, a quinone methide diterpene isolated from a conifer, Taxodium distichum, significantly induced apoptosis in human myelogenous leukemia-derived K562 cells, which is positive for the bcr-abl gene. Taxodione reduced the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). An antioxidant agent, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), canceled taxodione-induced ROS production and apoptotic cell death, suggesting that taxodione induced apoptosis through ROS accumulation. Furthermore, in K562 cells treated with taxodione, BCR-ABL, STAT5 and Akt were sequestered in mitochondrial fraction, and their localization changes decrease their abilities to stimulate cell proliferation. Strikingly, NAC canceled these taxodione-caused inhibition of BCR-ABL, STAT5 and Akt. In addition, taxodione significantly induced apoptosis in transformed Ba/F3 cells by not only BCR-ABL but also T315I-mutated BCR-ABL through the generation of ROS, suggesting that taxodione has potential as anti-tumor drug with high efficacy to overcome BCR-ABL T315I mutation-mediated resistance in leukemia cells. It's also expected that these knowledge becomes an important clue in the development of anti-cancer drugs against the broad range of tumors.","['Uchihara, Yuki', 'Tago, Kenji', 'Funakoshi-Tago, Megumi']","['Uchihara Y', 'Tago K', 'Funakoshi-Tago M']","['Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University.', 'Division of Structural Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry, Jichi Medical University.', 'Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

Most commonly associated breakpoint with CML is M-bcr in exon 13 or exon 14, producing splice variant b2a2 or b3a2 respectively. The distribution of these transcripts and their influence on clinico-hematological parameters is variable. Impact of the fusion transcripts on treatment outcome in Imatinib treated CML patients is still a matter of debate. Aims/settings and design: We conducted this study on 400 CML-CP patients to look for the distribution of fusion transcripts i.e. b3a2 and b2a2, their clinico-hematological profile and impact on treatment response in patients treated with Imatinib. Material and Methods: CML-CP was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for the BCR-ABL fusion transcript. Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was performed on peripheral blood every 3-6 monthly to look for treatment response. Results: The overall frequency of b3a2 transcript was observed in 288 (72%) followed by b2a2 in 104 (26%) and hybrid fusion transcript (b3a2 + b2a2) was seen in 8 (2%) cases. MMR was attained in 198/288 (68.7%) patients with b3a2 transcript and 90/288 (31.3%) patients failed to achieve MMR after 12 months of Imatinib therapy. Among the patients with b2a2 transcript, 44/104 (42.3%) patients achieved MMR and 60/104 (57.7%) patients failed to achieve MMR after 12 months of Imatinib therapy. Conclusions: In conclusion, the frequency of b3a2 transcript was more as compared to b2a2 transcript. MMR was significantly higher in patients with b3a2 transcript as compared to patients with b2a2.","['Sazawal, Sudha', 'Chhikara, Sunita', 'Singh, Kanwaljeet', 'Chaubey, Rekha', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Seth, Tulika', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Sazawal S', 'Chhikara S', 'Singh K', 'Chaubey R', 'Mahapatra M', 'Seth T', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,"['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['b3a2 and b2a2 fusion transcript', 'major molecular response', 'real-time polymerase chain reaction']",['None'],2019/04/12 06:00,2019/08/03 06:00,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2019_62_2_256_255842 [pii]', '10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_726_17 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2019 Apr-Jun;62(2):256-260. doi: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_726_17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last years those structures have been intensively synthesized and modified to yield new synthetic molecules that can specifically inhibit the activity of dysregulated protein kinases in cancer cells. Herein, a series of newly synthesized isoquinolinamine (FX-1 to 8) and isoindoloquinazolinone (FX-9, FX-42, FX-43) compounds were evaluated in regards to their anti-leukemic potential on human B- and T- acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Several biological effects were observed. B-ALL cells (SEM, RS4;11) were more sensitive against isoquinolinamine compounds than T-ALL cells (Jurkat, CEM). In SEM cells, metabolic activity decreased with 10 muM up to 26.7% (FX-3), 25.2% (FX-7) and 14.5% (FX-8). The 3-(p-Tolyl) isoquinolin-1-amine FX-9 was the most effective agent against B- and T-ALL cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.54 to 1.94 muM. None of the tested compounds displayed hemolysis on erythrocytes or cytotoxicity against healthy leukocytes. Anti-proliferative effect of FX-9 was associated with changes in cell morphology and apoptosis induction. Further, influence of FX-9 on PI3K/AKT, MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling was detected but was heterogeneous. Functional inhibition testing of 58 kinases revealed no specific inhibitory activity among cancer related kinases. In conclusion, FX-9 displays significant antileukemic activity in B- and T-ALL cells and should be further evaluated in regards to the mechanisms of action. Further compounds of the current series might serve as templates for the design of new compounds and as basic structures for modification approaches.","['Roolf, Catrin', 'Saleweski, Jan-Niklas', 'Stein, Arno', 'Richter, Anna', 'Maletzki, Claudia', 'Sekora, Anett', 'Escobar, Hugo Murua', 'Wu, Xiao-Feng', 'Beller, Matthias', 'Junghanss, Christian']","['Roolf C', 'Saleweski JN', 'Stein A', 'Richter A', 'Maletzki C', 'Sekora A', 'Escobar HM', 'Wu XF', 'Beller M', 'Junghanss C']","['Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Catalysis at the University of Rostock, Rostock 18059, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Catalysis at the University of Rostock, Rostock 18059, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock 18057, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190402,Korea (South),Biomol Ther (Seoul),Biomolecules & therapeutics,101472832,,,,PMC6720533,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Apoptosis', '*Heterocycles', '*Isoindoloquinazolinone', '*Isoquinolinamine', '*Kinase inhibitor']",,2019/04/12 06:00,2019/04/12 06:01,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/12 06:01 [medline]']","['biomolther.2018.199 [pii]', '10.4062/biomolther.2018.199 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2019 Apr 2;27(5):492-501. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2018.199.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been documented to act as an oncogene and is frequently highly expressed in human cancers including AML. However, the function and molecular mechanism of MALAT1 in regulating cytarabine (Ara-C) resistance of AML are largely unknown. The expressions of MALAT1 and miR-96 in AML patients and healthy controls were examined by qRT-PCR. CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay were performed to assess the proliferation and apoptosis of AML cells. The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-96 was investigated by luciferase reporter assay. We found that MALAT1 was upregulated while miR-96 was downregulated in AML patients compared with healthy controls. A negative correlation between MALAT1 and miR-96 expressions was observed in AML patients. Knockdown of MALAT1 inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, and enhanced Ara-C sensitivity of AML cells. Additionally, MALAT1 suppressed miR-96 expression by acting as a molecular sponge of miR-96 in AML cells. miR-96 downregulation abolished the effects of MALAT1 knockdown on the proliferation, apoptosis, Ara-C sensitivity in AML cells. In conclusion, MALAT1 knockdown inhibited proliferation, promoted apoptosis and enhanced Ara-C sensitivity in AML cells by upregulating miR-96, providing novel insights into the critical role of MALAT1 as a miRNA sponge in AML.","['Hu, Ning', 'Chen, Li', 'Wang, Chao', 'Zhao, Hongmian']","['Hu N', 'Chen L', 'Wang C', 'Zhao H']","['Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, China.

In the present study, we examined the role of HMGB1 in the necroptosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In two AML cell lines and primary AML cells from two patients, etoposide induced necroptosis via cIAP1/2 degradation when caspase activity was inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk, but treatment with extracellular HMGB1 prevented this necroptosis. Interestingly, HMGB1 did not prevent the degradation of cIAP1/2, but rather activated the nuclear factor kappa B pathway.

Despite advances in AML treatment in recent years, elderly patients have experienced limited benefit, and their outcomes remain poor. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive gene mutation analysis in elderly AML patients and identify gene mutations that could serve as prognostic factors. METHODS: An analysis of gene mutations was performed for 281 AML patients, including 98 elderly patients aged 65 years or above. RESULTS: Compared to younger AML patients, elderly patients showed a higher frequency of the following gene mutations: TP53 (P = 0.026), PTPN11 (P = 0.006), RUNX1 (P = 0.024), TET2 (P = 0.002), and ASXL1 (P = 0.023). The complete remission rate was significantly lower in DNMT3A mutation-positive cases (4.26%, P = 0.011) and TP53 mutation-positive cases (2.13%, P = 0.031) than in negative cases. The overall survival rate was significantly poorer in cases with FLT3-ITD (P = 0.003), DNMT3A (P = 0.033), or TP53 mutation (P < 0.001). Conversely, cases with PTPN11 mutation (P = 0.014) had a significantly more favorable prognosis. In multivariate analysis, FLT3-ITD (P = 0.011) and TP53 mutation positivity (P = 0.002) were independent poor prognostic factors, as were a performance status of 3 or above (P < 0.001) and poor cytogenetic prognosis (P = 0.001). In contrast, PTPN11 mutation positivity (P = 0.023) was an independent favorable prognosis factor. CONCLUSION: Analysis of gene mutations in elderly AML patients is very important, not only for establishing prognosis, but also for introducing appropriate molecular-targeted treatments.","['Fujiwara, Yusuke', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Yui, Shunsuke', 'Tokura, Taichiro', 'Inai, Kazuki', 'Onai, Daishi', 'Omori, Ikuko', 'Marumo, Atsushi', 'Yamanaka, Satoshi', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro', 'Terada, Kazuki', 'Nakagome, Shun', 'Arai, Kunihito', 'Kitano, Tomoaki', 'Okabe, Masahiro', 'Okamoto, Muneo', 'Tamai, Hayato', 'Nakayama, Kazutaka', 'Tajika, Kenji', 'Wakita, Satoshi', 'Inokuchi, Koiti']","['Fujiwara Y', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Yui S', 'Tokura T', 'Inai K', 'Onai D', 'Omori I', 'Marumo A', 'Yamanaka S', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Terada K', 'Nakagome S', 'Arai K', 'Kitano T', 'Okabe M', 'Okamoto M', 'Tamai H', 'Nakayama K', 'Tajika K', 'Wakita S', 'Inokuchi K']","['Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190410,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'gene mutation', 'prognostic factor', 'remission rate']",,2019/04/11 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13025 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2019 Aug;41(4):461-471. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13025.

For this reason, professionals from different areas have strived to implement actions to increase patient quality-of-life during and after cancer treatment. Among these measures, integral attention in reproductive health is one of the main points for the inclusion, safety, and autonomy of female patients. The approach to fertility in these cases should include counseling on fertility preservation and contraceptive options. Oocyte/embryo freezing is an effective technique that does not delay the start of cancer treatment, since controlled ovarian stimulation can be initiated at any stage of the menstrual cycle. At the same time, contraceptive counseling should be conducted based on the eligibility criteria established by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, there is still a lack of studies on (i) the suitability of contraceptives to patients of reproductive age with relatively frequent tumors (lymphoma, leukemia, bone cancer), and (ii) the use of contraceptive concurrently with chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, the choice of contraceptive method should consider other factors such as tumor type, thrombogenic risk factors linked to cancer/chemotherapy, immunosuppression, blood disorders (thrombocytopenia/anemia), bone mass reduction, metabolic/cardiovascular effects, and drug interaction.","['Melo, Anderson Sanches de', 'Paula, Camilla Teles Vidal de', 'Rufato, Marcelo Augusto Feres', 'Rufato, Mariana Carvalho Assad Carneiro', 'Rodrigues, Jhenifer Kliemchen', 'Ferriani, Rui Alberto', 'Barreto, Jorge']","['Melo AS', 'Paula CTV', 'Rufato MAF', 'Rufato MCAC', 'Rodrigues JK', 'Ferriani RA', 'Barreto J']","['Fertility Center of Ribeirao Preto (CEFERP) - Ribeirao Preto - Sao Paulo - Brasil.', 'Member of Latin America Oncofertility Network, Oncofertility Consortium.', 'Centro Universitario Estacio - Ribeirao Preto - Sao Paulo - Brasil.', 'Fertility Center of Ribeirao Preto (CEFERP) - Ribeirao Preto - Sao Paulo - Brasil.', 'Centro Universitario Estacio - Ribeirao Preto - Sao Paulo - Brasil.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo.

30969659,,Publisher,,,,,,2022 Jan,Lytic Bone Lesions,,,"Bone tumors are mostly benign. The most important determinants in imaging of bone tumors are morphology on plain radiograph (well-defined lytic, ill-defined lytic, and sclerotic lesions) and age of the patient at presentation. Well-defined osteolytic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions have a plethora of differentials in different age groups. For simplicity, a widely used mnemonic for lytic bone lesions is extremely helpful: FEGNOMASHIC. We have attempted to describe the most characteristic features of each of these tumors. The different bone tumors and lesions discussed are as follows: fibrous dysplasia (FD),[1] eosinophilic granuloma (EG), enchondroma, giant cell tumor (GCT), non-ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma,[2] aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), solitary bone cyst (SBC), hyperparathyroidism (Brown tumor), infection (always kept in differential diagnosis while dealing with bone lesions), chondroblastoma, CMF, metastasis, myeloma (any bone lesion detected in age above 40 years, must be ruled out for metastasis and myeloma). The normal variant that can mimic lytic bone lesion is pseudocyst. It is an area of focal trabecular rarefaction at a low-stress region.[3] Pseudocysts most commonly occur in the greater tuberosity of the humerus, calcaneus, and radial tuberosity. An osteolytic lesion with an ill-defined zone of transition is generally typical of malignant bone tumors (Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, metastasis, leukemia) and aggressive benign lesions (giant cell tumor, infection, eosinophilic granuloma).","['Subramanian, Surabhi', 'Viswanathan, Vibhu Krishnan']","['Subramanian S', 'Viswanathan VK']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,,,2019/04/11 06:01,2019/04/11 06:01,,,['NBK539837 [bookaccession]'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,20190411,['StatPearls Publishing'],,['StatPearls'],['2019/04/11 06:01'],,,,,,['20210825'],

It was first recognized in 1934; however, at that time, it was described as hemorrhagic thrombocythemia. Essential thrombocytosis is one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms. It was classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm in 1951 by Damesheck.[1] Myeloproliferative neoplasm includes polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, and essential polycythemia.[2] The three types of myeloproliferative neoplasm are similar as they share the same mutations. Approximately 55% of patients with essential thrombocytosis have the JAK2 mutation.[3] Essential thrombocytosis is characterized by thrombocytosis with the presence of megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the bone marrow. Due to thrombocytosis, there are risks of vascular events such as thrombosis and hemorrhage and sometimes the conversion to a blast phase of myelofibrosis.[4] According to the World Health Organization, essential thrombocytosis is a disease that occurs when the platelet count is more than 450000 with the presence of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Calreticulin (CALR) or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutation, lacking clonal or reactive causes.[5] This review article will focus on reviewing the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of this disease.","['Ashorobi, Damilola', 'Gohari, Pouyan']","['Ashorobi D', 'Gohari P']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,,,2019/04/11 06:01,2019/04/11 06:01,,,['NBK539709 [bookaccession]'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,20190411,['StatPearls Publishing'],,['StatPearls'],['2019/04/11 06:01'],,,,,,['20210626'],

Previous reports have suggested poor prognosis for patients with LC, but these reports have largely consisted of descriptive studies with a limited number of patients. Objectives: To identify patient factors associated with LC and characterize the association of LC with the course of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, matched-cohort study included 1683 patients with AML diagnosed from January 1, 2005, to April 1, 2017, with and without biopsy-proven LC seen at a single-center, tertiary care hospital in St Louis, Missouri. To specifically evaluate differences in survival, propensity scoring was used to match patients with AML with LC to patients with AML without LC off the logit of propensity score based on age, race/ethnicity, sex, and leukemia type. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare cumulative probability survival. Matched survival analysis was performed with extended Cox regression to determine factors associated with leukemia-specific and overall survival. Main Outcomes and Measures: Leukemia-specific survival and overall survival. Results: A total of 1683 patients were reviewed, including 78 patients with biopsy-proven LC of the AML type and 1605 patients with AML without LC. A total of 62 of the patients with AML and LC (mean [SD] age, 58.2 [11.7] years; 33 [53.2%] male) were matched in a 1:3 ratio to 186 patients with AML without LC (mean [SD] age, 58.2 [13.5] years; 103 [55.4%] male). The 5-year survival among the 62 patients with AML with LC was 8.6%, shorter than the 28.3% among the 186 matched patients with AML without LC. Matched survival analysis revealed that patients with AML and LC compared with those without LC had hazard ratios of 2.06 (95% CI, 1.26-3.38; P = .004) for leukemia-specific death and of 1.66 (95% CI, 1.06-2.60; P = .03) for all-cause death. In addition, matched patients with LC had greater odds of extramedullary organ burden (odds ratio, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.72-7.05; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: The results suggest that the presentation of LC in patients with AML is associated with decreased overall survival and leukemia-specific survival.

It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL with del17p, and by the EMA for patients with del17p/TP53 mutation who have failed a BCR inhibitor, or in patients without those aberrations who have failed previous therapy, regardless of their genetic/molecular profile. Venetoclax in combination with rituximab has been also approved for the treatment of CLL after at least 1 prior therapy, regardless of del17p. Areas covered: This article reviews the chemical structure, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetic, and the clinical applications of venetoclax in monotherapy and in combined treatment of CLL. Publications dated 2010 through March 2019 were obtained from the MEDLINE database. The proceedings of the American Society of Hematology held during the last five years were also included. Expert opinion: Venetoclax shows high efficacy, a favorable toxicity profile, and a high rate of minimal residual disease negativity, which is thought to have an impact on overall survival. It is efficient in patients with del17p/TP53 mutations, the incidence of which increases during clonal CLL evolution, and after the failure of BCR pathway inhibitors.","['Korycka-Wolowiec, Anna', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Kubiak-Mlonka, Aleksandra', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Korycka-Wolowiec A', 'Wolowiec D', 'Kubiak-Mlonka A', 'Robak T']","['a Department of Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.', 'b Department of Hematology , Medical University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'a Department of Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.', 'a Department of Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190425,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse events', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'clinical efficacy', 'pharmacokinetics', 'toxicity', 'venetoclax']",,2019/04/11 06:00,2019/05/16 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17425255.2019.1606211 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2019 May;15(5):353-366. doi: 10.1080/17425255.2019.1606211.

METHODS: We investigated WT1 and Survivin expression levels by RT-PCR in 61 AML patients in correlation with clinical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: WT1 was overexpressed in 45 patients (73.8%), associated with higher BM blasts (p = 0.017), lower incidence of favorable-prognosis cytogenetics (p = 0.035), and higher incidence of Flt3-ITD mutations (p = 0.026). Survivin was overexpressed in 17 patients (27.9%) with higher mean WBC count (p = 0.049). Patients with overexpression of either gene showed inferior complete remission (CR) rates and survival rates, patients with overexpression of both genes showed higher mean WBCs (p = 0.035) and higher BM blasts (p = 0.029) while the double negative group showed higher incidence of favorable cytogenetic events (p = 0.021), better CR rates and survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the introduced prognostic impact of WT1 and Survivin genes in AML patients and its potential use in MRD monitoring and immunotherapy.","['Adnan-Awad, Shady', 'Meligui, Yomna M El', 'Salem, Salem Eid', 'Salaheldin, Omina', 'Ayoub, Mahmoud A', 'Kamel, Mahmoud M']","['Adnan-Awad S', 'Meligui YME', 'Salem SE', 'Salaheldin O', 'Ayoub MA', 'Kamel MM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Survivin/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,,,2019/04/11 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.180329 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2019 Apr 1;65(4). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.180329.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mineralocorticoids is one of the causes influencing the implantation window. This study targeted to evaluation fludrocortisone different properties on endometrial receptivity. The objective of this study was to assess whether treatment with fludrocortisone could impact the expression of diverse genes and proteins that are involved in uterine receptivity in mice. In this study, 40 female adult BALB/c mice were used. The samples were allocated to four groups of ten. Control group (C) received: vehicle; fludrocortisone group (FCA): received 1.5 mg/kg fludrocortisone; PP242 group (PP242): received 30 mg/kg PP242; fludrocortisone+PP242 group (FCA+PP242): received fludrocortisone and PP242. Mice were killed on window implantation day after mating and confirmed pregnancy. The endometrial epithelium of mouse was collected to assess mRNA expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), mucin-1 (MUC1), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), (Msx.1), miRNA Let-7a, and miRNA 223-3p as well as protein expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in the uterine using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. In comparison with the control group, fludrocortisone administration upregulated the expression of LIF, HB-EGF, Msx.1, miRNA Let-7a, ERK1/2, and mTOR in the epithelial endometrium. The PP242-treated group demonstrated a significant rise in the expression of MUC1, miRNA 223-3p and a remarkable decline in ERK1/2 and p-4E-BP1 levels in comparison with the control group. Combination therapy of (FCA+PP242) resulted in a remarkable rise in LIF, Msx-1, HB-EGF, ERK1/2, and mTOR levels, in comparison with the PP242 group. Furthermore, combination therapy of (FCA+PP242) downregulated the expression of MUC1 in comparison with the PP242-treated group. According to the results, fludrocortisone affected uterine receptivity possibly by means of modulating the expression of genes involved in the uterine receptivity and activation of the ERK1/2-mTOR pathway.","['Hesam Shariati, Mohammad Bakhtiar', 'Seghinsara, Abbas Majdi', 'Shokrzadeh, Naser', 'Niknafs, Behrooz']","['Hesam Shariati MB', 'Seghinsara AM', 'Shokrzadeh N', 'Niknafs B']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Infertility and Reproductive Health research center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190409,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'H5669VNZ7V (PP242)', 'U0476M545B (Fludrocortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Endometrium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fludrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Mucin-1/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Uterus/*drug effects/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Msx.1', '*endometrial receptivity', '*extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)', '*fludrocortisone', '*leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', '*mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)']",,2019/04/11 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28609 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Nov;234(11):20098-20110. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28609.

The most adverse prognosis was observed in patients with DNMT3A and FLT3-ITD co-mutation, whose survival could be significantly improved with alloHSCT. In contrast, the most favourable prognosis without any further benefit from alloHSCT was identified in patients with mutations in NPM1 or CEBPA, after exclusion of the unfavourable prognostic groups defined by mutations in DNMT3A, RUNX1 or genes from chromatin/spliceosome group. An additional analysis of 113 diagnosis-remission paired samples revealed that persistence of non-DNMT3A mutations (above 2% VAF) represented a further negative prognostic factor.

Additionally, we compared our data to those obtained from a systematic review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 74 patients undergoing treatment with imatinib mesylate. Sociodemographic characteristics, oral mucosa alterations, and medical history were evaluated. Oral hyperpigmentation was scored. The use of imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea was evaluated. Association between oral hyperpigmentation and imatinib mesylate was assessed. A systematic review was also conducted to retrieve case reports or case series of patients with oral hyperpigmentation associated with imatinib mesylate. RESULTS: Among the 74 participants, 41 were male (55.4%) and 33 were female (44.6%). Participants' mean age was 49.3 years. Sixty-six (89.2%) patients developed hyperpigmented lesions in the hard palate mucosa. In multivariate analysis, patients who had used imatinib mesylate for > 72 months had a hyperpigmentation score 1.62 times higher than those who had used this medication during a shorter period. Patients who had used hydroxyurea for > 30 days had a hyperpigmentation score 1.43 times higher than those who had used this medication during a shorter period. The systematic review retrieved 20 clinical cases of patients undergoing imatinib mesylate treatment and exhibiting oral hyperpigmentation. CONCLUSIONS: The development of oral hyperpigmentation is associated with imatinib mesylate use. Hydroxyurea seems to increment such an association.

Daunorubicin (DNR) and idarubicin (IDA) are the two anthracyclines most commonly used. DNR and IDA are used interchangeably with different conversion factors, as there is no high-level evidence on the equipotency of these two agents for AML treatment. To determine the equipotent doses of DNR and IDA, we first systematically reviewed studies directly comparing the clinical outcomes of AML induction therapy utilizing DNR and IDA. We found 15 articles that met our inclusion criteria and compared time-to-event survival end points as well as complete remission rates post-induction. The DNR:IDA equipotency ratio was estimated at 5.90 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-20.7. To validate the estimate from our meta-analysis biologically, we conducted in vitro tests comparing anti-AML activity of DNR and IDA against six AML cell lines and two primary AML cells from patients with different cytogenetic and molecular characteristics. Based on these in vitro data, the equipotency dose ratio between DNR and IDA was 4.06 with 95% CI 3.64-4.49. Combining the estimates from the meta-analysis and the in vitro data using inverse-variance weighting, the current best estimate of the DNR:IDA equipotent ratio is 4.1 with 95% CI 3.9-4.3. This estimate, however, is largely driven by the in vitro chemo-sensitivity data. Given clinical studies demonstrating the safety of IDA at higher doses, our work implies that dose intensification of IDA could be investigated in future clinical trials in AML.","['Adige, Sunil', 'Lapidus, Rena G', 'Carter-Cooper, Brandon A', 'Duffy, Alison', 'Patzke, Ciera', 'Law, Jennie Y', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Ambulos, Nicholas P', 'Zou, Ying', 'Bentzen, Soren M', 'Emadi, Ashkan']","['Adige S', 'Lapidus RG', 'Carter-Cooper BA', 'Duffy A', 'Patzke C', 'Law JY', 'Baer MR', 'Ambulos NP', 'Zou Y', 'Bentzen SM', 'Emadi A']","['School of Medicine, University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, 22 S.

Psychoneuroimmunology-based intervention increased immune markers (CD8+ T, B, and natural killer cells, serum immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin M) and quality of life, whereas it shortens the duration of fever and use of antipyretics, antibiotics, analgesics, and respiratory therapy. Immunity markers correlated with clinical conditions.

Although current treatments, including chemotherapy and glucocorticoids, have significantly improved survival, T-ALL remains a fatal disease and new treatment options are needed. Since more than 60% of T-ALL cases bear oncogenic NOTCH1 mutations, small molecule inhibitors of NOTCH1 signalling; gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI), are being actively investigated for the treatment of T-ALL. Unfortunately, GSI have shown limited clinical efficacy and dose-limiting toxicities. We hypothesized that by combining known drugs, blocking NOTCH activity through another mechanism, may synergize with GSI enabling equal efficacy at a lower concentration. Here, we show that the clinically used anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ), an inhibitor of lysosomal function and autophagy, decreases T-ALL cell viability and proliferation. This effect of CQ was not observed in GSI-resistant T-ALL cell lines. Mechanistically, CQ impairs the redox balance, induces ds DNA breaks and activates the DNA damage response. CQ also interferes with intracellular trafficking and processing of oncogenic NOTCH1. Interestingly, we show for the first time that the addition of CQ to gamma-secretase inhibition has a synergistic therapeutic effect on T-ALL and reduces the concentration of GSI required to obtain a reduction in cell viability and a block of proliferation. Overall, our results suggest that CQ may be a promising repurposed drug in the treatment of T-ALL, as a single treatment or in combination with GSI, increasing the therapeutic ratio.","['Hounjet, Judith', 'Habets, Roger', 'Schaaf, Marco B', 'Hendrickx, Tessa C', 'Barbeau, Lydie M O', 'Yahyanejad, Sanaz', 'Rouschop, Kasper M', 'Groot, Arjan J', 'Vooijs, Marc']","['Hounjet J', 'Habets R', 'Schaaf MB', 'Hendrickx TC', 'Barbeau LMO', 'Yahyanejad S', 'Rouschop KM', 'Groot AJ', 'Vooijs M']","['Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'MAASTRO Clinic, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiotherapy/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Maastricht MUMC+, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. marc.vooijs@maastrichtuniversity.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190409,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antimalarials/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chloroquine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,,2019/04/11 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0802-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0802-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Jul;38(27):5457-5468. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0802-x.

Despite the high risk, DNA-damaging inflammatory microenvironment, PV progenitors tend to preserve their genomic stability over decades until their progression to post-PV myelofibrosis/acute myeloid leukemia. Using induced pluripotent stem cells-derived CD34(+) progenitor-enriched cultures from JAK2V617F(+) PV patient and from JAK2 wild-type healthy control, CRISPR-modified HEL cells and patients' bone marrow sections from different disease stages, we demonstrate that JAK2V617F induces an intrinsic IFNgamma- and NF-kappaB-associated inflammatory program, while suppressing inflammation-evoked DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo. We show that cells with JAK2V617F tightly regulate levels of inflammatory cytokines-induced reactive oxygen species, do not fully activate the ATM/p53/p21waf1 checkpoint and p38/JNK MAPK stress pathway signaling when exposed to inflammatory cytokines, suppress DNA single-strand break repair genes' expression yet overexpress the dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) 1. RNAi-mediated knock-down and pharmacological inhibition of DUSP1, involved in p38/JNK deactivation, in HEL cells reveals growth addiction to DUSP1, consistent with enhanced DNA damage response and apoptosis in DUSP1-inhibited parental JAK2V617F(+) cells, but not in CRISPR-modified JAK2 wild-type cells.

As DNA damage can arrest proliferation, and, in the case of myeloid leukemia, induce differentiation of cancer cells, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the replication stress response is paramount. Here, we show that PARI, a replisome protein involved in regulating DNA repair and replication stress, suppresses differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. We show that PARI is overexpressed in myeloid leukemia cells, and its knockdown reduces leukemia cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mouse models. PARI depletion enhances replication stress and DNA-damage accumulation, coupled with increased myeloid differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that PARI inhibits activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, which can initiate p21-mediated differentiation and proliferation arrest. Finally, we show that PARI expression negatively correlates with expression of differentiation markers in clinical myeloid leukemia samples, suggesting that targeting PARI may restore differentiation ability of leukemia cells and antagonize their proliferation.","['Nicolae, Claudia M', ""O'Connor, Michael J"", 'Schleicher, Emily M', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Gowda, Raghavendra', 'Robertson, Gavin', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Moldovan, George-Lucian']","['Nicolae CM', ""O'Connor MJ"", 'Schleicher EM', 'Song C', 'Gowda R', 'Robertson G', 'Dovat S', 'Moldovan GL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. glm29@psu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190409,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PARPBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,2019/04/11 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0810-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0810-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Jul;38(27):5530-5540. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0810-x.

Approximately 12-15% of older patients with AML harbor isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) gene mutations. Enasidenib is an oral inhibitor of mutant IDH2 proteins. Among 39 patients with newly diagnosed mutant-IDH2 AML who received enasidenib monotherapy in this phase I/II trial, median age was 77 years (range 58-87) and 23 patients (59%) had had an antecedent hematologic disorder. The median number of enasidenib treatment cycles was 6.0 (range 1-35). The most common treatment-related adverse events were indirect hyperbilirubinemia (31%), nausea (23%), and fatigue, decreased appetite, and rash (18% each). Treatment-related grade 3-4 cytopenias were reported for eight patients (21%); there was no treatment-related grade 3-4 infections. Twelve patients achieved a response (overall response rate 30.8% [95% CI 17.0%, 47.6%]), including seven patients (18%) who attained complete remission. At a median follow-up of 8.4 months, the median duration of any response was not reached (NR). Median overall survival for all patients was 11.3 months (95% CI 5.7, 15.1), and was NR for responders. Oral, outpatient targeted treatment with enasidenib may benefit older adults with newly diagnosed mutant-IDH2 AML who are not candidates for cytotoxic regimens.","['Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Collins, Robert', 'Stein, Anthony S', 'Frattini, Mark G', 'Xu, Qiang', 'Tosolini, Alessandra', 'See, Wendy L', 'MacBeth, Kyle J', 'Agresta, Samuel V', 'Attar, Eyal C', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Stein, Eytan M']","['Pollyea DA', 'Tallman MS', 'de Botton S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Collins R', 'Stein AS', 'Frattini MG', 'Xu Q', 'Tosolini A', 'See WL', 'MacBeth KJ', 'Agresta SV', 'Attar EC', 'DiNardo CD', 'Stein EM']","['Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA. daniel.pollyea@ucdenver.edu.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', ""Gustave Roussy, Departement d'hematologie et Departement d'innovation Therapeutique, F-94805, Villejuif, France."", 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190409,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Triazines)', '3T1SS4E7AG (enasidenib)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminopyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazines/*therapeutic use']",,,,,2019/04/11 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0472-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0472-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Nov;33(11):2575-2584. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0472-2.

To clarify the impact of SETD2 mutations on chemotherapy sensitivity in MLLr leukemia, two loss-of-function (LOF) Setd2-mutant alleles (Setd2(F2478L/WT) or Setd2(Ex6-KO/WT)) were generated and introduced, respectively, to the Mll-Af9 knock-in leukemia mouse model. Both alleles cooperated with Mll-Af9 to accelerate leukemia development that resulted in resistance to standard Cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells showed downregulated signaling related to cell cycle progression, S, and G2/M checkpoint regulation. Thus, after Cytarabine treatment, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells exit from the S phase and progress to the G2/M phase. Importantly, S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint inhibition could resensitize the Mll-Af9/Setd2 double-mutant cells to standard chemotherapy by causing DNA replication collapse, mitotic catastrophe, and increased cell death. These findings demonstrate that LOF SETD2 mutations confer chemoresistance on AL to DNA-damaging treatment by S and G2/M checkpoint defects. The combination of S and G2/M checkpoint inhibition with chemotherapy can be explored as a promising therapeutic strategy by exploiting their unique vulnerability and resensitizing chemoresistant AL with SETD2 or SETD2-like epigenetic mutations.","['Dong, Yunzhu', 'Zhao, Xinghui', 'Feng, Xiaomin', 'Zhou, Yile', 'Yan, Xiaomei', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Bu, Jiachen', 'Zhan, Di', 'Hayashi, Yoshihiro', 'Zhang,

Mutated G-CSFRs have been directly associated with two distinct malignant phenotypes in patients, e.g. acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). However, the signaling mechanism of the mutated G-CSFRs is not well understood. Here, we present a comprehensive SILAC-based quantitative phosphoserine and phosphothreonine dataset of the normal and mutated G-CSFRs signaling using the BaF3 cell-line-based in vitro model system. High pH reversed phase concatenation and Titanium Dioxide Spin Tip column were utilized to increase the dynamic range and detection of the phosphoproteome of G-CSFRs. The dataset was further analyzed using several computational tools to validate the quality of the dataset. Overall, this dataset is the first global phosphoproteomics analysis of both normal and disease-associated-mutant G-CSFRs. We anticipate that this dataset will have a strong potential to decipher the phospho-signaling differences between the normal and malignant G-CSFR biology with therapeutic implications. The phosphoproteomic dataset is available via the PRIDE partner repository.","['Dwivedi, Pankaj', 'Muench, David E', 'Wagner, Michael', 'Azam, Mohammad', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Greis, Kenneth D']","['Dwivedi P', 'Muench DE', 'Wagner M', 'Azam M', 'Grimes HL', 'Greis KD']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267, USA.', ""Division of Immunobiology and Center for Systems Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Immunobiology and Center for Systems Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267, USA. ken.greis@uc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Dataset', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190409,England,Sci Data,Scientific data,101640192,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoserine', 'Phosphothreonine', '*Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/metabolism', '*Serine/chemistry/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', '*Threonine/chemistry/genetics']",PMC6480977,,,,2019/04/11 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2019/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41597-019-0015-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41597-019-0015-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Data. 2019 Apr 9;6(1):21. doi: 10.1038/s41597-019-0015-8.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7666-9216', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8723-3389', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8162-6758', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5316-3351']",,,"['R01 CA211594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA196658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007250-06/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)/International', '1S10 RR027015-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Center for Research Resources (NCRR)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blockade of PI3K signaling with idelalisib is effective for the treatment of relapsed CLL in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. In this single-arm, open-label, nonrandomized phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of idelalisib with ofatumumab in 27 patients with treatment-naive CLL in need of therapy. Patients were planned to receive idelalisib for 2 monthly cycles, then idelalisib and ofatumumab for 6 cycles, followed by idelalisib indefinitely. The study was closed early and all patients ceased therapy when an increased rate of death as a result of infection was observed on other first-line idelalisib trials. Median time on therapy was 8.1 months, and median duration of follow-up was 39.7 months. We previously reported high rates of hepatotoxicity in a smaller cohort of patients in this trial; toxicities necessitated therapy discontinuation in 15 patients after a median of 7.7 months. The most frequent grade >/=3 adverse events were transaminitis (52% of patients), neutropenia (33%), and colitis/diarrhea (15%). The best overall response rate (ORR) was 88.9%, including 1 complete response. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 23 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 18-36 months); 11 patients have not yet required second-line therapy. Idelalisib and ofatumumab demonstrated an unacceptable safety profile in the first-line setting, which resulted in a short PFS despite a high ORR.

Vitamin D (VD) is known to be involved in various immune and epigenetic processes. This analysis aimed to evaluate serum VD levels in patients with MDS and to analyze associations between serum VD levels and disease characteristics. METHODS: Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)-D3), the major form of VD in human serum, were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay in 62 unselected patients with MDS. Associations between serum 25(OH)-D3 levels and disease characteristics were analyzed using Kendall's tau and two-sided p values. RESULTS: The median serum 25(OH)-D3 level was markedly reduced (17.5 ng/mL). Patients with lower-risk disease features had lower serum 25(OH)-D3 levels than patients with higher-risk disease features with regard to medullary blast counts (16 vs. 31 ng/mL, p < 0.001), the revised international prognostic scoring system (13 vs. 30.5 ng/mL, p = 0.001), and blood counts. CONCLUSIONS: We show that patients with lower-risk disease characteristics exhibit lower serum VD levels than patients with higher-risk disease characteristics. Whether these findings might reflect innate immune deregulation has to be investigated in further studies.","['Muller-Thomas, Catharina', 'Tuchler, Heinz', 'Rudelius, Martina', 'Schneider, Heike', 'Pfefferkorn, Sabrina', 'Gotze, Katharina S']","['Muller-Thomas C', 'Tuchler H', 'Rudelius M', 'Schneider H', 'Pfefferkorn S', 'Gotze KS']","['Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany, catharina.mueller-thomas@gmx.de.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry und Pathobiochemistry, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190409,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/*blood/pathology', 'Calcifediol/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Association between vitamin D and MDS', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*Serum vitamin D level']",,2019/04/10 06:00,2019/10/30 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['000496014 [pii]', '10.1159/000496014 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2019;141(4):225-231. doi: 10.1159/000496014.

Nevertheless, several patients co-expressing the JAK2V617F mutation and the BCR-ABL1 transcript have been described in the literature. We report the case of a 61-year-old male who presented with an essential thrombocythaemia phenotype and had a subsequent diagnosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. Colony-forming assays demonstrated the coexistence of 2 different haematopoietic clones: one was positive for the JAK2V617F mutation and the other co-expressed both JAK2V617F and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. No colonies displayed the BCR-ABL1 transcript alone. These findings indicate that the JAK2V617F mutation was the founding genetic alteration of the disease, followed by the acquisition of the BCR-ABL1 chimeric oncogene. Our data support the hypothesis that a heterozygous JAK2V617F clone may have favoured the bi-clonal nature of this myeloproliferative disorder, generating clones harbouring a second transforming genetic event.","['Tirro, Elena', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Zammit, Valentina', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Di Gregorio, Sandra', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Manzella, Livia']","['Tirro E', 'Stella S', 'Massimino M', 'Zammit V', 'Pennisi MS', 'Vitale SR', 'Romano C', 'Di Gregorio S', 'Puma A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Stagno F', 'Manzella L']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy, ele_tir@yahoo.it.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

In the present study, overexpression and knockdown experiments revealed that miR-15b was required to block the proliferation of NB4 and HL60 cells and induce them differentiated to granulocyte lineage. Moreover, we identified CCNE1 as a direct target of miR-15b, and demonstrated that CCNE1 was involved in cell differentiation and proliferation in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. In addition, we demonstrated a novel pathway in which miR-15b regulated cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase and promoted terminal differentiation of cells by targeting CCNE1, which could modulate the cell cycle effort pRb in APL cells.

We characterized patterns of ED visits and explored nonclinical predictors of subsequent hospitalization, including time of ED arrival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with cancer (excluding leukemia and nonmelanoma skin cancer) between 2012 and 2016 at a large county urban safety-net health system. We identified ED visits occurring within 180 days after a cancer diagnosis, along with subsequent hospitalizations (observation stay or inpatient admission). We used mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression to model hospitalization at ED disposition, accounting for variability across patients and emergency physicians. RESULTS: The 9,050 adults with cancer were 77.2% nonwhite and 55.0% female. Nearly one-quarter (24.7%) of patients had advanced-stage cancer at diagnosis, and 9.7% died within 180 days of diagnosis. These patients accrued 11,282 ED visits within 180 days of diagnosis. Most patients had at least one ED visit (57.7%); half (49.9%) occurred during business hours (Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 4:59 pm), and half (50.4%) resulted in hospitalization. More than half (57.5%) of ED visits were for complaints that included: pain/headache, nausea/vomiting/dehydration, fever, swelling, shortness of breath/cough, and medication refill. Patients were most often discharged home when they arrived between 8:00 am and 11:59 am (adjusted odds ratio for hospitalization, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84). CONCLUSION: ED visits are common among safety-net patients with newly diagnosed cancer, and hospitalizations may be influenced by nonclinical factors. The majority of ED visits made by adults with newly diagnosed cancer in a safety-net health system could potentially be routed to an alternate site of care, such as a cancer urgent care clinic.","['Hong, Arthur S', 'Sadeghi, Navid', 'Harvey, Valorie', 'Lee, Simon Craddock', 'Halm, Ethan A']","['Hong AS', 'Sadeghi N', 'Harvey V', 'Lee SC', 'Halm EA']","['1 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', '1 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', '2 Parkland Health & Hospital System, Dallas, TX.', '2 Parkland Health & Hospital System, Dallas, TX.', '1 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', '3 Harold C.

These trials included heterogeneous patient populations in terms of disease and baseline characteristics. These hamper the use of standard network meta-analyses for indirect treatment comparison of relative efficacy. In this situation, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in second-line CP-CML was performed. The aim was to compare the relative efficacies of bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib in second-line CP-CML patients.Methods: The MAIC was preceded by a systematic literature review that ensured inclusion of the underlying data for the analyses. The outcomes were measured in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). The treatments were quantitatively compared based on Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) regressions, on restricted mean survival (RMST, when the proportionality assumption showed evidence of violation) and on odds ratios (for response measures).Results: Comparing with dasatinib, bosutinib resulted in HRs for PFS and OS of 0.63 (0.44-0.90, p < .05) and 0.82 (0.54-1.26, p = .37) respectively, and resulted in an OR for MCyR of 0.78 (0.53-1.16). Although the proportionality of hazards assumption was violated for PFS, the RMST analyses confirmed the findings of the Cox regression. When compared with nilotinib, bosutinib showed a significant HR of 0.54 (0.38-0.76, p < .01) in favor of bosutinib for PFS, a non-significant HR of 0.72 (0.46-1.13, p = .16) for OS and a non-significant OR of 0.98 (0.71-1.35) for MCyR.Conclusions: Bosutinib had a significantly greater PFS than both dasatinib and nilotinib. For OS, the findings were numerically in favor of bosutinib, but not statistically significant. For MCyR, the findings were numerically in favor of dasatinib and nilotinib, but not statistically significant.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Muresan, Bogdan', 'Mamolo, Carla', 'Cappelleri, Joseph C', 'Crescenzo, Rocco J', 'Su, Yun', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Heeg, Bart', 'Douglas Smith, B']","['Cortes JE', 'Muresan B', 'Mamolo C', 'Cappelleri JC', 'Crescenzo RJ', 'Su Y', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Heeg B', 'Douglas Smith B']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Ingress-Health, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Patient & Health Impact, Pfizer Inc., Groton, CT, USA.', 'Global Biometrics & Data Management, Pfizer Inc., Groton, CT, USA.', 'Worldwide Research & Development, Pfizer Inc., Walton Oaks, UK (at the time of this research).', 'Patient & Health Impact, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA (at the time of this research).', 'Department of Hematology, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Ingress-Health, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncology, John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190515,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*bosutinib', '*chronic-phase', '*dasatinib', '*nilotinib']",,2019/04/10 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2019.1605239 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2019 Sep;35(9):1615-1622. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2019.1605239.

In the current retrospective study, we assessed response rates as adjudicated by the IWG (International Working Group) MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) and MDS/MPN myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndrome response criteria, in 121 CMML patients treated with Azacitidine (AZA, n = 56) and Decitabine (DAC, n = 65). The overall response rates were 41% by the IWG MDS (AZA- 45%, DAC-39%), and 56% by the IWG MDS/MPN (AZA-56%, DAC-58%) response criteria, with CR (complete remission) rates of <20% for both agents, by both criteria. There were no significant differences in response rates between proliferative and dysplastic CMML. Moreover, 29% of CMML patients in a CR with HMA progressed to AML (blast transformation), underscoring the limited impact of these agents on disease biology. Progression after HMA response was associated with a median overall-survival (OS) of 8 months, while median OS in patients with primary HMA failure was 4 months. Lower serum LDH levels (<250 Units/L) were associated with HMA responses by both criteria; while ASXL1 and TET2 mutational status had no impact. HMA treated patients had a longer median OS (31 vs 18 months; P = .01), in comparison to those treated with conventional care regimens (excluding observation only patients), without any differences between AZA vs DAC (P = .37). In conclusion, this study highlights the inadequacies of HMA therapy in CMML, retrospectively validates the IWG MDS/MPN response criteria and underscores the need for newer, rationally derived therapies.","['Coston, Tucker', 'Pophali, Prateek', 'Vallapureddy, Rangit', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Finke, Christy M', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Carr, Ryan', 'Binder, Moritz', 'Mangaonkar, Abhishek A', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Zblewski, Darci', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Coston T', 'Pophali P', 'Vallapureddy R', 'Lasho TL', 'Finke CM', 'Ketterling RP', 'Carr R', 'Binder M', 'Mangaonkar AA', 'Gangat N', 'Al-Kali A', 'Litzow M', 'Zblewski D', 'Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A', 'Patnaik MM']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190503,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Decitabine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,,,,2019/04/10 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25488 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jul;94(7):767-779. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25488.

The abnormal expression of MAP2K1 is associated with leukemia. Bioinformatics analysis showed the targeted relationship between microRNA-181a (miR-181a) and the 3'-UTR of MAP2K1. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-181a in regulating MAP2K1 expression, the effects on leukemic cell proliferation, apoptosis, and adriamycin (ADM) resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to confirm the targeted relationship between miR-181a and MAP2K1. ADM resistant cell line HL-60/ADM was established. MiR-181a and MAP2K1 expressions were detected. HL-60/ADM cells were cultured in vitro and divided into two groups, including microRNA-Normal control (miR-NC) group and miR-181a mimic group. MAP2K1, phosphorylated MAP2K1 (p-MAP2K1), and phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) protein expressions were tested. Cell apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was determined using EdU staining. RESULTS: There is a targeted regulatory relationship between miR-181a and MAP2K1 mRNA. miR-181a expression was significantly lower, while MAP2K1 mRNA and protein expressions were markedly higher in HL-60/ADM cells than HL-60 cells (p<0.05). Transfection of miR-181a mimic markedly reduced expressions of MAP2K1, p-MAP2K1, and p-ERK in HL-60/ADM cells, enhanced cell apoptosis, and weakened cell proliferation compared to miR-NC (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MiR-181a reduction and MAP2K1 elevation were related to ADM resistance in leukemia cells. Up-regulation of miR-181a expression inhibited leukemia cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced ADM resistance via targeting MAP2K1 expression and ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.","['Wang, J-J', 'Yu, J-P']","['Wang JJ', 'Yu JP']","['Department of Laboratory, Nuclear Industry 215 Hospital of Shaanxi Province, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China. yuyujianping@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",,,,,2019/04/10 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201903_17397 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Mar;23(6):2497-2504. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201903_17397.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 Dec;24(23):11987.

Some 'missing' heritability may be mediated by epigenetic changes in the parental germ line that do not involve transmission of genetic variants from parent to offspring. We report that deletion of the chromatin regulator Kdm6a (Utx) in the paternal germ line results in elevated tumor incidence in genetically wild type mice. This effect increases following passage through two successive generations of Kdm6a male germline deletion, but is lost following passage through a wild type germ line. The H3K27me3 mark is redistributed in sperm of Kdm6a mutants, and we define approximately 200 H3K27me3-marked regions that exhibit increased DNA methylation, both in sperm of Kdm6a mutants and in somatic tissue of progeny.

Limited studies describing the clinicopathologic features and mutation profile are available. We searched for myeloid neoplasms with a DDX41 gene mutation tested by an 81-gene next-generation sequencing panel over a 7-month period. We identified 34 patients with myeloid neoplasms with DDX41 abnormalities; 26 (76%) men and 8 women (24%) [median age, 70 years], 20 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 10 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and 3 myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Fifty-nine DDX41 variants were detected: 27 (46%) appeared somatic and 32 (54%) were presumably germline mutations. The majority of presumed germline mutations were upstream of the Helicase 2 domain (93%) and involved loss of the start codon (30%). The majority of somatic mutations were within the Helicase 2 domain (78%), with the missense mutation p.R525H being most common (67%). There was a significant difference in the location of germline or somatic mutations (P < .0001). Concomitant mutations were detected involving 19 genes, but only TP53 (n = 11, 32%), ASXL1 (n = 8, 24%), and JAK2 (n = 4, 12%) were recurrent. Twenty (59%) patients showed diploid cytogenetics. Twenty-three (68%) patients presented with AML or MDS-EB-2, suggesting an association with high-grade myeloid neoplasm. Patients with myeloid neoplasms carrying DDX41 mutations show male predominance (3:1), higher age at presentation, association with TP53 mutations, and association with high-grade myeloid neoplasms in our cohort at a referral cancer center setting. These findings support the recognition of myeloid neoplasms with DDX41 mutation as unique, need for germline confirmation, and further assessment of family members.","['Quesada, Andres E', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Ok, Chi Y', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Bannon, Sarah A', 'Benton, Christopher B', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Patel, Keyur P']","['Quesada AE', 'Routbort MJ', 'DiNardo CD', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Khoury JD', 'Thakral B', 'Zuo Z', 'Yin CC', 'Loghavi S', 'Ok CY', 'Wang SA', 'Tang Z', 'Bannon SA', 'Benton CB', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Luthra R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Patel KP']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Clinical Cancer Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190507,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Germ-Line Mutation', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Factors', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,2019/04/10 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25486 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jul;94(7):757-766. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25486.

CAR T cell immunotherapy is probably one of the most encouraging developments for the treatment of hematological malignancies. In 2017, two CAR T cell therapies were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: one for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the other for adult patients with advanced lymphomas. However, despite significant progress in the area, CAR T cell therapy is still in its early days and faces significant challenges, including the complexity and costs associated with the technology. B cell lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic cancer in dogs, with an incidence approaching 0.1% and a total of 20-100 cases per 100,000 individuals. It is a widely accepted naturally occurring model for human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Current treatment is with combination chemotherapy protocols, which prolong life for less than a year in canines and are associated with severe dose-limiting side effects, such as gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity. To date, one canine study generated CAR T cells by transfection of mRNA for CAR domain expression. While this was shown to provide a transient anti-tumor activity, results were modest, indicating that stable, genomic integration of CAR modules is required in order to achieve lasting therapeutic benefit. This commentary summarizes the current state of knowledge on CAR T cell immunotherapy in human medicine and its potential applications in animal health, while discussing the potential of the canine model as a translational system for immuno-oncology research.","['Mochel, Jonathan P', 'Ekker, Stephen C', 'Johannes, Chad M', 'Jergens, Albert E', 'Allenspach, Karin', 'Bourgois-Mochel, Agnes', 'Knouse, Michael', 'Benzekry, Sebastien', 'Wierson, Wesley', 'LeBlanc, Amy K', 'Kenderian, Saad S']","['Mochel JP', 'Ekker SC', 'Johannes CM', 'Jergens AE', 'Allenspach K', 'Bourgois-Mochel A', 'Knouse M', 'Benzekry S', 'Wierson W', 'LeBlanc AK', 'Kenderian SS']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, 50011, USA. jmochel@iastate.edu.', 'Iowa State University College of Vet.

We propose that this murine model could be a useful tool for dissecting PD etiology and developing treatment strategies against this neurodegenerative disease.","['Ekholm-Reed, Susanna', 'Baker, Robert', 'Campos, Alexandre R', 'Stouffer, David', 'Henze, Martha', 'Wolf, Dieter A', 'Loring, Jeanne F', 'Thomas, Elizabeth A', 'Reed, Steven I']","['Ekholm-Reed S', 'Baker R', 'Campos AR', 'Stouffer D', 'Henze M', 'Wolf DA', 'Loring JF', 'Thomas EA', 'Reed SI']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Scripps Research, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.', '3Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 02037 USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.', '3Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 02037 USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Scripps Research, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190404,England,Commun Biol,Communications biology,101719179,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (parkin protein)']",,"['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cell Count', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dopaminergic Neurons/*pathology', 'Gene Dosage/*genetics', '*Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Activity/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Parkinson Disease/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",PMC6449387,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],2019/04/10 06:00,2019/04/10 06:01,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s42003-019-0366-x [doi]', '366 [pii]']",epublish,Commun Biol. 2019 Apr 4;2:125. doi: 10.1038/s42003-019-0366-x. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6226-9767'],,,"['R01 GM105802/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS059904/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the mechanisms of dexamethasone resistance in B cell ALL (B-ALL), we generated dexamethasone-resistant clones by prolonged treatment with dexamethasone. Using RNA-sequencing and high-throughput screening, we found that dexamethasone-resistant cells are dependent on receptor tyrosine kinases. Further analysis with phosphokinase arrays showed that the type III receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is constitutively active in resistant cells. Targeted next-generation and Sanger sequencing identified an internal tandem duplication mutation and a point mutation (R845G) in FLT3 in dexamethasone-resistant cells, which were not present in the corresponding sensitive clones. Finally, we showed that resistant cells displayed sensitivity to second-generation FLT3 inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that long-term dexamethasone treatment selects cells with a distinct genetic background, in this case oncogenic FLT3, and therefore therapies targeting FLT3 might be useful for the treatment of relapsed B-ALL patients.","['Chougule, Rohit A', 'Shah, Kinjal', 'Moharram, Sausan A', 'Vallon-Christersson, Johan', 'Kazi, Julhash U']","['Chougule RA', 'Shah K', 'Moharram SA', 'Vallon-Christersson J', 'Kazi JU']","['1Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.0000 0001 0930 2361grid.4514.4', '1Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.0000 0001 0930 2361grid.4514.4', '1Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.0000 0001 0930 2361grid.4514.4', '2Division of Oncology and Pathology, Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.0000 0001 0930 2361grid.4514.4', '1Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.0000 0001 0930 2361grid.4514.4']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190404,England,NPJ Genom Med,NPJ genomic medicine,101685193,,,,PMC6449402,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],2019/04/10 06:00,2019/04/10 06:01,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41525-019-0082-y [doi]', '82 [pii]']",epublish,NPJ Genom Med. 2019 Apr 4;4:7. doi: 10.1038/s41525-019-0082-y. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0719-5336'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present case, an evidence-guided treatment plan of supplements and lifestyle changes were used to support the patient. Case Presentation: A 56-y-old female presented to her primary care physician for a routine physical in 2001. Complete blood cell results suggest pathology among white blood cells. Flow cytometry was used to confirm the presence of CLL. Other than an episode of splenomegaly in 2005 and mild lymphadenopathy, the patient has remained asymptomatic since diagnosis in 2001. In late 2001, the patient began a physician-assisted regimen of alternative dietary supplements and lifestyle changes. Conclusion: Nutritional supplementation along with lifestyle changes appears to have supported the maintenance of stable and indolent CLL in this patient. It is important for physicians to be prepared to engage with their patients on use of supplements and lifestyle changes in managing their disease.","['Haskin, Gregory', 'Kogan, Mikhail']","['Haskin G', 'Kogan M']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,Integr Med (Encinitas),"Integrative medicine (Encinitas, Calif.)",101196303,,,,PMC6380985,,,,2018/02/01 00:00,2018/02/01 00:01,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Integr Med (Encinitas). 2018 Feb;17(1):51-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One issue not yet fully addressed is distinctions attributable to age of diagnosis. Methods: In this report, we verified a survival difference based on diagnostic age for both pediatric NBL and pediatric ALL datasets, with younger patients surviving longer for both diseases. We identified several gene expression markers that correlated with age, along a continuum, and then used a series of age-independent survival metrics to filter these initial correlations. Results: For pediatric NBL, we identified 2 genes that are expressed at a higher level in lower surviving patients with an older diagnostic age; and 4 genes that are expressed at a higher level in longer surviving patients with a younger diagnostic age. For pediatric ALL, we identified 3 genes expressed at a higher level in lower surviving patients with an older diagnostic age; and 17 genes expressed at a higher level in longer surviving patients with a younger diagnostic age. Conclusions: This process implicated pan-chromosome effects for chromosomes 11 and 17 in NBL; and for the X chromosome in ALL.","['Diviney, Andrea', 'Chobrutskiy, Boris I', 'Zaman, Saif', 'Blanck, George']","['Diviney A', 'Chobrutskiy BI', 'Zaman S', 'Blanck G']","['1Department of Molecular Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, 12901 Bruce B.

TGF-beta receptor activation and phosphorylation trigger a regulatory circuit of activating and inhibitory SMAD proteins and increased activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway either by a loss of negative feedback or constitutive activation has been associated with the myelosuppression and ineffective erythropoiesis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Anemia is the predominant cause of morbidity and quality of life impairment in patients with lower-risk (LR)-MDS, and there are very limited therapy options for these patients after failure of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Targeting the aberrant TGF-ss signaling pathway has therefore been investigated as a promising therapeutic approach to resolve the ineffective erythropoiesis in LR-MDS. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the TGF-beta signaling cascade in hematopoiesis under physiologic conditions and its role in MDS pathogenesis. We also review preclinical and clinical data for the activin receptor type IIA ligand traps sotatercept and luspatercept that have recently shown promising results in overcoming the myelosuppressive effects of TGF-beta signaling alterations to improve hematopoiesis in transfusion-dependent, non-del(5q) LR-MDS patients. Additional potential targets within the TGF-beta pathway have also been identified in preclinical experiments and may provide further therapeutic options. Finally, combining different TGF-beta pathway inhibitors or using them in combination with ESAs or the immunomodulator lenalidomide might have synergistic effects as well.","['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Zeidan AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. amer.zeidan@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20190408,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,2019/04/10 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0448-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0448-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1303-1312. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0448-2.

Our RNA-interference studies identified proteasome-associated ubiquitin-receptor Rpn13 as a mediator of MM cell growth and survival. Here, we developed the first degrader of Rpn13, WL40, using a small-molecule-induced targeted protein degradation strategy to selectively degrade this component of the UPS. WL40 was synthesized by linking the Rpn13 covalent inhibitor RA190 with the cereblon (CRBN) binding ligand thalidomide. We show that WL40 binds to both Rpn13 and CRBN and triggers degradation of cellular Rpn13, and is therefore first-in-class in exploiting a covalent inhibitor for the development of degraders. Biochemical and cellular studies show that WL40-induced Rpn13 degradation is both CRBN E3 ligase- and Rpn13-dependent. Importantly, WL40 decreases viability in MM cell lines and patient MM cells, even those resistant to bortezomib. Mechanistically, WL40 interrupts Rpn13 function and activates caspase apoptotic cascade, ER stress response and p53/p21 signaling. In animal model studies, WL40 inhibits xenografted human MM cell growth and prolongs survival. Overall, our data show the development of the first UbR Rpn13 degrader with potent anti-MM activity, and provide proof of principle for the development of degraders targeting components of the UPS for therapeutic application.","['Song, Yan', 'Park, Paul M C', 'Wu, Lei', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Picaud, Sarah', 'Li, Deyao', 'Wimalasena, Virangika K', 'Du, Ting', 'Filippakopoulos, Panagis', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Qi, Jun', 'Chauhan, Dharminder']","['Song Y', 'Park PMC', 'Wu L', 'Ray A', 'Picaud S', 'Li D', 'Wimalasena VK', 'Du T', 'Filippakopoulos P', 'Anderson KC', 'Qi J', 'Chauhan D']","['LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

In this model the leukemia initiating cells (LICs) comprise pre-leukaemic, differentiation inhibited thymocytes allowing us to provide a profile of the LIC surfaceome in which GPR56, CD53 and CD59a are co-expressed with CD25.

We investigated the indications for allo-HSCT, clinical outcome, management of relapse, and post-transplant TKI treatment in a population-based setting using the Swedish CML registry. Of 118 CML patients transplanted between 2002 and 2017, 56 (47.4%) received allo-HSCT in first CP, among whom TKI resistance was the most common transplant indication (62.5%). For patients diagnosed with CML in CP at <65 years of age, the cumulative probability of undergoing allo-HSCT within 5 years was 9.7%. Overall 5-year survival was 96.2%, 70.1% and 36.9% when transplanted in first CP, second or later CP, and in accelerated phase or blast crisis, respectively. Risk factors for relapse were EBMT score >2 and reduced intensity conditioning, and for death, CP > 2 at time point of allo-HSCT only. Non-relapse mortality for patients transplanted in CP was 11.6%.

CASE REPORT We describe 2 cases of acute and chronic OM by CPKp in adults with hematologic disorders. Patient 1, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, developed bacteremia due to multidrug CPKp after induction chemotherapy. Despite pathogen-directed antibiotic treatment, blood cultures remained positive for CPKp, with an increase in its resistance pattern, and worsening of clinical condition. A pelvic computed tomography revealed air bubbles in the femoral head and ilium, suggestive of OM, and bone culture was positive for pandrug-resistant CPKp. The clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and the patient died. Patient 2, with aplastic anemia, developed multidrug CPKp bacteremia after immunosuppressive therapy, with good response to pathogen-directed antibiotic treatment. Ten months later, she underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and at the time of neutrophil engraftment, an abscess developed in the right thigh. An extensively drug-resistant CPKp was isolated from the pus, and antibiotics were started, without clinical improvement. A magnetic resonance of the thigh revealed an intraosseous abscess, suggestive of OM, and after debridement surgery and 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotics, she was successfully discharged home. CONCLUSIONS OM due to CPKp is uncommonly reported. These 2 cases illustrate the complex management of OM by CPKp in immunocompromised hematologic patients, and the importance of clinical suspicion for a prompt diagnosis, early treatment, and successful outcome.","['Alho, Ana C', 'Infante, Joana', 'Carmo, Eduarda', 'Raposo, Joao']","['Alho AC', 'Infante J', 'Carmo E', 'Raposo J']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHLN - EPE, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHLN - EPE, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Hospital de Egas Moniz, CHLO - EPE, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital de Santa Maria, CHLN - EPE, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190409,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (carbapenemase)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/complications/therapy', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Klebsiella Infections/*diagnosis', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteomyelitis/*microbiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', '*Transplant Recipients', 'beta-Lactamases/metabolism']",PMC6474388,,,,2019/04/10 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['909965 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.909965 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Apr 9;20:482-488. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.909965.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than half of older AML patients fail to respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and most responders relapse with drug-resistant disease. Failure to achieve complete remission can be partly attributed to the drug resistance advantage of AML blasts that frequently express P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-binding cassette transporter. Our previous work showed that elevated acid ceramidase (AC) levels in AML contribute to blast survival. Here, we investigated P-gp expression levels in AML relative to AC. Using parental HL-60 cells and drug-resistant derivatives as our model, we found that P-gp expression and efflux activity were highly upregulated in resistant derivatives. AC overexpression in HL-60 conferred resistance to the AML chemotherapeutic drugs, cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and daunorubicin, and was linked to P-gp upregulation. Furthermore, targeting AC through pharmacologic or genetic approaches decreased P-gp levels and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, AC overexpression increased NF-kappaB activation whereas NF-kB inhibitors reduced P-gp levels, indicating that the NF-kappaB pathway contributes to AC-mediated modulation of P-gp expression. Hence, our data support an important role for AC in drug resistance as well as survival and suggest that sphingolipid targeting approaches may also impact drug resistance in AML.","['Tan, Su-Fern', 'Dunton, Wendy', 'Liu, Xin', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Morad, Samy A F', 'Desai, Dhimant', 'Doi, Kenichiro', 'Conaway, Mark R', 'Amin, Shantu', 'Claxton, David F', 'Wang, Hong-Gang', 'Kester, Mark', 'Cabot, Myles C', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Tan SF', 'Dunton W', 'Liu X', 'Fox TE', 'Morad SAF', 'Desai D', 'Doi K', 'Conaway MR', 'Amin S', 'Claxton DF', 'Wang HG', 'Kester M', 'Cabot MC', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute Hershey, PA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Departments of Pharmacology Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Pediatrics Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Public Health Sciences University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute Hershey, PA.', 'Pediatrics Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA tploughran@virginia.edu.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190408,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (Acid Ceramidase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Acid Ceramidase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",PMC6547629,['NOTNLM'],"[""*adenosine 5'-triphosphate binding cassette transporter B1"", '*cancer', '*ceramide', '*drug therapy', '*multidrug resistance protein 1', '*nuclear factor-kappaB', '*sphingolipid', '*sphingosine 1-phosphate']",,2019/04/10 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2275(20)32248-3 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.M091876 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2019 Jun;60(6):1078-1086. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M091876.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors E2A and Lyl1 form a complex that promotes lymphoid specification. In this study, we demonstrate that Tal1, a Lyl1-related basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that promotes T acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is required for HSC specification, erythropoiesis, and megakaryopoiesis, is a negative regulator of murine lymphoid specification. We demonstrate that Tal1 limits the expression of multiple E2A target genes in HSCs and controls the balance of myeloid versus T lymphocyte differentiation potential in lymphomyeloid-primed progenitors. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms controlling lymphocyte specification and may reveal a basis for the unique functions of Tal1 and Lyl1 in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['de Pooter, Renee F', 'Dias, Sheila', 'Chowdhury, Munmun', 'Bartom, Elisabeth T', 'Okoreeh, Michael K', 'Sigvardsson, Mikael', 'Kee, Barbara L']","['de Pooter RF', 'Dias S', 'Chowdhury M', 'Bartom ET', 'Okoreeh MK', 'Sigvardsson M', 'Kee BL']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Committee on Immunology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Committee on Immunology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Committee on Immunology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611.', 'Committee on Immunology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; and.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; bkee@bsd.uchicago.edu.', 'Committee on Immunology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190408,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/genetics/*immunology']",PMC6504590,,,,2019/04/10 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801220 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801220 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 May 15;202(10):2837-2842. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801220.

We sought to investigate regulatory mechanisms that result in increased therapeutic resistance, which is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer and linked to dysregulation of the androgen-responsive pathway. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The underlying intracellular mechanism that sustains the oncogenic network involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and therapeutic resistance of prostate cancer was evaluated to investigate and identify effectors. Multiple sets of samples with prostate adenocarcinomas and CRPC were assessed via IHC and other assays. RESULTS: We demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was induced by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and was upregulated by ZBTB46 in prostate cancer to promote CRPC and neuroendocrine differentiation. LIF was found to be induced in patients with prostate cancer after ADT and was associated with enriched nuclear ZBTB46 staining in high-grade prostate tumors. In prostate cancer cells, high ZBTB46 output was responsible for the activation of LIF-STAT3 signaling and neuroendocrine-like features. The abundance of LIF was mediated by ADT-induced ZBTB46 through a physical interaction with the regulatory sequence of LIF. Analysis of serum from patients showed that cases of higher tumor grade and metastatic prostate cancer exhibited higher LIF titers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that LIF is a potent serum biomarker for diagnosing advanced prostate cancer and that targeting the ZBTB46-LIF axis may therefore inhibit CRPC development and neuroendocrine differentiation after ADT.","['Liu, Yen-Nien', 'Niu, Shaoxi', 'Chen, Wei-Yu', 'Zhang, Qingfu', 'Tao, Yulei', 'Chen, Wei-Hao', 'Jiang, Kuo-Ching', 'Chen, Xufeng', 'Shi, Huaiyin', 'Liu, Aijun', 'Li, Jinhang', 'Li, Yanjing', 'Lee, Yi-Chao', 'Zhang, Xu', 'Huang, Jiaoti']","['Liu YN', 'Niu S', 'Chen WY', 'Zhang Q', 'Tao Y', 'Chen WH', 'Jiang KC', 'Chen X', 'Shi H', 'Liu A', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Lee YC', 'Zhang X', 'Huang J']","['Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. liuy@tmu.edu.tw xzhang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn jiaoti.huang@duke.edu.', 'TMU Research Center of Cancer Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, State Key Laboratory of Kidney Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Chinese PLA Medical Academy, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital and College of Basic Medical Sciences, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology, The PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', 'PhD Program for Neural Regenerative Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Center for Neurotrauma and Neuroregeneration, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, State Key Laboratory of Kidney Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Chinese PLA Medical Academy, Beijing, China. liuy@tmu.edu.tw xzhang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn jiaoti.huang@duke.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina. liuy@tmu.edu.tw xzhang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn jiaoti.huang@duke.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190408,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb46 protein, human)']",IM,"['Androgen Antagonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Androgen/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC7168873,,,,2019/04/10 06:00,2020/08/06 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-3239 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3239 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 1;25(13):4128-4140. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3239.

The miR-140-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in several tumors, but the role of miR-140-5p in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains unclear. Here, we investigated the suppression of miR-140-5p in CML patients and CML cell lines using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Overexpression miR-140-5p in CML cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation as revealed by the CCK-8 assay and promoted cell apoptosis as revealed by flow cytometry. Moreover, the sine oculis homeobox 1 (SIX1) gene had been confirmed as a direct target of miR-140-5p using bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays. Overexpression of miR-140-5p decreased the SIX1 protein level in CML cells. SIX1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly up-regulated in CML patients and CML cell lines. Knockdown of SIX1 expression significantly inhibited CML cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Furthermore, SIX1 as a transcriptional factor positively regulated pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2) expression and played an important role in the Warburg effect. In addition, these findings indicated that miR-140-5p functions as a tumor suppressor and plays a critical role in CML cell apoptosis and metabolism by targeting SIX1. Moreover, the miR-140-5p/SIX1 axis may be a potential therapeutic target in CML.","['Nie, Zi-Yuan', 'Liu, Xiao-Jun', 'Zhan, Ying', 'Liu, Meng-Han', 'Zhang, Xiao-Yan', 'Li, Zi-Ye', 'Lu, Ya-Qiong', 'Luo, Jian-Min', 'Yang, Lin']","['Nie ZY', 'Liu XJ', 'Zhan Y', 'Liu MH', 'Zhang XY', 'Li ZY', 'Lu YQ', 'Luo JM', 'Yang L']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China luojianmin1960@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190430,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn140 microRNA, human)', '0 (SIX1 protein, human)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '0 (thyroid hormone-binding proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology/physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Thyroid Hormones/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6488949,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*PKM2', '*SIX1', '*Warburg effect', '*apoptosis', '*miR-140-5p']",,2019/04/10 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20190150 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20190150 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2019 Apr 30;39(4). pii: BSR20190150. doi: 10.1042/BSR20190150.

METHODS: This was a single institution ancillary study to a prospective observational study (N=20 consecutive adults aged >/=60 with newly diagnosed AML who received induction chemotherapy). Biomarkers (Interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-6 soluble receptor [IL-6 sR], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha], TNFalpha soluble receptor 1 [TNFalpha sR1], interleukin-3 [IL-3], C-reactive protein [CRP]) were collected at start of induction, weekly for three weeks, and post-induction and were compared over time using paired t-tests. GA was administered at baseline and post-induction, and correlated with biomarker levels using Spearman correlations. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and compared by categorized biomarker level using Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: Biomarker levels were stable during induction, except for CRP and IL-6 sR. Declines in objectively measured physical function [Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB); r=0.71, p<0.01] and increases in self-reported limitation in instrumental activities of daily living (r=0.81, p<0.01) were correlated with increased TNFalpha sR1. Declines in SPPB were correlated with increased CRP (r=-0.73, p<0.01). Improvement in depression was correlated with increased IL-6 sR (r=-0.59 p=0.02). Survival was shorter in those with baseline TNFalpha or CRP levels above the median (6.1 vs. 40.2months and 5.5 vs. 27.6months respectively, p=0.04 for both). CONCLUSION: Among older adults with AML, the relationships between TNFalpha sR1, CRP, and IL-6 sR with change in physical and emotional health during treatment warrants further investigation.","['Loh, Kah Poh', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Nicklas, Barbara J', 'Kritchevsky, Stephen B', 'Williamson, Jeff D', 'Ellis, Leslie R', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Pardee, Timothy S', 'Goyal, Neha G', 'Klepin, Heidi D']","['Loh KP', 'Tooze JA', 'Nicklas BJ', 'Kritchevsky SB', 'Williamson JD', 'Ellis LR', 'Powell BL', 'Pardee TS', 'Goyal NG', 'Klepin HD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, James P.

METHODS: Four-week-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHRs were either treated with losartan (20 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks or served as untreated controls. BP was measured by the tail-cuff method. At 12 weeks, isometric contraction of the aortic rings of the rats was evaluated with a force transducer and recorder. The mRNA and protein levels of the target Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), and the extent of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT-1) phosphorylation in the aorta, were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The BP of the four-week-old SHRs did not differ from that of the age-matched WKY rats, whereas the BP of the twelve-week-old control group SHRs was higher than that of the control group WKY rats. Losartan treatment, however, inhibited BP elevation in both rat strains, doing so to a greater extent in the treatment group SHRs. The contractile force in response to angiotensin II of the aortic rings from the SHRs treated with losartan was significantly lower than that of the aortic rings from the non-treated SHRs. The protein expression of leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) was significantly higher in the non-treated SHRs compared to the non-treated WKY rats. CONCLUSION: The study results showed that the reduction of BP elevation by losartan in SHRs occurs through the suppression of LARG expression and MYPT-1 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells.","['Chiu, Wei-Chiao', 'Chiang, Jiun-Yang', 'Juang, Jyh-Ming', 'Wu, Cho-Kai', 'Tsai, Chia-Ti', 'Tseng, Yung-Zu', 'Su, Ming-Jai', 'Chiang, Fu-Tien']","['Chiu WC', 'Chiang JY', 'Juang JM', 'Wu CK', 'Tsai CT', 'Tseng YZ', 'Su MJ', 'Chiang FT']","['Graduate Institute of Physiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Pharmacology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Cardiovascular Center, Fu Jen Catholic University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

For analyses purposes patients were divided into Group A, consisted of 48 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) and Group B with 33 heavily pre-treated patients (13 Hodgkin s lymphoma, 7 non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, 7 MM, 4 germ cell tumor, 2 non-promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia). RESULTS: In the Group A, circulating CD34+ cells/muL was significantly higher, 90% started stem cell harvest on day 14, 98% collected >/=5.0 x 10(6) CD34+cells/kg and a single apheresis was sufficient in 92% of the cases. In the Group B, 85% started leukapheresis on day 14, 88% collected >/=2.0 x 10(6) CD34+cells/kg which was achieved with a single apheresis in 82% of the cases; a higher proportion of the patients (63.6% versus 33.3%) required platelet transfusions. Both groups exhibited few adverse events and the time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: Intermediate-dose cytarabine plus G-CSF mobilization is effective even for heavily pre-treated patients. The outpatient administration of G-CSF, the reliable prediction of the day to begin harvesting, the optimal CD34+ cell yield obtained with a single apheresis and the fewer occurrences of adverse events denoted the benefits of this regimen.","['Callera, Alexandra Fernandes', 'Rosa, Evandro Secchi', 'Callera, Fernando']","['Callera AF', 'Rosa ES', 'Callera F']","['Centro de Hematologia do Vale, Rua Euclides Miragaia 700, Sala 75 - Centro, Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo 12245-820, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia do Vale, Rua Euclides Miragaia 700, Sala 75 - Centro, Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo 12245-820, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia do Vale, Rua Euclides Miragaia 700, Sala 75 - Centro, Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo 12245-820, Brazil.

Average age for FeLV- and FIV-positive individuals was 38.32 and 64.25 months, respectively. Behavior such as aggressiveness and sex (male) were both associated with increased odds of result positivity test for FeLV and FIV; older animals were also associated with FIV test results. A very small proportion of the animals were vaccinated against FeLV and none against FIV. Most of the animals were adopted from shelters or rescued from streets, living with multiple cats that had access to outdoors. The high prevalence of FeLV suggests a need for better control strategies against this disease.","['Biezus, Giovana', 'Machado, Gustavo', 'Ferian, Paulo Eduardo', 'da Costa, Ubirajara Maciel', 'Pereira, Leonardo Henrique Hasckel da Silva', 'Withoeft, Jessica Aline', 'Nunes, Igor Augusto Coelho', 'Muller, Thiago Rinaldi', 'de Cristo, Thierry Grima', 'Casagrande, Renata Assis']","['Biezus G', 'Machado G', 'Ferian PE', 'da Costa UM', 'Pereira LHHDS', 'Withoeft JA', 'Nunes IAC', 'Muller TR', 'de Cristo TG', 'Casagrande RA']","['Veterinary Medicine Department, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (UDESC), Av.

A reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22 generates the chimeric Bcr-Abl oncogene, which is associated with several hematological malignancies. However, the functional relevance between aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemia remains obscure. METHODS: LncRNA cDNA microarray was used to identify novel lncRNAs involved in Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. To study the functional relevance of novel imatinib-upregulated lncRNA (IUR) family in Abl-induced tumorigenesis, Abl-transformed cell survival and xenografted tumor growth in mice was evaluated. Primary bone marrow transformation and in vivo leukemia transplant using lncRNA-IUR knockdown (KD) transgenic mice were further conducted to corroborate the role of lncRNA-IUR in Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Transcriptome RNA-seq, Western blot, RNA pull down and RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) were employed to determine the mechanisms by which lncRNA-IUR-5 regulates Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis. RESULTS: We identified a conserved lncRNA-IUR family as a key negative regulator of Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Increased expression of lncRNA-IUR was detected in both human and mouse Abl-transformed cells upon imatinib treatment. In contrast, reduced expression of lncRNA-IUR was observed in the peripheral blood lymphocytes derived from Bcr-Abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients compared to normal subjects. Knockdown of lncRNA-IUR remarkably promoted Abl-transformed leukemic cell survival and xenografted tumor growth in mice, whereas overexpression of lncRNA-IUR had opposite effects. Also, silencing murine lncRNA-IUR promoted Bcr-Abl-mediated primary bone marrow transformation and Abl-transformed leukemia cell survival in vivo. Besides, knockdown of murine lncRNA-IUR in transgenic mice provided a favorable microenvironment for development of Abl-mediated leukemia. Finally, we demonstrated that lncRNA-IUR-5 suppressed Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis by negatively regulating STAT5-mediated expression of CD71. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that lncRNA-IUR may act as a critical tumor suppressor in Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis by suppressing the STAT5-CD71 pathway. This study provides new insights into functional involvement of lncRNAs in leukemogenesis.","['Wang, Xuefei', 'Yang, Jianling', 'Guo, Guijie', 'Feng, Riyue', 'Chen, Ke', 'Liao, Yuan', 'Zhang, Lianfeng', 'Sun, Liping', 'Huang, Shile', 'Chen, Ji-Long']","['Wang X', 'Yang J', 'Guo G', 'Feng R', 'Chen K', 'Liao Y', 'Zhang L', 'Sun L', 'Huang S', 'Chen JL']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100101, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Key Laboratory of Immune Mechanism and Intervention on Serious Disease in Hebei Province, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100101, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100101, China.', 'Institute of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100101, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Fujian-Taiwan Animal Pathogen Biology, College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, China.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Comparative Medical Center, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Fujian-Taiwan Animal Pathogen Biology, College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, China. chenjl@im.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190408,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oligoribonucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6454664,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcr-Abl', '*Cellular transformation', '*Imatinib', '*Leukemia', '*LncRNA']",,2019/04/10 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-019-1013-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-019-1013-3 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2019 Apr 8;18(1):84. doi: 10.1186/s12943-019-1013-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After analysis of 93 AML cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found expression of 293 genes that correlated to the expression of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene. Based on these 293 genes, the cyclooxygenase (COX), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathways were predicted to be specifically activated in AMLs with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion. Moreover, the in vitro proliferation of AML cells with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion decreased significantly more than that of AML cells without the fusion, when the pathways were inhibited pharmacologically. The results indicate that novel targetable signaling pathways could be identified by the analysis of the gene expression features of AMLs with non-targetable genetic alterations. The elucidation of specific molecular targets for AMLs that have a specific genetic alteration would promote personalized treatment of AMLs and improve clinical outcomes.","['Yun, Jae Won', 'Bae, Yoon Kyung', 'Cho, So Yeong', 'Koo, Harim', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Nam, Do-Hyun', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Chun, Sejong', 'Joo, Kyeung Min', 'Park, Woong-Yang']","['Yun JW', 'Bae YK', 'Cho SY', 'Koo H', 'Kim HJ', 'Nam DH', 'Kim SH', 'Chun S', 'Joo KM', 'Park WY']","['Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Science and Technology (SAIHST), Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea. jwyunmd@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea. jwyunmd@gmail.com.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Science and Technology (SAIHST), Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea. bab1825@gmail.com.', 'Single Cell Network Research Center, Sungkyunkwan University of Medicine, Suwon 16419, Korea. bab1825@gmail.com.', 'Single Cell Network Research Center, Sungkyunkwan University of Medicine, Suwon 16419, Korea. soyeong159@naver.com.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell biology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon 16419, Korea. soyeong159@naver.com.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Science and Technology (SAIHST), Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea. guhalim@naver.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea. heejinkim@skku.edu.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Science and Technology (SAIHST), Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea. dhns.nam@samsung.com.', 'Departments of Neurosurgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea. dhns.nam@samsung.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea. sunnyhk@skku.edu.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School & Hospital, Gwangju 61469, Korea. sjchun79@jnu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Science and Technology (SAIHST), Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea. kmjoo@skku.edu.', 'Single Cell Network Research Center, Sungkyunkwan University of Medicine, Suwon 16419, Korea. kmjoo@skku.edu.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell biology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon 16419, Korea. kmjoo@skku.edu.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Science and Technology (SAIHST), Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea. woongyang.park@samsung.com.', 'Samsung Genome Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul 06351, Korea. woongyang.park@samsung.com.', 'Departments of Molecular Cell Biology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon 16419, Korea. woongyang.park@samsung.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190406,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Computational Biology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC6480444,['NOTNLM'],"['RUNX1-RUNX1T1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'oncogenes', 'transcription factor']",,2019/04/10 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20071717 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20071717 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Apr 6;20(7). pii: ijms20071717. doi: 10.3390/ijms20071717.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9029-8036', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2750-405X']",,,['NRF-2016R1A5A2945889/National Research Foundation of Korea'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cluster analysis-a Machine Learning approach-was applied on personal exposure measurements from 977 children in France to characterize real-life ELF exposure scenarios. Electric networks near the child's home or school were considered as environmental factors characterizing the exposure scenarios. The following clusters were identified: children with the highest exposure living 120(-)200 m from 225 kV/400 kV overhead lines; children with mid-to-high exposure living 70(-)100 m from 63 kV/150 kV overhead lines; children with mid-to-low exposure living 40 m from 400 V/20 kV substations and underground networks; children with the lowest exposure and the lowest number of electric networks in the vicinity. 63(-)225 kV underground networks within 20 m and 400 V/20 kV overhead lines within 40 m played a marginal role in differentiating exposure clusters. Cluster analysis is a viable approach to discovering variables best characterizing the exposure scenarios and thus it might be potentially useful to better tailor epidemiological studies. The present study did not assess the impact of indoor sources of exposure, which should be addressed in a further study.","['Tognola, Gabriella', 'Bonato, Marta', 'Chiaramello, Emma', 'Fiocchi, Serena', 'Magne, Isabelle', 'Souques, Martine', 'Parazzini, Marta', 'Ravazzani, Paolo']","['Tognola G', 'Bonato M', 'Chiaramello E', 'Fiocchi S', 'Magne I', 'Souques M', 'Parazzini M', 'Ravazzani P']","[""CNR IEIIT-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni, 20133 Milan, Italy. gabriella.tognola@ieiit.cnr.it."", ""CNR IEIIT-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni, 20133 Milan, Italy. marta.bonato@ieiit.cnr.it."", 'Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria DEIB, Politecnico di Milano, 20133 Milan, Italy. marta.bonato@ieiit.cnr.it.', ""CNR IEIIT-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni, 20133 Milan, Italy. emma.chiaramello@ieiit.cnr.it."", ""CNR IEIIT-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni, 20133 Milan, Italy. serena.fiocchi@ieiit.cnr.it."", 'EDF Electricite de France, 92300 Levallois-Perret, France. isabelle.magne@edf.fr.', 'EDF Electricite de France, 92300 Levallois-Perret, France. martine.souques@edf.fr.', ""CNR IEIIT-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni, 20133 Milan, Italy. marta.parazzini@ieiit.cnr.it."", ""CNR IEIIT-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni, 20133 Milan, Italy. paolo.ravazzani@ieiit.cnr.it.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190406,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Electricity', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'France', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Machine Learning', '*Magnetic Fields', 'Schools']",PMC6479449,['NOTNLM'],"['*ELF MF', '*Machine Learning', '*children', '*cluster analysis', '*indoor exposure', '*magnetic field']",,2019/04/10 06:00,2019/08/15 06:00,['2019/04/10 06:00'],"['2019/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph16071230 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph16071230 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 Apr 6;16(7). pii: ijerph16071230. doi: 10.3390/ijerph16071230.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2433-449X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5941-297X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2503-4779', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9008-7530', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0282-3329']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main functional changes associated with disease evolution in CML was high proliferation rate, decreased apoptosis, blockade of differentiation, and strong resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The current study analyzed the relative expressional profiles of genes related with proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as c-MYC, BAD, BCL-2, C/EBPalpha/-beta and ABCB1 respectively in different clinical stages of CML by SYBR Green I quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR.

Likewise, the mean expression level of BAD, C/EBPalpha/-beta genes were found to be significantly down regulated. Present study concluded that the complex interplay of several candidate genes like overexpression of c-MYC, ABCB1, BCL-2 and down regulation of BAD, C/EBPalpha/-beta played a significant role in the disease evolution and development of drug resistant in CML.","['Chandran, Ramachandran Krishna', 'Geetha, Narayanan', 'Sakthivel, Kunnathur Murugesan', 'Kumar, Raveendran Suresh', 'Krishna, Kumarapillai Mohanan Nair Jagathnath', 'Sreedharan, Hariharan']","['Chandran RK', 'Geetha N', 'Sakthivel KM', 'Kumar RS', 'Krishna KMNJ', 'Sreedharan H']","['Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India; Department of Biochemistry, PSG College of Arts and Science, Civil Aerodrome Post, Coimbatore 641014, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in 5%-9% of patients during treatment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a mouse model of ibrutinib-induced AF and investigate its proarrhythmic mechanisms. METHODS: In C57BI/6 mice in the ibrutinib and control groups, ibrutinib (25 mg/kg/d) or vehicle (hydroxypropy1-beta-cyclodextrin), respectively, was administered orally for 4 weeks. Transesophageal burst stimulation then was used to induced AF. To evaluate the underlying mechanism of AF, cardiac echocardiography was performed. Ca(2+) handling and action potentials in atrial myocytes were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the ibrutinib group showed (1) a higher incidence and longer duration of AF with transesophageal burst stimulation; (2) increased left atrial mass, as indicated by echocardiography; (3) significant myocardial fibrosis in the left atrium on Masson trichrome staining; (4) Ca(2+) handling disorders in atrial myocytes, such as reduced Ca(2+) transient amplitude, enhanced spontaneous Ca(2+) release, and reduced sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) capacity; (5) enhanced delayed afterdepolarization in atrial myocytes; and (6) increased CaMKII expression and phosphorylation of RyR2-Ser2814 and PLN-Thr17. CONCLUSION: The present study established a mouse model of AF by oral administration of ibrutinib for 4 weeks. The arrhythmogenic mechanisms underlying this model likely are associated with structural remodeling and Ca(2+) handling disorders in the atrium.","['Jiang, Le', 'Li, Linling', 'Ruan, Yanfei', 'Zuo, Song', 'Wu, Xiaoyan', 'Zhao, Qianqian', 'Xing, Yanwei', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Xia, Shijun', 'Bai, Rong', 'Du, Xin', 'Liu, Nian', 'Ma, Chang-Sheng']","['Jiang L', 'Li L', 'Ruan Y', 'Zuo S', 'Wu X', 'Zhao Q', 'Xing Y', 'Zhao X', 'Xia S', 'Bai R', 'Du X', 'Liu N', 'Ma CS']","['Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', ""Guang'anmen Hospital, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China.

Relapse post-HCT is associated with poor prognosis; however, inpatient healthcare utilization of this population is unknown. Here we describe survival, intensity of healthcare utilization, and characteristics associated with high resource use at the end of life (EOL). Adult patients with AL/MDS who underwent HCT at a large regional referral center with subsequent relapse between 2005 and 2015 were included in this retrospective study. We compared the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients as well as healthcare utilization over 2 years postrelapse and at EOL by postrelapse disease-directed therapeutic interventions. We created a composite score for EOL healthcare utilization intensity by summing the presence of any of the following criteria: death in the hospital, use of chemotherapy, emergency department, hospitalization, intensive care unit, intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or hemodialysis in the last month of life. Higher scores indicate more intense healthcare use at EOL. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to determine variables (demographic characteristics, postrelapse treatment group, advance directives documentation, palliative care referral, time to relapse) associated with EOL healthcare utilization intensity. One hundred fifty-four patients were included; median age at relapse was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 to 63), 55% were men, 79% had AL, and median time from HCT to relapse was 6 months (IQR, 3 to 10). After relapse, 28% received supportive care only, 50% received chemotherapy only, and 22% received chemotherapy plus cell therapy (either donor lymphocyte infusion, second HCT, or donor lymphocyte infusion plus second HCT). With the exception of time until relapse and Karnofsky Performance Status, baseline characteristics (gender, age, race, graft-versus-host disease, year of treatment) did not significantly differ by postrelapse treatment group. One hundred thirty-six patients (88%) died within 2 years of relapse; survival differed significantly by postrelapse treatment group, with those receiving disease-directed treatment showing lower risk of death. Healthcare use in AL/MDS patients after post-HCT relapse was high overall, with 44% visiting the emergency department at least once (22% at least 2 times), 93% hospitalized (55% at least 2 times, 16% at least 5 times), and 38% using the intensive care unit (median length of stay 5, days; IQR, 3 to 10). Use was high even among those receiving only supportive care. For those patients who died, the mean intensity score for EOL healthcare use was 1.8 (standard deviation, 1.8). Most patients (70%) had a marker of high-intensity healthcare utilization at the EOL or died in hospital. In multivariable analysis, an increase in age (estimate -.03 (95% CI, -.06 to -.003) and having AL versus MDS were significantly associated with a decreased EOL healthcare intensity score; no other variables were associated with intensity of EOL healthcare use. Healthcare utilization after post-HCT relapse is associated with receipt of disease-directed therapy but remains high across all groups despite known poor prognosis. Interventions are needed to minimize nonbeneficial treatments and promote goal-concordant EOL care in this seriously ill patient population.","['Langston, Jessica A', 'Sundaram, Vandana', 'Periyakoil, Vyjeyanthi S', 'Muffly, Lori']","['Langston JA', 'Sundaram V', 'Periyakoil VS', 'Muffly L']","['Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California; VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, California.

In this study, we analyzed differentially expressed genes in CD34(+)hematopoietic cells and identified a novel lncRNA, H22954, which was down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In cultured AML cells and mouse xenograft models, H22954 expression inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis and RNA antisense purification assay indicated that H22954 targeted the 3' untranslated region of the BCL2 gene. In luciferase assays, H22954 expression inhibited BCL2 expression. In transfected K562cells and mouse xenograft tumors, H22954 overexpression reduced BCL-2 protein levels and promoted cell death. In AML patients, H22954 expression inversely correlated with BCL-2 protein levels in bone marrow cells, blast cell numbers and disease prognosis. These results indicate that H22954 is a novel regulator of BCL-2 and that reduced H22954 expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Qi, Xiaofei', 'Jiao, Yang', 'Cheng, Chao', 'Qian, Feng', 'Chen, Zixing', 'Wu, Qingyu']","['Qi X', 'Jiao Y', 'Cheng C', 'Qian F', 'Chen Z', 'Wu Q']","['Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou, 215000, China; Departments of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, China; Departments of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, China.

However, data supporting the use of ISA for primary prophylaxis in these patients are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of breakthrough invasive fungal infections (bIFIs) among adult hematologic malignancy patients and HCT recipients who received >/=7 days of ISA primary prophylaxis between 1 September 2016 and 30 September 2018. The incidence of bIFIs in patients receiving ISA was compared to those receiving posaconazole (POS) and voriconazole (VOR) during the same time period. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five patients received 197 courses of ISA prophylaxis. Twelve bIFIs (Aspergillus fumigatus [5], Aspergillus species [2], Mucorales [2], Fusarium species [2], and Candida glabrata [1]) occurred, representing 8.3% of patients and 6.1% of courses, after a median duration of 14 days of ISA prophylaxis. All bIFIs occurred during periods of neutropenia. Seven patients (58.3%) died within 42 days of onset of bIFI. In addition, bIFIs complicated 10.2% of ISA, 4.1% of POS, and 1.1% of VOR courses among patients with de novo or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia during the study period, with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) complicating 6.8% of ISA, 1.3% of POS, and zero VOR courses. CONCLUSIONS: Although ISA has been approved for treatment of invasive Aspergillus and mucormycosis, we observed an increased rate of bIFI, notably IPA, using ISA for primary prophylaxis. These results support the need for further study to determine the role of ISA as primary prophylaxis.","['Fontana, Lauren', 'Perlin, David S', 'Zhao, Yanan', 'Noble, Brie N', 'Lewis, James S', 'Strasfeld, Lynne', 'Hakki, Morgan']","['Fontana L', 'Perlin DS', 'Zhao Y', 'Noble BN', 'Lewis JS', 'Strasfeld L', 'Hakki M']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.', 'Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health, Nutley, New Jersey.', 'Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health, Nutley, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Oregon State University/Oregon Health and Science University College of Pharmacy.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '60UTO373KE (isavuconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Nitriles', 'Pyridines', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Triazoles']",PMC7931837,['NOTNLM'],"['*breakthrough invasive fungal infection', '*hematologic malignancy', '*hematopoietic cell transplant', '*isavuconazole', '*prophylaxis']",,2019/04/09 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['5431181 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciz282 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Feb 14;70(5):723-730. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciz282.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Twenty-four testicles with their epididymis were recovered from adult alpacas at the slaughterhouse of Huancavelica-Peru. Samples were transported to the Laboratory of Reproductive Physiology at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. Testes were selected for our study when the progressive motility of epididymal spermatozoa (ESPM) was above 30%. Isolation of SSC was performed with two enzymatic digestions. Finally, sperm viability was evaluated by means of the trypan blue vital stain in spermatogonial round cells. Samples with more than 80% viability were selected. Isolated cells cultured for 2 days were used for identifying the presence of SSCs by the expression of integrin beta1 (116 bp) and PLZF (206 bp) genes.

To date, the use of ATO for clinical treatment of solid tumors is still limited by its poor biocompatibility and severe toxic side effects. To address these limitations, here we developed a pH-low insertion peptide (pHLIP) modified ATO-based multifunctional drug-delivery system (DDS), which is termed MnAs@SiO2-pHLIP. With the coating of pHLIP, MnAs@SiO2-pHLIP could efficiently target the acidic tumor microenvironment, resulting in high intracellular accumulation of the DDS. As a ""smart"" nanoparticle (NP) platform, the DDS could controllably discharge the loaded ATO in response to acidic environments, which promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells. The features of controlled release capacity and the outstanding targeting ability contribute to better anticancer efficacy and less toxicity towards normal tissues compared with free ATO. It is worth noting that the acidic tumor microenvironment would also trigger the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) that brighten the T1 signal, which is exploited for real-time monitoring via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These multifunctional features, as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments, could potentially expand the use of ATO to the treatment of solid tumors. We believe that MnAs@SiO2-pHLIP could serve as an auspicious agent for cancer theranostics and find tremendous applications in cancer management.","['Zhang, Ke', 'Lin, Hongyu', 'Mao, Junjie', 'Luo, Xiangjie', 'Wei, Ruixue', 'Su, Zhongzhen', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Li, Dan', 'Gao, Jinhao', 'Shan, Hong']","['Zhang K', 'Lin H', 'Mao J', 'Luo X', 'Wei R', 'Su Z', 'Zhou B', 'Li D', 'Gao J', 'Shan H']","['Center for Interventional Medicine, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. lidan25@mail.sysu.edu.cn zhoub2@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biomater Sci,Biomaterials science,101593571,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Peptides)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Drug Liberation', 'Extracellular Space/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Silicon Dioxide/chemistry']",,,,,2019/04/09 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9bm00216b [doi]'],ppublish,Biomater Sci. 2019 May 28;7(6):2480-2490. doi: 10.1039/c9bm00216b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to provide a better outlook for the anticancer property of 10058-F4, an appealing inhibitor of c-Myc, in pre-B ALL cell lines either in the context of monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results declared that abrogation of c-Myc decreased the proliferative capacity of pre-B ALL-derived cells through halting the transition of the cells from G1 phase, and reducing the replicative potential of both REH and Nalm-6 cells, at least partly, through c-Myc-mediated suppression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. Moreover, 10058-F4 potently induced a caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in pre-B ALL cells via shifting the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic target genes. Although the inhibition of PI3Kdelta using Idelalisib upregulated the messenger RNA expression of autophagy-related genes in 10058-F4-treated cells, treatment with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine decreased viability of the cells, either as a single agent or in combination with Idelalisib and/or 10058-F4; suggesting that the activation of autophagy in pre-B ALL cells could blunt apoptotic events and attenuate anticancer effect of both c-Myc and PI3K inhibitors. Finally, the results of our synergistic experiments delineated that 10058-F4 produced a synergistic effect with vincristine and provided an enhanced therapeutic efficacy in ALL cells, highlighting that c-Myc oncoprotein could be a bona fide target for the treatment of ALL.","['Sheikh-Zeineddini, Negar', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Riyahi, Niknam', 'Shabestari, Rima Manafi', 'Janzamin, Ehsan', 'Safa, Majid']","['Sheikh-Zeineddini N', 'Bashash D', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Riyahi N', 'Shabestari RM', 'Janzamin E', 'Safa M']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Flowcyt Science-Based Company, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190407,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (5-(4-ethylbenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*10058-F4', '*PI3K signaling pathway', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*autophagy', '*c-Myc']",,2019/04/09 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2018/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.28675 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Aug;120(8):14004-14016. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28675.

Previous studies suggest proteasome inhibition with chemotherapy improves relapse ALL response rates. This phase 2 Children's Oncology Group study tested the hypothesis that adding the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to chemotherapy increases complete response rates (CR2). Evaluable patients (n = 135, 103 B-ALL, 22 T-ALL, 10 T-lymphoblastic lymphoma) were treated with reinduction chemotherapy plus bortezomib. Overall CR2 rates were 68 +/- 5% for precursor B-ALL patients (<21 years of age), 63 +/- 7% for very early relapse (<18 months from diagnosis) and 72 +/- 6% for early relapse (18-36 months from diagnosis). Relapsed T-ALL patients had an encouraging CR2 rate of 68 +/- 10%. End of induction minimal residual disease (MRD) significantly predicted survival. MRD negative (MRDneg; MRD <0.01%) rates increased from 29% (post-cycle 1) to 64% following cycle 3. Very early relapse, end-of-induction MRDneg precursor B-ALL patients had 70 +/- 14% 3-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates, vs. 3-year EFS/OS of 0-3% (P = 0.0001) for MRDpos (MRD >/=0.01) patients. Early relapse patients had similar outcomes (MRDneg 3-year EFS/OS 58-65% vs. MRDpos 10-19%, EFS P = 0.0014). These data suggest that adding bortezomib to chemotherapy in certain ALL subgroups, such as T-cell ALL, is worthy of further investigation.

Methods: This is a validation study that was conducted at Majmaah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between January-2017 and July-2018. Two independent data sets of CLL transcriptomics from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with time-to-first treatment (TTFT) data (GSE39671; 130 patients) and information about overall survival (OS) (GSE22762; 107 patients) were used for the validation analyses. To further investigate the relatedness of a transcript of interest to other neoplasms, 6 independent data sets of cancer transcriptomics with prognostic information (1865 patients) from the cancer genomics atlas (TCGA) were used. Pathway-enrichment analyses were conducted using Reactome; and correlation analyses of gene expression were performed using Pearson score. Results: Nine of the CLL-related proteins exhibited transcript expression that predicted TTFT and 7 of the CLL-related proteins showed mRNA levels that predicted OS in CLL patients (p</=0.05). Of these transcripts, 8 were different types of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs); and 2 (HNRNPUL2 and HIST1C1H) retained prognostic significance in the 2 independent data sets. Furthermore, genes that enriched CLL-related pathways (p</=0.05; false discovery rate [FDR] </=0.05) were found to correlate with the expression of HNRNPUL2 (Pearson score: >/=0.50; p lessthan 0.00001). Finally, increased expression of HNRNPUL2 was indicative of poor prognosis of various types of cancer other than CLL (p less than 0.05). Conclusion: The cognate transcripts of 14 of our CLL-related proteins significantly predicted CLL prognosis.","['Alsagaby, Suliman A']",['Alsagaby SA'],"['Department of Medical Laboratories Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Majmaah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Methods: Medical records of children newly diagnosed with BAL or ALAL, based on the EGIL or the 2008/2016 WHO criteria, respectively, admitted at Chonnam National University Hospital in 2001-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Twelve (3.2%) of 377 AL patients satisfied the BAL or ALAL definitions based on the EGIL or the WHO criteria, respectively. Among 12 patients including 11 with BAL and another with undefined case based on the EGIL criteria, 7 (1.9%) had ALAL based on more stringent 2016 WHO criteria (AUL, 2; MPAL, 5). One patient had MPAL with t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), BCR-ABL+, and two had MLL gene abnormality. ALL-directed regimen was associated with better complete remission rate compared with AML-directed regimen (100.0% vs. 16.7%; P=0.015). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 51.1+/-15.8% and 51.9+/-15.7%, respectively. AUL was associated with poor OS and EFS compared with MPAL (0.0% vs. 75.0+/-21.7%; P=0.008). Conclusion: Due to the rarity of the cases, future multicenter, prospective studies incorporating large number of cases are urgently warranted to identify the clinical, biologic, and molecular markers for the prediction of prognosis and determine the best tailored therapy for each patient.","['Lee, Hyun Gyung', 'Baek, Hee Jo', 'Kim, Ho Sung', 'Park, Soo Min', 'Hwang, Tai Ju', 'Kook, Hoon']","['Lee HG', 'Baek HJ', 'Kim HS', 'Park SM', 'Hwang TJ', 'Kook H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190321,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC6439300,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage', 'Biphenotypic acute leukemia', 'Children', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia']","[""Authors' Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest: No potential conflicts"", 'of interest relevant to this article were reported.']",2019/04/09 06:00,2019/04/09 06:01,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2019.54.1.63 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2019 Mar;54(1):63-73. doi: 10.5045/br.2019.54.1.63.

ABCB1 displays a high affinity for imatinib. BMI1 is a polycomb group protein thought to be overexpressed in leukemic cells. Methods: This study was conducted to investigate the prognostic value of ABCB1 and BMI1 expressions in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Expression levels were measured in 81 patients newly diagnosed with CML and 20 healthy controls by real time reverse transcription- PCR. Results: The ABCB1 expression levels did not differ between patients with CML and controls. Low ABCB1 mRNA levels were observed in patients who achieved an optimal response compared to suboptimal and resistant cases (P=0.005). Non-responders showed the highest ABCB1 levels. ABCB1 expression did not affect the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients. BMI1 expression was higher in patients than that in controls (P=0.001). Patients in advanced phases expressed higher levels of BMI1 than those in the chronic phase (P=0.004). High BMI1 expression was associated with a shorter PFS. Conclusion: ABCB1 mRNA expression may serve as a predictor of the optimal response to imatinib treatment in patients with CML.

Here, we analyzed the outcomes and prognostic factors of children with Ph+ ALL who received imatinib and chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first complete remission (CR). Methods: Thirty-one Ph+ ALL patients (female 10) diagnosed from January 2005 to December 2016 were included in the study. All patients were treated with imatinib and chemotherapy before HCT. Bone marrow (BM) evaluations included real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) study of the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript. All patients received HCT with total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning at a median of 6.4 (range, 4.2-47.1) months from diagnosis. Results: Compared to values at diagnosis, the median decrement of RQ-PCR value post-consolidation, and prior to HCT was -3.7 Log and -4.8 Log, respectively. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of the patients were 64.5+/-9.4% (20/31) and 75.0+/-8.3% (23/31) respectively. Events included relapse (N=5) and death in CR post-HCT (N=6). The 5-year incidence of molecular relapse was 30.9+/-9.1% (9/31). An RQ-PCR decrement of at least -4 Log post-consolidation significantly predicted lower incidence of molecular relapse: 7.7+/-7.7% for >/=-4 Log decrement, 50.0+/-13.8% for <-4 Log decrement (P=0.027). Conclusion: Decrement in RQ-PCR for the BCR-ABL1 transcript that was determined after consolidation was the only significant prognostic factor for incidence of molecular relapse. In the post-induction TKI initiation setting, steadfast imatinib treatment during consolidation may allow for optimum post-HCT outcomes.","['Shin, Juae', 'Lee, Na Yeong', 'Kim, Seongkoo', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin']","['Shin J', 'Lee NY', 'Kim S', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190321,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC6439289,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Children', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'RQ-PCR']","[""Authors' Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest: No potential conflicts"", 'of interest relevant to this article were reported.']",2019/04/09 06:00,2019/04/09 06:01,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2018/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2019.54.1.45 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2019 Mar;54(1):45-51. doi: 10.5045/br.2019.54.1.45.

Of these, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an aggressive childhood cancer, is largely driven by mutations in RAS genes and those that encode regulators of these proteins. The Mx1-cre kras(+/G12D) mouse model mirrors several key features of this disease and has been used extensively to determine the utility and mechanism of small molecule therapeutics in the context of RAS-driven myeloproliferative disorders. Treatment of disease-bearing KRAS(G12D) mice with rigosertib (RGS), a small molecule RAS mimetic that is in phase II and III clinical trials for MDS and AML, decreased the severity of leukocytosis and splenomegaly and extended their survival. RGS also increased the frequency of HSCs and rebalanced the ratios of myeloid progenitors. Further analysis of KRAS(G12D) HSPCs in vitro revealed that RGS suppressed hyperproliferation in response to GM-CSF and inhibited the phosphorylation of key RAS effectors. Together, these data suggest that RGS might be of clinical benefit in RAS-driven myeloid disorders.","['Baker, Stacey J', 'Cosenza, Stephen C', 'Ramana Reddy, M V', 'Premkumar Reddy, E']","['Baker SJ', 'Cosenza SC', 'Ramana Reddy MV', 'Premkumar Reddy E']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190308,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6443005,['NOTNLM'],"['RAS', 'hematopoiesis', 'myeloproliferative disorder', 'rigosertib']","['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST EPR is an equity holder, board member and a paid consultant', 'of Onconova Therapeutics, Inc.

Methods: Rats were randomly divided into normal (N) group, CD model (M) group, CD model with herb-partitioned moxibustion (MM) group, normal with herb-partitioned moxibustion (NM) group, CD model with mesalazine (western medicine, Med ) group, and normal saline (NS) group, with 10 rats in each group. The CD model rats were prepared by trinitrobenzene sulphonic expect for the N group and NM group. After the CD rats model were established, the rats in the MM and NM groups were treated with herb-partitioned moxibustion at Tianshu (ST25) and Qihai (CV6) acupoints once daily for 7 days, and rats in the Med and NS groups were respectively treated with mesalazine enteric coated tablet and normal saline once daily for 7 days. After intervention, hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the histological changes of colon; RNA sequencing was used to observe the changes in autophagy- and immune-associated gene expression profiles. In addition, autophagy- and immune-associated cytokines and signaling pathways in CD rats were also screened.

HPM also changed the expression of many autophagy- and immune-associated genes, especially downregulating the expression of autophagy-associated Nod2, Irgm genes as well as the receptor of immune-associated Il12b, Il22 (Il12rb1, Il22ra2) genes in the colon of CD rats. HPM also changed the enrichment levels of differentially expressed genes in the human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 infection pathway, the Epstein-Barr virus infection pathway, and the cell adhesion molecule pathway. In addition, the expression levels of Nod2, Irgm, IL-12b, and IL-22 mRNA were increased (all P< 0.01) in the M group compared to the N group, while the expression levels of Nod2, Irgm, IL-12b, and IL-22 mRNA were decreased (P<0.05 or P<0.01) in the MM and Med groups compared to the M group. Conclusion: Herb-partitioned moxibustion may effectively attenuate intestinal inflammation and promote the repair of colon mucosal injury of CD rats through the regulation of autophagy- and immune-associated gene expression and signaling pathways.","['Zhao, Ji-Meng', 'Liu, Ya-Nan', 'Zheng, Han-Dan', 'Huang, Yan', 'Qi, Qin', 'Liu, Hui-Rong', 'Shi, Yin', 'Ma, Xiao-Peng', 'Lu, Yuan', 'Wu, Lu-Yi']","['Zhao JM', 'Liu YN', 'Zheng HD', 'Huang Y', 'Qi Q', 'Liu HR', 'Shi Y', 'Ma XP', 'Lu Y', 'Wu LY']","['Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Immunological Effects, Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200030, China.', 'Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Immunological Effects, Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200030, China.', 'Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Immunological Effects, Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Immunological Effects, Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Immunological Effects, Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200030, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Immunological Effects, Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200030, China.', 'Shanghai Qigong Research Institute, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200030, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190307,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC6431444,,,,2019/04/09 06:00,2019/04/09 06:01,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3405146 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2019 Mar 7;2019:3405146. doi: 10.1155/2019/3405146. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9075-6036', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5588-0274', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5132-1141', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7502-1573', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9532-4870', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7584-5727', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8888-1698']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Kuwait Cancer Registry for Kuwaiti adults (15-99 years) and children (0-14 years) diagnosed with one of 18 common cancers during 2000-2013 and followed up to 31 December 2014. Net survival was estimated at 1, 3, and 5 years by sex. To control for background mortality, life tables of all-cause mortality in the general population were constructed by single year of age, sex, and calendar year of death (""complete"" life tables). Net survival estimates were age-standardised using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. RESULTS: Cancers with the highest net survival throughout the 14-year period were prostate, breast (women) and rectum in adults, and lymphoma in children. Survival was lowest for liver, pancreas and lung cancer in adults, and brain tumours in children. During 2010-2013, one year survival was over 80% for cancers of the prostate, breast, rectum, cervix and colon. Five-year survival was above 80% only for prostate cancer. For children, one and five-year survival was above 80% only for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoma. Survival was generally higher for women than men, and declined faster in women than men between 1 and 3 years after diagnosis. Differences between boys and girls were small. CONCLUSION: Cancer survival improved for most Kuwaiti adults and children over the 14-year period, with women generally having a more favourable prognosis than men. Continuous surveillance is required to monitor cancers for which survival did not improve, and to dissect the underlying causes for the differences in survival between Kuwait and other countries.","['Alawadhi, Eiman', 'Al-Awadi, Ahmed', 'Elbasmi, Amani', 'Coleman, Michel P', 'Allemani, Claudia']","['Alawadhi E', 'Al-Awadi A', 'Elbasmi A', 'Coleman MP', 'Allemani C']","['Cancer Survival Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Kuwait Cancer Control Center, Ministry of Health, State of Kuwait.', 'Kuwait Cancer Control Center, Ministry of Health, State of Kuwait.', 'Cancer Survival Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Cancer Survival Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Kuwait,Gulf J Oncolog,The Gulf journal of oncology,101500911,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kuwait', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Research Design', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/04/09 06:00,2019/07/17 06:00,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2018/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gulf J Oncolog. 2019 Jan;1(29):39-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In C. elegans, adult animals reallocate fat stores from intestinal cells to the germline via low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particles to promote embryogenesis. Here, I demonstrate that two conserved homeodomain transcription factors, CEH-60/PBX and UNC-62/MEIS, coordinate a transcriptional network that supports reproduction while suppressing longevity and stress-response pathways. The CEH-60:UNC-62 heterodimer serves an unanticipated dual function in intestinal nuclei by directly activating the expression of lipoprotein genes while directly repressing stress-responsive genes. Consequently, ceh-60 mutants display fat storage defects, a dramatic lifespan extension, and hyper-activation of innate immunity genes. Finally, CEH-60 associates with PQM-1 at the DAF-16-associated element within the promoters of stress-responsive genes to control gene expression. Thus, CEH-60 governs an elaborate transcriptional network that balances stress responses and longevity against reproduction during developmental transitions.","['Dowen, Robert H']",['Dowen RH'],"['Integrative Program for Biological and Genome Sciences, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.

Many studies have revealed that the overexpression of the Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) protein is related to leukemogenesis. Curcuminoids (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin) from Thai turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn.) are the focus of this study because they have been previously been reported to show potent antileukemic activity. This study aims to investigate the cytotoxic effect of in-house curcuminoids on the human leukemic stem cell line (KG-1a) when compared to other leukemic cell lines (KG-1 and K562). MTT assays were used to determine the cytotoxicity of curcuminoids at various concentrations. Curcumin exhibited the strongest cytotoxic activity on KG-1a cells with IC50 values of 13.6 +/- 1.9 microM. To determine the effect of curcuminoids on WT1 and CD34 protein expressions by Western blotting, KG-1a cells were treated with noncytotoxic concentrations (IC20 value). Bisdemethoxycurcumin showed the strongest suppression of WT1 and CD34 protein expressions with 73.3 +/- 1.4 and 82.9 +/- 2.0%, respectively. In summary, curcuminoids, especially bisdemethoxycurcumin, could inhibit WT1 and CD34 protein expressions. Thus, bisdemethoxycurcumin is a compound that calls for further studies of its process in the inhibition of WT1 and CD34 expressions in LSCs for the leukemia treatment.","['Panyajai, Pawaret', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Chiampanichayakul, Sawitree', 'Anuchapreeda, Songyot']","['Panyajai P', 'Tima S', 'Chiampanichayakul S', 'Anuchapreeda S']","['Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS-CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Center for Research and Development of Natural Products for Health, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS-CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS-CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.', 'Center for Research and Development of Natural Products for Health, Chiang Mai University , Chiang Mai , Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190407,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diarylheptanoids)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '2EFO1BP34R (bis(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)methane)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'W2F8059T80 (demethoxycurcumin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcuma/chemistry', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Diarylheptanoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",,,,,2019/04/09 06:00,2020/06/06 06:00,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2019.1598565 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2019;71(7):1189-1200. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2019.1598565.

We performed this study to investigate the feasibility of unrelated donor HSCT who initially had intermediate- or high-risk cytogenetics. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with AML who received unrelated HSCT in CR1 at Samsung Medical Center between November 2001 and January 2012. Patients were allocated based on karyotype at diagnosis as follows: (a) low-risk: inv(16), t(16;16), t(8;21), and t(15;17); (b) high-risk: -5, 5q-, -7, 3q abnormalities, t(8;16), t(6;9), t(6;11), t(6;21), t(10;11), complex karyotype (>/=3 abnormalities), and acute megakaryocytic leukemia without t(1;22); and (c) IR: all the other karyotypes including normal. Patients in intermediate- or high-risk group who were transplanted with either unrelated CB or matched unrelated BM/mobilized PB in their CR1 were included in this study. The projected OS and EFS rates were 74.9% and 71.1%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 87.3 months after transplantation. The EFS was 70.1%, 80.7%, and 73.9% for CB, BM, and mobilized PB groups, respectively (P = 0.89), and 73.9% and 70.6% for IR and high-risk groups (P = 0.76). The leading cause of death was relapse (n = 8), and only one patient died from non-relapse cause. Unrelated donor HSCT seems a feasible approach for children with intermediate- or high-risk AML in CR1.

Still, relapse occurs in 30% of the children after HSCT. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 which can lead to an altered p53 protein expression are rare at time of diagnosis of ALL, yet occur more frequent at relapse indicating a more aggressive disease. Our aim was to evaluate if alterations in the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 signaled a relapse in pediatric ALL patients post-HSCT and could guide for preemptive immunotherapy. PROCEDURE: Paraffin-embedded bone marrow samples from 46 children diagnosed with ALL between 1997 and 2010, and transplanted at Karolinska University Hospital, were analyzed for p53 by IHC. Samples were analyzed independently at diagnosis, before HSCT, and after HSCT 0-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6-12 months. RESULT: Strong expression of p53 in the bone marrow at 0-3-months after HSCT was associated with increased risk of relapse, odds ratio 2.63 (confidence interval 1.08-6.40) P = 0.033. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of p53 protein expression in bone marrow from pediatric ALL patients that undergo HSCT may be a potential, additional prognostic marker for predicting relapse after HSCT.","['Mattsson, Kristin', 'Honkaniemi, Emma', 'Ramme, Kim', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Sander, Birgitta M', 'Gustafsson, Britt M']","['Mattsson K', 'Honkaniemi E', 'Ramme K', 'Barbany G', 'Sander BM', 'Gustafsson BM']","['Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, CLINTEC, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, CLINTEC, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Astrid Lindgren`s Childrens Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital-Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital-Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, CLINTEC, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190406,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*metabolism/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Sweden', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*HSCT', '*children', '*p53', '*relapse']",,2019/04/08 06:00,2020/04/22 06:00,['2019/04/08 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13408 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2019 Jun;23(4):e13408. doi: 10.1111/petr.13408.

Our previous study showed that LukS-PV can induce apoptosis in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) THP-1 and HL-60 cells. C5aR (C5a receptor) is the receptor for PVL, but whether C5aR plays a key role in LukS-PV induced apoptosis is unclear. The aim of this study was to establish whether C5aR plays a physiological role in apoptosis of leukemia cells induced by LukS-PV. We investigated the role of C5aR in leukemia cell apoptosis induced by LukS-PV by pretreatment of THP-1 and HL-60 cells with C5aR antagonist and transfection to knockdown C5aR in THP-1 cells or overexpress C5aR in Jurkat cells before treatment with LukS-PV. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by staining with Annexin V/propidium iodide or Annexin V-PE/7-AAD. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was determined using JC-1 dye. The expression of apoptosis-associated genes and proteins was identified by qRT-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis, respectively. As the C5aR antagonist concentration increased, the rate of apoptosis induced by LukS-PV decreased, the MMP increased, and expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak genes and proteins was downregulated while that of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-x genes and proteins was upregulated. Knockdown of C5aR also decreased LukS-PV-induced THP-1 cell apoptosis. LukS-PV did not induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells, which have no endogenous C5aR expression; however, LukS-PV did induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells after overexpression of C5aR. Correspondingly, the MMP decreased and Bax and Bak were upregulated while Bcl-2 and Bcl-x were downregulated. LukS-PV can induce apoptosis in AML cells by targeting C5aR. C5aR may be a potential therapeutic target for AML and LukS-PV is a candidate targeted drug for the treatment of AML.","['Zhang, Peng', 'Yu, Wen-Wei', 'Peng, Jing', 'Xu, Liang-Fei', 'Zhao, Chang-Cheng', 'Chang, Wen-Jiao', 'Ma, Xiao-Ling']","['Zhang P', 'Yu WW', 'Peng J', 'Xu LF', 'Zhao CC', 'Chang WJ', 'Ma XL']","['School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Anhui Provincial Hospital of Infectious Disease, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190406,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Leukocidins)', '0 (Panton-Valentine leukocidin)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bacterial Toxins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exotoxins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocidins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins']",PMC6536962,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*C5a receptor', '*LukS-PV', '*molecular marker', '*therapeutic target']",,2019/04/08 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/04/08 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2137 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 May;8(5):2474-2483. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2137.

Paediatricians successfully reduce toxicities by using lower bleomycin doses and substituting carboplatin for cisplatin, while testicular and paediatric immature teratomas (ITs) are safely managed with surgery alone. AIM: The aim was to determine whether reduced-toxicity treatment could rationally be extended to patients older than 18 years. METHODS: Multicentre cohort study was carried out in four large UK cancer centres over 12 years. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients were enrolled. Overall survival was 93%, and event-free survival (EFS) was 72%. Neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy (82% BEP) caused 27 potentially chronic toxicities, and one patient subsequently died from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There was no difference in histology, stage or grade in patients </=/>18 years, and EFS was not different in these age groups (</=18:28% and >18:28%; log-rank P = 0.96). Histological subtype powerfully predicted EFS (log-rank P = 4.9 x 10(-7)). Neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy reduced future relapse/progression in dysgerminoma (n = 37, chemo:0% vs. no chemo:20%), yolk sac tumour (n = 23, 26.3% vs.75%) and mixed germ cell tumour (n = 32, 40%vs.70%) but not in IT (n = 42, 33% vs.15%). Additionally, we observed no radiological responses to chemotherapy in ITs, pathological IT grade did not predict EFS (univariate hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval: 0.57-1.19, P = 0.94) and there were no deaths in this subtype. CONCLUSION: Survival was excellent but chemotherapy toxicities were severe, implying significant overtreatment. Our data support the extension of reduced-toxicity, paediatric regimens to adults. Our practice-changing findings that IT was chemotherapy resistant and pathological grade uninformative strongly endorse exclusive surgical management of ovarian ITs at all ages.","['Newton, C', 'Murali, K', 'Ahmad, A', 'Hockings, H', 'Graham, R', 'Liberale, V', 'Sarker, S-J', 'Ledermann, J', 'Berney, D M', 'Shamash, J', 'Banerjee, S', 'Stoneham, S', 'Lockley, M']","['Newton C', 'Murali K', 'Ahmad A', 'Hockings H', 'Graham R', 'Liberale V', 'Sarker SJ', 'Ledermann J', 'Berney DM', 'Shamash J', 'Banerjee S', 'Stoneham S', 'Lockley M']","['Barts Health NHS Trust, West Smithfield, London, EC1A 7BE, UK; University College Hospital, 235 Euston Road London, NW1 2BU, UK; University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8HW, UK; University of Bristol, Senate House, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol BS8 1TH, UK.', 'The Royal Marsden Hospital, 203 Fulham Rd, Chelsea, London SW3 6JJ, UK.', 'The Wolfson Institute, CRUK Barts Cancer Centre, Queen Mary University London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK; Cancer Intelligence, Cancer Research UK, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London EC1V 4AD, UK.', 'Barts Health NHS Trust, West Smithfield, London, EC1A 7BE, UK; Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'University College Hospital, 235 Euston Road London, NW1 2BU, UK.', 'University College Hospital, 235 Euston Road London, NW1 2BU, UK.', 'Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK; Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus, Hampstead, London NW3 2PR, UK.', 'University College Hospital, 235 Euston Road London, NW1 2BU, UK.', 'Barts Health NHS Trust, West Smithfield, London, EC1A 7BE, UK; Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Barts Health NHS Trust, West Smithfield, London, EC1A 7BE, UK.', 'The Royal Marsden Hospital, 203 Fulham Rd, Chelsea, London SW3 6JJ, UK.', 'University College Hospital, 235 Euston Road London, NW1 2BU, UK.', 'Barts Health NHS Trust, West Smithfield, London, EC1A 7BE, UK; University College Hospital, 235 Euston Road London, NW1 2BU, UK; Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.

The RNA-sequencing profiles and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from TCGA database. Differential expressed genes (DEG) were screened using limma package, subsequently following by GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were performed to screen critical DEGs. Nomogram-based prediction model were constructed to identify clinical factors with independent prognostic values, and the accuracy of this model was validated. A total of 214 DEGs were identified from relapse AML samples compared with non-relapse samples. These DEGs were mainly involved in twenty GO terms and three signaling pathways, such as chromatin assembly or disassembly, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Among these genes, Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis results showed that relapse and risk score were significantly correlated with survival outcomes. Finally, the accuracy ability of nomogram-based prediction model was validated. These six DEGs (ABCA5, CYP7A1, HERC5, etc.) play major roles in AMLs progression. Our nomogram-based prognostic predictive model might be an effective method to estimate survival probability of AML patients with different risk status.","['Niu, Ping', 'Yao, Baozhen', 'Wei, Li', 'Zhu, Hengbo', 'Fang, Congcong', 'Zhao, Yueqiang']","['Niu P', 'Yao B', 'Wei L', 'Zhu H', 'Fang C', 'Zhao Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Plastic Surgery, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, Hubei Province, China.

We collected retrospective data of 355 consecutive AML patients (>/=60 years) who were treated with intensive chemotherapy (IC) (n = 155), hypomethylating agents (HMA) (n = 83), or best supportive care (BSC) (n = 117) between 2002 and 2017. Overall survival (OS) and response rates after therapy were analyzed. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to analyze the impact of different treatment strategies on survival. The median OS was not significantly different between patients treated with IC or HMA (14.9 vs 10.9 months; HR = 1.32, p = 0.076)), despite a difference in complete remission rate (59% after IC vs 35% after HMA). Patients who received a allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT) after treatment with IC or HMA had a significant survival benefit compared to patient who didn't proceed to allo HCT (median OS 65 vs 8 months, respectively, p < 0.001). The type of induction therapy (i.e. IC or HMA) did not impact on survival after allo HCT (48 vs 65 months, respectively, p = 0.440). In conclusion, consolidation with an allo HCT provides a significant benefit for older AML patients independent of upfront treatment with IC or HMA. Our data suggest that more older patients should be considered for an allo HCT.","['Hilberink, Jacobien', 'Hazenberg, Carin', 'van den Berg, Eva', 'Mulder, Andre', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'van der Helm, Lieke', 'de Groot, Marco', 'Choi, Goda', 'de Bock, Geertruida H', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Huls, Gerwin']","['Hilberink J', 'Hazenberg C', 'van den Berg E', 'Mulder A', 'Schuringa JJ', 'van der Helm L', 'de Groot M', 'Choi G', 'de Bock GH', 'Vellenga E', 'Ammatuna E', 'Huls G']","['Department of Haematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9713 GZ, the Netherlands.

It has various pharmacological effects, such as antioxidation, anti-aging, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, antiobesity, anti-diabetes, cardioprotection, neuroprotection. Recently, anti-leukemia activities of resveratrol has been studied extensively via its effects on a variety of biological processes involving cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy. Current treatments of leukemia mainly rely on intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, however, these treatments are still with poor survival and high treatment-related mortality.

PRELIC study.,24-30,S1879-4068(18)30462-4 [pii] 10.1016/j.jgo.2019.03.010 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: To explore the preferences of Spanish healthcare professionals (haematologists and hospital pharmacists) for the treatment selection of active Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) patients at first relapse, condition that mainly afflicts older adults. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among haematologists and hospital pharmacists. A literature review and a focus group informed the DCE design. CLL treatment settings were defined by seven attributes: four patient/disease-related attributes (age, functional status, comorbidities, and risk of the disease) and three treatment-related attributes (efficacy [hazard ratio of progression-free survival, HR-PFS], rate of discontinuations due to adverse events and cost). A mixed-logit model was used to determine choice-based preferences. Relative importance (RI) of attributes was calculated and compared between stakeholders. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) was estimated through the DCE. Besides, nine ad-hoc questions were posed, to explore more in depth CLL treatment decision making. RESULTS: A total of 130 participants (72 haematologists and 58 hospital pharmacists) answered the DCE. All attributes were significant predictors of preferences (p<0.05) in the multinomial model. Higher RI was obtained for treatment-related attributes: the highest rated being 'cost' (23.8%) followed by 'efficacy' (20.9%). Regarding patient-related attributes, the highest RI was obtained for 'age' (18.1%). No significant differences (p>0.05) in RI between haematologists and pharmacists were found. WTP for the treatment was higher for younger CLL patients. Ad-hoc questions showed that patient age and functional status influence treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS: For healthcare professionals, 'cost' and 'efficacy' (treatment-related attributes) and age (patient-related attribute) are the main factors that determine CLL treatment selection at first relapse. WTP decreases as patient's age increases.","['Boque, Concepcion', 'Abad, Maria Reyes', 'Agustin, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Goni, Manuel', 'Moreno, Carolina', 'Gabas-Rivera, Clara', 'Granados, Enrique', 'Castro-Gomez, Antonio', 'Pardo, Carlos', 'Lizan, Luis']","['Boque C', 'Abad MR', 'Agustin MJ', 'Garcia-Goni M', 'Moreno C', 'Gabas-Rivera C', 'Granados E', 'Castro-Gomez A', 'Pardo C', 'Lizan L']","['Instituto Catalan de Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Santa Creu y Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Outcomes'10, Castellon, Spain.

In the present study, we found that homoharringtonine (HHT), a protein translation inhibitor of plant alkaloid in China, exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against FLT3-ITD (+) cell lines and primary leukemia cells, and a remarkable synergistic anti-leukemia action was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mouse models when co-treated with the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor IPI504. Mechanistically, HHT combined with IPI504 synergistically inhibited the growth of leukemia cells by inducing apoptosis and G1 phase arrest. This synergistic action resulted in a prominent reduction of total and phosphorylated FLT3 (p-FLT3) as well as inhibition of its downstream signaling molecules such as STAT5, AKT, ERK and 4E-BP1. Furthermore, co-treatment of HHT and IPI504 led to a synergistic or additive effect on 55.56%(10/18) of acute myeloid leukemia cases tested, including three relapsed/refractory patients. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the combination of HHT and HSP90 inhibitor provides an alternative way for the treatment of FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia, especially for relapsed/refractory AML.","['Wu, Zhaoxing', 'Zhuang, Haifeng', 'Yu, Qingfeng', 'Zhang, Xuzhao', 'Jiang, Xudong', 'Lu, Xiaoya', 'Xu, Ying', 'Yang, Linlin', 'Wu, Bowen', 'Ma, An', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Xiao, Xibin', 'Liang, Yun', 'Gao, Ruilan', 'Shen, Jianping', 'Xu, Rongzhen']","['Wu Z', 'Zhuang H', 'Yu Q', 'Zhang X', 'Jiang X', 'Lu X', 'Xu Y', 'Yang L', 'Wu B', 'Ma A', 'Zhang L', 'Xiao X', 'Liang Y', 'Gao R', 'Shen J', 'Xu R']","['Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China; Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China; Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China; Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China; Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China; Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China; Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China; Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310009, China.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the therapeutic effects of ZGP on the treatment of POF induced by chemotherapy, and elucidate the potential molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (N=54) were randomized to six groups, containing the Control group, Model group, three ZGP groups and Triptorelin group which was served as a positive control. The Triptorelin group received triptorelin injection ten days before model establishment by cyclophosphamide. The three ZGP groups (high dose group, medium dose group and low dose group) were given a daily intragastric administration of ZGP at doses of 3.2, 1.6 and 0.8g/kg for sixty days. We observed the general growth of rats and examed the estrous cycle and the rate of pregnancy, ovarian ultrastructures, follicles and corpora lutea numbers. The serum hormone concentrations were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To explore the molecular mechanism of the effect, gene and protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and Cyt-c related to apoptosis were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), Western Blot and Immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. RESULTS: After treating with ZGP, though the rate of pregnancy showed no significant difference, the estrous cycle, ovarian ultrastructures, numbers of follicles and corpora lutea were improved significantly. And ZGP led to a significant lower concentration of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the serum, and the concentration of oestradiol (E2) was increased. Furthermore, a significant downregulation of Bax, cytochrome c (Cyt-c), and upregulation of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) both on gene and protein levels were observed after the administration with ZGP.

The successful development of any new drug relies on adequate safety testing including preclinical toxicology studies. Selection of an appropriate preclinical species requires a thorough understanding of the compound's metabolic clearance and pathways, as well as other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. In addition, elucidation of the metabolising enzymes in human facilitates improved clinical prediction based on population pharmacokinetics and can inform drug-drug interaction studies. Intrinsic clearance (CLint) determination and metabolite profiling of CCT241736 in human and four preclinical species (dog, minipig, rat and mouse) was undertaken in cryopreserved hepatocytes and liver microsomes. Recombinant human cytochrome P450 bactosomes (rCYP) were utilised to provide reaction phenotyping data and support prediction of metabolic pathways. CCT241736 exhibited low CLint in both hepatocytes and liver microsomes of human, dog, minipig and rat, but considerably higher CLint in mouse. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were identified as the major enzymes responsible for biotransformation of CCT241736 in human, exclusively forming five out of seven metabolites. Minipig showed greatest similarity to human with regard to both overall metabolic profile and abundance of specific metabolites relative to parent compound, and is therefore proposed as the most appropriate toxicological species. The greatest disparity was observed between human and dog. Based on metabolic profile, either mouse or rat is a suitable rodent species for toxicology studies.","['Wood, Francesca L', 'Shepherd, Sam', 'Hayes, Angela', 'Liu, Manjuan', 'Grira, Katia', 'Mok, Yi', 'Atrash, Butrus', 'Faisal, Amir', 'Bavetsias, Vassilios', 'Linardopoulos, Spiros', 'Blagg, Julian', 'Raynaud, Florence I']","['Wood FL', 'Shepherd S', 'Hayes A', 'Liu M', 'Grira K', 'Mok Y', 'Atrash B', 'Faisal A', 'Bavetsias V', 'Linardopoulos S', 'Blagg J', 'Raynaud FI']","['Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.

FLT3 inhibitors have been developed, but have had limited clinical efficacy due to development of resistance, highlighting the need for better understanding of the function of FLT3-ITD and how to target it more effectively using novel combination strategies. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown efficacy in cancers with impaired homologous recombination (HR) due to BRCA mutations, but PARP inhibitor efficacy has not been fully explored in BRCA-proficient cancers, including AML. Recent research has connected inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling to downregulation of numerous DNA repair proteins, including those involved in HR, and the novel combination with PARP inhibitors induces synthetic lethality in AML. Additionally, PARP inhibitor therapy may also target the highly error-prone alternative non-homologous end-joining (ALT NHEJ) DNA repair pathway in which PARP participates, thereby decreasing genomic instability and development of therapy resistance. Therefore, PARP inhibitors may be attractive therapeutic agents in combination with FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD AML.","['Dellomo, Anna J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Rassool, Feyruz V']","['Dellomo AJ', 'Baer MR', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA; University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA; University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA; Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, 20201, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA; University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.

Although considered a stem cell disease, little is known about MCL-propagating neoplastic stem cells. We here describe that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in MCL reside within a CD34(+)/CD38(-) fraction of the clone. Whereas highly purified CD34(+)/CD38( horizontal line ) cells engrafted NSGhSCF mice with fully manifesting MCL, no MCL was produced by CD34(+)/CD38(+) progenitors or the bulk of KIT(+)/CD34(-) mast cells. CD34(+)/CD38(-) MCL cells invariably expressed CD13 and CD133, and often also IL-1RAP, but did not express CD25, CD26 or CLL-1. CD34(+)/CD38(-) MCL cells also displayed several surface targets, including CD33, which was homogenously expressed on MCL LSCs in all cases, and the D816V mutant form of KIT. Although CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells were resistant against single drugs, exposure to combinations of CD33-targeting and KIT-targeting drugs resulted in LSC-depletion and markedly reduced engraftment in NSGhSCF mice. Together, MCL LSCs are CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells that express distinct profiles of markers and target antigens. Characterization of MCL LSCs should facilitate their purification and should support the development of LSC-eradicating curative treatment approaches in this fatal type of leukemia.","['Eisenwort,

We used microarray to compare T-LBL tissue samples (n = 75) and fetal thymus tissues (n = 20), and identified 35 differentially expressed miRNAs. Using 107 subjects as the training group, we developed a five-miRNA-based classifier to predict patient survival with LASSO Cox regression: lower risk was associated with better prognosis (disease-free survival (DFS): hazard ratio (HR) 4.548, 95% CI 2.433-8.499, p < 0.001; overall survival (OS): HR 5.030, 95% CI 2.407-10.513, p < 0.001). This classifier displayed good performance in the internal testing set (n = 106) and the independent external set (n = 304). High risk was associated with more favorable response to HSCT (DFS: HR 1.675, 95% CI 1.127-2.488, p = 0.011; OS: HR 1.602, 95% CI 1.055-2.433, p = 0.027). When combined with ECOG-PS and/or NOTCH1/FBXW7 status, this classifier had even better prognostic performance in patients receiving HSCT (DFS: HR 2.088, 95% CI 1.290-3.379, p = 0.003; OS: HR 1.996, 95% CI 1.203-3.311, p = 0.007). The five-miRNA classifier may be a useful prognostic biomarker for T-LBL adults, and could identify subjects who could benefit from HSCT.","['Tian, Xiao-Peng', 'Huang, Wei-Juan', 'Huang, Hui-Qiang',

Although promising improvements have been recently achieved, one third of patients experience relapse or refractory T-LBL. Therefore, optimal strategies for identifying high-risk patients are urgently needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 75 newly diagnosed adult patients (aged >/=15 years) with T-LBL were identified and the predictive value of complete blood count (CBC) abnormalities, including lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on clinical outcomes, was analyzed. RESULTS: Using the receiver operating characteristic curve to determine the best cutoff values based on survival, it was found that patients with T-LBL with LMR </=2.8, NLR >/=3.3, and PLR >/=200 had both inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and inferior overall survival (OS), in which the differences were much more remarkable in the international prognostic index score 0-2 subgroup. In the multivariable analysis, NLR >/=3.3 together with age >40 years and central nervous system (CNS) involvement were identified to be independently associated with shortened PFS, whereas PLR >/=200 and CNS involvement were identified to be independent risk factors for OS. LMR, NLR, and PLR were integrated to generate a ""CBC score"" model, which well separated adult patients with T-LBL into three risk groups, and the 3-year OS was 84%, 53%, and 30% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, a ""CBC score"" model was initially promoted for stratification in adult patients with T-LBL using simple, widely available, and easy to interpret parameters in the largest adult T-LBL cohort to date. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Optimal strategies for identifying high-risk patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) are urgently needed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 17,504 men and women (>/=18 years of age) registered in the National Cancer Database who were diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2013 and had follow-up to the end of 2014, were analyzed. The primary predictor variable was treatment received, and overall survival was the outcome variable. Additional variables addressed and adjusted included gender, age, race, Charleston Comorbidity Index, level of education, income, insurance, distance traveled, facility type and diagnosing/treating facility. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 48.8 years with a standard deviation of 19.3 years. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for secondary predictor variables, treatment modality was a statistically significant predictor of overall survival from ALL. Relative to patients who were treated with chemotherapy only, the patients who got chemotherapy and stem cell transplant had a decreased risk of mortality by 39%. Of the 5,409 patients between the ages of 18 and 39 years i.e. adolescent and young adults (AYA), no statistically significant survival difference was found between patients treated with stem cell transplant and those not. CONCLUSION: Stem cell transplant led to improved survival for all age groups except the AYA.","['Master, Samip', 'Koshy, Nebu', 'Mansour, Richard', 'Shi, Runhua']","['Master S', 'Koshy N', 'Mansour R', 'Shi R']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Science Center, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Science Center, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Science Center, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Science Center, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A. rshi@lsuhsc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'adolescent and young adults (AYA) ALL', 'stem cell transplant']",,2019/04/07 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2019/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['39/4/1899 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13298 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Apr;39(4):1899-1906. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13298.,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-HSCT relapse is a common cause of mortality, and complications such as chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) are debilitating and life-threatening. To compare post-HSCT outcomes of different donor sources, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive transplants performed in several international centers from 2005 to 2015. A total of 317 patients were studied: 19% matched sibling donor (MSD), 23% matched unrelated donor (MUD), 39% umbilical cord blood (UCB), and 19% double UCB (dUCB) recipients. The median age at transplant was 10 years (range, 0.42-21 years), and median follow-up was 4.74 years (range, 4.02-5.39 years). Comparisons were made while controlling for patient, transplant, and disease characteristics. There were no differences in relapse, leukemia-free survival, or nonrelapse mortality. dUCB recipients had inferior survival compared with matched sibling recipients, but all other comparisons showed similar overall survival. Despite the majority of UCB transplants being HLA mismatched, the rates of cGVHD were low, especially compared with the well-matched MUD recipients (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.67; P = .02). The composite measure of cGVHD and leukemia-free survival (cGVHD-LFS), which represents both the quality of life and risk for mortality, was significantly better in the UCB compared with the MUD recipients (HR, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-1; P = .03). In summary, the use of UCB is an excellent donor choice for pediatric patients with AML when a matched sibling cannot be identified.","['Keating, Amy K', 'Langenhorst, Jurgen', 'Wagner, John E', 'Page, Kristin M', 'Veys, Paul', 'Wynn, Robert F', 'Stefanski, Heather', 'Elfeky, Reem', 'Giller, Roger', 'Mitchell, Richard', 'Milano, Filippo', ""O'Brien, Tracey A"", 'Dahlberg, Ann', 'Delaney, Colleen', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Boelens, Jaap Jan']","['Keating AK', 'Langenhorst J', 'Wagner JE', 'Page KM', 'Veys P', 'Wynn RF', 'Stefanski H', 'Elfeky R', 'Giller R', 'Mitchell R', 'Milano F', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Dahlberg A', 'Delaney C', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Verneris MR', 'Boelens JJ']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Division, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.', 'Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom."", 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.', ""Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""School of Women & Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', ""Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""School of Women & Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Division, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*standards', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pediatrics/*methods', 'Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6457227,,,,2019/04/07 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018025908 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025908 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 9;3(7):1118-1128. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025908.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4187-8456', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2232-6952']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,['Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 24;4(6):1081.

However, only 11% of hematological malignancies have mutant p53. Mechanisms that cause wild-type p53 dysfunction and promote leukemia are inadequately deciphered. The stem cell protein Asrij/OCIAD1 is misexpressed in several human hematological malignancies and implicated in the p53 pathway and DNA damage response. However, Asrij function in vertebrate hematopoiesis remains unknown. We generated the first asrij null (knockout [KO]) mice and show that they are viable and fertile with no gross abnormalities. However, by 6 months, they exhibit increased peripheral blood cell counts, splenomegaly, and an expansion of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with higher myeloid output. HSCs lacking Asrij are less quiescent and more proliferative with higher repopulation potential as observed from serial transplantation studies. However, stressing KO mice with sublethal gamma irradiation or multiple injections of 5-fluorouracil results in reduced survival and rapid depletion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) by driving them into proliferative exhaustion. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed increased polyubiquitinated protein levels, Akt/STAT5 activation and COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (CSN5)-mediated p53 ubiquitination, and degradation in KO HSPCs. Further, we show that Asrij sequesters CSN5 via its conserved OCIA domain, thereby preventing p53 degradation. In agreement, Nutlin-3 treatment of KO mice restored p53 levels and reduced high HSPC frequencies. Thus, we provide a new mouse model resembling myeloproliferative disease and identify a posttranslational regulator of wild-type p53 essential for maintaining HSC quiescence that could be a potential target for pharmacological intervention.","['Sinha, Saloni', 'Dwivedi, Tirath Raj', 'Yengkhom, Roja', 'Bheemsetty, Venkata Anudeep', 'Abe, Takaya', 'Kiyonari, Hiroshi', 'VijayRaghavan, K', 'Inamdar, Maneesha S']","['Sinha S', 'Dwivedi TR', 'Yengkhom R', 'Bheemsetty VA', 'Abe T', 'Kiyonari H', 'VijayRaghavan K', 'Inamdar MS']","['Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India.', 'Genetic Engineering Team and.', 'Genetic Engineering Team and.', 'Animal Resource Development Unit, RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Kobe, Japan.', 'National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India; and.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India.', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Gandhi Krishi Vignana Kendra, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190405,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Emi2 protein, mouse)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (Trp53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.-.- (Cops5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (COP9 Signalosome Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COP9 Signalosome Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,2019/04/07 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2019/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42517-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000530 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 May 30;133(22):2385-2400. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000530.

Carfilzomib, a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, has clinical efficacy even among bortezomib-refractory patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a phase I/II trial of carfilzomib, PLD, and dexamethasone (KDD) with the primary endpoints being safety and efficacy (NCT01246063). Twenty-three patients were enrolled in the phase I portion and the MTD of carfilzomib was determined to be 56 mg/m(2) (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16) when combined with PLD (30 mg/m(2) on day 8) and dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16). Seventeen additional patients were enrolled in the phase II portion. RESULTS: KDD was determined to be well tolerated with the only common grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events of infection. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity included lymphopenia (63%), thrombocytopenia (40%), anemia (40%), and neutropenia (28%). In the cohort of patients treated at the MTD, where median prior therapies were 2% and 42% were refractory to bortezomib, the overall response rate was 83% (20/24) with 54% (13/24) having a very good partial response or better. The median progression-free survival was 13.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-21.7). CONCLUSIONS: This trial is the first to report outcomes using a triplet regimen of high-dose carfilzomib. KDD was well tolerated and appears efficacious in RRMM. Additional study is needed to more precisely determine patient outcomes with this regimen and its utility compared with other carfilzomib containing salvage regimens.","['Schroeder, Mark A', 'Fiala, Mark A', 'Huselton, Eric', 'Cardone, Michael H', 'Jaeger, Savina', 'Jean, Sae Rin', 'Shea, Kathryn', 'Ghobadi, Armin', 'Wildes, Tanya', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith E', 'Vij, Ravi']","['Schroeder MA', 'Fiala MA', 'Huselton E', 'Cardone MH', 'Jaeger S', 'Jean SR', 'Shea K', 'Ghobadi A', 'Wildes T', 'Stockerl-Goldstein KE', 'Vij R']","['BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri. markschroeder@wustl.edu.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'Hematology/Oncology Division, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.', 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190405,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (liposomal doxorubicin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6606335,,,,2019/04/07 06:00,2020/08/06 06:00,['2019/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-1909 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1909 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 1;25(13):3776-3783. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1909.

TP53 mutations found in cancers disrupt ASPP2 binding, arguing for an important role of ASPP2 in TP53-mediated tumor suppression. We now identify an oncogenic splicing variant, ASPP2kappa, with high prevalence in acute leukemia. METHODS: An mRNA screen to detect ASPP2 splicing variants was performed and ASPP2kappa was validated using isoform-specific PCR approaches. Translation into a genuine protein isoform was evaluated after establishing epitope-specific antibodies. For functional studies cell models with forced expression of ASPP2kappa or isoform-specific ASPP2kappa-interference were created to evaluate proliferative, apoptotic and oncogenic characteristics of ASPP2kappa. FINDINGS: Exon skipping generates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated C-terminus, omitting the TP53-binding sites. ASPP2kappa translates into a dominant-negative protein variant impairing TP53-dependent induction of apoptosis. ASPP2kappa is expressed in CD34+ leukemic progenitor cells and functional studies argue for a role in early oncogenesis, resulting in perturbed proliferation and impaired induction of apoptosis, mitotic failure and chromosomal instability (CIN) - similar to TP53 mutations. Importantly, as expression of ASPP2kappa is stress-inducible it defines a novel class of dynamic oncogenes not represented by genomic mutations. INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrates that ASPP2kappa plays a distinctive role as an antiapoptotic regulator of the TP53 checkpoint, rendering cells to a more aggressive phenotype as evidenced by proliferation and apoptosis rates - and ASPP2kappa expression results in acquisition of genomic mutations, a first initiating step in leukemogenesis. We provide proof-of-concept to establish ASPP2kappa as a clinically relevant biomarker and a target for molecule-defined therapy.

However, early achievement of full donor chimerism (FDC) and relapse remain challenging. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have been shown to have antitumor cytotoxicity. Infusion of donor-derived CIK cells has been studied for hematologic malignancies relapsed after allo-HCT but has not been evaluated as post-transplant consolidation. In this phase II study, we prospectively studied whether a one-time infusion of 1x10(8)/kg CD3(+) donor-derived CIK cells administered between day +21 and day +35 after TLI-ATG conditioning could improve achievement of FDC by day +90 and 2-year clinical outcomes in patients with myeloid neoplasms. CIK cells, containing predominantly CD3(+)CD8(+)NKG2D(+) cells along with significantly expanded CD3(+)CD56(+) cells, were infused in 31 of 44 patients. Study outcomes were compared to outcomes of a retrospective historical cohort of 100 patients. We found that this one-time CIK infusion did not increase the rate of FDC by day +90. On an intention-to-treat analysis, 2-year non-relapse mortality (6.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0-14.5%), event-free survival (27.3%; 95% CI, 16.8-44.2%), and overall survival (50.6%; 95% CI, 37.5-68.2%) were similar to the values seen in the historical cohort. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease at 1-year was 25.1% (95% CI, 12-38.2%). On univariate analysis, the presence of monosomal or complex karyotype was adversely associated with relapse-free survival and overall survival. Given the favorable safety profile of CIK cell infusion, strategies such as repeat dosing or genetic modification merit exploration.

Sarcopenia (low muscle mass) is associated with physical disability and premature mortality in individuals with nonmalignant diseases and may be a predictor of NRM and poor overall survival in patients undergoing HCT. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 859 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent a first HCT as adults (>/=18 years) between 2007 and 2014. Sarcopenia was assessed from pre-HCT abdominal computed tomography scans. Two-year cumulative incidence of NRM was calculated, with relapse/progression considered as a competing risk event. Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard ratio estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained and adjusted for relevant covariates. Kaplan-Meier method was used to examine overall survival. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Median age at HCT was 51 years (range = 18-74 years); 52.5% had a high [>/=3] HCT-comorbidity index; 33.7% had sarcopenia pre-HCT. Sarcopenia was an independent predictor of higher NRM risk (hazard ratio = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.16 to 2.16) compared with patients who were not. The 2-year incidence of NRM approached 30% in patients with sarcopenia and high (>/=3) HCT-comorbidity index. Patients with sarcopenia had on average a longer hospitalization (37.2 days vs 31.5 days, P < .001) and inferior overall survival at 2 years (55.2%, 95% CI = 49.5% to 61.0% vs 66.9%, 95% CI = 63.0% to 70.8%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is an important and independent predictor of survival after HCT, with potential additional downstream impacts on health-economic outcomes. This information can be used to facilitate treatment decisions prior to HCT and guide interventions to decrease the risk of treatment-related complications after HCT.","['Armenian, Saro H', 'Xiao, Meisi', 'Berano Teh, Jennifer', 'Lee, Brandyn', 'Chang, Howard A', 'Mascarenhas, Kristen', 'Lee, Sean', 'Iukuridze, Alex', 'Xie, Jack J', 'Scott, Jessica M', 'Jones, Lee W', 'Lennie Wong, F', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro']","['Armenian SH', 'Xiao M', 'Berano Teh J', 'Lee B', 'Chang HA', 'Mascarenhas K', 'Lee S', 'Iukuridze A', 'Xie JJ', 'Scott JM', 'Jones LW', 'Lennie Wong F', 'Forman SJ', 'Nakamura R']","[""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations."", ""See the Notes section for the full list of authors' affiliations.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcopenia/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6695315,,,,2019/04/06 06:00,2020/06/10 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['5320048 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djy231 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Aug 1;111(8):837-844. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djy231.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), a histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, plays an important role in the progressions of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemias and has been validated as a potential therapeutic target. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a novel DOT1L inhibitor, massonianoside B (MA), by pharmacophore-based in silico screening and biological studies. MA is a structurally unique natural product inhibitor of DOT1L with an IC50 value of 399 nM. The compound displays high selectivity for DOT1L over other S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent PMTs. Treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells with MA gives a dose-dependent reduction in cellular levels of histone lysine 79 mono- and dimethylation without affecting the methylation of other histone sites. Moreover, MA selectively inhibits proliferation and causes apoptosis in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells and downregulates the expression of MLL fusion target genes, including HOXA9 and MEIS1. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MA may bind to the SAM-binding site of DOT1L. We identified MA as not only a novel DOT1L inhibitor with antileukemic activity but also a DOT1L-targeted molecular probe that may serve as a useful chemical tool for investigating the role of DOT1L in biological processes.","['Chen, Jie', 'Park, Hyun-Ju']","['Chen J', 'Park HJ']","['School of Pharmacy , Sungkyunkwan University , Suwon , Gyeonggi-do 16419 , South Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy , Sungkyunkwan University , Suwon , Gyeonggi-do 16419 , South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190416,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (massonianoside B)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzofurans/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mannose/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/drug effects']",,,,,2019/04/06 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.8b00933 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2019 May 17;14(5):873-881. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00933.

Studies have proven the effectiveness of IFN-alpha in the treatment of ophthalmic disorders involving the anterior segment of the eye (conjunctival papilloma, squamous neoplasia, conjunctival mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, Mooren's ulcer, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis) and the posterior segment of the eye (serpiginous choroidopathy, posterior uveitis, pseudophakic and diabetic cystoid macular edema, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy). The therapy with IFN-alpha remains a promising alternative in cases of a failing response to conventional therapy, helping to maintain or improve visual acuity, prevent vision loss, and ameliorate the prognosis of the patient. However, clinicians who decide to use IFN-alpha in their patients must be aware of general and ophthalmological side effects and inform their patients to undergo a systemic evaluation such as a physical examination, blood and serological tests, and a chest X-ray before the beginning of treatment. This review presents the current knowledge of the use of IFN-alpha, its efficacy, and properties in ophthalmological diseases, and thus may encourage clinicians to administer this drug as a treatment modality in ophthalmological diseases in the future.","['Lewczuk, Natalia', 'Zdebik, Alexander', 'Boguslawska, Joanna']","['Lewczuk N', 'Zdebik A', 'Boguslawska J']","['1 Department and Clinic of Ophthalmology, University of Wroclaw Medical College, Wroclaw, Poland.', '2 Department and Clinic of Dermatology and Allergology, Asklepios Nordseeklinik GmbH, Sylt, Germany.', '1 Department and Clinic of Ophthalmology, University of Wroclaw Medical College, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190405,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'G8RGG88B68 (peginterferon alfa-2b)', 'Q46947FE7K (peginterferon alfa-2a)']",IM,"['Eye Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Ophthalmology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Behcet's uveitis"", '*conjunctival papilloma', '*immunomodulation by interferons', '*interferon alpha', '*interferon beta', '*ocular surface squamous neoplasia', '*proliferative diabetic retinopathy', '*serpiginous choroidopathy']",,2019/04/06 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.2018.0125 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2019 May;39(5):259-272. doi: 10.1089/jir.2018.0125.

VolSurf+ physicochemical descriptors take into account several cationic structural features of ILs such as heterocyclic aromatic and non-aromatic cationic cores, alkyl chain length, presence of oxygen atoms in the substituents as well as the properties of a wide variety of inorganic and organic anions. Combination of these cation and anion PPs can provide descriptors for over 8000 ILs, thus allowing the development of QSPR models for IL cytotoxicity (IPC-81 rat cell line) and enzyme toxicity (acetylcholinesterase inhibition). The adoption of a Partial Least Squares approach, relating PPs and toxicities, provided affordable predictions for ILs in both learning and external validation sets, implying the possibility to extend the predictive model to a set of 520 ILs. This allows us to establish priorities in selecting ILs for experimental hazard assessment as required by the REACH regulation.","['Paterno, A', 'Bocci, G', 'Cruciani, G', 'Fortuna, C G', 'Goracci, L', 'Scire, S', 'Musumarra, G']","['Paterno A', 'Bocci G', 'Cruciani G', 'Fortuna CG', 'Goracci L', 'Scire S', 'Musumarra G']","['a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche , Universita di Catania , Catania , Italy.', 'b Laboratorio di Chemiometria e Chemioinformatica, Dipartimento di Chimica , Universita di Perugia , Italy.', 'b Laboratorio di Chemiometria e Chemioinformatica, Dipartimento di Chimica , Universita di Perugia , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche , Universita di Catania , Catania , Italy.', 'b Laboratorio di Chemiometria e Chemioinformatica, Dipartimento di Chimica , Universita di Perugia , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche , Universita di Catania , Catania , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche , Universita di Catania , Catania , Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,SAR QSAR Environ Res,SAR and QSAR in environmental research,9440156,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IPC-81 leukaemia cell lines', 'Principal properties', 'QSPR', 'acetylcholinesterase inhibition', 'ionic liquids', 'physicochemical descriptors']",,2016/03/01 00:00,2016/03/01 00:01,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/1062936X.2016.1156571 [doi]'],ppublish,SAR QSAR Environ Res. 2016 Mar;27(3):221-244. doi: 10.1080/1062936X.2016.1156571.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best DMR level by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for TKI discontinuation is still a matter of debate. To compare the accuracy of digital PCR (dPCR) and RT-qPCR for BCR-ABL1 transcript levels detection, 142 CML patients were monitored for a median time of 24 months. Digital PCR detected BCR-ABL1 transcripts in the RT-qPCR undetectable cases. The dPCR analysis of the samples, grouped by the MR classes, revealed a significant difference between MR(4.0) and MR(4.5) (P = 0.0104) or MR(5.0) (P = 0.0032). The clinical and hematological characteristics of the patients grouped according to DMR classes (MR(4.0) vs MR(4.5-5.0) ) were superimposable. Conversely, patients with dPCR values <0.468 BCR-ABL1 copies/microL (as we previously described) showed a longer DMR duration (P = 0.0220) and mainly belonged to MR(4.5-5.0) (P = 0.0442) classes compared to patients with higher dPCR values. Among the 142 patients, 111 (78%) discontinued the TKI treatment; among the 111 patients, 24 (22%) lost the MR(3.0) or MR(4.0) . RT-qPCR was not able to discriminate patients with higher risk of MR loss after discontinuation (P = 0.8100). On the contrary, according to dPCR, 12/25 (48%) patients with BCR-ABL1 values >/=0.468 and 12/86 (14%) patients with BCR-ABL1 values <0.468 lost DMR in this cohort, respectively (P = 0.0003). Treatment-free remission of patients who discontinued TKI with a dPCR <0.468 was significantly higher compared to patients with dPCR >/= 0.468 (TFR at 2 years 83% vs 52% P = 0.0017, respectively). In conclusion, dPCR resulted in an improved recognition of stable DMR and of candidates to TKI discontinuation.","['Bernardi, Simona', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Zanaglio, Camilla', 'Polverelli, Nicola', 'Dereli Eke, Elif', ""D'Adda, Mariella"", 'Farina, Mirko', 'Bucelli, Cristina', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Toffoletti, Eleonora', 'Deambrogi, Clara', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Franceschini, Luca', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Divona, Maria Domenica', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Russo, Domenico']","['Bernardi S', 'Malagola M', 'Zanaglio C', 'Polverelli N', 'Dereli Eke E', ""D'Adda M"", 'Farina M', 'Bucelli C', 'Scaffidi L', 'Toffoletti E', 'Deambrogi C', 'Stagno F', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Franceschini L', 'Abruzzese E', 'Divona MD', 'Gobbi M', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Gaidano G', 'Tiribelli M', 'Bonifacio M', 'Cattaneo C', 'Iurlo A', 'Russo D']","['Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'CREA Laboratory (Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica AIL), ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'CREA Laboratory (Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica AIL), ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'CREA Laboratory (Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica AIL), ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', ""Hematology Division, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda-Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medical Area, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Hematology Section and BMT Unit, Rodolico Hospital, A.O.U.

METHODS: The neonate, who was suspected for Down syndrome, was analyzed in terms of clinical feature, peripheral blood cell morphology, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunological classification and other laboratory tests. On hundred and fourteen leukemia-related genes were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS). RESULTS: Laboratory test revealed obvious abnormal liver function and coagulation function, anemia, and extreme leukocytosis. Cell smear indicated significantly increased progenitor cells, which conformed to proliferation of megakaryocytes. FISH showed trisomy 21. By NGS, c.220+dupT, a novel mutation, was identified in exon 2 of the GATA1 gene, which encodes a N-terminal activation domain and has a frequency of 95.8%. No mutation was identified among the remaining 113 genes. CONCLUSION: The neonate had DS and GATA1 gene mutation. High percentage of circulating blasts should be considered as transient myelodysplasia but not congenital leukemia.","['Zheng, Rui', 'Zhang, Weiqing', 'Chen, Baoguo', 'Shen, Zhiying', 'Lin, Aifen']","['Zheng R', 'Zhang W', 'Chen B', 'Shen Z', 'Lin A']","['Central Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital, Linhai, Zhejiang 317000, China.

It is approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is being investigated for other hematological malignancies. Venetoclax is predominantly eliminated by the liver; therefore, there is a need to investigate the effect of hepatic insufficiency on venetoclax pharmacokinetics. METHODS: A phase I study was carried out in 24 women with normal hepatic function or mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (based on Child-Pugh scores), who received a single 50 mg dose of venetoclax with a low-fat meal. Blood samples were collected up to 120 h after venetoclax administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental methods. RESULTS: Venetoclax maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment were similar to subjects with normal hepatic function. Mean venetoclax AUC in subjects with severe hepatic impairment was 2.3- to 2.7-fold higher than in subjects with normal hepatic function. The half-life of venetoclax in subjects with severe hepatic impairment was approximately two-fold longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Unbound fractions of venetoclax in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were similar to the subjects with normal hepatic function. No significant adverse safety events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: No venetoclax dosage adjustment is required in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment, a 50% dose reduction of venetoclax is recommended to account for higher exposures and the longer half-life.","['Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Dave, Nimita', 'Marbury, Thomas', 'Hu, Beibei', 'Miles, Dale', 'Agarwal, Suresh K', 'Bueno, Orlando F', 'Menon, Rajeev M']","['Salem AH', 'Dave N', 'Marbury T', 'Hu B', 'Miles D', 'Agarwal SK', 'Bueno OF', 'Menon RM']","['AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA. ahmed.salem@abbvie.com.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. ahmed.salem@abbvie.com.', 'AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Orlando Clinical Research Center, Orlando, FL, 32809-3017, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, 94080, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Hepatic Insufficiency/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Safety', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",,,,,2019/04/06 06:00,2020/08/07 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-019-00746-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-019-00746-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2019 Aug;58(8):1091-1100. doi: 10.1007/s40262-019-00746-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the incidence of PCL is relatively low, our case report study presents a rare opportunity to describe the clinical and pathological characteristics of this leukemia, as well as different modalities of treatment and outcomes of primary PCL (pPCL). CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension complained of pain in the left flank area which started four months prior to admission. On admission, his vital signs were stable, and physical examination was completely benign. Laboratory evaluation showed hemoglobin of 5.1 g/dL, white blood cell count of 6.6 cells per cubic millimeter with 16% atypical lymphocytes, and platelet count of 51000 per microliter. Peripheral smear showed more than 10%-15% of plasma cells (Figure 1), and flow cytometry of peripheral blood confirmed PCL with 24% plasma cells CD138+. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 80% plasma cells (38+, 138+, 117+, 10-, 19-, 20-, 56-) with 90% cellularity. The Oncology team was consulted, and VCD therapy was started. After completing therapy at 1, 4, 8, and 11 d, the patient was discharged home. The patient was being considered for a bone marrow transplant evaluation within two months of discharge. CONCLUSION: PCL is a rare and aggressive form of leukemia with a poor prognosis. Multi-center studies and clinical trials should be conducted to develop accurate criteria for the initial diagnosis and prompt treatment of this disease.","['Jain, Akriti G', 'Faisal-Uddin, Mohammed', 'Khan, Abdul K', 'Wazir, Mohammed', 'Shen, Qi', 'Manoucheri, Manoucher']","['Jain AG', 'Faisal-Uddin M', 'Khan AK', 'Wazir M', 'Shen Q', 'Manoucheri M']","['Internal Medicine, Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL 32804, United States. akriti.jain@adventhealth.com.', 'Deccan College of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana 500058, India.', 'Internal Medicine, Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL 32804, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL 32804, United States.', 'Central Florida Pathology Associates, Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL 32804, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL 32804, United States.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,World J Clin Oncol,World journal of clinical oncology,101549149,,,,PMC6441660,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogenic transplantation', 'Case report', 'Chemotherapy', 'Primary plasma cell leukemia', 'Rare leukemia', 'Secondary plasma cell leukemia']","['Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors state that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",2019/04/06 06:00,2019/04/06 06:01,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5306/wjco.v10.i3.161 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Oncol. 2019 Mar 24;10(3):161-165. doi: 10.5306/wjco.v10.i3.161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as an immunomodulating therapy has been widely used for GVHD treatment. However, the mechanism of action of ECP still remains to be elucidated, particularly the influence of ECP on NK cells. Thirty-four patients with steroid-refractory/resistant acute GVHD (aGVHD) >/= degrees II and moderate to severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) received ECP therapy. Patient samples obtained during intensive and long-term treatment were analyzed. Immunomonitoring with respect to cell phenotype and function was performed on rested peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using multiparametric flow cytometry. NK activity in terms of cytokine release was analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining after co-culture with K562 cells. Moreover, the proliferative capacity of NK cells, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells was determined by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining. Clinically, 75% of aGVHD and 78% of cGVHD patients responded to ECP therapy. Moreover, our data show that aGVHD, cGVHD patients and healthy donors (HDs) present distinct NK patterns: aGVHD patients have a higher frequency of CD56(bri) NK subsets with stronger NKG2D and CD62L expression, while CD56(-)CD16(+) NK cells with higher expression of CD57 and CD11b stand out as a signature population for cGVHD. ECP therapy could significantly decrease CD56(bri)CD16(-) NK cells with shifting the quality from a cytotoxic to a regulatory pattern and additionally mature CD56(dim) NK cells via upregulation of CD57 in complete responding aGVHD patients. Moreover, ECP could keep the anti-viral and anti-leukemic effects intact via maintaining specialized anti-viral/leukemic CD57(+)NKG2C(+)CD56(dim) NK cells as well as remaining the quality and quantity of cytokine release by NK cells. The proliferative capacity of effector cells remained constant over ECP therapy. In conclusion, ECP represents an attractive option to treat GVHD without compromising anti-viral/leukemic effects. Shaping of CD56(bri) NK cell compartment by downregulating the cytotoxic subset while upregulating the regulatory subset contributes to the mechanisms of ECP therapy in aGVHD.","['Ni, Ming', 'Wang, Lei', 'Yang, Mingya', 'Neuber, Brigitte', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss, Angela', 'Schubert, Maria-Luisa', 'Luft, Thomas', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Schonland, Stefan', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Chen, Bao-An', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Kruger, William', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Beider, Katia', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Schmitt, Anita']","['Ni M', 'Wang L', 'Yang M', 'Neuber B', 'Sellner L', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss A', 'Schubert ML', 'Luft T', 'Hegenbart U', 'Schonland S', 'Wuchter P', 'Chen BA', 'Eckstein V', 'Kruger W', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Beider K', 'Nagler A', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Dreger P', 'Schmitt M', 'Schmitt A']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wuerttemberg-Hessen, Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C, Hematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Clinic Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190320,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Photopheresis', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC6436423,['NOTNLM'],"['*ECP', '*GvHD', '*anti-leukemia effect', '*anti-viral effect', '*immunomodulation', '*natural killer cells']",,2019/04/06 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.00547 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Mar 20;10:547. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00547. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past years, more research attention has been drawn to the specific effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms in somatically ill patients. This reviews aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the current findings and evidence of exercise interventions in somatic disorders to improve depressive symptoms. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Cochrane databases and extracted meta-analyses from somatically ill patients that underwent exercise interventions and provided information about the outcome of depressive symptoms. Results: Of the 4123 detected publications, 39 were selected for final analysis. Various diseases were included (breast-cancer, prostate cancer, mixed-cancer, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hemodialysis, fibromyalgia syndrome, acute leukemia, other hematological malignancies, heart failure, HIV, multiple sclerosis, mixed neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease, stroke, ankylosing spondylitis, traumatic brain injury, lupus erythematodes). Most meta-analyses (33/39) found beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, but quality of the included studies as well as duration, intensity, frequency, and type of exercise varied widely. Conclusion: Exercise training has the potential to improve depressive symptoms in patients with somatic disorders. For specific training recommendations, more high quality studies with structured exercise programs and better comparability are needed.","['Roeh, Astrid', 'Kirchner, Sophie K', 'Malchow, Berend', 'Maurus, Isabel', 'Schmitt, Andrea', 'Falkai, Peter', 'Hasan, Alkomiet']","['Roeh A', 'Kirchner SK', 'Malchow B', 'Maurus I', 'Schmitt A', 'Falkai P', 'Hasan A']","['Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Neuroscience (LIM27), Institute of Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Systematic Review'],20190320,Switzerland,Front Psychiatry,Frontiers in psychiatry,101545006,,,,PMC6435577,['NOTNLM'],"['aerobic', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'somatic disease', 'training']",,2019/04/06 06:00,2019/04/06 06:01,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00141 [doi]'],epublish,Front Psychiatry. 2019 Mar 20;10:141. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00141. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morin is a natural polyphenol which negatively modulates, among others, the activity of LMW-PTP, leading to the potentiation of the effects of different antitumoral drugs, representing a potential beneficial treatment against cancer. Methods: LMW-PTP levels were measured by immunoblot analysis both in CLL cells from patients and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-derived Mec-1 cells. Cell viability was assessed in Mec-1 cells treated with morin alone or in combination with either fludarabine or ibrutinib or following siRNA-mediated LMW-PTP knockdown. Furthermore, the expression levels of VLA-4 and CXCR4 were assessed by both qRT-PCR and flow cytometry and both adhesion to fibronectin-coated plates and migration toward CXCL12 were analyzed in Mec-1 cells treated with morin alone or in combination with fludarabine or ibrutinib. Results: We observed that LMW-PTP is highly expressed in Mec-1 cells as well as in leukemic B lymphocytes purified from CLL patients compared to normal B lymphocytes. Morin treatment strongly decreased LMW-PTP expression levels in Mec-1 cells and potentiated the anticancer properties of both fludarabine and ibrutinib by increasing their apoptotic effects on leukemic cells. Moreover, morin negatively regulates adhesion and CXCL12-dependent migration of Mec-1 cells by affecting VLA-4 integrin expression and CXCR4 receptor recycling. Conclusions: Morin treatment in CLL-derived Mec-1 cell line synergizes with conventional anticancer drugs currently used in CLL therapy by affecting leukemic cell viability and trafficking.","['Capitani, Nagaja', 'Lori, Giulia', 'Paoli, Paolo', 'Patrussi, Laura', 'Troilo, Arianna', 'Baldari, Cosima T', 'Raugei, Giovanni', ""D'Elios, Mario Milco""]","['Capitani N', 'Lori G', 'Paoli P', 'Patrussi L', 'Troilo A', 'Baldari CT', 'Raugei G', ""D'Elios MM""]","['1Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2304grid.8404.8', '3Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.0000 0004 1757 4641grid.9024.f', '2Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2304grid.8404.8', '2Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2304grid.8404.8', '3Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.0000 0004 1757 4641grid.9024.f', '1Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2304grid.8404.8', '3Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.0000 0004 1757 4641grid.9024.f', '2Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2304grid.8404.8', '1Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2304grid.8404.8']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190321,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6429822,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'LMW-PTP', 'Migration', 'Morin']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],2019/04/06 06:00,2019/04/06 06:01,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-019-0786-1 [doi]', '786 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Mar 21;19:67. doi: 10.1186/s12935-019-0786-1. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9160-0930'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we unveil different mechanisms that eliminate p53-R248Q, one of the most frequent mutants found in human cancers. We show that the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG eliminates R248Q by stimulating macroautophagy under normal growth conditions. Metabolic stress induced by the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits the macroautophagy pathway. This induces the accumulation of R248Q, which in addition further inhibits macroautophagy. Combination of DCA and 17-AAG further decreases the autophagy flux compared to DCA alone. Despite this, this co-treatment strongly decreases R248Q levels. In this situation of metabolic stress, 17-AAG induces the binding of p53-R248Q to Hsc70 and the activation of Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (CMA), leading to higher R248Q degradation than in non-stress conditions. Thus, different metabolic contexts induce diverse autophagy mechanisms that degrade p53-R248Q, and under metabolic stress, its degradation is CMA-mediated. Hence, we present different strategies to eliminate this mutant and provide new evidence of the crosstalk between macroautophagy and CMA and their potential use to target mutant p53.","['Allende-Vega, Nerea', 'Villalba, Martin']","['Allende-Vega N', 'Villalba M']","['IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France. nerea.allende-vega@inserm.fr.', 'IRMB, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France. nerea.allende-vega@inserm.fr.', 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France. martin.villalba@inserm.fr.', 'IRMB, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France. martin.villalba@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190404,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '9LSH52S3LQ (Dichloroacetic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dichloroacetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6449403,,,,2019/04/06 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-42220-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-42220-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Apr 4;9(1):5637. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-42220-y.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4385-4888'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, interphase roles of Mad1 that do not impact mitotic checkpoint function remain largely uncharacterized. Here we show that upregulation of Mad1, which is common in human breast cancer, prevents stress-induced stabilization of the tumor suppressor p53 in multiple cell types. Upregulated Mad1 localizes to ProMyelocytic Leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies in breast cancer and cultured cells. The C-terminus of Mad1 directly interacts with PML, and this interaction is enhanced by sumoylation. PML stabilizes p53 by sequestering MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation, to the nucleolus. Upregulated Mad1 displaces MDM2 from PML, freeing it to ubiquitinate p53. Upregulation of Mad1 accelerates growth of orthotopic mammary tumors, which show decreased levels of p53 and its downstream effector p21. These results demonstrate an unexpected interphase role for Mad1 in tumor promotion via p53 destabilization.","['Wan, Jun', 'Block, Samuel', 'Scribano, Christina M', 'Thiry, Rebecca', 'Esbona, Karla', 'Audhya, Anjon', 'Weaver, Beth A']","['Wan J', 'Block S', 'Scribano CM', 'Thiry R', 'Esbona K', 'Audhya A', 'Weaver BA']","['Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA. baweaver@wisc.edu.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA. baweaver@wisc.edu.', 'Department of Oncology/McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA. baweaver@wisc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190404,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MAD1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC6449396,,,,2019/04/06 06:00,2019/05/02 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-09471-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-09471-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Apr 4;10(1):1540. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-09471-9.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7828-5152'],,,"['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088151/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM110567/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contemporary evidence to inform treatment of relapsed or refractory severe aplastic anemia for pediatric patients is also limited. The clinical features and outcomes for 314 children treated from 2002 to 2014 with immunosuppressive therapy for acquired severe aplastic anemia were analyzed retrospectively from 25 institutions in the North American Pediatric Aplastic Anemia Consortium. The majority of subjects (n=264) received horse anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG) plus cyclosporine (CyA) with a median 61 months follow up. Following hATG/CyA, 71.2% (95%CI: 65.3,76.6) achieved an objective response. In contrast to adult studies, the quality of response achieved in pediatric patients was high, with 59.8% (95%CI: 53.7,65.8) complete response and 68.2% (95%CI: 62.2,73.8) achieving at least a very good partial response with a platelet count >/=50x10(9)L. At five years post-hATG/CyA, overall survival was 93% (95%CI: 89,96), but event-free survival without subsequent treatment was only 64% (95%CI: 57,69) without a plateau. Twelve of 171 evaluable patients (7%) acquired clonal abnormalities after diagnosis after a median 25.2 months (range: 4.3-71 months) post treatment. Myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia developed in 6 of 314 (1.9%). For relapsed/refractory disease, treatment with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant had a superior event-free survival compared to second immunosuppressive therapy treatment in a multivariate analysis (HR=0.19, 95%CI: 0.08,0.47; P=0.0003).

Germline mutations of cohesin complex genes SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 or their regulators NIPBL and HDAC8 have been identified in CdLS as well as somatic mutations in myeloid disorders. We describe the first case of a paediatric patient with CdLS with B-cell precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). The patient did not show any unusual cytogenetic abnormality, and he was enrolled into the high risk arm of AIEOP-BFM ALL2009 protocol because of slow early response, but 3 years after discontinuation, he experienced an ALL relapse. We identified a heterozygous mutation in exon 46 of NIPBL, causing frameshift and a premature stop codon (RNA-Targeted Next generation Sequencing Analysis). The analysis of the family indicated a de novo origin of this previously not reported deleterious variant. As for somatic cohesin mutations in acute myeloid leukaemia, also this ALL case was not affected by aneuploidy, thus suggesting a major impact of the non-canonical role of NIPBL in gene regulation. A potential biological role of NIPBL in leukaemia has still to be dissected.","['Fazio, Grazia', 'Massa, Valentina', 'Grioni, Andrea', 'Bystry, Vojtech', 'Rigamonti, Silvia', 'Saitta, Claudia', 'Galbiati, Marta', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Consarino, Caterina', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Selicorni, Angelo', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Fazio G', 'Massa V', 'Grioni A', 'Bystry V', 'Rigamonti S', 'Saitta C', 'Galbiati M', 'Rizzari C', 'Consarino C', 'Biondi A', 'Selicorni A', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro di Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano, Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano, Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masarykova Univerzita, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masarykova Univerzita, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Centro di Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano, Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano, Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano, Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Department, Monza Brianza per il Bambino e la sua Mamma (MBBM) Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica, Presidio Ospedaliero Ciaccio-De Lellis, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano, Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Department, Monza Brianza per il Bambino e la sua Mamma (MBBM) Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Presidio S.

This study enrolled 574 patients (age, 16-73 years; median, 52 years) who were randomly assigned to ICE (n = 286 evaluable) or sHD (2 weekly 3-day blocks with cytarabine 2 g/m(2) twice a day for 2 days plus idarubicin; n = 286 evaluable). Responsive patients were risk-stratified for a second randomization. Standard-risk patients received autograft or repetitive blood stem cell-supported high-dose courses. High-risk patients (and standard-risk patients not mobilizing stem cells) underwent allotransplantation. CR rates after 2 induction courses were comparable between ICE (80.8%) and sHD (83.6%; P = .38). sHD yielded a higher single-induction CR rate (69.2% vs 81.5%; P = .0007) with lower resistance risk (P < .0001), comparable mortality (P = .39), and improved 5-year overall survival (39% vs 49%; P = .045) and relapse-free survival (36% vs 48%; P = .028), despite greater hematotoxicity delaying or reducing consolidation blocks. sHD improved the early CR rate in high-risk AML (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.74; P = .0008) and in patients aged 60 years and less with de novo AML (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.78; P = .003), and also improved overall/relapse-free survival in the latter group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.94; P = .01), in standard-risk AML, and postallograft (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96; P = .03). sHD was feasible, effectively achieved rapid CR, and improved outcomes in AML subsets.

It is unclear whether antecedent CLL adds prognostic value to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) for MDS. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the significance of a previous CLL diagnosis as an independent adverse prognostic factor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 18 consecutive patients with t-MDS, previously treated for CLL (CLL-MDS) from 2002 to 2016. For each CLL-MDS patient, we identified 2 control patients with de novo MDS matched for age (</= 65 or > 65 years), IPSS-R (</= 3 or > 3), and year of MDS diagnosis (before or after 2008). Multivariable models were developed to test for independent predictors of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median time from CLL to MDS diagnosis was 58.8 months (range, 12-280 months) and median number of treatment lines for CLL was 1 (range, 1-5), including alkylating agents in 15 patients (83%) and fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab in 12 patients (67%). Hypomethylating agents were administered in 13 (72%) of CLL-MDS patients and 33 (91%) of de novo MDS patients. After a median follow-up of 19.2 months, OS was not different between CLL-MDS and matched de novo MDS patients. CLL-MDS patients with IPSS-R score </= 3 had better OS compared with those with IPSS-R score > 3. In multivariate analysis, there was no significant independent association between history of CLL OS or progression to AML. CONCLUSION: History of CLL did not independently affect OS in t-MDS patients beyond IPSS-R score.","['Cooper, Jason P', 'Khajaviyan, Sirin', 'Smith, Stephen D', 'Maloney, David G', 'Shustov, Andrei R', 'Warren, Edus H', 'Soma, Lorinda A', 'Lynch, Ryan C', 'Ujjani, Chaitra', 'Till, Brian', 'Halpern, Anna B', 'Gopal, Ajay K', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Scott, Bart L', 'Shadman, Mazyar']","['Cooper JP', 'Khajaviyan S', 'Smith SD', 'Maloney DG', 'Shustov AR', 'Warren EH', 'Soma LA', 'Lynch RC', 'Ujjani C', 'Till B', 'Halpern AB', 'Gopal AK', 'Deeg HJ', 'Scott BL', 'Shadman M']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

Even a transient decrease in cardiac function might affect transplantation outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records and echocardiography examinations of 78 patients with AML who received induction therapy and underwent HSCT. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (28%) received daunorubicin at a dose of 90 mg/m(2) per day and 53 patients (68%) received 60 mg/m(2) per day or an equivalent dose of idarubicin. In 14 patients (18%) the postinduction ejection fraction declined by at least 10%. This change was temporary in 6 patients and longstanding in the remainder. Patients who developed systolic dysfunction had inferior overall survival (13 months compared with 27 months; P = .013). Patients whose diastolic function deteriorated had improved survival outcome (38 months compared with 17 months; P = .048). CONCLUSION: Although even transient reduction in systolic function might compromise survival outcome, diastolic dysfunction predicts improved survival in patients with AML who undergo HSCT.","['Pasvolsky, Oren', 'Morelli, Olga', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'Vaturi, Mordehay', 'Wolach, Ofir', 'Amitai, Irina', 'Vaxman, Iuliana', 'Ratzon, Roy', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Kornowski, Ran', 'Iakobishvilli, Zaza', 'Raanani, Pia']","['Pasvolsky O', 'Morelli O', 'Rozovski U', 'Vaturi M', 'Wolach O', 'Amitai I', 'Vaxman I', 'Ratzon R', 'Yeshurun M', 'Kornowski R', 'Iakobishvilli Z', 'Raanani P']","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

Our objective was to comprehensively summarize the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic or solid malignancies. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (inception - November 21, 2017). Interventional studies investigating CAR-T cell therapy in patients with malignancies were included. Our primary outcome of interest was complete response (defined as the absence of detectable cancer). Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the quality of evidence using established methods. A total of 42 hematological malignancy studies and 18 solid tumor studies met were included (913 participants). Of 486 evaluable hematologic patients, 54.4% [95% CI, 42.5%-65.9%] experienced complete response in 27 CD19 CAR-T cell therapy studies. Of 65 evaluable hematologic patients, 24.4% [95% CI, 9.4%-50.3%] experienced complete response in seven non-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy studies. Cytokine release syndrome was experienced by 55.3% [95% CI, 40.3%-69.4%] of patients and neurotoxicity 37.2% [95% CI, 28.6%-46.8%] of patients with hematologic malignancies. Of 86 evaluable solid tumor patients, 4.1% [95% CI, 1.6%-10.6%] experienced complete response in eight CAR-T cell therapy studies. Limitations include heterogeneity of study populations, as well as high risk of bias of included studies. There was a strong signal for efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in patients with CD19+ hematologic malignancies and no overall signal in solid tumor trials published to date. These results will help inform patients, physicians, and other stakeholders of the benefits and risks associated with CAR-T cell therapy.","['Grigor, Emma J M', 'Fergusson, Dean', 'Kekre, Natasha', 'Montroy, Joshua', 'Atkins, Harold', 'Seftel, Matthew D', 'Daugaard, Mads', 'Presseau, Justin', 'Thavorn, Kednapa', 'Hutton, Brian', 'Holt, Robert A', 'Lalu, Manoj M']","['Grigor EJM', 'Fergusson D', 'Kekre N', 'Montroy J', 'Atkins H', 'Seftel MD', 'Daugaard M', 'Presseau J', 'Thavorn K', 'Hutton B', 'Holt RA', 'Lalu MM']","['Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Blueprint Translational Research Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Pubic Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Blueprint Translational Research Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Pubic Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Department of Surgery, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Blueprint Translational Research Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Pubic Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Cancer Therapeutic Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba.', 'Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Vancouver Prostate Centre, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Blueprint Translational Research Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Pubic Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Blueprint Translational Research Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Pubic Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'School of Epidemiology and Pubic Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Knowledge Synthesis Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada; Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Blueprint Translational Research Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

We investigated the function of the long BIRC3 3' UTR, which is upregulated in leukemia. The 3' UTR does not regulate BIRC3 protein localization or abundance but is required for CXCR4-mediated B cell migration. We established an experimental pipeline to study the mechanism of regulation and used mass spectrometry to identify BIRC3 protein interactors. In addition to 3'-UTR-independent interactors involved in known BIRC3 functions, we detected interactors that bind only to BIRC3 protein encoded from the mRNA with the long 3' UTR. They regulate several functions, including CXCR4 trafficking. We further identified RNA-binding proteins differentially bound to the alternative 3' UTRs and found that cooperative binding of Staufen and HuR mediates 3'-UTR-dependent complex formation. We show that the long 3' UTR is required for the formation of specific protein complexes that enable additional functions of BIRC3 protein beyond its 3'-UTR-independent functions.","['Lee, Shih-Han', 'Mayr, Christine']","['Lee SH', 'Mayr C']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

Each of these cytogenetic entities carries unique diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. CBF AML is most common and as such, its treatment is more clearly established, consisting of intensive induction chemotherapy followed by cytarabine based consolidation. Due in large part to its intrinsic chemo-sensitivity, CBF AML is associated with relatively high rates of remission and survival. PDGFR mediated AML is comparatively rare, and as such, diagnostic and treatment paradigms are not as well defined. Early identification of PDGFR translocations is essential, as they confer profound imatinib sensitivity which may, in many instances, spare the need for chemotherapy. Prompt recognition of such lesions requires a strong index of suspicion, and as such these diagnoses are often initially overlooked. Unfortunately, many cases of PDGFR associated AML, particularly those with other concurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, demonstrate treatment emergent imatinib resistance. Such patients continue to present a challenge, even with the advent of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Patients with rare translocations such as ETV6-ABL1 are not well described however seem to follow an aggressive clinical course, with limited response to imatinib, and poor outcomes. This review examines the significance of eosinophilia in the context of AML, with respect to its presentation, pathology, and cytogenetics, and with special attention to appropriate evaluation and treatment.","['Naymagon, Leonard', 'Marcellino, Bridget', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Naymagon L', 'Marcellino B', 'Mascarenhas J']","['Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L Levy Place, Box 1079, New York, NY 10029, USA.

Because of their innate properties, NK cells are being considered for immunotherapies against various malignancies or leukemia. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are capable of inducing enough NK cells for allogeneic transplantation. However, current induction protocols require feeder cells or human or bovine serum for the differentiation and expansion of NK cells, which incurs potential risk for contamination and may cause lot dependency in the cells. To address these issues, here we established a differentiation protocol for developing functional NK cells from hPSCs under a completely chemically-defined condition. The resultant PSC-derived NK cells show comparable phenotypes to those produced under serum-containing condition, exerting strong killing potential against a leukemia cell line in vitro and resistance to tumor growth in vivo. Our protocol can be a useful tool for applying PSC-derived NK cells to future cellular cancer immunotherapies.","['Matsubara, Hiroyuki', 'Niwa, Akira', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Saito, Megumu K']","['Matsubara H', 'Niwa A', 'Nakahata T', 'Saito MK']","['Department of Clinical Application, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Training Program of Leaders for Integrated Medical System, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Application, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

Therapeutic benefits of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, are limited due to the emergence of drug resistance. While investigations have been conducted to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to this FLT3 inhibitor, a profile of cell functioning at the metabolite level and crosstalk between metabolic pathways has yet to be created. This study aimed to elucidate the alteration of metabolomic profile of leukemia cells resistant to the FLT3 inhibitor. METHODS: We established two sorafenib-resistant cell lines carrying FLT3/ITD mutations, namely the murine BaF3/ITD-R and the human MV4-11-R cell lines. We performed a global untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope-labeling mass spectrometry analysis to identify the metabolic alterations relevant to the therapeutic resistance. RESULTS: The resistant cells displayed fundamentally rewired metabolic profiles, characterized by a higher demand for glucose, accompanied by a reduction in glucose flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP); and by an increase in oxidative stress, accompanied by an enhanced glutathione synthesis. We demonstrated that the highest scoring network of altered metabolites in resistant cells was related to nucleotide degradation. A stable isotope tracing experiment was performed and the results indicated a decrease in the quantity of glucose entering the PPP in resistant cells. Further experiment suggested that the inhibition of major enzymes in the PPP consist of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) in the oxidative arm and transketolase (TKT) in the non-oxidative arm. In addition, we observed that chronic treatment with sorafenib resulted in an increased oxidative stress in FLT3/ITD-positive leukemia cells, which was accompanied by decreased cell proliferation and an enhanced antioxidant response. CONCLUSIONS: Our data regarding comparative metabolomics characterized a distinct metabolic and redox adaptation that may contribute to sorafenib resistance in FLT3/ITD-mutated leukemia cells.","['You, Xin', 'Jiang, Weiye', 'Lu, Wenhua', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Yu, Tiantian', 'Tian, Jingyu', 'Wen, Shijun', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Huang, Peng', 'Hu, Yumin']","['You X', 'Jiang W', 'Lu W', 'Zhang H', 'Yu T', 'Tian J', 'Wen S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Huang P', 'Hu Y']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, 651 Dong Feng East Road, Guangzhou, 510060, Guangdong, P.

We prospectively examined the association between NK-cytotoxic activity, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) on the overall survival (OS) of patients. Patients with NK-cytotoxicity above a critical threshold had a longer duration of response and survived longer than patients with severe impairment of NK-cytotoxicity. The numbers of MDSCs, and Tregs in the PB of patients after a short exposure to AZA were not different from normal donors. In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that the therapeutic activity of AZA is at least partly mediated by an immunomodulatory effect. To our knowledge, this is the first study reported so far, that shows a positive correlation between NK cytotoxicity and OS of AZA-treated patients.","['Tsirogianni, Maria', 'Grigoriou, Eirini', 'Kapsimalli, Violetta', 'Dagla, Kleopatra', 'Stamouli, Maria', 'Gkirkas, Konstantinos', 'Konsta, Eve', 'Karagiannidou, Angeliki', 'Gkodopoulos, Konstantinos', 'Stavroulaki, Georgia', 'Pappa, Vassiliki', 'Angelopoulou, Maria', 'Lowdell, Mark', 'Tsirigotis, Panagiotis']","['Tsirogianni M', 'Grigoriou E', 'Kapsimalli V', 'Dagla K', 'Stamouli M', 'Gkirkas K', 'Konsta E', 'Karagiannidou A', 'Gkodopoulos K', 'Stavroulaki G', 'Pappa V', 'Angelopoulou M', 'Lowdell M', 'Tsirigotis P']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Saint Savvas Regional Cancer Hospital , Athens , Greece.', 'Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, ""Evangelismos"" General Hospital , Athens , Greece.', 'Department of Microbiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation Centre for Cell, Gene & Tissue Therapeutics, Royal Free Hospital , London , UK.', 'Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""ATTIKO"" General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190405,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology/*mortality', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK-cytotoxicity', '*Natural killer cell', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*azacytidine', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",,2019/04/06 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/04/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1581935 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Oct;60(10):2457-2463. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1581935.

The new compounds were designed based on the structures of our previous arylamine ester derivatives endowed with high P-gp-dependent multidrug resistance reversing activity on a multidrug-resistant leukemia cell line. All new compounds were active in the pirarubicin uptake assay on the doxorubicin-resistant erythroleukemia K562cells (K562/DOX). Compounds bearing a linker made up of 10 methylenes showed unprecedented high reversal activities regardless of the combination of aromatic moieties. Docking results obtained by an in silico study supported the data obtained by the biological tests and a study devoted to establish the chemical stability in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and human plasma showed that only a few compounds exhibited a significant degradation in the human plasma matrix. Ten selected non-hydrolysable derivatives were able to inhibit the P-gp-mediated rhodamine-123 efflux on K562/DOX cells, and the evaluation of their apparent permeability and ATP consumption on other cell lines suggested that the compounds can behave as unambiguous or not transported substrates. The activity of these the compounds on the transport proteins breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1) was also analyzed. All tested derivatives displayed a moderate potency on the BCRP overexpressing cells; while only four molecules showed to be effective on MRP1 overexpressing cells, highlighting a clear structural requirement for selectivity. In conclusion, we have identified a new very powerful series of compounds which represent interesting leads for the development of new potent and efficacious P-gp-dependent MDR modulators.","['Dei, Silvia', 'Braconi, Laura', 'Trezza, Alfonso', 'Menicatti, Marta', 'Contino, Marialessandra', 'Coronnello, Marcella', 'Chiaramonte, Niccolo', 'Manetti, Dina', 'Perrone, Maria Grazia', 'Romanelli, Maria Novella', 'Udomtanakunchai, Chatchanok', 'Colabufo, Nicola Antonio', 'Bartolucci, Gianluca', 'Spiga, Ottavia', 'Salerno, Milena', 'Teodori, Elisabetta']","['Dei S', 'Braconi L', 'Trezza A', 'Menicatti M', 'Contino M', 'Coronnello M', 'Chiaramonte N', 'Manetti D', 'Perrone MG', 'Romanelli MN', 'Udomtanakunchai C', 'Colabufo NA', 'Bartolucci G', 'Spiga O', 'Salerno M', 'Teodori E']","[""Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child's Health - Section of Pharmaceutical and Nutraceutical Sciences, University of Florence, via Ugo Schiff 6, 50019 Sesto Fiorentino (FI), Italy.

Here we show that inhibition of the deubiquitinase USP9X by its inhibitor WP1130 or EOAI3402143 (G9) induces apoptosis preferentially in cells transformed by these mutant kinases, including FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell line MV4-11 and primary AML cells. Mechanistically, WP1130 induced aggresomal translocation of the mutant kinases, particularly FLT3-ITD in its activated and autophosphorylated conformation, to block the downstream signaling events, which was aggravated by knock down of USP9X. Moreover, USP9X physically associated with FLT3-ITD to inhibit its K63-linked polyubiquitination, while FLT3-ITD induced tyrosine phosphorylation and degradation of USP9X through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. WP1130 or G9 also induced oxidative stress to stimulate stress-related MAP kinase pathways and DNA damage responses to activate in cooperation with inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, which was synergistically enhanced by BH3 mimetics and prevented by overexpression of Bcl-xL or Mcl-1. Thus, USP9X represents a promising target for novel therapies against therapy-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.","['Akiyama, Hiroki', 'Umezawa, Yoshihiro', 'Ishida, Shinya', 'Okada, Keigo', 'Nogami, Ayako', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Akiyama H', 'Umezawa Y', 'Ishida S', 'Okada K', 'Nogami A', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Clinical Laboratory, Medical Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.

Numerous clinical reports have indicated that ATO is a developmental toxicant which can result in birth defects of human beings. But whether arsenic trioxide can lead to human cardiac developmental toxicity remains largely unknown. So the present study aims to explore the influence and mechanisms of ATO on human cardiac development by using a vitro cardiac differentiation model of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Here we found that clinically achievable concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 1 muM) of ATO resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation during the whole process of cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs. Meanwhile, TUNEL assay revealed that ATO could cause cell apoptosis during cardiac differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, we found that ATO reduced the expressions of mesoderm markers Brachyury and EOMES, cardiac progenitor cell markers GATA-4, MESP-1 and TBX-5, and cardiac specific marker alpha-actinin in differentiated hiPSCs. Furthermore, ATO treatment had caused DNA damage which was shown in the upregulation of gammaH2AX, a sensitive marker for DNA double-strand breaks. Taken together, ATO blocked cardiomyocyte differentiation, induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest during cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs, which might be associated with DNA damage.","['Bao,

However, their production is still limited and requires more efficient and adaptive technologies. The more common systems are high-shear homogenization such as microfludizers at industrial scale and ultrasounds at research scale, both based on high energy, limiting their application for sensitive drugs. Recently a process based on premix membrane emulsification (PME) was developed to produce nanoemulsions. These 3 processes have been compared for the production of a model parenteral nanoemulsion containing all-trans retinoic acid, a thermolabile molecule that is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in a parenteral form. Droplet size and active integrity were studied because of their major interest for efficacy and safety assessment. Regarding droplet size, PME produced monodispersed droplets of 335 nm compared with the other processes that produced nanoemulsions of around 150 nm but with the presence of micron-size droplets detected by laser diffraction and optical microscopy. No real difference between the 3 processes was observed on active degradation during emulsifcation. However regarding stability, especially at 40 degrees C, nanoemulsions obtained with the microfluidizer showed a greater molecule degradation and unstable nanoemulsion with a 4-times droplet size increase under stress conditions.","['Alliod, Oceane', 'Almouazen, Eyad', 'Nemer, Georgio', 'Fessi, Hatem', 'Charcosset, Catherine']","['Alliod O', 'Almouazen E', 'Nemer G', 'Fessi H', 'Charcosset C']","['University of Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, LAGEP UMR 5007, 43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France.', 'University of Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, LAGEP UMR 5007, 43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France.', 'University of Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, LAGEP UMR 5007, 43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France.', 'University of Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, LAGEP UMR 5007, 43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France.', 'University of Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, LAGEP UMR 5007, 43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France.

X-ray crystallography of 1 with the kinase showed an infrequent flip of the peptide bond between Met109 and Gly110, which was considered to lead to high kinase selectivity. Our structure-based design strategy was to conduct scaffold transformation of 1 with maintenance of hydrogen bond interactions with the flipped hinge backbone of the enzyme. In accordance with this strategy, we focused on scaffold transformation to identify imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-one derivatives as potent inhibitors of the p38 MAP kinase. Of the compounds evaluated, 21 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in human monocytic leukemia cells, and TNF-alpha-induced production of interleukin-8 in human whole blood cells.

However, the role of T cells (if any) in disease progression remains unclear and has not been directly studied. This has changed with the advent of new therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, which actively use retargeted patient-derived T cells as ""living drugs"" for CLL. However complete responses are relatively low (~26%) and recent studies have suggested the differentiation status of patient T cells before therapy may influence efficacy. Non-chemotherapeutic drugs, such as idelalisib and ibrutinib, also have an impact on T cell populations in CLL patients. This review will highlight what is known about T cells in CLL during disease progression and after treatment, and discuss the prospects of using T cells as predictive biomarkers for immune status and response to therapy.","['Man, Stephen', 'Henley, Peter']","['Man S', 'Henley P']","['Section of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Section of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190403,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Purines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* CLL', '*T cells', '*immunotherapy', '*leukaemia']",,2019/04/05 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/04/05 06:00'],"['2019/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15918 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Jul;186(2):220-233. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15918.

Tregs are decisive not only in the protection against destruction of own tissues by autoimmune immunocompetent cells but also in the immunological answer to developing cancers. On the other hand, Tregs could be responsible for the progression of acute and chronic leukemias. In our study, we review publications available in the PUMED database concerning acute leukemia, with a particular emphasis on child's leukemias. The percentage of regulatory T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow was elevated compared to those in healthy individuals and correlated with progressive disease. Regulatory T-cells taken from children diagnosed with leukemia showed a higher suppressive capability, which was confirmed by detecting elevated levels of secreted IL-10 and TGF-beta. The possibility of pharmacological intervention in the self-control of the immunological system is now under extensive investigation in many human cancers. Presumably, Treg cells could be a vital part of targeted therapies. Routine Treg determination could be used to assess the severity of disease and prognosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This proposition results from the fact that in some studies, higher percentage of Treg cells in peripheral blood was demonstrated. However, observations confirming these facts are scarce; thus, extrapolating them to the population of children with hematological malignancies needs to be verified in additional studies.","['Niedzwiecki, M', 'Budzilo, O', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, E', 'Pawlik-Gwozdecka, D', 'Zielinski, M', 'Maciejka-Kemblowska, L', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Trzonkowski, P']","['Niedzwiecki M', 'Budzilo O', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Pawlik-Gwozdecka D', 'Zielinski M', 'Maciejka-Kemblowska L', 'Szczepanski T', 'Trzonkowski P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Clinical Immunology and Transplantology Unit at the Department of Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric, Hematology and Oncology in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Clinical Immunology and Transplantology Unit at the Department of Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190303,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-10/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/classification/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology']",PMC6421759,,,,2019/04/05 06:00,2019/07/19 06:00,['2019/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/2816498 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2019 Mar 3;2019:2816498. doi: 10.1155/2019/2816498. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7266-7694', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8366-5846']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LDD-1075 and LDD-1076 are indirubin derivatives, and LDD-1075 is the ester form of LDD-1076. LDD-1076 exhibited a potent in vitro FLT3 kinase activity inhibition with an IC50 of 7.89 nM, whereas, LDD-1075 demonstrated a relatively weak activity against FLT3 (IC50 of 3.19 microM). In contrast with the results of the FLT3 kinase activity inhibition assay, the LDD-1076 did not affect the growth of the MV4-11 cell line, which harbors the constitutively activated form of the FLT3 mutation. Notably, LDD-1075 exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect against the MV4-11 cells. When LDD-1075 was incubated with the MV4-11 cell lysate, the formation of LDD-1076 was observed. Treatment with LDD-1075 inhibited the FLT3 phosphorylation along with the phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 protein, which is a downstream signal transducer of FLT3. Treatment with LDD-1075 induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that some patients with a sustained deep molecular response to TKI therapy can safely stop therapy and remain in a treatment-free remission. TKI discontinuation is now offered to select patients in routine clinical care. In order to better support patient decision making, we explored patients' views on TKI discontinuation and the factors patients consider when making this decision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from three U.S. academic cancer centers. Qualitative interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed. RESULTS: We interviewed 22 patients, half of whom wanted to try TKI discontinuation. Eleven factors relevant to the decision emerged, and patients weighed these factors differently. Commonly mentioned factors included perceived risk of relapse, TKI side effects, financial considerations, polypharmacy, and willingness to change something that was working (status quo). There were notable differences in patients' understanding of the likelihood of achieving a treatment-free remission, with patients who did not want to stop TKIs more accurately reporting the risk of relapse than patients who wanted to stop. CONCLUSION: This is a novel decision that will become more common as the prevalence of patients with well-controlled CML continues to increase. These results highlight the need for patient education and decision support so that patients and providers can make shared decisions that are informed and values based. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The standard treatment for chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is lifelong oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Clinical trials have shown that some patients with a sustained deep molecular response to TKI therapy can safely stop therapy and remain in a treatment-free remission. TKI discontinuation is now being offered to patients outside of clinical trials. This study explored factors that patients who are eligible to try TKI discontinuation considered when making this decision. Factors relevant to the decision included risk of relapse, side effects, financial considerations, polypharmacy, and willingness to change something that was working. This is a novel decision that will become more common as the prevalence of patients with well-controlled CML continues to increase. These results highlight the need for decision support and outline the factors that should be included so that patients and providers can make shared decisions that are informed and values based.","['Flynn, Kathryn E', 'Myers, Judith M', ""D'Souza, Anita"", 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Thompson, James E', 'Atallah, Ehab']","['Flynn KE', 'Myers JM', ""D'Souza A"", 'Schiffer CA', 'Thompson JE', 'Atallah E']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA kflynn@mcw.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190403,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Polypharmacy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC6738285,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic phase', '*Decision making', '*Goals', '*Leukemia', '*Myeloid', '*Polypharmacy']","['Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest may be found at the end of this', 'article.']",2019/04/05 06:00,2020/07/22 06:00,['2019/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2018-0831 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0831 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2019 Sep;24(9):1253-1258. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0831.

Long-term data from randomized trials of nilotinib demonstrate an increased risk of vascular AEs (VAEs) compared with other TKIs, although the natural history of these events in response to dose modifications or cessation has not been fully characterized. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence of nilotinib-associated AEs in 220 patients with CML-CP at 17 Australian institutions. Overall, AEs of any grade were reported in 95 patients (43%) and prompted nilotinib cessation in 46 (21%). VAEs occurred in 26 patients (12%), with an incidence of 4.1 events per 100 patient-years. Multivariate analysis identified age (P = .022) and dyslipidemia (P = .007) as independent variables for their development. There was 1 fatal first VAE, whereas the remaining patients either continued nilotinib (14 patients) or stopped it immediately (11 patients). Recurrent VAEs were associated with ongoing therapy in 7 of 14 who continued (with 2 fatal VAEs) vs 1 of 11 who discontinued (P = .04). Nineteen of the 23 evaluable patients surviving a VAE ultimately stopped nilotinib, of whom 14 received an alternative TKI. Dose reduction or cessation because of VAEs did not adversely affect maintenance of major molecular response. These findings demonstrate that in contrast to other AEs, VAEs are ideally managed with nilotinib cessation because of the increased risk of additional events with its ongoing use.","['Minson, Adrian G', 'Cummins, Katherine', 'Fox, Lucy', 'Costello, Ben', 'Yeung, David', 'Cleary, Rebecca', 'Forsyth, Cecily', 'Tatarczuch, Maciek', 'Burbury, Kate', 'Motorna, Olga', 'Shortt, Jake', 'Fleming, Shaun', 'McQuillan, Andrew', 'Schwarer, Anthony', 'Harrup, Rosemary', 'Holmes, Amy', 'Ratnasingam, Sumita', 'Chan, Kah-Lok', 'Hsu, Wei-Hsun', 'Ashraf, Asma', 'Putt, Faye', 'Grigg, Andrew']","['Minson AG', 'Cummins K', 'Fox L', 'Costello B', 'Yeung D', 'Cleary R', 'Forsyth C', 'Tatarczuch M', 'Burbury K', 'Motorna O', 'Shortt J', 'Fleming S', 'McQuillan A', 'Schwarer A', 'Harrup R', 'Holmes A', 'Ratnasingam S', 'Chan KL', 'Hsu WH', 'Ashraf A', 'Putt F', 'Grigg A']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Gosford Hospital, Gosford, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia.', 'School of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Hollywood Medical Centre, Perth, Australia.', 'Box Hill Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Australia.', 'Canberra Hospital, Canberra, Australia.', 'Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', ""St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia; and.', 'Calvary Mater Hospital, Newcastle, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Safety-Based Drug Withdrawals', 'Vascular Diseases/chemically induced']",PMC6457217,,,,2019/04/05 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018028035 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018028035 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 9;3(7):1084-1091. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018028035.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7357-2024'],['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective second- and third-generation FLT3 inhibitors have shown significant clinical activity in patients with relapsed FLT3-mutant AML. However, clearance of FLT3-mutant clones does not consistently occur, and disease will progress in most patients after an initial response. This scenario challenges the model of FLT3-mutant AML being oncogene addicted, and it suggests that redundant signaling pathways regulate AML cell survival after FLT3 inhibition. We show that primary FLT3-mutant AML cells escape apoptosis induced by FLT3 inhibition in vitro in the presence of cytokines produced normally in the bone marrow, particularly granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Despite reactivating canonical FLT3-signaling pathways, GM-CSF and IL-3 maintain cell survival without rescuing proliferation. Cytokine-mediated resistance through GM-CSF and IL-3 is dependent on JAK kinase, STAT5, and proviral integration site of Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) but not MAPK or mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Cotreatment with FLT3 inhibitors and inhibitors of JAK or PIM kinases blocks GM-CSF and IL-3 rescue of cell survival in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, these data provide a strong rationale for combination therapy with FLT3 inhibitors to potentially improve clinical responses in AML.","['Sung, Pamela J', 'Sugita, Mayumi', 'Koblish, Holly', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Sung PJ', 'Sugita M', 'Koblish H', 'Perl AE', 'Carroll M']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, DE.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*physiology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",PMC6457213,,,,2019/04/05 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018029850 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029850 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 9;3(7):1061-1072. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029850.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5828-5622', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5622-3735']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,"['R01 CA198089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007439/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although genome sequencing has revealed the CMML mutation profile, the mechanism of disease development remains unclear. Here we show that aberrant histone acetylation by nucleoporin-98 (NUP98)-HBO1, a newly identified fusion in a patient with CMML, is sufficient to generate clinically relevant CMML pathogenesis. Overexpression of NUP98-HBO1 in murine HSC/progenitors (HSC/Ps) induced diverse CMML phenotypes, such as severe leukocytosis, increased CD115(+) Ly6C(high) monocytes (an equivalent subpopulation to human classical CD14(+) CD16(-) monocytes), macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, megakaryocyte-lineage dysplasia, splenomegaly, and cachexia. A NUP98-HBO1-mediated transcriptional signature in human CD34(+) cells was specifically activated in HSC/Ps from a CMML patient cohort. Besides critical determinants of monocytic cell fate choice in HSC/Ps, an oncogenic HOXA9 signature was significantly activated by NUP98-HBO1 fusion through aberrant histone acetylation. Increased HOXA9 gene expression level with disease progression was confirmed in our CMML cohort. Genetic disruption of NUP98-HBO1 histone acetyltransferase activity abrogated its leukemogenic potential and disease development in human cells and a mouse model. Furthermore, treatment of azacytidine was effective in our CMML mice. The recapitulation of CMML clinical phenotypes and gene expression profile by the HBO1 fusion suggests our new model as a useful platform for elucidating the central downstream mediators underlying diverse CMML-related mutations and testing multiple compounds, providing novel therapeutic potential.","['Hayashi, Yoshihiro', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Kagiyama, Yuki', 'Nishikawa, Sayuri', 'Ding, Ye', 'Imagawa, Jun', 'Shingai, Naoki', 'Kato, Naoko', 'Kitaura, Jiro', 'Hokaiwado, Shintaro', 'Maemoto, Yuki', 'Ito, Akihiro', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Kitabayashi, Issay', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Harada, Hironori']","['Hayashi Y', 'Harada Y', 'Kagiyama Y', 'Nishikawa S', 'Ding Y', 'Imagawa J', 'Shingai N', 'Kato N', 'Kitaura J', 'Hokaiwado S', 'Maemoto Y', 'Ito A', 'Matsui H', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Iwama A', 'Komatsu N', 'Kitamura T', 'Harada H']","['Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Bunkyo Gakuin University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Edogawa Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Atopy Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Cell Signaling, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Cell Signaling, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT7 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenotype']",PMC6457235,,,,2019/04/05 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018025007 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025007 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 9;3(7):1047-1060. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025007.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1490-9923'],['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe a role for NOX2 in leukemia-initiating stem cell populations (LSCs). In a murine model of leukemia, suppression of NOX2 impaired core metabolism, attenuated disease development, and depleted functionally defined LSCs. Transcriptional analysis of purified LSCs revealed that deficiency of NOX2 collapses the self-renewal program and activates inflammatory and myeloid-differentiation-associated programs. Downstream of NOX2, we identified the forkhead transcription factor FOXC1 as a mediator of the phenotype. Notably, suppression of NOX2 or FOXC1 led to marked differentiation of leukemic blasts. In xenotransplantation models of primary human myeloid leukemia, suppression of either NOX2 or FOXC1 significantly attenuated disease development. Collectively, these findings position NOX2 as a critical regulator of malignant hematopoiesis and highlight the clinical potential of inhibiting NOX2 as a means to target LSCs.","['Adane, Biniam', 'Ye, Haobin', 'Khan, Nabilah', 'Pei, Shanshan', 'Minhajuddin, Mohammad', 'Stevens, Brett M', 'Jones, Courtney L', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Reisz, Julie A', 'Zaberezhnyy, Vadym', 'Gasparetto, Maura', 'Ho, Tzu-Chieh', 'Kelly, Kathleen K', 'Myers, Jason R', 'Ashton, John M', 'Siegenthaler, Julie', 'Kume, Tsutomu', 'Campbell, Eric L', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Adane B', 'Ye H', 'Khan N', 'Pei S', 'Minhajuddin M', 'Stevens BM', 'Jones CL', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Reisz JA', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Gasparetto M', 'Ho TC', 'Kelly KK', 'Myers JR', 'Ashton JM', 'Siegenthaler J', 'Kume T', 'Campbell EL', 'Pollyea DA', 'Becker MW', 'Jordan CT']","['Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Genomics Research Center, University of Rochester, NY 14642, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Genomics Research Center, University of Rochester, NY 14642, USA.', 'Genomics Research Center, University of Rochester, NY 14642, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Feinberg Cardiovascular and Renal Research Institute, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queens University, Belfast, UK.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Genomics Research Center, University of Rochester, NY 14642, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of 30 CT studies of healthy adult cats recruited from September 2013 to July 2015 was performed. Healthy cats >1 year of age were included based on the absence of clinical signs, unremarkable physical examination, normal results of the complete blood count, biochemical profile, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus and Bartonella species infection tests. The relationship between gland biometry (size and attenuation values) and the age, sex, laterality and body weight of cats were tested by two-way ANOVA. The intraclass correlation coefficient was assessed and mean, SD, range and reference interval provided. RESULTS: Twenty-seven cats were included. Bilobed, arrowhead and oval adrenal gland shape patterns were recognised, the first being most common. No statistically significant differences were observed between the biometric parameters (length, height and attenuation values) and age, sex, laterality or body weight of the cats. Regarding the width of the adrenal glands, there was a statistically significant effect of sex and laterality. The length (11.6 +/- 2.1 mm) and height (6.1 +/- 1.3 mm) were the most consistent biometrical parameters to describe adrenal glands. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adrenal gland shape, size and attenuation CT data of healthy feline patients are provided in this study, as well as normal reference intervals for morphometric characterisation based on adrenal length and height.","['Mallol, Claudia', 'Altuzarra, Raul', 'Espada, Yvonne', 'Tobon Restrepo, Mauricio', 'Serrano, Emmanuel', 'Novellas, Rosa']","['Mallol C', 'Altuzarra R', 'Espada Y', 'Tobon Restrepo M', 'Serrano E', 'Novellas R']","['Diagnostic Imaging Service of the Fundacio Hospital Clinic Veterinari, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Diagnostic Imaging Service of the Fundacio Hospital Clinic Veterinari, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Diagnostic Imaging Service of the Fundacio Hospital Clinic Veterinari, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Wildlife Ecology and Health Group and Wildlife Ecopathology Service (SEFaS), Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Diagnostic Imaging Service of the Fundacio Hospital Clinic Veterinari, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190403,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,"['*Adrenal Glands/anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/physiology', '*Cats/anatomy & histology/physiology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*veterinary']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adrenal gland', '*CT', '*attenuation values', '*shape', '*size']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X19840090 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2020 Apr;22(4):285-291. doi: 10.1177/1098612X19840090.

However, its efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been less impressive compared with that in patients with acute lymphoid leukemia. Furthermore, immune checkpoints have a critical role in the immune system. Several clinical trials have confirmed the dramatic effects of programmed death1/programmed deathligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) inhibitors in numerous malignancies, but the immuneassociated adverse events of PD1/PDL1 inhibitors may occur in a number of systems. The aim of the present study was to investigate the combination of CD19 CART cells with a reduced dose of PD1 inhibitor. This method is expected to overcome the side-effects of PD1 inhibitors, while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. The findings demonstrated that a reduced dose of PD1 inhibitor did not affect the transfection rate, proliferation rate or cytokine secretion of CD19 CART cells. An interesting finding of the present study was that the number of PD1positive cells CART cells, measured by flow cytometry, declined when they were cultured in vitro, but returned to high levels with gradual prolongation of the coculture time of CD19 CART cells with lymphoma cells; however, there was no change in the mRNA expression of T cells and CART cells during this process. This phenomenon may be one of the reasons why the curative effect of CART cells on Bcell lymphoma is unsatisfactory compared with Bcell leukemia. The synergistic effect of a reduceddose PD1 inhibitor combined with CD19 CART cells from T cells highly expressing PD1 was confirmed in a mouse trial. Mice in the combined treatment group achieved the longest survival time. In this group, the proportion of CART cells and the level of interleukin6 were higher compared with those in the CART cell group. In conclusion, a reduced dose of a PD1 inhibitor combined with CD19 CART cells appears to be a promising treatment option for relapsed/refractory BNHL exhibiting high PD1 expression by T cells. This method may achieve good clinical efficacy while reducing the side-effects of PD1 inhibitors.","['Zhang, Rui', 'Deng, Qi', 'Jiang, Yan-Yu', 'Zhu, Hai-Bo', 'Wang, Jia', 'Zhao, Ming-Feng']","['Zhang R', 'Deng Q', 'Jiang YY', 'Zhu HB', 'Wang J', 'Zhao MF']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Nankai, Tianjin 300192, P.R.

Agents that reverse MDR and sensitize AML cells to chemotherapy are of great clinical significance. The present study developed Adriamycin (Adr)resistant cell lines, namely K562/Adr200 and K562/Adr500, which exhibited MDR. The upregulation of ATPbinding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) was confirmed as the mechanism of resistance by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Subsequently, the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitor, WYE354, in sensitizing the K562/Adr200 and K562/Adr500 cell lines to Adr was evaluated. At subcytotoxic concentrations, WYE354 increased Adr cytotoxicity in the K562/Adr200 and K562/Adr500 cells. WYE354 restored Adr sensitivity in the resistant cells by inhibiting ABCB1mediated substrate efflux, thereby leading to an accumulation of Adr, an increase in Adrmediated G2/M cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, WYE354 stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1, which was consistent with in silico predictions using a human ABCB1 mouse homology model, indicating that WYE354 is a potent substrate of ABCB1. WYE354 did not regulate the expression of ABCB1 at the concentrations used in the present study. These findings indicate that WYE354 may be a competitive inhibitor of ABCB1mediated efflux and a potential candidate in combination with standard chemotherapy for overcoming MDR. Further clinical investigations are warranted to validate this combination in vivo.","['Ibrahim, Sara M', 'Bakhashab, Sherin', 'Ilyas, Asad M', 'Pushparaj, Peter N', 'Karim, Sajjad', 'Khan, Jalaluddin A', 'Abuzenadah, Adel M', 'Chaudhary, Adeel G', 'Al-Qahtani, Muhammed H', 'Ahmed, Farid']","['Ibrahim SM', 'Bakhashab S', 'Ilyas AM', 'Pushparaj PN', 'Karim S', 'Khan JA', 'Abuzenadah AM', 'Chaudhary AG', 'Al-Qahtani MH', 'Ahmed F']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190402,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (WYE-354)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Purines/*administration & dosage', 'Substrate Specificity', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",PMC6489006,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/08/16 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2019.7093 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2019 Jun;41(6):3179-3188. doi: 10.3892/or.2019.7093.

Exposure to higher concentrations of C19H15F3N2O resulted in significantly increased apoptosis rate in NB4 cells. RT PCR showed that C19H15F3N2O has up-regulated the expression of P21 and down-regulated the expression of Cyclin D. Western blotting experiments also demonstrated that the P21 expression in C19H15F3N2O treated cells has significantly increased, where compared with either untreated control cells or I3A treated cells. This newly (C19H15F3N2O) was able to inhibit NB4 cells proliferation and causes apoptosis of these cells more than I3A, and these effects are probably facilitated via cell cycle arrest. C19H15F3N2O might probably be introduced as a promising organic therapeutic reagent against APL.","['Noroozi, Mojgan Karimabad', 'Mahmoodi, Mehd', 'Jafarzadeh, Abdollah', 'Darehkordi, Ali', 'Hajizadeh, Mohammad Reza', 'Khorramdelazad, Hossein', 'Sayadi, Ahmad Reza', 'Falahati-Pour, Soudeh Khanamani', 'Hassanshahi, Gholamhossein']","['Noroozi MK', 'Mahmoodi M', 'Jafarzadeh A', 'Darehkordi A', 'Hajizadeh MR', 'Khorramdelazad H', 'Sayadi AR', 'Falahati-Pour SK', 'Hassanshahi G']","['Molecular Medicine Research Center, Research Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Research Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Research Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Research Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Research Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Pistachio Safety Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Research Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190331,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8724FJW4M5 (indole)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['C19H15F3N2O', 'Cancer', 'Flow cytometry', 'Gene', 'Real-time PCR', 'Western blot.']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2019 Mar 31;65(3):41-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HL60 cells were treated with control, apatinib alone, cytarabine alone and apatinib combined with cytarabine. Cell proliferation in each group was detected via methy thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, changes in the cell cycle and mitochondrial transmembrane potential in each group after treatment were detected via flow cytometry, and apoptosis was detected via Annexin V-PI double labeling. Moreover, changes in cell cycle-related proteins and apoptosis-associated proteins in each group after treatment were detected via Western blotting. RESULTS: MTT assay revealed that the sub-lethal dose of apatinib combined with cytarabine had a higher inhibitory rate on tumor cells than cytarabine alone. Cell cycle assay showed that apatinib combined with cytarabine could effectively arrest HL60 cells in G0/G1 phase in the combination group. In combination group, the expression level of the positive regulator cyclin D1 was decreased, while the expression levels of the negative regulators p21 and p27 were significantly up-regulated compared with those in single application groups. Results of apoptosis assay manifested that in the combination group, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential of HL60 cells could be synergistically destroyed, and the proportion of apoptotic cells was also obviously increased. Results of Western blotting demonstrated that the levels of apoptosis-associated proteins cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP and Bax in the combination group after treatment were remarkably up-regulated, while the Bcl-2 protein level was significantly down-regulated. CONCLUSION: Apatinib combined with cytarabine resists acute myeloid leukemia through synergistically regulating cell cycle and promoting apoptosis.","['Pan, Qing', 'Wang, Jiuhe', 'Jiang, Xianqin', 'Yang, Enqin', 'Dong, Lin', 'Gu, Kebin']","['Pan Q', 'Wang J', 'Jiang X', 'Yang E', 'Dong L', 'Gu K']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Jining No.2 People's Hospital, Jining 272049, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Pyridines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5S371K6132 (apatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2019 Jan-Feb;24(1):374-381.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BD OneFlow system builds on, and further standardizes, the EuroFlow protocols. We aimed to assess the effects on safety, efficiency, and costs for laboratories of adopting the BD OneFlow reagent tubes (LST and B-CLPD T1) for diagnosing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: We compared in-house laboratory processes and results with those using the LST and B-CLPD T1 reagent tubes with, and without, blood film morphology. Outcome measures included concordance in classification results, and efficiency within the laboratory, that is, resource usage, staff time, unwanted events, and cost-consequences. RESULTS: There was 100% concordance between the classifications made with in-house flow cytometry and those with the BD OneFlow reagent tubes. Using BD OneFlow tubes required 13 hours less staff time per month (i.e. for 100 samples) than the in-house process. Sensitivity analyses explored the effects of uncertainties in the price of the BD OneFlow tubes and the prevalence of CLL and identified the thresholds at which laboratories might expect cost-savings from adopting the BD OneFlow system. Laboratory and clinical staff considered the BD OneFlow system to be safe and effective. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories adopting the BD OneFlow system for classifying patients with suspected CLL can expect safe, efficient processes that can be cost saving if the discount on the list price, and prevalence of CLL (which will both vary between sites and countries), is within the thresholds suggested by the health economics sensitivity analysis.

We aim to define the features of this group. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study, including patients 18-45 years of age, diagnosed with Ph-negative MPN between 1985 and 2017. RESULTS: One hundred nine patients were included, 37 with polycythemia vera (34%), 54 with essential thrombocytosis (50%), 15 with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (14%), and 3 with MPN unclassifiable (3%). Median age was 33 years and 62 (57%) were females. During a median follow-up of 8 years, 39 patients (37%) had at least one thrombotic event. 30/39 of events were venous (77%), 23/30 of which were splanchnic (77%). In 14/39 (36%), thrombosis preceded MPN diagnosis. In a multivariable analysis, only splenomegaly predicted for thrombosis (HR 5.6, CI: 1.4-22). The 10-year risk for secondary myelofibrosis was similar for ET and PV (0.13 vs 0.19, P = 0.51). The 10-year risk for leukemic transformation or mortality was significantly higher for PMF (0.3, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The risks of mortality and of progression to MF/leukemia in young adults are similar to older population. Thrombotic events are frequently a presenting sign with a high incidence of venous, in particular splanchnic, events.","['Barzilai, Merav', 'Kirgner, Ilya', 'Avivi, Irit', 'Ellis, Martin', 'Dally, Najib', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'Lavi, Noa']","['Barzilai M', 'Kirgner I', 'Avivi I', 'Ellis M', 'Dally N', 'Rozovski U', 'Lavi N']","['Division of Hematology, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Sava, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology, Ziv Medical Center, Safad, Israel.', 'Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190425,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Thrombosis/diagnosis/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['essential thrombocytosis', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'polycythemia vera', 'young adults']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/11/16 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13232 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Jun;102(6):504-508. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13232.

Having widely overspent, stricter budgeting rules were introduced in 2016. The CDF can now only include treatments with potential to be cost effective once sufficient data are collected. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to explore the process and criteria used for consideration of treatments under the new CDF framework and to describe the extent of evidence collection. METHODS: We identified CDF list, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scottish Medicines Consortium documents (10 May 2018). Data were collected on drugs and indications, reasons for inclusion in the CDF, data collection, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and corresponding recommendations for Scotland. RESULTS: In total, 12 drugs were listed on the CDF in 17 indications, 12 of which were considered end-of-life care. The most common cancers were non-small-cell lung (n = 4), urothelial (n = 3), lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 2) and multiple myeloma (n = 2). The companies' ICERs were generally lower than those from the committee and the evidence review group. Drugs were included in the CDF for 6-42 months, with the majority included for >/=18 months. Data were frequently collected on overall survival (n = 16) and progression-free survival (n = 5) using NHS systems and, frequently, ongoing trials. CONCLUSIONS: Data collection frequently included overall survival and exceeded the 2 years recommended in the CDF strategy. It appears the CDF is allowing patients access to drugs long before they may become available for routine use. Our results are limited by the availability of published information and the small dataset.","['Sabry-Grant, Celia', 'Malottki, Kinga', 'Diamantopoulos, Alexander']","['Sabry-Grant C', 'Malottki K', 'Diamantopoulos A']","['Symmetron Limited, 8 Devonshire Square, London, EC2M 4PL, UK. csabrygrant@symmetron.net.', 'Symmetron Limited, 8 Devonshire Square, London, EC2M 4PL, UK.', 'Symmetron Limited, 8 Devonshire Square, London, EC2M 4PL, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Financial Management', 'Health Services Accessibility/*economics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/economics/pathology', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Scotland', 'Survival Rate', 'Terminal Care']",,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/05/08 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40273-019-00793-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s40273-019-00793-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2019 Jul;37(7):953-962. doi: 10.1007/s40273-019-00793-6.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5700-6265'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommends quantification of BCR-ABL1 transcripts by real-time quantitative PCR every 3 months during TKI treatment. Since a proportion of patients in deep molecular response (DMR: MR(4), MR(4.5), MR(5)) maintain remission after treatment stop, assessment of DMR is crucial. However, systematically collected molecular data, monitored with sensitive standardized assays, are not available outside clinical trials. METHODS: Data were collected on the standardized assessment of molecular response in the context of real-life practice. BCR-ABL1 transcript levels after > 2 years of TKI therapy were evaluated for DMR by local laboratories as well as standardized EUTOS laboratories. Since standardized molecular monitoring is a prerequisite for treatment discontinuation, central surveillance of the performance of the participating laboratories was carried out. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2017, 3377 peripheral blood samples from 1117 CML patients were shipped to 11 standardized reference laboratories in six European countries. BCR-ABL1 transcript types were b3a2 (41.63%), b2a2 (29.99%), b2a2/b3a2 (3.58%) and atypical (0.54%). For 23.72% of the patients, the initial transcript type had not been reported. Response levels (EUTOS laboratory) were: no MMR, n = 197 (6.51%); MMR, n = 496 (16.40%); MR(4), n = 685 (22.64%); MR(4.5), n = 937 (30.98%); MR(5), n = 710 (23.47%). With a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.708, a substantial agreement between EUTOS-certified and local laboratories was shown. CONCLUSIONS: Multicenter DMR assessment is feasible in the context of real-life clinical practice in Europe. Information on the BCR-ABL1 transcript type at diagnosis is crucial to accurately monitor patients' molecular response during or after TKI therapy.","['Mobius, Susanne', 'Schenk, Thomas', 'Himsel, Danny', 'Maier, Jacqueline', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Andrikovics, Hajnalka', 'Meggyesi, Nora', 'Machova-Polakova, Katerina', 'Zizkova, Hana', 'Jurcek, Tomas', 'Mesanovic, Semir', 'Zadro, Renata', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Haenig, Jens', 'Schuld, Peter', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas']","['Mobius S', 'Schenk T', 'Himsel D', 'Maier J', 'Franke GN', 'Saussele S', 'Pott C', 'Andrikovics H', 'Meggyesi N', 'Machova-Polakova K', 'Zizkova H', 'Jurcek T', 'Mesanovic S', 'Zadro R', 'Gottardi E', 'Haenig J', 'Schuld P', 'Cross NCP', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Universitat Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Universitat Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'III.

Nevertheless, recent data indicate that dysregulation of heme metabolism might promote tumorigenesis. The intracellular heme pool is finely regulated through the control of heme synthesis, degradation, incorporation into hemoproteins and trafficking across membranes. All these processes might be potentially targeted to alter endogenous heme content in order to counteract cancer growth. Nevertheless, these putative therapeutic interventions have to take into account the possibility of undesired side effects, such as the over-activation of heme-dependent enzymes involved in cancer. Among them, cyclooxygenase-2 is a prostaglandin-producing hemoprotein, induced during inflammation and in different types of tumor, particularly in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether modulation of endogenous heme may affect cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activity, taking advantage of two different approaches able to alter heme levels: the silencing of the heme exporter Feline Leukemia Virus subgroup C receptor 1 and the induction of heme synthesis by 5-aminolevulinic acid administration. Our data demonstrate that the down-regulation of the heme exporter in colorectal cancer cells does not affect cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activity. Conversely, 5-aminolevulinic acid administration results in decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression. However, the overall cyclooxygenase-2 enzymatic activity is maintained. The present work sheds light on the complex modulation of cyclooxygenase-2 by endogenous heme and support the idea that targeting heme metabolism could be a valuable therapeutic option against cancer.","['Destefanis, Francesca', 'Fiorito, Veronica', 'Altruda, Fiorella', 'Tolosano, Emanuela']","['Destefanis F', 'Fiorito V', 'Altruda F', 'Tolosano E']","['Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190319,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6433962,['NOTNLM'],"['ALA', 'COX2', 'FLVCR', 'FLVCR1', 'cancer', 'haem', 'heme', 'hemoprotein']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/04/04 06:01,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00162 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Mar 19;9:162. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00162. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This scenario is ideal as CD19 expression is homogeneous and human blood provides a favorable environment for CAR-T cells to thrive and destroy cancer cells (along with normal B cells). Yet, CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors remain challenged by fewer tumor targets and poor CAR-T cell performances in a hostile tumor microenvironment. For acute myeloid leukemia and childhood solid tumors such as osteosarcoma, the primary treatment is systemic chemotherapy that often falls short of expectation especially for relapsed and refractory conditions. We aim to develop a CAR-T adaptor molecule (CAM)-based therapy that uses a bispecific small-molecule ligand EC17, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with folic acid, to redirect FITC-specific CAR-T cells against folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors. As previously confirmed in rodents as well as in human clinical studies, EC17 penetrates solid tumors within minutes and is retained due to high affinity for the FR, whereas unbound EC17 rapidly clears from the blood and from receptor-negative tissues. When combined with a rationally designed CAR construct, EC17 CAM was shown to trigger CAR-modified T cell activation and cytolytic activity with a low FR threshold against tumor targets. However, maximal cytolytic potential correlated with (i) functional FR levels (in a semi-log fashion), (ii) the amount of effector cells present, and (iii) tumors' natural sensitivity to T cell mediated killing. In tumor-bearing mice, administration of EC17 CAM was the key to drive CAR-T cell activation, proliferation, and persistence against FR+ pediatric hematologic and solid tumors. In our modeling systems, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was induced under specific conditions, but the risk of severe CRS could be easily mitigated or prevented by applying intermittent dosing and/or dose-titration strategies for the EC17 CAM. Our approach offers the flexibility of antigen control, prevents T cell exhaustion, and provides additional safety mechanisms including rapid reversal of severe CRS with intravenous sodium fluorescein. In this paper, we summarize the translational aspects of our technology in support of clinical development.","['Lu, Yingjuan J', 'Chu, Haiyan', 'Wheeler, Leroy W', 'Nelson, Melissa', 'Westrick, Elaine', 'Matthaei, James F', 'Cardle, Ian I', 'Johnson, Adam', 'Gustafson, Joshua', 'Parker, Nikki', 'Vetzel, Marilynn', 'Xu, Le-Cun', 'Wang, Emilia Z', 'Jensen, Michael C', 'Klein, Patrick J', 'Low, Philip S', 'Leamon, Christopher P']","['Lu YJ', 'Chu H', 'Wheeler LW', 'Nelson M', 'Westrick E', 'Matthaei JF', 'Cardle II', 'Johnson A', 'Gustafson J', 'Parker N', 'Vetzel M', 'Xu LC', 'Wang EZ', 'Jensen MC', 'Klein PJ', 'Low PS', 'Leamon CP']","['Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research (BTCCCR), Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research (BTCCCR), Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research (BTCCCR), Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research (BTCCCR), Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States."", 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research (BTCCCR), Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States."", 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States.', 'Endocyte, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190319,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6433934,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T adaptor molecule', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'folate receptor', 'osteosarcoma']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/04/04 06:01,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00151 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Mar 19;9:151. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00151. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients follow an indolent clinical course with eventual progression and need for therapy. In contrast, T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare type of T-cell leukemia with most patients having an aggressive clinical course and a dismal prognosis. Therapies are limited for T-PLL patients and there is a high relapse rate. Morphologically, the cells of CLL and T-PLL can show overlapping features. Here, we report the case of a 61-year-old man who presented with a clinically indolent CLL and T-PLL, initially diagnosed solely and followed as CLL, despite the presence of an associated but unrecognized aberrant T-cell population in blood. After 2 years, the T-PLL component became more apparent with cutaneous and hematologic manifestations and the diagnosis was confirmed by immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated an ATM deletion in both CLL and T-PLL components. Retrospective testing demonstrated that composite CLL and T-PLL were both present in skin and lymph nodes as well as in blood and bone marrow since initial presentation. This case is also unique because it highlights that a subset of T-PLL patients can present with clinically indolent disease. The concomitant detection of ATM mutation in CLL and T-PLL components raises the possibility of a common pathogenic mechanism.","['Sakhdari, Ali', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Ginsberg, Lawrence E', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, Cheryl F', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Miranda, Roberto N']","['Sakhdari A', 'Tang G', 'Ginsberg LE', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg CF', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Miranda RN']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190303,United States,Case Rep Pathol,Case reports in pathology,101576609,,,,PMC6420994,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/04/04 06:01,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4915086 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Pathol. 2019 Mar 3;2019:4915086. doi: 10.1155/2019/4915086. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9482-4806', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8467-5464']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structurally identified from 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS data, majoranolide proved cytotoxic against cancer cells-MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (breast), HT-29 (colon), PC-3 (prostate), 786-0 (renal), and HL-60 (leukemia)-inhibiting growth in HL-60 cells (GI50 = 0.21 muM) and exhibiting higher selectivity for this line than for nonneoplastic NIH/3T3 murine fibroblasts. Effects on the cell cycle, caspase-3 activation, and plasma membrane integrity were evaluated by flow cytometry. Expression of genes related to apoptotic pathways (BAX, BCL2, BIRC5, and CASP8) was investigated using RT-qPCR. At 50 muM, majoranolide induced cell cycle arrest at G1 in 24 h increased the sub-G1 population in 48 h and increased caspase-3 activation in a time-dependent manner. The compound upregulated BAX and CASP8 transcription (proapoptotic genes) and downregulated BIRC5 (antiapoptotic). Loss of plasma membrane integrity in 30% of cells occurred at 48 h, but not at 24 h, characterizing gradual, programmed death. The results suggest that majoranolide cytotoxicity involves apoptosis induction in HL-60 cells, although other mechanisms may contribute to this cell death.","['Heemann, Lanna M', 'de Souza, Kamylla F S', 'Tofoli, Danilo', 'Filippin, Kelly J', 'Garcez, Walmir S', 'Matos, Maria de Fatima C', 'Garcez, Fernanda R', 'Perdomo, Renata T']","['Heemann LM', 'de Souza KFS', 'Tofoli D', 'Filippin KJ', 'Garcez WS', 'Matos MFC', 'Garcez FR', 'Perdomo RT']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cell Culture, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Food Technology, and Nutrition, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cell Culture, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Food Technology, and Nutrition, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cell Culture, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Food Technology, and Nutrition, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cell Culture, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Food Technology, and Nutrition, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cell Culture, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Food Technology, and Nutrition, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190303,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC6421045,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/04/04 06:01,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3464237 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2019 Mar 3;2019:3464237. doi: 10.1155/2019/3464237. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9283-7881', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8417-6956', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9131-3587', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9650-1509', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7883-4705', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4240-0849', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3995-4472', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2747-7039']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For patients with relapsed/refractory AML, the prognosis is particularly poor with currently available treatments. Although genetically heterogeneous, AML subtypes share a common differentiation arrest at hematopoietic progenitor stages. Overcoming this differentiation arrest has the potential to improve the long-term survival of patients, as is the case in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene. Treatment of APL with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces terminal differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic promyelocytes, resulting in cure rates of over 80%. Unfortunately, similarly efficacious differentiation therapies have, to date, been lacking outside of APL. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, was recently reported to induce differentiation of diverse AML subtypes. In this report we describe the discovery and characterization of BAY 2402234 - a novel, potent, selective and orally bioavailable DHODH inhibitor that shows monotherapy efficacy and differentiation induction across multiple AML subtypes. Herein, we present the preclinical data that led to initiation of a phase I evaluation of this inhibitor in myeloid malignancies.","['Christian, Sven', 'Merz, Claudia', 'Evans, Laura', 'Gradl, Stefan', 'Seidel, Henrik', 'Friberg, Anders', 'Eheim, Ashley', 'Lejeune, Pascale', 'Brzezinka, Krzysztof', 'Zimmermann, Katja', 'Ferrara, Steven', 'Meyer, Hanna', 'Lesche, Ralf', 'Stoeckigt, Detlef', 'Bauser, Marcus', 'Haegebarth, Andrea', 'Sykes, David B', 'Scadden, David T', 'Losman, Julie-Aurore', 'Janzer, Andreas']","['Christian S', 'Merz C', 'Evans L', 'Gradl S', 'Seidel H', 'Friberg A', 'Eheim A', 'Lejeune P', 'Brzezinka K', 'Zimmermann K', 'Ferrara S', 'Meyer H', 'Lesche R', 'Stoeckigt D', 'Bauser M', 'Haegebarth A', 'Sykes DB', 'Scadden DT', 'Losman JA', 'Janzer A']","['Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany. andreas.janzer@bayer.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Translocation, Genetic/drug effects']",,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0461-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0461-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Oct;33(10):2403-2415. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0461-5.

In this study, we aimed to delineate clinical, histopathological, and molecular features of h-MDS, based on a large and well-annotated cohort of patients with bone marrow (BM) hypocellularity. The study included 534 consecutive adult patients with hypocellular BM (278 h-MDS and 136 aplastic anemia), and 727 with normo- or hypercellular MDS (n-MDS). Comparison of clinical features of patients with h-MDS as defined by BM cellularity </=25% (n = 204) or reduced age-adjusted cellularity (n = 74) did not reveal significant differences. We developed a diagnostic score to discriminate h-MDS from non-malignant BMF based on histological and cytological variables with the highest specificity for MDS (h-score). The information from chromosomal abnormalities and somatic mutation patterns was then integrated into a cyto-histological/genetic score (hg-score). This score was able to segregate two groups of h-MDS with a significantly different risk of blast progression (P < 0.001). The integration of cyto-histological and genetic features in adult patients with hypocellular BM facilitated segregation into two distinct groups, one with clinical and genetic features highly consistent with myeloid neoplasm, and one with features more consistent with non-malignant BMF.","['Bono, Elisa', 'McLornan, Donal', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Gandhi, Shreyans', 'Galli, Anna', 'Khan, Alesia Abigael', 'Kulasekararaj, Austin G', 'Boveri, Emanuela', 'Raj, Kavita', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Ireland, Robin M', 'Bianchessi, Antonio', 'Jiang, Jie', 'Todisco, Gabriele', 'Ferretti, Virginia Valeria', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Marsh, Judith C W', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Bono E', 'McLornan D', 'Travaglino E', 'Gandhi S', 'Galli A', 'Khan AA', 'Kulasekararaj AG', 'Boveri E', 'Raj K', 'Elena C', 'Ireland RM', 'Bianchessi A', 'Jiang J', 'Todisco G', 'Ferretti VV', 'Cazzola M', 'Marsh JCW', 'Malcovati L', 'Mufti GJ']","['Department of Hematology, IRCCS Policlinico S.

However, little is known regarding the molecular characterization of lymphoma niches. Here, we focused on the interplay between MCL cells and the associated monocytes/macrophages. Using circulating MCL cells (n = 58), we showed that, through the secretion of CSF1 and, to a lesser extent, IL-10, MCL polarized monocytes into specific CD163(+) M2-like macrophages (MvarphiMCL). In turn, MvarphiMCL favored lymphoma survival and proliferation ex vivo. We next demonstrated that BTK inhibition abrogated CSF1 and IL-10 production in MCL cells, leading to the inhibition of macrophage polarization and consequently resulting in the suppression of microenvironment-dependent MCL expansion. In vivo, we showed that CSF1 and IL-10 plasma concentrations were higher in MCL patients than in healthy donors, and that monocytes from MCL patients overexpressed CD163. Further analyses of serial samples from ibrutinib-treated patients (n = 8) highlighted a rapid decrease of CSF1, IL-10, and CD163 in responsive patients. Finally, we showed that targeting the CSF1R abrogated MvarphiMCL-dependent MCL survival, irrespective of their sensitivity to ibrutinib. These data reinforced the role of the microenvironment in lymphoma and suggested that macrophages are a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies in MCL.","['Papin, Antonin', 'Tessoulin, Benoit', 'Bellanger, Celine', 'Moreau, Anne', 'Le Bris, Yannick', 'Maisonneuve, Herve', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Touzeau, Cyrille', 'Amiot, Martine', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, Catherine', 'Le Gouill, Steven', 'Chiron, David']","['Papin A', 'Tessoulin B', 'Bellanger C', 'Moreau A', 'Le Bris Y', 'Maisonneuve H', 'Moreau P', 'Touzeau C', 'Amiot M', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Le Gouill S', 'Chiron D']","[""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'GDR3697 Micronit, CNRS, Nantes, France.', ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, CHU, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'GDR3697 Micronit, CNRS, Nantes, France.', ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, CHU, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU, Nantes, France."", ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", 'Centre Hospitalier de la Roche sur Yon, La Roche sur Yon, France.', ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, CHU, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, CHU, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'GDR3697 Micronit, CNRS, Nantes, France.', ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'GDR3697 Micronit, CNRS, Nantes, France.', ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, CHU, Nantes, France."", ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France. david.chiron@univ-nantes.fr."", 'GDR3697 Micronit, CNRS, Nantes, France. david.chiron@univ-nantes.fr.', ""L'Hema-NexT, i-Site NexT, Nantes, France. david.chiron@univ-nantes.fr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (CSF1R protein, human)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0463-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0463-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Oct;33(10):2442-2453. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0463-3.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for the induction of cytokines by chemotherapy remain unknown. Here, we found that chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., Ara-C, DNR, 6-MP) induced the expression of niche-protecting cytokines (GDF15, CCL3 and CCL4) in both ALL cell lines and primary cells in vitro. The ATM and NF-kappaB pathways were activated after chemotherapy treatment, and the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of these pathways significantly reversed the cytokine upregulation. Besides, chemotherapy-induced NF-kappaB activation was dependent on ATM-TRAF6 signaling, and NF-kappaB transcription factor p65 directly regulated the cytokines expression. Furthermore, we found that both pharmacological and genetic perturbation of ATM and p65 significantly decreased the residual ALL cells after Ara-C treatment in ALL xenograft mouse models. Together, these results demonstrated that ATM-dependent NF-kappaB activation mediated the cytokines induction by chemotherapy and ALL resistance to chemotherapeutics.

We used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase system to identify activated oncogenes in hematologic cancers in wild-type mice and mice that express a stabilized cyclin E protein (termed cyclin ET74AT393A). Cyclin E governs cell division and is misregulated in human cancers. Cyclin ET74AT393A mice develop ineffective erythropoiesis that resembles early-stage human myelodysplastic syndrome, and we sought to identify oncogenes that might cooperate with cyclin E hyperactivity in leukemogenesis. SB activation in hematopoietic precursors caused T-cell leukemia/lymphomas (T-ALL) and pure red blood cell erythroleukemias (EL). Analysis of >12,000 SB integration sites revealed markedly different oncogene activations in EL and T-ALL: Notch1 and Ikaros were most common in T-ALL, whereas ETS transcription factors (Erg and Ets1) were targeted in most ELs. Cyclin E status did not impact leukemogenesis or oncogene activations. Whereas most SB insertions were lost during culture of EL cell lines, Erg insertions were retained, indicating Erg's key role in these neoplasms. Surprisingly, cyclin ET74AT393A conferred growth factor independence and altered Erg-dependent differentiation in EL cell lines. These studies provide new molecular insights into erythroid leukemia and suggest potential therapeutic targets for human leukemia.","['Loeb, Keith R', 'Hughes, Bridget T', 'Fissel, Brian M', 'Osteen, Nyka J', 'Knoblaugh, Sue E', 'Grim, Jonathan E', 'Drury, Luke J', 'Sarver, Aaron', 'Dupuy, Adam J', 'Clurman, Bruce E']","['Loeb KR', 'Hughes BT', 'Fissel BM', 'Osteen NJ', 'Knoblaugh SE', 'Grim JE', 'Drury LJ', 'Sarver A', 'Dupuy AJ', 'Clurman BE']","['Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, 98108, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA.', 'Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA. bclurman@fredhutch.org.', 'Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA. bclurman@fredhutch.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190402,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Transposases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cyclin E/*genetics', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/genetics', 'Transposases/*genetics']",PMC6445099,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-41805-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-41805-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Apr 2;9(1):5488. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-41805-x.,,,,"['R01 CA193808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA229922/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Cancer Institute (NCI)/International', 'P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211249/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK 56465/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (National Institute of', 'Diabetes &amp; Digestive &amp; Kidney Diseases)/International', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 9,544 transcriptomes from more than 30 hematologic malignancies, normal blood cell types, and cell lines, and showed that disease types could be stratified in a data-driven manner. We then identified cluster-specific pathway activity, new biomarkers, and in silico drug target prioritization through interrogation of drug target databases. Using known vulnerabilities and available drug screens, we highlighted the importance of integrating molecular phenotype with drug target expression for in silico prediction of drug responsiveness. Our analysis implicated BCL2 expression level as an important indicator of venetoclax responsiveness and provided a rationale for its targeting in specific leukemia subtypes and multiple myeloma, linked several polycomb group proteins that could be targeted by small molecules (SFMBT1, CBX7, and EZH1) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and supported CDK6 as a disease-specific target in acute myeloid leukemia. Through integration with proteomics data, we characterized target protein expression for pre-B leukemia immunotherapy candidates, including DPEP1. These molecular data can be explored using our publicly available interactive resource, Hemap, for expediting therapeutic innovations in hematologic malignancies.

Noninvasive imaging methods that can quantify DCK activity are invaluable for assessing tumor resistance and predicting treatment efficacy. Here we developed a ""natural"" MRI approach to detect DCK activity using its natural substrate deoxycytidine (dC) as the imaging probe, which can be detected directly by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI without any synthetic labeling. CEST MRI contrast of dC and its phosphorylated form, dCTP, successfully discriminated DCK activity in two mouse leukemia cell lines with different DCK expression. This dC-enhanced CEST MRI in xenograft leukemic cancer mouse models demonstrated that DCK(+) tumors have a distinctive dynamic CEST contrast enhancement and a significantly higher CEST contrast than DCK(-) tumors (AUC(0-60 min) = 0.47 +/- 0.25 and 0.20 +/- 0.13, respectively; P = 0.026, paired Student t test, n = 4) at 1 hour after the injection of dC. dC-enhanced CEST contrast also correlated well with tumor responses to gemcitabine treatment. This study demonstrates a novel MR molecular imaging approach for predicting cancer resistance using natural, nonradioactive, nonmetallic, and clinically available agents. This method has great potential for pursuing personalized chemotherapy by stratifying patients with different DCK activity. SIGNIFICANCE: A new molecular MRI method that detects deoxycytidine kinase activity using its natural substrate deoxycytidine has great translational potential for clinical assessment of tumor resistance and prediction of treatment efficacy.","['Han, Zheng', 'Li, Yuguo', 'Zhang, Jia', 'Liu, Jing', 'Chen, Chuheng', 'van Zijl, Peter C', 'Liu, Guanshu']","['Han Z', 'Li Y', 'Zhang J', 'Liu J', 'Chen C', 'van Zijl PC', 'Liu G']","['Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'F.M.

AML is poorly responsive to conventional chemotherapy and a diagnosis of AML is usually fatal. More effective and less toxic forms of therapy are desperately needed. AML cells are known to be highly dependent on the amino acid glutamine for their survival. These studies were directed at determining the effects of glutaminase inhibition on metabolism in AML and identifying general weaknesses that can be exploited therapeutically. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: AML cancer cell lines, primary AML cells, and mouse models of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were utilized. RESULTS: We show that blocking glutamine metabolism through the use of a glutaminase inhibitor (CB-839) significantly impairs antioxidant glutathione production in multiple types of AML, resulting in accretion of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) and apoptotic cell death. Moreover, glutaminase inhibition makes AML cells susceptible to adjuvant drugs that further perturb mitochondrial redox state, such as arsenic trioxide (ATO) and homoharringtonine (HHT). Indeed, the combination of ATO or HHT with CB-839 exacerbates mitoROS and apoptosis, and leads to more complete cell death in AML cell lines, primary AML patient samples, and in vivo using mouse models of AML. In addition, these redox-targeted combination therapies are effective in eradicating ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting glutamine metabolism in combination with drugs that perturb mitochondrial redox state represents an effective and potentially widely applicable therapeutic strategy for treating multiple types of leukemia.","['Gregory, Mark A', 'Nemkov, Travis', 'Park, Hae J', 'Zaberezhnyy, Vadym', 'Gehrke, Sarah', 'Adane, Biniam', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Hansen, Kirk C', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'DeGregori, James']","['Gregory MA', 'Nemkov T', 'Park HJ', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Gehrke S', 'Adane B', 'Jordan CT', 'Hansen KC', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado. james.degregori@ucdenver.edu mark.gregory@ucdenver.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado. james.degregori@ucdenver.edu mark.gregory@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190402,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Glutamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Oxidation-Reduction/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6642698,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/08/06 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-3223 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3223 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 1;25(13):4079-4090. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3223.

The clinical importance of CD38 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been known for over 2 decades, although it's relevance as a therapeutic target in CLL remains understudied. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the biological effects and antitumor mechanisms engaged by daratumumab in primary CLL cells. Besides its known immune-effector mechanisms (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent death, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis), we also measured direct apoptotic effects of daratumumab alone or in combination with ibrutinib. In vivo antileukemic activity was assessed in a partially humanized xenograft model. The influence of CD38 on B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling was measured via immunoblotting of Lyn, Syk, BTK, PLCgamma2, ERK1/2, and AKT. RESULTS: In addition to immune-effector mechanisms; daratumumab also induced direct apoptosis of primary CLL cells, which was partially dependent on FcgammaR cross-linking. For the first time, we demonstrated the influence of CD38 on BCR signaling where interference of CD38 downregulated Syk, BTK, PLCgamma2, ERK1/2, and AKT; effects that were further enhanced by addition of ibrutinib. In comparison to single-agent treatment, the combination of ibrutinib and daratumumab resulted in significantly enhanced anti-CLL activity in vitro and significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival in the in vivo CLL xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrate the antitumor mechanisms of daratumumab in CLL; furthermore, we show how cotargeting BTK and CD38 lead to a robust anti-CLL effect, which has clinical implications.","['Manna, Alak', 'Aulakh, Sonikpreet', 'Jani, Prachi', 'Ahmed, Salman', 'Akhtar, Sharoon', 'Coignet, Marie', 'Heckman, Michael', 'Meghji, Zahara', 'Bhatia, Kirtipal', 'Sharma, Aarushi', 'Sher, Taimur', 'Alegria, Victoria', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Chini, Eduardo N', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher', 'Ailawadhi, Sikander', 'Paulus, Aneel']","['Manna A', 'Aulakh S', 'Jani P', 'Ahmed S', 'Akhtar S', 'Coignet M', 'Heckman M', 'Meghji Z', 'Bhatia K', 'Sharma A', 'Sher T', 'Alegria V', 'Malavasi F', 'Chini EN', 'Chanan-Khan A', 'Ailawadhi S', 'Paulus A']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Department of Cancer Prevention & Control, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Lab of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Science, University of Torino, Italy.', 'Signal Transduction Laboratory, Kogod Aging Center, Department of Anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida. paulus.aneel@mayo.edu chanan-khan.asher@mayo.edu.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', ""Mayo Clinic Cancer Center at St. Vincent's Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida. paulus.aneel@mayo.edu chanan-khan.asher@mayo.edu.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190402,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4Z63YK6E0E (daratumumab)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6744942,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/08/06 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-3412 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3412 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 1;25(13):3974-3985. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3412.

Here, we report a germline deletion of ETV6 identified by linkage and structural variant analysis of whole-genome sequencing data segregating in a kindred with thrombocytopenia, B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The 75-nt deletion removed the ETV6 exon 7 splice acceptor, resulting in exon skipping and protein truncation. The ETV6 deletion was also identified by optimal structural variant analysis of exome sequencing data. These findings identify a new mechanism of germline predisposition in ALL and implicate ETV6 germline variation in predisposition to lymphoma. Importantly, these data highlight the importance of germline structural variant analysis in the search for germline variants predisposing to familial leukemia.","['Rampersaud, Evadnie', 'Ziegler, David S', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Churchman, Michelle L', 'Schrader, Kasmintan A', 'Joseph, Vijai', 'Offit, Kenneth', 'Tucker, Katherine', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Warby, Meera', 'Chenevix-Trench, Georgia', 'Huntsman, David G', 'Tsoli, Maria', 'Mead, R Scott', 'Qu, Chunxu', 'Leventaki, Vasiliki', 'Wu, Gang', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Rampersaud E', 'Ziegler DS', 'Iacobucci I', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Churchman ML', 'Schrader KA', 'Joseph V', 'Offit K', 'Tucker K', 'Sutton R', 'Warby M', 'Chenevix-Trench G', 'Huntsman DG', 'Tsoli M', 'Mead RS', 'Qu C', 'Leventaki V', 'Wu G', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", 'Childrens Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN."", 'Department of Molecular Oncology, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Hereditary Cancer Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Childrens Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Hereditary Cancer Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School University of NSW Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Computational Biology, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; and.', 'Childrens Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'South Eastern Area Laboratory Service, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exome/genetics', 'Family', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Thrombocytopenia/genetics']",PMC6457220,,,,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018030635 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018030635 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Apr 9;3(7):1039-1046. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018030635.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5195-5366', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7451-7916', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1878-2587', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1850']",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CIHR/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been demonstrated to exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in various human cancer types. The aim of our study was to investigate whether piceatannol induces autophagy and apoptosis in MOLT-4 human leukemia cells. Our results revealed that piceatannol activated autophagy in MOLT-4 cells, as evidenced by the detection of an increased level of LC3-II protein and a concomitant decrease in p62/SQSTM1 protein level. Moreover, piceatannol induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells which was accompanied by phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of cell nuclei. However, the toxic effects exerted by piceatannol in MOLT4 cells diminished after longer periods of exposure to the compound. Our findings imply that MOLT-4 cells may acquire resistance to piceatannol toxicity, which may result from the induction of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein. The present study provides new data showing that the use of piceatannol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia may be associated with the risk of multidrug resistance.","['Siedlecka-Kroplewska, Kamila', 'Slebioda, Tomasz', 'Kmiec, Zbigniew']","['Siedlecka-Kroplewska K', 'Slebioda T', 'Kmiec Z']","['Department of Histology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.

In the present research the authors evaluated its ability to destroy leukemic cancer (Jurkat E6-1) cells, using the alkaloid extract of this plant. METHODS: Constituents of the alkaloid extract were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and their cytotoxicity in leukemic cancer cells and healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed. Cell death via apoptosis was confirmed by DNA laddering, caspase-3 activity, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and mitochondrial toxicity assays. The specific course of gene activation in treated cells was determined through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: GC-MS analysis identified six alkaloids and proto-alkaloids, namely, benzyl isothiocyanate (1), 2-ethoxy-4H-3,1-benzoxazin-4-one (2), (4R)-2-(2-aminophenyl)-4-phenyloxazoline (3), 5-acetyl-1,2-dihydro-6-methyl-2-oxo-4-phenyl-3-pyridinecarbonitrile (4), benzo[b][1,8]-naphthyridin-5(10H)-one,2,4,7-trimethyl (5) and 1,4-diaminoanthraquinone (6), in the alkaloid extract of L. sativum. Of these, compound 1 was previously identified in the seeds of L. sativum. Exposure to the alkaloid extract caused death of Jurkat E6-1 cells, with median lethal concentration (LC50) of 75.25microg/mL. However, the alkaloid extract also showed a nontoxic and proliferative (1.6-fold) effect in healthy PBMCs. Further experiments performed with Jurkat cells at LC50 and sub-LC50 doses demonstrated DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3 and time-dependant phosphatidylserine translocation (apoptosis) from inner to outer cell membranes. Cell toxicity and assessment of adenosine triphosphate level, together with using qPCR to evaluate expression profile of major apoptosis genes, revealed that apoptosis may be induced by disruption in the mitochondrial outer membrane potential, through activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways in Jurkat cells. CONCLUSION: The ability of the alkaloid extract of L. sativum seeds to induce apoptosis indicates a potential pharmacological use in cancer chemotherapy. The separation of individual active compounds and further in-depth exploration of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis may lead to novel chemotherapeutic compounds in our future antineoplastic research.","['Basaiyye, Shriniwas S', 'Kashyap, Sanjay', 'Krishnamurthi, Kannan', 'Sivanesan, Saravanadevi']","['Basaiyye SS', 'Kashyap S', 'Krishnamurthi K', 'Sivanesan S']","['Environmental Health Division, CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur 440 020, India.

Here, we investigated the mechanisms of IFNa efficacy in JAK2V617F- vs. BCR-ABL-positive cells. METHODS: Gene expression microarrays and RT-qPCR of PV vs. CML patient PBMCs and CD34+ cells and of the murine cell line 32D expressing JAK2V617F or BCR-ABL were used to analyze and compare interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Furthermore, using CRISPR/Cas9n technology, targeted disruption of STAT1 or STAT2, respectively, was performed in 32D-BCR-ABL and 32D-JAK2V617F cells to evaluate the role of these transcription factors for IFNa efficacy. The knockout cell lines were reconstituted with STAT1, STAT2, STAT1Y701F, or STAT2Y689F to analyze the importance of wild-type and phosphomutant STATs for the IFNa response. ChIP-seq and ChIP were performed to correlate histone marks with ISG expression. RESULTS: Microarray analysis and RT-qPCR revealed significant upregulation of ISGs in 32D-JAK2V617F but downregulation in 32D-BCR-ABL cells, and these effects were reversed by tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Similar expression patterns were confirmed in human cell lines, primary PV and CML patient PBMCs and CD34+ cells, demonstrating that these effects are operational in patients. IFNa treatment increased Stat1, Stat2, and Irf9 mRNA as well as pY-STAT1 in all cell lines; however, viability was specifically decreased in 32D-JAK2V617F. STAT1 or STAT2 knockout and reconstitution with wild-type or phospho-deficient STAT mutants demonstrated the necessity of STAT2 for IFNa-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in BCR-ABL- but not in JAK2V617F-expressing cells. STAT1 was essential for IFNa activity in both BCR-ABL- and JAK2V617F-positive cells. Furthermore, ChIP experiments demonstrate higher repressive and lower active chromatin marks at the promoters of ISGs in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS: JAK2V617F but not BCR-ABL sensitizes MPN cells to interferon, and this effect was dependent on STAT1. Moreover, STAT2 is a survival factor in BCR-ABL- and JAK2V617F-positive cells but an IFNa-sensitizing factor solely in 32D-JAK2V617F cells by upregulation of STAT1 expression.","['Schubert, Claudia', 'Allhoff, Manuel', 'Tillmann, Stefan', 'Maie, Tiago', 'Costa, Ivan G', 'Lipka, Daniel B', 'Schemionek, Mirle', 'Feldberg, Kristina', 'Baumeister, Julian', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Chatain, Nicolas', 'Koschmieder, Steffen']","['Schubert C', 'Allhoff M', 'Tillmann S', 'Maie T', 'Costa IG', 'Lipka DB', 'Schemionek M', 'Feldberg K', 'Baumeister J', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Chatain N', 'Koschmieder S']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Regulation of Cellular Differentiation Group, Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany. skoschmieder@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190402,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/*genetics']",PMC6444528,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*CRISPR/Cas9', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*IFNa', '*ISG', '*JAK2V617F', '*MPN', '*Polycythemia vera', '*STAT factors']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-019-0722-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-019-0722-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Apr 2;12(1):36. doi: 10.1186/s13045-019-0722-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human infection with BLV has been reported in breast and lung cancer tissues and was significantly associated with breast cancer in 3 case-control studies. The purpose of this current research was to determine if BLV is present in human blood cells and if antibodies to BLV are related to blood cell infection. METHODS: Standard liquid PCR and Sanger DNA sequencing were used to test for BLV in buffy coat cells (leukocytes and platelets) of blood specimens from 95 self-selected female subjects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG, IgM, and IgA was used to detect antibodies to BLV in the plasma of the corresponding blood samples. RESULTS: BLV DNA was detected in the buffy coat cells of blood in 33/95 (38%) of the subjects by PCR and DNA sequencing. IgG antibodies were detected in 30/95(32%), IgM in 55/95(58%), and IgA in 30/95(32%) of the subjects. There was no significant correlation between presence of the antibodies and presence of BLV DNA. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of BLV in human blood raises the question of whether infection of leukocytes could conceivably lead to leukemia as it does in infected cattle. Also, system wide circulation of infected blood cells could facilitate BLV transit to various internal tissues/organs with potential for their infection and subsequent development of cancer. The most likely route of BLV transmission to humans would be zoonotic, as a foodborne infection. Although eradicated from cattle in some countries, BLV still has a high rate of infection in the Americas, the Middle East, and parts of Europe and Asia. This report of BLV in the blood layer containing human leukocytes/platelets adds important information which could be useful to elucidate possible routes of transmission of BLV to humans and to prevent further human infection.","['Buehring, Gertrude C', 'DeLaney, Anne', 'Shen, HuaMin', 'Chu, David L', 'Razavian, Niema', 'Schwartz, Daniel A', 'Demkovich, Zach R', 'Bates, Michael N']","['Buehring GC', 'DeLaney A', 'Shen H', 'Chu DL', 'Razavian N', 'Schwartz DA', 'Demkovich ZR', 'Bates MN']","['School of Public Health, University of California, 16 Barker Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-7354, USA. buehring@berkeley.edu.', 'Kaiser Permanente Medical Cente, San Rafael, CA, USA.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, 16 Barker Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-7354, USA.', 'Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Oakland, MI, USA.', 'University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Joint Medical Program, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'RTI International, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, 16 Barker Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720-7354, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190402,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Blood Buffy Coat/virology', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC6444872,['NOTNLM'],"['Bovine leukemia virus', 'Human blood', 'Zoonotic infection']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-019-3891-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-019-3891-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Apr 2;19(1):297. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-3891-9.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8868-7390'],,,['#R03CA117318-02/National Cancer Institute'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and methods: The CEA was performed using a decision tree model with a lifetime horizon. The model explores the cost-effectiveness of rasburicase vs SOC for both preventing TLS and treating established TLS among pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Both the prophylaxis-use model and treatment-use model incorporate long-term health states of the diseases: survival without TLS and death. The efficacy data of rasburicase and SOC were obtained from published literature. Drug costs, healthcare resource utilization (HRU), and adverse event (AE) management costs were obtained via a published study with clinical experts. Costs in US dollar and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are reported, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated. Uncertainties due to parameter fluctuations in the model were assessed through one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Results: During TLS prevention, compared with SOC, the ICER of rasburicase treatment in China are $17,580.04/QALY, $5,783.45/QALY, and $5,391.00/QALY for pediatric patients with AML, ALL, and NHL, respectively. For the established TLS treatment, compared with SOC, the ICERs of rasburicase treatment are $2,031.18/QALY, $1,142.93/QALY, and $990.37/QALY for pediatric patients with AML, ALL, and NHL, respectively. Limitations: The clinical data for SOC are based on the published study in China, and the rasburicase prevention or treatment failure rate was either calculated based on the risk ratio or directly from the clinical study among non-Chinese pediatric patients. Another study limitation was the lack of utility data for pediatric patients with TLS and without TLS. Thus, the utility scores of pediatric cancer survivors were used as an alternative. Conclusion: Rasburicase is estimated to be a cost-effective alternative to SOC in the prevention and treatment of TLS among Chinese pediatric patients with AML, ALL, and NHL.","['Hu, Shaoyan', 'Han, Yi', 'Zhang, Wenjie', 'Zhang, Tianxiang', 'Yao, Xingxing', 'Liu, Li']","['Hu S', 'Han Y', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang T', 'Yao X', 'Liu L']","[""a Department of Hematology , Children's Hospital of Suzhou University , Suzhou , PR China."", 'b Market Access , WPP Health , Shanghai , PR China.', 'b Market Access , WPP Health , Shanghai , PR China.', 'b Market Access , WPP Health , Shanghai , PR China.', 'c Department of Health Economics and Outcome Research , Sanofi , Shanghai , PR China.', 'c Department of Health Economics and Outcome Research , Sanofi , Shanghai , PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190430,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,"['0 (Gout Suppressants)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'China', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Gout Suppressants/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Health Resources/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Standard of Care', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*drug therapy/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/*economics/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['C51', 'C52', 'Tumor lysis syndrome', 'cost-effectiveness', 'prevention', 'rasburicase', 'treatment']",,2019/04/04 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2019/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2019.1603155 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2019 Aug;22(8):742-750. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2019.1603155.

It has become clear that preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis (CH), characterized by an expansion of stem and progenitor cells that carry somatic mutations but are still capable of normal differentiation, can precede the development of clinically overt myeloid neoplasia by many years. CH commonly develops in the aging hematopoietic system, yet progression to myelodysplasia or AML is rare. The discovery that myeloid neoplasms frequently develop from premalignant precursor conditions that are detectable in many healthy individuals has important consequences for the diagnosis, and potentially for the treatment of these disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on CH as a precursor of myeloid cancers and the implications of CH-related gene mutations in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected myelodysplastic syndrome. We will discuss the risk of progression associated with CH in healthy persons and in patients undergoing chemotherapy for a non-hematologic cancer, and the significance of CH in autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Among them, compound 9u possessed nanomolar FLT3 inhibitory activities and subnanomolar inhibitory activities against MV4-11 and Molm-13 cells. It also showed excellent inhibitory activities in FLT3-ITD-D835V and FLT3-ITD-F691L cells which were resistant to quizartinib. Furthermore, 9u exhibited over 40-fold selectivity toward FLT3 relative to c-Kit kinase, which might reduce myelosuppression toxicity. Cellular assays demonstrated that 9u inhibited phosphorylated FLT3 and downstream signaling factors and also induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 stage and apoptosis in MV4-11 and Molm-13 cells. Oral administration of 9u at 10 mg/kg could achieve rapid tumor extinction in the MV4-11 xenograft model and significantly inhibit the tumor growth in the MOLM-13 xenograft model with a tumor growth inhibitory rate of 96% without obvious toxicity. Additionally, 9u demonstrated high bioavailability ( F = 59.5%) and suitable eliminated half-life time ( T1/2 = 2.06 h), suggesting that 9u may be a potent candidate for treating acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Yuan, Xue', 'Chen, Yong', 'Zhang, Wanhua', 'He, Jun', 'Lei, Lei', 'Tang, Minghai', 'Liu, Jiang', 'Li, Muzhou', 'Dou, Caixia', 'Yang, Tao', 'Yang, Linyu', 'Yang, Shengyong', 'Wei, Yuquan', 'Peng, Aihua', 'Niu, Ting', 'Xiang, Mingli', 'Ye, Haoyu', 'Chen, Lijuan']","['Yuan X', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang W', 'He J', 'Lei L', 'Tang M', 'Liu J', 'Li M', 'Dou C', 'Yang T', 'Yang L', 'Yang S', 'Wei Y', 'Peng A', 'Niu T', 'Xiang M', 'Ye H', 'Chen L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190415,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidine)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00223 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Apr 25;62(8):4158-4173. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00223.

In the last decade, there has been a progressive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease, which has led to discovery of potential therapeutic targets, resulting in selective treatment approaches aimed at rational and personalized treatment strategies. In the last 2 years, different new agents for AML have become widely available for newly diagnosed or relapsing/refractory patients, and others are object of clinical investigation. For most treatment-naive patients, it is now evident that standard 3 + 7 represents undertreatment in that the addition of new compounds results in better quality of response and improved survival.

Although risk loci have been identified for B-ALL, the inherited basis of T-ALL is mostly unknown, with a particular paucity of genome-wide investigation of susceptibility variants in large patient cohorts. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1191 children with T-ALL and 12 178 controls, with independent replication using 117 cases and 5518 controls. The associations were tested using an additive logistic regression model. Top risk variants were tested for effects on enhancer activity using luciferase assay. All statistical tests were two sided. RESULTS: A novel risk locus in the USP7 gene (rs74010351, odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 1.65, P = 4.51 x 10-8) reached genome-wide significance in the discovery cohort, with independent validation (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.22, P = .04). The USP7 risk allele was overrepresented in individuals of African descent, thus contributing to the higher incidence of T-ALL in this race/ethnic group. Genetic changes in USP7 (germline variants or somatic mutations) were observed in 56.4% of T-ALL with TAL1 overexpression, statistically significantly higher than in any other subtypes. Functional analyses suggested this T-ALL risk allele is located in a putative cis-regulatory DNA element with negative effects on USP7 transcription. Finally, comprehensive comparison of 14 susceptibility loci in T- vs B-ALL pointed to distinctive etiology of these leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate strong associations between inherited genetic variation and T-ALL susceptibility in children and shed new light on the molecular etiology of ALL, particularly commonalities and differences in the biology of the two major subtypes (B- vs T-ALL).","['Qian, Maoxiang', 'Zhao, Xujie', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Gocho, Yoshihiro', 'Smith, Colton', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Li, Yizhen', 'Xu, Heng', 'Zhang, Shouyue', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Zhai, Xiaowen', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Dunsmore, Kimberly P', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Carroll, William L', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Zweidler-Mckay, Patrick A', 'Wood, Brent', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Evans, William E', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Qian M', 'Zhao X', 'Devidas M', 'Yang W', 'Gocho Y', 'Smith C', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Li Y', 'Xu H', 'Zhang S', 'Jeha S', 'Zhai X', 'Sanda T', 'Winter SS', 'Dunsmore KP', 'Raetz EA', 'Carroll WL', 'Winick NJ', 'Rabin KR', 'Zweidler-Mckay PA', 'Wood B', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE', 'Hunger SP', 'Mullighan CG', 'Relling MV', 'Loh ML', 'Yang JJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Blacks', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Genes, p16', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7/*genetics']",PMC6910193,,,,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['5424170 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djz043 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Dec 1;111(12):1350-1357. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djz043.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Therapeutic and molecular advances have substantially improved the treatment for subtypes of B-ALL, such that subclassification by cytogenetic and molecular alterations is critical for risk stratification and management. Novel rearrangements involving ABL1, JAK2, EPO, and other kinases have been identified that may respond to inhibition akin to BCR-ABL1. This diverse group of leukemias has been recognized as a provisional entity in the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of the Hematopoietic Neoplasms as B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1-like (Ph-like B-ALL).

We and others have previously reported on safety and efficacy of autologous CD19-targeted CAR T-cells for these patients; here we report safety and long-term follow-up of CAR T-cell therapy with or without conditioning chemotherapy for patients with R/R CLL and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial investigating CD19-targeted CAR T-cells incorporating a CD28 costimulatory domain (19-28z). Seventeen of 20 patients received conditioning chemotherapy prior to CAR T-cell infusion. Five patients with CLL received ibrutinib at the time of autologous T-cell collection and/or CAR T-cell administration. RESULTS: This analysis included 16 patients with R/R CLL and 4 patients with R/R indolent B-NHL. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in all 20 patients but grades 3 and 4 CRS and neurological events were uncommon (10% for each). Ex vivo expansion of T-cells and proportions of CD4+/CD8+ CAR T-cells with CD62L+CD127+ immunophenotype were significantly greater in patients on ibrutinib at leukapheresis. Three of 12 evaluable CLL patients receiving conditioning chemotherapy achieved CR (two had minimal residual disease-negative CR). All patients achieving CR remained progression-free at median follow-up of 53 months. CONCLUSION: Conditioning chemotherapy and 19-28z CAR T-cells were acceptably tolerated across investigated dose levels in heavily pretreated patients with R/R CLL and indolent B-NHL, and a subgroup of patients achieved durable CR. Ibrutinib therapy may modulate autologous T-cell phenotype. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00466531.

While recent studies have focused on the role of LIF in osteoblast differentiation, the exact role of LIFR during the early stage of osteogenic differentiation remains unclear. We observed that LIFR expression gradually decreased during the early stage of osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. To evaluate how LIFR regulates osteogenic differentiation in greater depth, we transfected hMSCs with LIFR overexpression and siRNA lentiviral plasmids. Cells were divided into four groups: a negative overexpression control group, a LIFR overexpression group, a negative siRNA control group, and a LIFR siRNA group. On different days (0, 3, and 6) of the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was assayed with an ALP staining and activity assay kit. Cells were harvested to assess the mRNA and protein expression of LIF, LIFR, and osteogenesis-related factors (ALP; RUNX2; osteonectin) by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. In addition, culture supernatants were tested for the LIF content by ELISA. Our results showed that overexpression of LIFR significantly suppressed the osteoblast differentiation of hMSCs. In contrast, LIFR siRNA markedly improved this osteoblast differentiation as determined by ALP staining and activity measurements. Moreover, RUNX2, ALP, and ONN expression was also significantly changed by altering LIFR expression. We further analysed the expression of LIF and LIFR, revealing consistent LIF and LIFR trends during the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Together, these results suggested that LIFR may be a novel negative regulator during the early stage of hMSC osteogenic differentiation.","['Wang, T', 'Yan, R Q', 'Xu, X Y', 'Cao, L L', 'Liu, J Y', 'Zheng, M R', 'Li, W D']","['Wang T', 'Yan RQ', 'Xu XY', 'Cao LL', 'Liu JY', 'Zheng MR', 'Li WD']","[""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Skills Center, Affiliated Hospital of Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Jiujiang Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Jiujiang Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', '*Osteogenesis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,,,,2018/01/01 00:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['FB2018A0023 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2018;64(5-6):186-194.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The size of nuclear regions occupied by nucleolar bodies decreased during the differentiation and maturation of leukaemic lymphocytes, but was constant for each differentiation or maturation stage. The present study was undertaken to provide more information on the approximate size of the nuclear regions occupied by nucleolar bodies in leukaemic granulocytic progenitors. Myeloblasts of established Kasumi 1 and K 562 cell lineages originating from human myeloid leukaemias were convenient models for such study because they represented only one and early differentiation stage of granulocytic progenitors. According to the results, the maximal and mean nucleolar body : maximal and mean nuclear diameter ratios in myeloblasts without heavy nuclear alterations were stable and not markedly influenced by the anti-leukaemic treatment or aging. Thus, the roughly estimated size of nuclear regions occupied by nucleolar bodies in these cells appeared to be similar and stable regardless of aging or anti-leukaemic treatment. In contrast, the anti-leukaemic treatment or aging in such myeloblasts induced marked reduction of the nucleolar biosynthetic activity reflected by the decreased number of nucleolar fibrillar centres.","['Smetana, K', 'Otevrelova, P', 'Kuzelova, K', 'Zapotocky, M']","['Smetana K', 'Otevrelova P', 'Kuzelova K', 'Zapotocky M']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology of the Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleolus/*pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology']",,,,,2018/01/01 00:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['FB2018A0022 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2018;64(5-6):182-185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate whether HTLV-1 PVL is also important for the development of ATL among HTLV-1-positive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Methods: We established a cohort of 82 HTLV-1-positive RA patients between 2017 and 2018. Of those, 27 (32.9%) were treated with biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) with/without methotrexate. We measured HTLV-1 PVL in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at study entry and compared the value by clinical status and treatment options.Results: The median PVL for all was 9.6 copies per 1000 PBMCs without sex difference (male 17.2 and female 8.6; p = .24). The median PVL was significantly higher for patient's comorbid bronchiectasis, malignancies, and opportunistic infectious diseases, compared with patients without comorbidity. There were no significant differences in PVL levels among types of bDMARDs, although the level was tended to be higher for patients treated with JAK inhibitor.Conclusions: HTLV-1 seropositive RA patients comorbid for any diseases having higher HTLV-1 PVLs will be a higher risk for developing ATL. Careful follow-up of these patients is necessary to detect ATL development.","['Eguchi, Katsumi', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Terada, Kaoru', 'Aramaki, Toshiyuki', 'Tuji, Yoshiko', 'Kurushima, Shouta', 'Kojima, Kanako', 'Arima, Kazuhiko', 'Iwamoto, Naoki', 'Ichinose, Kunihiko', 'Kawakami, Atushi', 'Hirakata, Naoyuki', 'Ueki, Yukitaka']","['Eguchi K', 'Iwanaga M', 'Terada K', 'Aramaki T', 'Tuji Y', 'Kurushima S', 'Kojima K', 'Arima K', 'Iwamoto N', 'Ichinose K', 'Kawakami A', 'Hirakata N', 'Ueki Y']","['Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Frontier Life Science, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Public Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Rheumatic and Collagen Disease Center, Sasebo Chuo Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190429,England,Mod Rheumatol,Modern rheumatology,100959226,,IM,"['Adult', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/virology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/pathology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/*pathogenicity', '*Viral Load']",,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1 proviral load', 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type-1', 'pulmonary complication']",,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/10/03 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14397595.2019.1602931 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Rheumatol. 2020 May;30(3):471-480. doi: 10.1080/14397595.2019.1602931.

To investigate the molecular associations among T2DM, prostate cancer (PCa), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), using a biomolecular network enrichment analysis. We obtained a list of disease-related genes and constructed disease networks. Then, GO enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significant functions and pathways of overlapping modules in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database. More than 75% of these overlapping genes were found to be consistent with the findings of previous studies. In the three diseases, we found that Sarcoglycan delta (SGCD) and Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3) were the overlapping genes and identified negative regulation of apoptotic process and negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter RNA as the two overlapping biological functions. CML and PCa were the most closely related, with 34 overlapping genes, five overlapping modules, 27 overlapping biological functions, and nine overlapping pathways. There were 13 overlapping genes, one overlapping modules, four overlapping biological functions and one overlapping pathway (FoxO signaling pathway) were found in T2DM and CML.And T2DM and PCa were the least related pair in our study, with only six overlapping genes, five overlapping modules, and one overlapping biological function. SGCD and RND3 were the main gene-to-gene relationship among T2DM, CML, and PCa; apoptosis, development, and transcription from RNA polymerase II promote processes were the main functional connections among T2DM, CML, and PCa by network enrichment analysis. There is a ""scalene"" relationship among T2DM, CML, and PCa at gene, pathway, biological process, and module levels: CML and PCa were the most closely related, the second were T2DM and PCa, and T2DM and PCa were the least related pair in our study.

However, immune reaction to the drug may increase the clearance or impair the function of L-asparaginase and reduces its therapeutic efficacy. The objective of this study was to identify potential plasma proteins that could be used as proxies for L-asparaginase activity. METHODS: Fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), total protein, and albumin levels as well as antithrombin (AT) and L-asparaginase activities were measured in 97 children with ALL treated for prolonged period of time with L-asparaginase. Binary logistic regression and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to evaluate the predictive value of plasma proteins for L-asparaginase activity. RESULTS: Median E. coli L-asparaginase activity was 220 IU/L (range, 0-1308) throughout the treatment period. L-asparaginase activity was below 100 IU/L in 23% of measured samples. L-asparaginase activity was inversely associated with AT activity, fibrinogen, total protein, and albumin levels (r = -0.63, -0.62, -0.57, and -0.45, respectively; P < 0.0001), but not with VWF:Ag. ROC curve analyses showed an intermediate accuracy of AT activity (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.77) to detect specimens with subtherapeutic level of L-asparaginase. An optimal accuracy was found when AT and fibrinogen were combined (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 75%; specificity = 82%; positive predictive value = 55%; negative predictive value = 92%) with cutoff values of 0.73 IU/mL and 1.85 g/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AT combined with fibrinogen levels could be used as a proxy to identify patients with therapeutic level of L-asparaginase activity in the absence of real-time asparaginase measurement during prolonged exposure to L-asparaginase.","['Merlen, Clemence', 'Bonnefoy, Arnaud', 'Afeich, Cynthia', 'Theoret, Yves', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Rivard, Georges-Etienne']","['Merlen C', 'Bonnefoy A', 'Afeich C', 'Theoret Y', 'Laverdiere C', 'Leclerc JM', 'Rivard GE']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190402,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antithrombin Proteins)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antithrombin Proteins/*metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*L-asparaginase', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*antithrombin', '*fibrinogen']",,2019/04/03 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27729 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jul;66(7):e27729. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27729.

Radiology exhibited bilateral ground-glass shadows. In order to prevent pneumonia as a possible side effect due to conventional chemotherapy, it was decided to first treat the patient with rituximab; however, dyspnea persisted. Therefore, bronchoscopy was performed and specimens were sampled for both histological examination and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis. BAL showed lymphocytosis (28.7%), and by means of immunocytochemistry a few CD79a+ Blymphocytes as well as lymphoid cells positive for the hairy cell marker DBA44 were observed. In addition, molecular study revealed the BRAF V600E mutation. Thus, the findings of BAL were interpreted as lung infiltration by hairy cell leukemia. This result was confirmed by histology. Following a therapy switch to cladribine, a significant improvement was reached. Pulmonary infiltrates by hairy cell leukemia were rarely described. This case represents the first report of hairy cell leukemia diagnosed by means of BAL. It may be difficult to clearly separate between lymphoma infiltration of the lung and medicamentous pneumonitis, but this differential diagnosis can be supported by morphological methods.","['Hansen, T', 'Constantin, C', 'Weber, M', 'Titze, U', 'Hartmann, F']","['Hansen T', 'Constantin C', 'Weber M', 'Titze U', 'Hartmann F']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Klinikum Lippe GmbH, Detmold und Lemgo, Rontgenstrasse 18, 32756, Detmold, Deutschland.

In the case of astrocyte apoptosis resulting from reperfusion injury following hypoxia, the function of the Lifr remains to be fully elucidated. This study established models of in vivo ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) using an in vitro model of OGD to investigate the direct impact of silencing the Lifr on astrocyte apoptosis. Astrocytes harvested from newborn Wistar rats were exposed to OGD. Cell viability and apoptosis levels were determined by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining assays, respectively. Apoptosis was further investigated by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay. A standard western blotting protocol was applied to determine levels of the protein markers Bcl2, Bax, p-Akt/Akt, p-Stat3/Stat3, and p-Erk/Erk. The cell viability assay (MTT) showed that astrocyte viability decreased in response to OGD. Furthermore, blocking RNA to silence the Lifr further reduces astrocyte viability and increases levels of apoptosis as detected by annexin V/PI double staining. Likewise, western blotting after Lifr silencing demonstrated increased levels of the apoptosis-related proteins Bax and p-Erk/Erk and correspondingly lower levels of Bcl2, p-Akt/Akt, and p-Stat/Stat3. The data gathered in these analyses indicate that the Lifr plays a pivotal role in the astrocyte apoptosis induced by hypoxic/low-glucose environments. Further investigation of the relationship between apoptosis and the Lifr may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological injuries.","['Huo, Liang', 'Fan, Yuying', 'Wang, Hua']","['Huo L', 'Fan Y', 'Wang H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190227,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Glucose/*deficiency', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC6415309,,,,2019/04/03 06:00,2019/07/23 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1613820 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Feb 27;2019:1613820. doi: 10.1155/2019/1613820. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6711-2950', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5579-347X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6123-2911']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was performed to determine the level of participation in general PA and physical education in school (PES) among children with ALL who completed intensive chemotherapy and identify possible barriers that influence adherence to PA and PES. Methods: A cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted over 1 year in a tertiary pediatric hematology and oncology referral center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A total of 47 children with ALL aged 7-18 years old who were off-treatment and attended school on a regular basis were recruited. A modified structured questionnaire adapted from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, Division of Adolescent and School Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was used to assess the children's level of PA and PES participation. Results: Among the 47 children will ALL included herein, 11 (23.4%) were physically active for at least 60 min a day for 5 days or more, following CDC recommendations. The median duration from completion of intensive chemotherapy was 4.95 years (25th, 3.29; 75th, 7.95). Younger age at study entry (median, 8.7 years old vs. 12.2 years old) and younger age at diagnosis (median, 2.9 years old vs. 4.3 years old) were significantly associated with higher PA level. Almost all children (45/47, 95.7%) participated in PES. Barriers to non-participation in PES mainly included exhaustion or fear of injury. Conclusions: Majority of the children with ALL included herein had low levels of daily PA after intensive chemotherapy. Nonetheless, their participation in PES was encouraging. PA should thus be promoted during and after cessation of ALL treatment to prevent long-term health risks and improve overall quality of life.","['Alias, Hamidah', 'Mohd Nazi, Nur Adlina', 'Lau Sie Chong, Doris']","['Alias H', 'Mohd Nazi NA', 'Lau Sie Chong D']","['Department of Pediatrics, UKM Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, The National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, UKM Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, The National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, UKM Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, The National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190318,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC6431648,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'barriers', 'off-chemotherapy', 'physical activity', 'physical education in school']",,2019/04/03 06:00,2019/04/03 06:01,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2019.00073 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Mar 18;7:73. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00073. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results demonstrate that the recovered NK cells after cryopreservation and rewarming maintain their viability immediately after thawing at a comparable level to control (dimethyl sulfoxide-based cryopreservation). Although, their viability drops in the first day in culture compared to controls, the cells grow back to a comparable level to controls after 1 week in culture. In addition, the anti-tumor functional activity of recovered NK cells demonstrates higher cytotoxic potency against leukemia cells compared to control. This approach presents a new direction for NK cell preservation, focusing on function and potentially enabling storage and distribution for cancer immunotherapy.","['El Assal, Rami', 'Abou-Elkacem, Lotfi', 'Tocchio, Alessandro', 'Pasley, Shannon', 'Matosevic, Sandro', 'Kaplan, David L', 'Zylberberg, Claudia', 'Demirci, Utkan']","['El Assal R', 'Abou-Elkacem L', 'Tocchio A', 'Pasley S', 'Matosevic S', 'Kaplan DL', 'Zylberberg C', 'Demirci U']","['Bio-Acoustic-MEMS in Medicine (BAMM) Laboratories Canary Center at Stanford for Cancer Early Detection Department of Radiology Stanford University School of Medicine Palo Alto CA 94304 USA.', 'Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS) Department of Radiology Stanford University School of Medicine Palo Alto CA 94304 USA.', 'Bio-Acoustic-MEMS in Medicine (BAMM) Laboratories Canary Center at Stanford for Cancer Early Detection Department of Radiology Stanford University School of Medicine Palo Alto CA 94304 USA.', 'Akron Biotechnology, LLC Boca Raton FL 33487 USA.', 'Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy College of Pharmacy Purdue University West Lafayette IN 47907 USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering Tufts University School of Engineering Medford MA 02155 USA.', 'Akron Biotechnology, LLC Boca Raton FL 33487 USA.', 'Bio-Acoustic-MEMS in Medicine (BAMM) Laboratories Canary Center at Stanford for Cancer Early Detection Department of Radiology Stanford University School of Medicine Palo Alto CA 94304 USA.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering (by courtesy) Stanford University School of Engineering Palo Alto CA 94304 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190127,Germany,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,,,,PMC6425501,['NOTNLM'],"['bioinspired materials', 'biopreservation', 'cryoprotectants', 'immunotherapy', 'natural killer cells']","['Dr. U.

Laboratory data showed anaemia and prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (85.8 s, normal range 24-39 s) without thrombocytopenia. Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) activity was less than 1% (normal range 60-150%), and a FVIII inhibitor was identified and quantified at 166 BU/mL to indicate a diagnosis of acquired haemophilia A (AHA). A recent, but sustained circulating monocytosis (>1 x 10(9)/L) was observed, which combined with elevated numbers of neutrophil and monocytic cells in the marrow, suggested evolution of MDS-MLD to chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), coinciding with AHA. Further analysis revealed a karyotype of 46, XY, i(14) (q10), which was the same abnormality previously identified in the patient. To treat bleeding caused by AHA, steroid and activated prothrombin complex concentrate were administered. Azacitidine (AZA) was used to treat CMML. During the clinical course, bleeding partially improved; however, subsequent acute myocardial infarction occurred on day 87. Worsening bone marrow failure was observed 4 months after the original admission, despite administration of AZA therapy, and the patient died due to bleeding from AHA. This case suggests that the evolution of MDS to CMML status can be associated with AHA conferring a bleeding tendency.","['Araki, Takeshi', 'Ohata, Shinya', 'Okamoto, Kohei', 'Morimoto, Kazuhide', 'Hiraishi, Mana', 'Yamada, Shinichiro', 'Mizuno, Ishikazu', 'Sugimoto, Takeshi']","['Araki T', 'Ohata S', 'Okamoto K', 'Morimoto K', 'Hiraishi M', 'Yamada S', 'Mizuno I', 'Sugimoto T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kita-Harima Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kita-Harima Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology, Kobe University Hospital, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Kita-Harima Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kita-Harima Medical Centre, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kita-Harima Medical Centre, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hyogo Cancer Center, Akashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kita-Harima Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190227,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,PMC6415290,,,,2019/04/03 06:00,2019/04/03 06:01,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2018/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/8612031 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Feb 27;2019:8612031. doi: 10.1155/2019/8612031. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8121-5323'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural compound with several anti-cancer and anti-oxidant properties. Fas, as a member of death inducing family of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors with an intracellular death domain, can initiate the extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. Here after the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) determination in cell lines, we searched for PTE effects on Fas, both in mRNA and surface levels in two ALL cell lines, Jurkat and Molt-4. After harvesting cells in optimum situations, MTS assay was used to determine IC50 concentrations. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry were performed for Fas mRNA and surface expression variations after exposure to PTE. The findings showed that PTE decreases cell viability with different extent in two ALL cell lines. In addition to inducing apoptosis, it can increase Fas in both gene and cell surface expression in the same concentrations. Pterostilbene as a natural anti-cancer agent can increase Fas expression both in mRNA and surface levels that results in apoptosis signal transduction improvement which sensitizes cells to apoptosis by immune effector cells. As a result, abnormal cells removal would be more efficiently with the minimum side effects on normal cells.","['Ramezani, Gelareh', 'Pourgheysari, Batoul', 'Shirzad, Hedayatollah', 'Sourani, Zahra']","['Ramezani G', 'Pourgheysari B', 'Shirzad H', 'Sourani Z']","['Immunology Department, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, I.R.

Here we examined the function of Kdm6b in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. Loss of Kdm6b lead to depletion of phenotypic and functional HSCs in adult mice, and Kdm6b is necessary for HSC self-renewal in response to inflammatory and proliferative stress. Loss of Kdm6b leads to a pro-differentiation poised state in HSCs due to the increased expression of the AP-1 transcription factor complex (Fos and Jun) and immediate early response (IER) genes. These gene expression changes occurred independently of chromatin modifications. Targeting AP-1 restored function of Kdm6b-deficient HSCs, suggesting that Kdm6b regulates this complex during HSC stress response. We also show Kdm6b supports developmental context-dependent leukemogenesis for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and M5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Kdm6b is required for effective fetal-derived T-ALL and adult-derived AML, but not vice versa. These studies identify a crucial role for Kdm6b in regulating HSC self-renewal in different contexts, and highlight the potential of KDM6B as a therapeutic target in different hematopoietic malignancies.","['Mallaney, Cates', 'Ostrander, Elizabeth L', 'Celik, Hamza', 'Kramer, Ashley C', 'Martens, Andrew', 'Kothari, Alok', 'Koh, Won Kyun', 'Haussler, Emily', 'Iwamori, Naoki', 'Gontarz, Paul', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Challen, Grant A']","['Mallaney C', 'Ostrander EL', 'Celik H', 'Kramer AC', 'Martens A', 'Kothari A', 'Koh WK', 'Haussler E', 'Iwamori N', 'Gontarz P', 'Zhang B', 'Challen GA']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Laboratory of Biomedicine, Division of Pathobiology, Department of Basic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Center of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Center of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA. gchallen@dom.wustl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190401,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (Kdm6b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",PMC6773521,,,,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0462-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0462-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Oct;33(10):2506-2521. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0462-4.

Here, we present a case of a 75-year-old man referred with proptosis and monocytosis-subsequently diagnosed as AML-M5b, whose disease course was distinguished by extensive tissue invasion (ocular, pulmonary, liver, spleen). Cytogenetics and molecular tests were consistent with blastic transformation of previously undiagnosed chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, supported by the presence of long-standing, low-grade monocytosis. Notably, a BRAF V600E mutation was also detected-an oncogenic driver previously reported in de novo and therapy-related, but not chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-transformed, AML-M5b. While an initial response to cytoreductive treatment was observed, his tissue-invasive disease soon progressed with worsening pulmonary infiltrates, disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure, resulting in death.","['Tedjaseputra, Aditya', 'Vilcassim, Fathima Shahla', 'Grigoriadis, George']","['Tedjaseputra A', 'Vilcassim FS', 'Grigoriadis G']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Immunohaematology Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Research, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Immunohaematology Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Research, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190331,England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Exophthalmos/*etiology/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*metabolism', 'Retina/*pathology', 'Retinal Diseases/drug therapy/*pathology/physiopathology']",PMC6453331,['NOTNLM'],"['carcinogenesis', 'haematology (incl blood transfusion)', 'pathology']",['Competing interests: None declared.'],2019/04/03 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['12/3/e228519 [pii]', '10.1136/bcr-2018-228519 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2019 Mar 31;12(3). pii: 12/3/e228519. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2018-228519.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6224-1940'],"['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019.

Importantly, ABL1 rearrangements, most commonly described in BCR/ABL1-positive B-ALL and BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL, have been observed in T-ALL and may respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. We describe a newly diagnosed case of pediatric T-ALL with a fluorescence in situ hybridization abnormality suggesting a partial ABL1 deletion by a BCR/ABL1 dual-color dual-fusion probe but that demonstrated a normal result using an ABL1 break-apart probe.

We retrospectively collected tumor and available matched serum samples at diagnosis and 1 and 3 months post-alloSCT from 53 patients with AML/MDS. After identifying driver mutations in 51 patients using next-generation sequencing, we designed at least 1 personalized digital polymerase chain reaction assay per case. Diagnostic ctDNA and matched tumor DNA exhibited excellent correlations with variant allele frequencies. Sixteen patients relapsed after a median of 7 months post-alloSCT. Both mutation persistence (MP) in bone marrow (BM) at 1 and 3 months post-alloSCT and corresponding ctDNA persistence (CP) in the matched serum (MP1 and MP3; CP1 and CP3, respectively) were comparably associated with higher 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates (MP1 vs non-MP1, 72.9% vs 13.8% [P = .0012]; CP1 vs non-CP1, 65.6% vs 9.0% [P = .0002]; MP3 vs non-MP3, 80% vs 11.6% [P = .0002]; CP3 vs non-CP3, 71.4% vs 8.4% [P < .0001]). We subsequently evaluated whether subset analysis of patients with 3 genes associated with clonal hematopoiesis, DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 (DTA), could also be helpful in relapse prediction. As a result, CP based on DTA gene mutations also had the prognostic effect on CIR. These results, for the first time, support the utility of ctDNA as a noninvasive prognostic biomarker in patients with AML/MDS undergoing alloSCT.","['Nakamura, Sousuke', 'Yokoyama, Kazuaki', 'Shimizu, Eigo', 'Yusa, Nozomi', 'Kondoh, Kanya', 'Ogawa, Miho', 'Takei, Tomomi', 'Kobayashi, Asako', 'Ito, Mika', 'Isobe, Masamichi', 'Konuma, Takaaki', 'Kato, Seiko', 'Kasajima, Rika', 'Wada, Yuka', 'Nagamura-Inoue, Tokiko', 'Yamaguchi, Rui', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Imoto, Seiya', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Tojo, Arinobu']","['Nakamura S', 'Yokoyama K', 'Shimizu E', 'Yusa N', 'Kondoh K', 'Ogawa M', 'Takei T', 'Kobayashi A', 'Ito M', 'Isobe M', 'Konuma T', 'Kato S', 'Kasajima R', 'Wada Y', 'Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Yamaguchi R', 'Takahashi S', 'Imoto S', 'Miyano S', 'Tojo A']","['Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center.', 'Department of Applied Genomics, Research Hospital.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital.', 'Health Intelligence Center, and.', 'Department of Cell Processing and Transfusion, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Processing and Transfusion, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital.', 'Health Intelligence Center, and.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center.', 'Health Intelligence Center, and.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190401,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Circulating Tumor DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Circulating Tumor DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42474-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-10-880690 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Jun 20;133(25):2682-2695. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-10-880690.

The pattern of disulfide bonds in alpha-defensins is crucial for the functional properties. Therefore, synthesis using the chemical and recombinant approaches is a challenging. A safe source for the production of alpha-defensins can be the use of leukoreduction filters in blood banks that contain large quantities of neutrophils and are discarded after use. The aim of this study was to purify alpha-defensins from neutrophils trapped in leukofilters and to investigate its anticancer activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunoprecipitation was performed to purify alpha-defensins and the presence of protein was confirmed by Western Blot. The Jurkat T-cell line was incubated with different concentrations (5, 10 and 15mug/ml) of purified HNP1-3 for 16h. Cell viability was measured using a WST-1 assay and apoptosis was analyzed for Annexin V/PI markers. Caspase-3/7 activity was determined using fluorescence assay. The effects of purified alpha-defensins were compared to commercial HNP 1-3. KEY FINDINGS: Purified HNP 1-3 decreased the viability at 10 and 15mug/ml and commercial HNP 1-3 at 15mug/ml concentrations. Following to the purified HNP1-3 treatment, the percentage of Annexin V positive population and caspase-3 activity were significantly increased compared to control (p=0.000 and p=0.001, respectively) and commercial HNP1-3 (p=0.034 and p=0.018, respectively). SIGNIFICANCE: Results indicated the anticancer activity of HNP1-3 which can be used as future chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, leukofilters can be considered as economic source for purifying these peptides.","['Ferdowsi, Shirin', 'Pourfathollah, Ali Akbar', 'Amiri, Fatemeh', 'Rafiee, Mohammad Hessam', 'Aghaei, Afsaneh']","['Ferdowsi S', 'Pourfathollah AA', 'Amiri F', 'Rafiee MH', 'Aghaei A']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran; Tarbiat Modares University, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology, Tehran, Iran.

This review discusses contemporary management of hematologic malignancies, followed by special discussion of novel agents, including signaling/small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, and immunotherapies, for treatment of hematologic malignancies with focus on infectious risk.","['Atkins, Sarah', 'He, Fiona']","['Atkins S', 'He F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street Southeast, MMC 284, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street Southeast, MMC 480, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

METHODS: In this study, we identify miRNAs that could predict clinical outcome in a heterogeneous AML population using TCGA dataset. RESULTS: We found that MiR-363 is a novel prognostic factor in AML patients undergoing chemotherapy. In multivariable analyses, high miR-363 remained predictive for shorter OS (HR = 2.349, P = 0.012) and EFS (HR = 2.082, P = 0.001) independent of other well-known prognostic factors. More importantly, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) overcame the adverse outcomes related to high miR-363 expression. In gene expression profiling, high miR-363 expression was positively correlated with the amounts of leukemogenic transcription factors, including Myb, RUNX3, GATA3, IKZF3, ETS1 and MLLT3. Notably, we found that the in silico predicted target genes (EZH2, KLF6 and PTEN) of miR-363 were downregulated in association with high miR-363 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, miR-363 expression may help identify patients in need of strategies to select the optimal therapy between chemotherapeutic and allo-HCST regimens. AML patients with high miR-363 expression may be highly recommended for early allo-HSCT regimen.","['Zhang, Huihui', 'Zhang, Ninghan', 'Wang, Rong', 'Shao, Tingting', 'Feng, Yuan', 'Yao, Yao', 'Wu, Qingyun', 'Zhu, Shengyun', 'Cao, Jiang', 'Zhang, Huanxin', 'Li, Zhenyu', 'Liu, Xuejiao', 'Niu, Mingshan', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Zhang H', 'Zhang N', 'Wang R', 'Shao T', 'Feng Y', 'Yao Y', 'Wu Q', 'Zhu S', 'Cao J', 'Zhang H', 'Li Z', 'Liu X', 'Niu M', 'Xu K']","['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Insititute of Nervous System Diseases, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. msniu24@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. msniu24@126.com.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. lihmd@163.com.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. lihmd@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190401,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN363 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Selection', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6444823,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Allo-HSCT', '*Chemotherapy', '*Clinical outcome', '*Mir-363']",,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/05/05 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-1858-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-019-1858-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2019 Apr 1;17(1):106. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-1858-7.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7077-6467'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocations involving 11q23 chromosomal region have been rarely reported in CML. The few reported patients with blast crisis (BC) of CML carrying an 11q rearrangement have insufficient responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and possess a poor prognosis. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 30-year-old man with CML who had a fulminant myeloid BC 4 months after initiation of first-line therapy with the TKI dasatinib, despite showing an optimal response at the 3-month timepoint. Despite cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea and 3rd-generation TKI ponatinib, the patient died within 10 days after the diagnosis of BC. Cytogenetic analyses revealed additional genetic aberrations including trisomy 8 and t(9;11)(p21;q23) involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. CONCLUSION: The presence of 11q23 rearrangements in the relapse clone in BC of CML most likely accounts for the adverse clinical outcome. Thus, in the case of rapid and unexpected BC, the presence of 11q rearrangements should be tested together with other additional chromosomal alterations, and immediate addition of chemotherapy to the TKIs should be evaluated.","['Janjetovic, Snjezana', 'Asemissen, Anne Marie', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Binder, Mascha', 'Dierlamm, Judith', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Schafhausen, Philippe']","['Janjetovic S', 'Asemissen AM', 'Dicker F', 'Binder M', 'Dierlamm J', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Schafhausen P']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wad Tumorzentrum, University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wad Tumorzentrum, University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wad Tumorzentrum, University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wad Tumorzentrum, University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wad Tumorzentrum, University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wad Tumorzentrum, University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190401,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['11q23 rearrangements', 'BCR-ABL', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'blast crisis', 'tyrosine kinase']",,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/01/23 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0300891619839473 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumori. 2019 Dec;105(6):NP8-NP11. doi: 10.1177/0300891619839473.

Such an observation was associated with the development of molecules inhibiting Bcl-2 activity, and among them, BH3-mimetics represent a novel class of therapeutic compounds. In 2016, venetoclax became the first approved oral inhibitor of Bcl-2, and it has been used with success in patients with CLL who present with a 17p deletion or TP53 mutations and in those who have received at least one prior therapy. However, its mechanism for controlling relapses, and its optimal use in terms of duration and combinations with other drugs, remain unknown. Therefore, this review focuses on the mechanisms controlling apoptosis, CLL B cell strategies to prevent apoptosis including in response to BH3-mimetics, and arguments supporting the use of BH3-mimetics in association with other therapies in order to limit compensatory mechanisms.","['Bagacean, Cristina', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Grewal, Ravnit', 'Brooks, Wesley H', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Renaudineau, Yves']","['Bagacean C', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Tempescul A', 'Grewal R', 'Brooks WH', 'Berthou C', 'Renaudineau Y']","['a Department of Hematology , Brest University Medical School Hospital , Brest , France.', 'b U1227 B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity , University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM , Brest , France.', 'c Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy , Brest University Medical School Hospital , Brest , France.', 'd Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj-Napoca , Romania.', 'a Department of Hematology , Brest University Medical School Hospital , Brest , France.', 'b U1227 B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity , University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM , Brest , France.', 'e South African National Bioinformatics Institute (SANBI) , University of the Western Cape , Cape Town , South Africa.', 'f Department of Chemistry , University of South Florida , Tampa , FL , USA.', 'a Department of Hematology , Brest University Medical School Hospital , Brest , France.', 'b U1227 B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity , University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM , Brest , France.', 'c Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy , Brest University Medical School Hospital , Brest , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190506,England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BH3-mimetics', '*CLL', '*apoptosis']",,2019/04/03 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408363.2019.1600468 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2019 Aug;56(5):321-332. doi: 10.1080/10408363.2019.1600468.

We studied the anticancer activity of greensporone A in a panel of leukemic cell lines. Greensporone A-mediated inhibition of proliferation is found to be associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death. Greensporone A treatment of leukemic cells causes inactivation of constitutively activated AKT and its downstream targets, including members GSK3 and FOXO1, and causes downregulation of antiapoptotic genes such as Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAPs) and Bcl-2. Furthermore, Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, was found to be upregulated in leukemic cell lines treated with greensporone A. Interestingly, gene silencing of AKT using AKT specific siRNA suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 with enhanced expression of Bax. Greensporone A-mediated increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio causes permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane leading to the accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm. Greensporone A-induced cytochrome c accumulation causes the activation of caspase cascade and cleavage of its effector, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), leading to apoptosis. Greensporone A-mediated apoptosis in leukemic cells occurs through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to depletion of glutathione (GSH) levels. Finally, greensporone A potentiated the anticancer activity of imatinib in leukemic cells. In summary, our study showed that greensporone A suppressed the growth of leukemic cells via induction of apoptotic cell death. The apoptotic cell death occurs by inhibition of AKT signaling and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic/caspase pathways. These results raise the possibility that greensporone A could be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia and other hematological malignancies.","['Prabhu, Kirti S', 'Siveen, Kodappully S', 'Kuttikrishnan, Shilpa', 'Jochebeth, Anh', 'Ali, Tayyiba A', 'Elareer, Noor R', 'Iskandarani, Ahmad', 'Quaiyoom Khan, Abdul', 'Merhi, Maysaloun', 'Dermime, Said', 'El-Elimat, Tamam', 'Oberlies, Nicholas H', 'Alali, Feras Q', 'Steinhoff, Martin', 'Uddin, Shahab']","['Prabhu KS', 'Siveen KS', 'Kuttikrishnan S', 'Jochebeth A', 'Ali TA', 'Elareer NR', 'Iskandarani A', 'Quaiyoom Khan A', 'Merhi M', 'Dermime S', 'El-Elimat T', 'Oberlies NH', 'Alali FQ', 'Steinhoff M', 'Uddin S']","['Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, P.O.

In this study, indoor levels of formaldehyde, as well as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, were measured in 6 Colorado nail salons. Personal exposure VOC measurements and health questionnaires (n=20) were also performed; questionnaires included employee demographics, health symptoms experienced, and protective equipment used. Cancer slope factors from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and anthropometric data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were then used to estimate cancer risk for workers, assuming 20-yr exposures to concentrations of benzene and formaldehyde reported here. Results show that 70% of surveyed workers experienced at least one health issue related to their employment, with many reporting multiple related symptoms. Indoor concentrations of formaldehyde ranged from 5.32 to 20.6mugm(-3), across all 6 salons. Indoor concentrations of toluene ranged from 26.7 to 816mugm(-3), followed by benzene (3.13-51.8mugm(-3)), xylenes (5.16-34.6mugm(-3)), and ethylbenzene (1.65-9.52mugm(-3)). Formaldehyde levels measured in one salon exceeded the Recommended Exposure Limit from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Cancer risk estimates from formaldehyde exposure exceeded the US EPA de minimis risk level (1x10(-6)) for squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and leukemia; leukemia risk exceeded 1x10(-4) in one salon. The average leukemia risk from benzene exposure also exceeded the US EPA de minimis risk level for all demographic categories modeled. In general, concentrations of aromatic compounds measured here were comparable to those measured in studies of oil refinery and auto garage workers. Cancer risk models determined that 20-yr exposure to formaldehyde and benzene concentrations measured in this study will significantly increase worker's risk of developing cancer in their lifetime.","['Lamplugh, Aaron', 'Harries, Megan', 'Xiang, Feng', 'Trinh, Janice', 'Hecobian, Arsineh', 'Montoya, Lupita D']","['Lamplugh A', 'Harries M', 'Xiang F', 'Trinh J', 'Hecobian A', 'Montoya LD']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, 1111 Engineering Drive, UCB 427, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, 80309-0427, USA.

Among PBMCs, natural killer (NK) cells appear to be a major cell type involved in this killing and UV-HSV-1 appears to directly and potently stimulate NK cell expression of CD69, degranulation, cytokine production, and migration to IL-8 in PC3 conditioned medium. We also found that UV-HSV-1 stimulates glycolysis in PBMCs and NK cells, and that 2-deoxyglucose and the protein kinase C inhibitor, Go6976, and the NFkappaB inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, all abrogate UV-HSV-1 activated killing of PC3 cells by PBMCs and NK cells. Using neutralizing anti-Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) we found that UV-HSV-1, like HSV-1, activates NK cells via TLR2. Taken together, these results are consistent with Toll-like receptor 2 ligands on UV-HSV-1 stimulating TLR2 on NK cells to activate protein kinase C, leading to enhanced glycolysis and NFkappaB activation, both of which play a critical role in this anti-PrCA innate immune response. Importantly, UV-HSV-1 synergizes with IL-15 to increase the cytolytic activity of PBMCs against PC3 cells and there was considerable donor-to-donor variation in killing ability. These results support the preclinical development of UV-HSV-1 as an adjuvant, in combination with IL-15, for cell infusions of healthy, preselected NK cells to treat PrCA.","['Samudio, Ismael', 'Hofs, Elyse', 'Cho, Brandon', 'Li, Michael', 'Bolduc, Kayla', 'Bu, Luke', 'Liu, Guoyu', 'Lam, Vivian', 'Rennie, Paul', 'Jia, William', 'Elisia, Ingrid', 'Krystal, Gerald']","['Samudio I', 'Hofs E', 'Cho B', 'Li M', 'Bolduc K', 'Bu L', 'Liu G', 'Lam V', 'Rennie P', 'Jia W', 'Elisia I', 'Krystal G']","['Research and Innovation Program in Acute and Chronic Leukemia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.', 'Brain Research Centre, University of British Columbia.', 'Brain Research Centre, University of British Columbia.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.', 'Vancouver Prostate Centre, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Brain Research Centre, University of British Columbia.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Glycolysis', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*immunology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'Virus Inactivation/*radiation effects']",,,,,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/06/19 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000261 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2019 Jun;42(5):162-174. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000261.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease-specific telangiectasias are generally localized in the oculocutaneous region, while telangiectasias located within the bladder are rarely seen in patients with AT. The patient who had been followed-up with a diagnosis of AT since the age of 3 years was later diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 8 years. The patient developed hematuria approximately in the 29th month of treatment. The cystoscopy revealed regions of extensive hemorrhagic telangiectasis, which was interpreted as the bladder involvement of AT. The case presented here underwent several cycles of intravesical steroid and tranexamic acid treatments and intravesical cauterization procedures, but the patient was unresponsive to all medical treatment approaches. The patient was consequently evaluated by an interventional radiology unit for a selective arterial embolization. The patient's hematuria resolved after embolization. Bladder wall telangiectasia may, on rare occasions, develop in patients with AT, and can result in life-threatening hemorrhages. We also suggest that a selective arterial embolectomy can be safely carried out in pediatric patients with treatment-resistant intravesical bleeding.","['Bahadir, Aysenur', 'Oguz, Sukru', 'Erduran, Erol', 'Dinc, Hasan', 'Yalcin Comert, Hatice S', 'Bahat Ozdogan, Elif', 'Kaya, Gulay']","['Bahadir A', 'Oguz S', 'Erduran E', 'Dinc H', 'Yalcin Comert HS', 'Bahat Ozdogan E', 'Kaya G']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology.', 'Division of Radiology.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology.', 'Division of Radiology.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery.', 'Division of Pediatric Nephrology.', 'Division of Pediatric Intensive Care, Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Hematuria/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Urinary Bladder']",,,,,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001471 [doi]', '00043426-202005000-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 May;42(4):316-318. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although amino acid variation in T-cell receptor variable chains often affects antigen specificity, dimorphism in the beta chain constant region (TRBC1 and TRBC2) is not thought to affect T-cell function. A recent study suggested that adoptive transfer of TRBC1-specific chimeric antigen-receptor-T cells provided an option for T-cell leukemia therapy that preserved T-cell immunity in the TRBC2 subset. This raises an important question as to whether TRBC1T cells are qualitatively different from TRBC2T cells. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Sixty-six antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-infected individuals, including 19 viraemic controllers and 47 noncontrollers, were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated for T-cell functional assays, tetramer analyses, TRBC1 staining and immunophenotyping. RESULTS: Viraemic controllers had a higher proportion of circulating TRBC1T cells than noncontrollers, raising the possibility that TRBC1T cells might be associated with HIV control. TRBC1T cells also showed more functional T-cell responses against both HIV and cytomegalovirus (P < 0.01). The immunophenotypes of TRBC1-bearing T cells were skewed towards naive and central memory phenotypes, whereas the majority of TRBC2-expressing T cells were terminally differentiated. Inverse correlations were observed between %TRBC1T cells and HIV plasma viral load, which was most pronounced for CD8 T cells (r = -0.7096, P = 0.00002357). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that TRBC1T-cell responses are of better quality than their TRBC2 counterparts, which should be considered in immunotherapeutic strategies for HIV infection. Conversely, depletion of TRBC1T cells as part of the treatment of TRBC1 T-cell malignancies may lead to compromised T-cell response quality.","['Kaewpreedee, Prathanporn', 'Boonrat, Potchara', 'Tansiri, Yada', 'Rowland-Jones, Sarah L', 'Hansasuta, Pokrath']","['Kaewpreedee P', 'Boonrat P', 'Tansiri Y', 'Rowland-Jones SL', 'Hansasuta P']","['Interdisciplinary Program in Medical Microbiology, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.', ""Faculty of Medicine, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand."", 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, NDM Research Building, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford, UK.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Medical Microbiology, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.', 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, NDM Research Building, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/immunology', 'Female', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', '*Genetic Variation', 'HIV/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/QAD.0000000000002187 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2019 Jul 15;33(9):1421-1429. doi: 10.1097/QAD.0000000000002187.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation of novel natural and synthetic structures that might be used for the development of new drugs with greater efficiency and selectivity to leukemic cells is mandatory. In this context, thiosemicarbazones have been well described in the literature by their several biological properties and their reaction is known as versatile, low-cost, and highly chemoselective. With this perspective, this study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effect and the main death mechanisms of a novel thiosemicarbazone (LAP17) on acute leukemia cell lines K562 and Jurkat. The results show that the strong cytotoxic effect of LAP17 to leukemic cells is due to apoptosis induction, which resulted in caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Intrinsic apoptosis seems to be related to the inversion of Bax/Bcl-2 expression, DeltaPsim loss, and AIF release, whereas extrinsic apoptosis was initiated by FasR. Gene-expression profiling of HL-60 cells treated with LAP17 by the microarray technique revealed a significant enrichment of gene sets related to cell cycle arrest at G2/M. Accordingly, K562 and Jurkat cells treated with LAP17 revealed a clear arrest at G2/M phase. Taking into consideration that LAP17 was not cytotoxic to nonhematological cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cell and erythrocytes), these results suggest that LAP17 is a promising new compound that might be used as a prototype for the development of new antileukemic agents.","['Perondi, Daiane M', 'Jacques, Amanda V', 'Stefanes, Natalia M', 'Maioral, Mariana F', 'Sens, Larissa', 'Pacheco, Lucas A', 'Cury, Nathalia M', 'Nunes, Ricardo J', 'Yunes, Jose A', 'Santos-Silva, Maria C']","['Perondi DM', 'Jacques AV', 'Stefanes NM', 'Maioral MF', 'Sens L', 'Pacheco LA', 'Cury NM', 'Nunes RJ', 'Yunes JA', 'Santos-Silva MC']","['Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Department of Clinical Analysis.', 'Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Department of Clinical Analysis.', 'Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Department of Clinical Analysis.', 'Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Department of Clinical Analysis.', 'Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center.', 'Structure and Activity Laboratory, Department of Chemistry Department.', 'Post- Graduation Program in Chemistry, Physical and Mathematical Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis.', 'Structure and Activity Laboratory, Department of Chemistry Department.', 'Post- Graduation Program in Chemistry, Physical and Mathematical Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis.', 'Molecular Biology Laboratory, Centro Infantil Boldrini.', 'Structure and Activity Laboratory, Department of Chemistry Department.', 'Post- Graduation Program in Chemistry, Physical and Mathematical Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis.', 'Molecular Biology Laboratory, Centro Infantil Boldrini.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hemopathies Laboratory, Department of Clinical Analysis.', 'Post-Graduation Program in Pharmacy, Health Science Center.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Thiosemicarbazones/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000780 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2019 Sep;30(8):828-837. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000780.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression was found to correlate with IGHV status and was suggested as its surrogate marker. Recent data reported that LPL expression might be influenced by pivotal signalling pathways in CLL. This study aimed to assess LPL gene expression in relation to key immunogenetic and molecular markers of CLL, including IGHV mutational status, B-cell receptor (BCR) stereotypy, TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 gene mutations. Materials and Methods: Expression of LPL mRNA was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 73 CLL patients by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). IGHV, NOTCH1, TP53, and SF3B1 gene mutation analysis was performed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. RESULTS: 44 of 73 (60%) CLL cases were categorized as LPL-positive based on the cut-off value established by ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis. LPL expression was significantly associated with IGHV mutation status (r = 0.684; p < 0.0001) and tended to correlate with presence of NOTCH1 gene mutations (p = 0.113). BCR stereotyped cases showed higher LPL expression values in comparison to unstereotyped cases in the LPL-positive group of patients (p = 0.041). LPL expression was associated with a shorter overall survival in the entire capital ES, CyrillicLL group (median 107 vs 143, p = 0.048) as well as in Binet A patients, albeit with borderline significance (median 139 vs not reached, p = 0.086). CONCLUSION: LPL expression was found to be closely correlated with IGHV gene mutational status and overall survival, proving LPL as prognostic marker in CLL. Our results also indicate a possible relationship between aberrant expression of LPL and BCR- and NOTCH1-dependent signalling pathways.","['Bilous, N', 'Abramenko, I', 'Chumak, A', 'Dyagil, I', 'Martina, Z']","['Bilous N', 'Abramenko I', 'Chumak A', 'Dyagil I', 'Martina Z']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Hematology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Hematology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (LPL protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis']",,,,,2019/04/02 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['12391 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2019 Mar;41(1):39-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined the impact of direct contact in reciprocal regulation of ASC-PBMC functions. Activated PBMCs in vitro induced ASC immunomodulatory activity, while direct and paracrine intercellular interactions regulated PBMCs themselves: the functional state of the organelles was altered, and activation decreased. Direct contact with immune cells affected the activity of ASC intracellular compartments, in particular, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and decreased the growth rate. Some ASC properties, including motility, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens (HLA-ABC and HLA-DR, respectively) expression, did not depend on contact with PBMCs and were only regulated by paracrine means. Direct ASC and PBMC contact favoured an angiogenesis-supportive microenvironment, possibly due to the greater production of VEGF by ASCs; this microenvironment also contained a higher leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) level. Thus, a change in the functional activity of ASCs and PBMCs upon interaction promoted the formation of an immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and proangiogenic microenvironment. This environment could help resolve inflammation and further restore damaged tissue. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of transplanted mesenchymal stromal cells, particularly ASCs, for the treatment of a number of autoimmune diseases as well as various tissue injuries. To improve the efficiency of these methods, it is necessary to understand the principal events that occur when ASCs are introduced, primarily the molecular mechanisms of interaction between ASCs and the recipient immune system. We demonstrated that an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and angiostimulatory shift in the paracrine profile upon the interaction of activated PBMCs and ASCs changes the functional activity of both cell types, a phenomenon that is potentiated by direct cell-cell contact.","['Bobyleva, Polina', 'Gornostaeva, Aleksandra', 'Andreeva, Elena', 'Ezdakova, Mariia', 'Gogiya, Badri', 'Buravkova, Ludmila']","['Bobyleva P', 'Gornostaeva A', 'Andreeva E', 'Ezdakova M', 'Gogiya B', 'Buravkova L']","['Cell Physiology Lab, Institute of Biomedical Problems, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Cell Physiology Lab, Institute of Biomedical Problems, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Cell Physiology Lab, Institute of Biomedical Problems, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Cell Physiology Lab, Institute of Biomedical Problems, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Herniology and Plastic Surgery, A.

METHODS: Retrospective case series of 72 patients. RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 19 months. Leukocoria (n = 49, 68%) was the most common presenting complaint. The tumors were classified as groups D (n = 60, 42%) or E (n = 84, 58%) based on the Philadelphia version of International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB); groups D (n = 84, 58%) or E (n = 60, 42%) based on Children's Hospital Los Angeles version of International Classification of Intraocular Retinoblastoma (ICIoR); T2 (n = 116, 81%) or T3 (n = 28, 19%) based on 8th edition American Joint Committee Classification (AJCC). Systemic chemotherapy (n = 138, 96%) was the most common primary treatment modality. The chance of globe salvage was higher for group D based on ICRB (83%; odds ratio (OR) 7.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.45-17.33) or ICIoR (81%; OR 12.75; 95% CI 5.74-28.34) and T2b (73%; OR 5.19; 95% CI 2.51-10.73) based on AJCC. Over a mean follow-up period of 59 months, tumor recurrence was noted in 42 (29%) eyes and globe salvage was achieved in 83 (58%) eyes. Of the 50 eyes where vision was recorded, vision of 20/200 or better was achieved in 24 (48%) eyes. There were events of leukemia (n = 1, 1%), pinealoblastoma (n = 1, 1%), systemic metastasis (n = 3, 4%), and death (n = 4, 6%) during the follow-up period.

GSK2606414 is a potent inhibitor of PERK, while KIRA6 inhibits the kinase activity of IRE1. Both molecules are frequently used to probe the biological roles of the UPR in mammalian cells. In a direct binding assay, GSK2606414 bound to the cytoplasmic domain of KIT with dissociation constants (Kd) value of 664 +/- 294 nM whereas KIRA6 showed a Kd value of 10.8 +/- 2.9 microM. In silico docking studies confirmed a compact interaction of GSK2606414 and KIRA6 with KIT ATP binding pocket. In cultured cells, GSK2606414 inhibited KIT tyrosine kinase activity at nanomolar concentrations and in a PERK-independent manner. Moreover, in contrast to other KIT inhibitors, GSK2606414 enhanced KIT endocytosis and its lysosomal degradation. Although KIRA6 also inhibited KIT at nanomolar concentrations, it did not prompt KIT degradation, and rescued KIT from GSK2606414-mediated degradation. Consistent with KIT inhibition, nanomolar concentrations of GSK2606414 and KIRA6 were sufficient to induce cell death in a KIT signaling-dependent mast cell leukemia cell line. Our data show for the first time that KIT is a shared target for two seemingly unrelated UPR inhibitors at concentrations that overlap with PERK and IRE1 inhibition. Furthermore, these data underscore discrepancies between in vitro binding measurements of kinase inhibitors and inhibition of the tyrosine kinase receptors in living cells.","['Mahameed, Mohamed', 'Wilhelm, Thomas', 'Darawshi, Odai', 'Obiedat, Akram', 'Tommy, Weiss-Sadan', 'Chintha, Chetan', 'Schubert, Thomas', 'Samali, Afshin', 'Chevet, Eric', 'Eriksson, Leif A', 'Huber, Michael', 'Tirosh, Boaz']","['Mahameed M', 'Wilhelm T', 'Darawshi O', 'Obiedat A', 'Tommy WS', 'Chintha C', 'Schubert T', 'Samali A', 'Chevet E', 'Eriksson LA', 'Huber M', 'Tirosh B']","['Institute for Drug Research, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Immunology, Medical School, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Drug Research, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Institute for Drug Research, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Institute for Drug Research, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, H91 TK33, Ireland.', '2bind GmbH, Am BioPark 11, 93053, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, H91 TK33, Ireland.', 'INSERM U1242, Universite de Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer Eugene Marquis, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Immunology, Medical School, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Drug Research, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel. boazt@ekmd.huji.ac.il.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190401,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0', '(7-methyl-5-(1-((3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)acetyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-5-yl)-7H-', 'pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidin-4-amine)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (KIRA6)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrazines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lysosomes/drug effects', 'Naphthalenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/*drug effects', 'eIF-2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6443726,,,,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1523-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1523-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Apr 1;10(4):300. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1523-3.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8610-8375', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5654-3109', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8067-6577']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the narrow therapeutic range, significant inter- and intra-patient variabilities of MTX, non-effectiveness and/or toxicity occur abruptly to cause chemotherapeutic interruption or discontinuation. The relationship between clinical outcome and the systemic concentration of MTX has been well established, making the monitoring of plasma MTX levels critical in the treatment of ALL. Besides metabolizing enzymes, multiple transporters are also involved in determining the intracellular drug levels. In this mini-review, we focused on the genetic polymorphisms of MTX-disposition related transporters and the potential association between the discussed genetic variants and MTX pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity in the context of MTX treatment. METHODS: We searched PubMed for citations published in English using the terms ""methotrexate"", ""transporter"", ""acute lymphoblastic leukemia"", ""polymorphisms"", and ""therapeutic drug monitoring"". The retrieval papers were critically reviewed and summarized according to the aims of this mini-review. RESULTS: Solute carrier (SLC) transporters (SLC19A1, SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1, and SLC22A8) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, ABCC5, and ABCG2) mediate MTX disposition. Of note, the influences of polymorphisms of SLC19A1, SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 genes on the clinical outcome of MTX have been extensively studied. CONCLUSION: Overall, the data critically reviewed in this mini-review article confirmed that polymorphisms in the genes encoding SLC and ABC transporters confer higher sensitivity to altered plasma levels, MTX-induced toxicity, and therapeutic response in pediatric patients with ALL. Pre-emptive determination may be helpful in individualizing treatment.","['Hu, Ya-Hui', 'Zhou, Lin', 'Wang, Shan-Shan', 'Jing, Xia', 'Guo, Hong-Li', 'Sun, Fang', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Chen, Feng', 'Xu, Jing', 'Ji, Xing']","['Hu YH', 'Zhou L', 'Wang SS', 'Jing X', 'Guo HL', 'Sun F', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen F', 'Xu J', 'Ji X']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Department of Physiology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Organic Anion Transporters/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABC transporters', '*Methotrexate', '*SLC transporters', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*pharmacokinetics', '*polymorphism', '*therapeutic drug monitoring.']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPD-EPUB-97674 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612825666190329141003 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2019;25(6):627-634. doi: 10.2174/1381612825666190329141003.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Via MTT assay STIM demonstrated cytotoxic activity against K562 cell line with IC50 value of 150 microM. Apoptosis, as the mechanism of cell death, was evaluated by morphological study and flow cytometric analysis. In vitro DNA binding property of STIM has been studied by vital spectroscopic techniques, which indicated that STIM interact with ctDNA through groove binding mode and binding constant (Kb) was estimated to be 6.9 x 10(4) M(-1). Docking studies revealed that hydrophobic is the most important interaction in STIM-DNA complex, and that the ligand (STIM) interacts with DNA via groove binding mode and the bindiyspng energy was calculated as -13.37 kcal/mol. Taken together, the present study suggests that STIM exhibits anticancer effect on K562 cell line through the induction of apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest at Sub-G1 phase and also can bind to double helix DNA in vitro.","['Mehdipour, Maryam', 'Dehghan, Gholamreza', 'Yekta, Reza', 'Hanifeh Ahagh, Mina', 'Mahdavi, Majid', 'Ghasemi, Zarrin', 'Fathi, Zahra']","['Mehdipour M', 'Dehghan G', 'Yekta R', 'Hanifeh Ahagh M', 'Mahdavi M', 'Ghasemi Z', 'Fathi Z']","['a Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science s, University of Tabriz , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science s, University of Tabriz , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science s, University of Tabriz , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science s, University of Tabriz , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science s, University of Tabriz , Tabriz , Iran.', 'b Department of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry , University of Tabriz , Tabriz , Iran.', 'b Department of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry , University of Tabriz , Tabriz , Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190331,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Stilbenes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxicity', 'K562', 'groove binding', 'molecular docking', 'stilbene derivatives']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15257770.2018.1498517 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2019;38(2):101-118. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2018.1498517.

Simulation-based interventions can enhance competency. We developed a low-fidelity tabletop simulation game to teach pediatric septic shock and compared residents' knowledge of and comfort with recognition and management of septic shock. Methods: Pediatric and emergency medicine residents participated in an education session involving a low-fidelity, tabletop simulation in which they managed two simulated pediatric patients with septic shock. The two patients were a 12-year-old healthy male with cold shock due to a urinary tract infection and a 5-year-old female with a history of leukemia who developed warm shock due to pneumonia. Because this session was presented as a board game rather than high-fidelity simulation, learners focused on decision making rather than the mechanics of procedures. Residents completed a survey and a knowledge-based test before and after this session. Results: Twenty-three pediatric and nine emergency medicine residents participated. Correct responses for the preintervention test were 71%, compared with 83% postintervention. The difference in rates was 12% (95% confidence interval, -0.17 to -0.07; p < .0001). Residents rated this modality as being more useful than lectures or reading and as equivalent to bedside teaching and high-fidelity simulation. Discussion: Our pilot low-fidelity simulation improved resident knowledge and comfort with pediatric septic shock care. Further studies are needed to address the impact of low-fidelity simulations on patient outcomes.","['Bridges, E Page', 'Foster, Catherine E', 'Park, Dan B', 'Lehman-Huskamp, Kathy L', 'Mark, Dan W', 'Tuuri, Rachel E']","['Bridges EP', 'Foster CE', 'Park DB', 'Lehman-Huskamp KL', 'Mark DW', 'Tuuri RE']","['Assistant Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.', 'Assistant Clerkship Director, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.', 'Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Section of Infectious Diseases, Baylor College of Medicine.', ""Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Section of Infectious Diseases, Texas Children's Hospital."", ""Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, University of North Carolina Children's Hospital."", ""Director of Pediatric Emergency Ultrasound, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, University of North Carolina Children's Hospital."", ""Associate Medical Director for Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, University of North Carolina Children's Hospital."", 'Associate Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina College of Medicine.', 'Director of Emergency Management, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina College of Medicine.', 'Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics, University of South Dakota, Sanford School of Medicine.', 'Associate Professor, University of New Mexico School of Medicine.', 'Clinical Director, Pediatric Emergency Department, University of New Mexico School of Medicine.', 'Division Chief, Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190211,United States,MedEdPORTAL,MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,101714390,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Competence', 'Emergency Medicine/*education', 'Female', 'Games, Recreational', 'Humans', 'Internship and Residency/*methods', 'Knowledge', 'Learning/physiology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Pediatrics/*education', 'Pneumonia/complications', 'Shock, Septic/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Simulation Training/methods', 'Urinary Tract Infections/complications']",PMC6415010,['NOTNLM'],"['*Low-Fidelity Simulation', '*Pediatric Sepsis', '*Residents', '*Septic Shock', '*Severe Sepsis']",['None to report.'],2019/04/02 06:00,2020/04/22 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10804 [doi]'],epublish,MedEdPORTAL. 2019 Feb 11;15:10804. doi: 10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10804.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2016 revised World Health Organization classification recognizes the following EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD): chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) of T- and NK-cell type (cutaneous and systemic forms), systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoma of childhood, aggressive NK-cell leukemia, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, and the new provisional entity primary EBV-positive nodal T/NK-cell lymphoma. EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), although not included in the WHO classification because it is a reactive, inflammatory disease, is included in this review because it can be life-threatening and may have overlapping features with other EBV+ T/NK LPDs. EBV+ T/NK LPDs are rare diseases difficult to diagnose and manage properly, because some LPDs have unusual presentations, and discrepancies between clinical and histological findings might be encountered. Furthermore, EBV+ T/NK disorders share some clinico-pathological features, and may evolve into other categories during the clinical course, including malignant transformation of CAEBV. Here, we review the EBV+ T/NK LPDs in terms of their definitions, clinical features, histology, immunophenotype, molecular findings, and pathogenesis. This review aims to increase our understanding and awareness of the differential diagnosis among the different EBV+ T/NK LPDs. New insights into the genetic characteristics of these disorders will also be discussed.","['Kim, Wook Youn', 'Montes-Mojarro, Ivonne A', 'Fend, Falko', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia']","['Kim WY', 'Montes-Mojarro IA', 'Fend F', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L']","['Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190315,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC6428722,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV', 'aggressive NK-cell leukemia', 'chronic active EBV infection', 'extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma', 'hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis', 'lymphoproliferations', 'primary EBV nodal T and NK-cell lymphoma', 'systemic EBV positive T-cell lymphoma']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2019/04/02 06:01,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2019.00071 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Mar 15;7:71. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00071. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 54-year-old man presented with fever, multiple lymphadenopathies, petechial purpura and intraoral mucosal hemorrhage. Laboratory data revealed thrombocytopenia, normal white blood cell count, mild anemia, no active viral infections, and no autoimmune antibodies. Multiple lymphadenopathies were observed on computed tomography. A bone marrow biopsy revealed minor hypercellularity with increased number of megakaryocytes; however, there were no pathological cells or phagocytic cells. The patient was diagnosed with ITP; concurrently, he was also diagnosed with T/HRBCL via lymph node biopsy, and was treated accordingly with a chemotherapeutic regimen comprising rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone. Prompt reduction in the size of the superficial lymph nodes and an increase of the platelet count were observed simultaneously.

After emission into the air, the atmospheric oxidation process can modify its physiochemical properties and change its biological responses. In this study, we aimed to compare different DNA damage and repair responses promoted by fresh BC (FBC) and ozone oxidized-BC (OBC). The cell apoptosis, cell arrest, DNA damage and repair were investigated in A549 cells after treatment with FBC and OBC. Associated gene expressions were measured with the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method. Both FBC and OBC could induce cell apoptosis in A549 cells with up-regulated gene of promyelocytic leukemia protein (pml) and down-regulated gene of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2). FBC caused cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases, which was associated with up-regulated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm), checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2), structural maintenance of chromosomes 1 (smc1) and cell division cycle 25 homolog A (cdc25a) genes. OBC promoted cell cycle arrest at the S phase with up-regulated genes of atm, chk2 and smc1. Both FBC and OBC induced oxidative DNA damage and time-dependent DNA repair responses with increased gene expressions of breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (brca1), recombination protein A paralog B (rad51b), methyl methanesulfonate-sensitivity protein 22-like and tonsoku-like (mms22l). Compared to FBC, OBC could cause more sufficient DNA damage repair responses through cell cycle arrest at the S phase, resulting in relatively weaker DNA damages.","['An, Jing', 'He, Huixin', 'Wang, Lu', 'Jin, Yingying', 'Kong, Jiexing', 'Zhong, Yufang', 'Liu, Mingyuan', 'Shang, Yu']","['An J', 'He H', 'Wang L', 'Jin Y', 'Kong J', 'Zhong Y', 'Liu M', 'Shang Y']","['School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering , Shanghai University , Shanghai 200444 , China .

In a case-control study, 100 patients with CLL and 105 healthy individuals were investigated for Notch homolog 1, translocation-associated (Drosophila) (NOTCH1) c.7544-7545delCT, recombinant splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) c.2098A>G, mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) 40-bp insertion/deletion and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) L265P mutations by using allele specific-polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR), a designed AS-PCR, PCR and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, respectively. The presence of NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations were confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing. The NOTCH1 mutation was detected in 10% of patients and not detected in the control group. A higher frequency of NOTCH1 mutation was detected in patients with stage III CLL (62.5%) compared with stages 0-II CLL (37.5%) (odds ratio, 4.69-fold; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-21.9; P=0.049). The SF3B1 mutation was observed in 12% of the patients compared with 1.9% of the controls (P=0.012). The presence of MDM2 polymorphism was not associated with the risk or the stage of the disease. In addition, the MYD88 L265P mutation was not detected in the patients or the controls. The current study established the frequency of NOTCH1, SF3B1, MDM2 and MYD88 mutations in patients with CLL from the Kurdish population of Western Iran. In summary, a high frequency of NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations were identified in patients with CLL compared with healthy individuals, and the NOTCH1 mutation was associated with a high stage of the disease.","['Maleki, Yosra', 'Alahbakhshi, Zahra', 'Heidari, Zahra', 'Moradi, Mohammad-Taher', 'Rahimi, Ziba', 'Yari, Kheirolah', 'Rahimi, Zohreh', 'Aznab, Mozafar', 'Ahmadi-Khajevand, Meisam', 'Bahremand, Fariborz']","['Maleki Y', 'Alahbakhshi Z', 'Heidari Z', 'Moradi MT', 'Rahimi Z', 'Yari K', 'Rahimi Z', 'Aznab M', 'Ahmadi-Khajevand M', 'Bahremand F']","['Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.', 'Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67148-69914, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190219,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC6425375,['NOTNLM'],"['MDM2', 'MYD88', 'NOTCH1', 'SF3B1', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'mutation']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2019/04/02 06:01,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2019.10048 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-10048 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2019 Apr;17(4):4016-4023. doi: 10.3892/ol.2019.10048.

Here we identify the Let7 target, Arid3a, as a crucial molecular effector of the B-1 cell developmental program. Arid3a expression is increased at pro-B cell stage and markedly increased at pre-B and immature B cell stages in the fetal/neonatal liver B-1 development relative to that in the Lin28b(-)Let7(+) adult bone marrow (BM) B-2 cell development. Analysis of B-lineage restricted Lin28b transgenic (Tg) mice, Arid3a knockout and Arid3a Tg mice, confirmed that increased Arid3a allows B cell generation without requiring surrogate light chain (SLC) associated pre-BCR stage, and prevents MHC class II cell expression at the pre-B and newly generated immature B cell stages, distinct from pre-BCR dependent B development with MHC class II in adult BM. Moreover, Arid3a plays a crucial role in supporting B1a cell generation. The increased Arid3a leads higher Myc and Bhlhe41, and lower Siglec-G and CD72 at the pre-B and immature B cell stages than normal adult BM, to allow BCR signaling induced B1a cell generation. Arid3a-deficiency selectively blocks the development of B1a cells, while having no detectable effect on CD5(-) B1b, MZ B, and FO B cell generation resembling B-2 development outcome. Conversely, enforced expression of Arid3a by transgene is sufficient to promote the development of B1a cells from adult BM. Under the environment change between birth to adult, altered BCR repertoire in increased B1a cells occurred generated from adult BM. However, crossed with B1a-restricted VH/D/J IgH knock-in mice allowed to confirm that SLC-unassociated B1a cell increase and CLL/lymphoma generation can occur in aged from Arid3a increased adult BM. These results confirmed that in fetal/neonatal normal mice, increased Arid3a at the pre-B cell and immature B cell stages is crucial for generating B1a cells together with the environment for self-ligand reactive BCR selection, B1a cell maintenance, and potential for development of CLL/Lymphoma in aged mice.","['Hayakawa, Kyoko', 'Li, Yue-Sheng', 'Shinton, Susan A', 'Bandi, Srinivasa R', 'Formica, Anthony M', 'Brill-Dashoff, Joni', 'Hardy, Richard R']","['Hayakawa K', 'Li YS', 'Shinton SA', 'Bandi SR', 'Formica AM', 'Brill-Dashoff J', 'Hardy RR']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190315,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Arid3a protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Aging/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology']",PMC6428705,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arid3a', '*B-1 development', '*B1a', '*CLL/lymphoma', '*Lin28b']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.00457 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Mar 15;10:457. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00457. eCollection 2019.,,,,['R01 AI113320/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we first measure the expression level of PVT1 in a Jurkat cell line, then small interfering (siRNA) PVT1 is applied to demonstrate the impact of PVT1 knockdown in apoptosis, proliferation, the cell cycle, and its downstream targets. Our findings show that lncRNA was significantly higher in the ALL cell line than normal lymphocytes and that PVT1 knock-down increased the rate of apoptosis, caused G0/G1 arrest in the cell cycle, reduced the proliferation rate, and, above all, reduced the stability of c-Myc protein. All findings were confirmed at the molecular level.

Among all the reported PRMT5 inhibitors, two small molecules (GSK-3326595 and JNJ-64619178) are currently being assessed in clinical trial. In this study, 40 PRMT5 inhibitor candidates were purchased from SPECS database supplier according to the pharmacophore and molecular docking based virtual screening results. Alpha linked immunosorbent assay (LISA) methylation assay was performed to test their inhibitory activity against PRMT5. The in vitro enzymatic assay results indicated that four compounds (2, 4, 10 and 37) showed PRMT5 inhibitory activity, while 4 and 10 displayed the most potent activity with IC50 values of 8.1 +/- 1.1 and 6.5 +/- 0.6 microM, respectively. The inhibitory activity results of 20 extra analogs of 4 further confirmed the potency of this scaffold. As expected, compounds 4 and 10 exhibited moderate anti-proliferative activity against mantle cell lymphoma Jeko-1 and leukemia cell MV4-11. Besides, Western blot assay results showed that 4 could reduce the H4R3me2s level in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that it could inhibit the activity of PRMT5 in cellular context. Detailed interactions between 4 and PRMT5 were characterized by binding mode analysis through molecular docking. The compounds discovered in this study will inspire medicinal chemists to further explore this series of PRMT5 inhibitors.","['Tao, Hongrui', 'Yan, Xue', 'Zhu, Kongkai', 'Zhang, Hua']","['Tao H', 'Yan X', 'Zhu K', 'Zhang H']","['School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, University of Jinan.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences.', 'School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, University of Jinan.', 'School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan.', 'School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,0377775,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (JNJ-64619178)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)', 'VXT8SZ6875 (GSK-3326595)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Discovery', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,['NOTNLM'],"['antiproliferation', 'epigenetic inhibitor', 'molecular docking', 'virtual screening']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/cpb.c18-00980 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo). 2019;67(4):382-388. doi: 10.1248/cpb.c18-00980.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The individuals share additional phenotypic features that include feeding difficulties in infancy, joint hypermobility, and characteristic facial features such as a wide mouth, a pointed chin, long ears, and a low columella. Notably, two individuals developed cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma, in childhood. KDM3B encodes for a histone demethylase and is involved in H3K9 demethylation, a crucial part of chromatin modification required for transcriptional regulation. We identified missense and truncating variants, suggesting that KDM3B haploinsufficiency is the underlying mechanism for this syndrome. By using a hybrid facial-recognition model, we show that individuals with a pathogenic variant in KDM3B have a facial gestalt, and that they show significant facial similarity compared to control individuals with ID. In conclusion, pathogenic variants in KDM3B cause a syndrome characterized by ID, short stature, and facial dysmorphism.","['Diets, Illja J', 'van der Donk, Roos', 'Baltrunaite, Kristina', 'Waanders, Esme', 'Reijnders, Margot R F', 'Dingemans, Alexander J M', 'Pfundt, Rolph', 'Vulto-van Silfhout, Anneke T', 'Wiel, Laurens', 'Gilissen, Christian', 'Thevenon, Julien', 'Perrin, Laurence', 'Afenjar, Alexandra', 'Nava, Caroline', 'Keren, Boris', 'Bartz, Sarah', 'Peri, Bethany', 'Beunders, Gea', 'Verbeek, Nienke', 'van Gassen, Koen', 'Thiffault, Isabelle', 'Cadieux-Dion, Maxime', 'Huerta-Saenz, Lina', 'Wagner, Matias', 'Konstantopoulou, Vassiliki', 'Vodopiutz, Julia', 'Griese, Matthias', 'Boel, Annekatrien', 'Callewaert, Bert', 'Brunner, Han G', 'Kleefstra, Tjitske', 'Hoogerbrugge, Nicoline', 'de Vries, Bert B A', 'Hwa, Vivian', 'Dauber, Andrew', 'Hehir-Kwa, Jayne Y', 'Kuiper, Roland P', 'Jongmans, Marjolijn C J']","['Diets IJ', 'van der Donk R', 'Baltrunaite K', 'Waanders E', 'Reijnders MRF', 'Dingemans AJM', 'Pfundt R', 'Vulto-van Silfhout AT', 'Wiel L', 'Gilissen C', 'Thevenon J', 'Perrin L', 'Afenjar A', 'Nava C', 'Keren B', 'Bartz S', 'Peri B', 'Beunders G', 'Verbeek N', 'van Gassen K', 'Thiffault I', 'Cadieux-Dion M', 'Huerta-Saenz L', 'Wagner M', 'Konstantopoulou V', 'Vodopiutz J', 'Griese M', 'Boel A', 'Callewaert B', 'Brunner HG', 'Kleefstra T', 'Hoogerbrugge N', 'de Vries BBA', 'Hwa V', 'Dauber A', 'Hehir-Kwa JY', 'Kuiper RP', 'Jongmans MCJ']","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, 6525GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands;

However, recent clinical evidence indicates that a substantial proportion of CML patients exhibit BCR-ABL-dependent or independent resistance to imatinib. Despite the importance of imatinib resistance in CML, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this resistance are largely unknown. Here, we identified GCA (grancalcin) as a critical regulator of imatinib resistance in chronic phase CML via activation of autophagy. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GCA activates TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase activity to induce Lys63 ubiquitination of ULK1, a crucial regulator of autophagy, resulting in its stabilization and activation. We also highlighted the role of GCA-TRAF6-ULK1 autophagy regulatory axis in imatinib resistance. Our findings represent the basis for novel therapeutic strategies against CML.Abbreviation: ACTB/beta-actin: actin beta; ADM: adrenomedullin; AMBRA1: autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ANXA5: annexin A5; CP: cytogenetic response; CML: chronic myeloid leukemia; CUL3: cullin 3; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GCA: grancalcin; Dx: at diagnosis; E-64-d: (2S,3S)-trans-Epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester; IMres: Imatinib resistance; KLHL20: Kelch-like protein 20; LRMP: lymphoid-restricted membrane protein; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MMR: major molecular response; NH4Cl: ammonium chloride; PBMCs: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PTPRC: protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; SYK: spleen associated tyrosine kinase; TAP1: transporter 1, ATP binding cassette subfamily B member; TKIs: ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors; TLR9: toll- like receptor 9; TRAF6: TNF receptor associated factor 6; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.","['Han, Seung Hun', 'Korm, Sovannarith', 'Han, Ye Gi', 'Choi, Soo-Young', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Chung, Hee Jin', 'Park, Kibeom', 'Kim, Jae-Young', 'Myung, Kyungjae', 'Lee, Joo-Yong', 'Kim, Hongtae', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Han SH', 'Korm S', 'Han YG', 'Choi SY', 'Kim SH', 'Chung HJ', 'Park K', 'Kim JY', 'Myung K', 'Lee JY', 'Kim H', 'Kim DW']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Analytical Science and Technology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Analytical Science and Technology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Genomic Integrity Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Analytical Science and Technology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Integrated Metabolomics Research Group, Western Seoul Center, Korea Basic Science Institute, Seoul, Korea.', 'Center for Genomic Integrity Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190330,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GCA protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tifab protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ULK1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Autophagy/drug effects/*genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects/genetics']",PMC6844495,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*TRAF6', '*ULK1', '*chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*grancalcin (GCA)', '*imatinib resistance']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2019.1596492 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2019 Dec;15(12):2076-2090. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2019.1596492.

Additionally, Mcl-1 drives intrinsic and acquired resistance to many cancer therapeutics, including B cell lymphoma 2 family inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, and antitubulins. Therefore, Mcl-1 inhibition could serve as a strategy to target cancers that require Mcl-1 to evade apoptosis. Herein, we describe the use of structure-based design to discover a novel compound (42) that robustly and specifically inhibits Mcl-1 in cell culture and animal xenograft models. Compound 42 binds to Mcl-1 with picomolar affinity and inhibited growth of Mcl-1-dependent tumor cell lines in the nanomolar range. Compound 42 also inhibited the growth of hematological and triple negative breast cancer xenografts at well-tolerated doses. These findings highlight the use of structure-based design to identify small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors and support the use of 42 as a potential treatment strategy to block Mcl-1 activity and induce apoptosis in Mcl-1-dependent cancers.","['Lee, Taekyu', 'Christov, Plamen P', 'Shaw, Subrata', 'Tarr, James C', 'Zhao, Bin', 'Veerasamy, Nagarathanam', 'Jeon, Kyu Ok', 'Mills, Jonathan J', 'Bian,

Methods: The clinical data of 30 cases with CCA/Ph(-) during TKI treatment in Henan Cancer Hospital from August 2007 to July 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The univariate factor was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Multiple-factor was analyzed by Cox proportional risk model. Results: Of the 30 cases, 19 (63.3%) were males. At the first detection of CCA/Ph(-) the median age was 44 (rang 14-68) years old and the median treatment of TKI was 13 (rang 2-94) months. The clones proportion of first detected CCA/Ph(-)>/= 50% was found in 18 (60.0%) cases. TKI treatment for 3 months with BCR-ABL(IS) less than 10% was seen in 14 (46.7%) patients. 63.3% (19/30) of CCA/Ph(-) was transient (only one time) and 36.7% (11/30) was repeated (>/=2 times) . Trisomy 8 dominant accounted for 60.0% (18/30) , -7/7q- for 13.3% (4/30) , loss of chromosome Y 6.7%. With a median of follow-up 50 months, 76.7% (23/30) cases were in complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) ; 63.3% (19/30) in major molecular response (MMR) , 43.3% (13/30) in undetectable minimal residual disease (UMRD) . The median event-free survival rate of (EFS) were 44 months, and 2-year and 5-year EFS were (82.1+/-7.3) % and (52.4+/-12.8) %, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) were 50 months, and 2-year and 5-year OS rates were (92.6+/-5.0) % and (77.2+/-14.7) %, respectively. Univariate analysis shows that the 2-year EFS of who in males, more than 2 times CCA/Ph(-), BCR-ABL(IS)>10% at 3 months after TKI were significantly lower than women, transient CCA/Ph(-), and BCR-ABL(IS)</=10% (P<0.05) . The 2-year OS rate in whom the occurrence frequency of CCA/Ph(-) more than twice was significantly lower than those with transient CCA/Ph(-) (P<0.05) . Multivariate analysis showed that CCA/Ph(-) was an independent risk factor (RR=4.741, 95%CI 1.21-18.571, P=0.018) for EFS in CML patients. Conclusion: Trisomy 8, -7/7q-, and -Y were the most common CCA/Ph(-) during TKI treatment, with high clones proportion of >/=50%. CCA/Ph(-) mainly occurred transiently or was permanent occasionally. CCA/Ph(-) recurrence (>/=2 times) was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS in CML with TKI.","['Zhao, H F', 'Zhang, Yanli', 'Hu, J Y', 'Li, Z', 'Zhou, J', 'Yu, F K', 'Zu, Y L', 'Zhou, H', 'Wei, X D', 'Song, Y P']","['Zhao HF', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu JY', 'Li Z', 'Zhou J', 'Yu FK', 'Zu YL', 'Zhou H', 'Wei XD', 'Song YP']","['Department of Hematology, Henan Cancer Hospital, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC7342545,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromosomal abnormalities', 'Leukemia, myelogenous, chronic, BCR-ABL positive', 'Philadelphia negative cells', 'Prognosis', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2019/04/01 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.03.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Mar 14;40(3):209-214. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.03.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: MTT method was used to determine the anti-proliferation effect of different concentrations of artesunate, bortezomib and their combination on MV4-11 cells. The cell apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cleaved-Caspase-3, Bcl-2 family protein (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bim, Bax) and autophagy-related protein LC3B were assayed by Western blot. Results: Artesunate displayed a proliferation inhibition effect on MV4-11 with dose- and time-dependent manner, the IC(50) of artesunate on MV4-11 after 48 hours was 1.44 mug/ml. Bortezomib displayed a proliferation inhibition effect on MV4-11 with dose-dependent manner, the IC(50) of bortezomib on MV4-11 after 48 hours was 8.97 nmol/L. The combination of artesunate (0.75, 1.0 mug/ml) and Bortezomib (6, 8 nmol/L) showed higher inhibition on MV4-11 than artesunate or bortezomib alone in the same concentration gradient after 48 hours (P<0.05) . The cooperation index of the two drugs were all less than 1. The 48 h apoptotic rate of artesunate (1.5 mug/ml) on MV4-11 was (15.27+/-2.18) %, (19.85+/-3.23) % of bortezomib (8 nmol/L) , (81.67+/-5.96) % of combination of the two drugs, significantly higher than the single group (P<0.05) . When combination of the two drugs on MV4-11 after 24 hours, the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bim and the cleaved activation of Caspase-3 and autophagy-related protein LC3B were up-regulated and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expressions was down-regulated. Conclusion: Combination of artesunate with bortezomib shows a significant synergistic effects on proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy of MV4-11 cell lines, which may be associated with Bcl-2 family proteins expression.","['Hu, L J', 'Jiang, T', 'Wang, F J', 'Huang, S H', 'Cheng, X M', 'Jia, Y Q']","['Hu LJ', 'Jiang T', 'Wang FJ', 'Huang SH', 'Cheng XM', 'Jia YQ']","['Department of Hematology, Hematology Laboratory, Western China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Sichuan Province, Chengdu 610072, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Hematology Laboratory, Western China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yibin, Yibin 644000, Sichuan Province, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Chengdu Military General Hospital, Chengdu 610083, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hematology Laboratory, Western China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['60W3249T9M (Artesunate)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Artesunate', '*Autophagy', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute']",PMC7342538,['NOTNLM'],"['Artesunate', 'Bcl-2 family proteins', 'Bortezomib', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'MV4-11 cell lines']",,2019/04/02 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2019/04/01 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.03.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Mar 14;40(3):204-208. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.03.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Clinical data of patients with t (3; 21) (q26; q22) , diagnosed as hematologic malignancies in Peking University people's hospital from January 2011 to March 2018, were collected retrospectively. 19 patients in our hospital and forty-eight patients bearing t (3;21) (q26;q22) with detailed survival data reported in literature were summarized. Kaplan- Meier method was used for survival analysis. Results: Among 19 patients, including 15 males and 4 females with a median age of 36 years (22-68 years) , 4 cases was diagnosed as de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , 4 as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) , 3 as MDS-AML and 8 as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in myeloid blast transformation. All of the 19 patients were detected to have t (3;21) (q26;q22) by G-banding technique and 13 carried additional cytogenetic aberrations. 9 of the 19 patients were detected for positive AML1-MDS1 fusion genes. In the 9 patients with detailed follow-up data, 6 patients received chemotherapy and only 2 achieved complete remission (CR) while 4 with no response. During the follow-up period, 8 patients died and the median overall survival (OS) was 6 months (4.5 to 22 months) . Survival analysis of the present 9 patients together with the literature data showed that the prognosis was poor and the median OS was 7 months. In particular, AML/t-AML had the worst prognosis.

We hypothesized that BM morphologic abnormalities detected in the Chronic phase (CP) can identify patients with an increased risk of developing blast phase (BP). We also compared cases of BP PV to a group of acute myeloid leukemia cases with JAK2 mutation (AML-JAK2mut). We collected morphological, cytogenetics (CG), and molecular information at the time of diagnosis and at time of diagnosis of BP. We evaluate the presence of splicing factor mutations at BP. A total of 60/477 (12.5%) patients with diagnosis of BP of PV were identified, 17 of them had BM sample available during CP. Ten patients with PV CP were used as control group. We found that dyserythropoiesis during evolution were more frequent in patients who develop BP than in patients who remain in CP (13/17 vs. 3/10; P=.0402). Similarly, ring sideroblast (RS) increase during CP were more frequent in patients who develop BP (8/16 vs. 0/10. P=.0095). By ELN risk stratification for CG risk in BP all patients had adverse or intermediate risk; in AML-JAK2mut 2/11 patients (18%) had favorable as risk category. TP53 mutations were significantly more frequent in BP than in AML-JAK2mut (7/14 vs. 1/11, P=.0421). Mutation analysis for splicing factor at BP was performed on 13 patients. Only 2 patients with >15% RS had SRSF2 (2 patients) and SF3B1 (1 patient) mutations. The other patients were wild type. Dyserythropoiesis and the acquisition of RS precede other markers of disease progression to BP. CK and TP53 mutation are more frequent in BP than in AML-JAK2mut.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine safety, efficacy, and clinical impact of PST in immunocompromised patients with cancer. METHODS: A quality improvement process establishing a PST service was implemented at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Adult patients admitted to leukemia and genitourinary medical oncology (GUMO) services with history of possible type I reactions to PCN were eligible for testing. RESULTS: Between April and October 2017, 218 patients with reported PCN allergies were screened; 100 met inclusion criteria and underwent PST (67 leukemia, 33 GUMO). The most common reported allergy was to PCN (64%), with 61% reporting cutaneous reactions and 79% reporting reactions more than 20 years ago. PST with oral challenge results were overwhelmingly negative (95%); only 4% tested positive, and 1 test result was indeterminate (negative histamine control). After negative PST and oral challenge results, 51% patients were transitioned to PCN-based antibiotics during the same hospitalization. During the follow-up period (median 177 days), 65 of 95 patients were readmitted (185 total readmissions), and 51 patients required antibiotic therapy, with 37 receiving a PCN-based antibiotic (accounting for 336 days of therapy). No patient who received PCN-based antibiotics experienced an immediate-type allergic reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support PST use in immunocompromised hosts. The widespread use of PST in patients with cancer will allow for optimal use of antimicrobial therapy and stewardship, which are vital in a population at increased risk for infections.","['Taremi, Mahnaz', 'Artau, Annette', 'Foolad, Farnaz', 'Berlin, Sheila', 'White, Candice', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Raad, Issam', 'Adachi, Javier']","['Taremi M', 'Artau A', 'Foolad F', 'Berlin S', 'White C', 'Jiang Y', 'Raad I', 'Adachi J']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex.

Mutation frequencies at landmark time points (3, 6, and 12 months) were assessed with 16 landmark responses defined by European LeukemiaNet and 2 additional responses, including a complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months and a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months. RESULTS: After 12 months of imatinib treatment of 605 patients, 28 (4.6%) patients harbored 33 mutations, including 23 (69.7%) highly resistant T315I and P-loop mutations. Sequencing data from 650 samples were compared with cytogenetic responses. The mutation frequencies in optimal, warning, and failure groups were 0.5% (2/430), 1.8% (2/110), and 19.1% (21/110), respectively.

For the 2 additional responses, the mutation frequencies in patients with CHR at 3 months and with CCyR at 12 months were 0% (0/160) and 1.7% (4/242), respectively. Overall, mutations were frequently detected at 3-month cytogenetic failure (25.0%), 12-month cytogenetic failure (23.2%), and 6-month cytogenetic failure (10.5%) using response-mutation association analysis.

Extensive data have demonstrated that angiogenesis is associated with AML progression and chemotherapy resistance. Thus, targeting angiogenesis may be a promising approach for AML treatment. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of CS2164 (named as Chiauranib), a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in AML cells. Our results illustrated that CS2164 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and abolished clonogenicity in AML cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, CS2164 markedly induced apoptosis of AML cell lines and primary AML cells from 42 adult patients. Furthermore, we found that CS2164 has a comprehensive activity against AML irrespective of disease status and genetic mutations. Also, CS2164 suppressed AML growth in xenograft models in vivo.

A retrospective study was conducted including all adults allografted in our department with such a regimen and disease with the aim to assess whether or not the donor type (matched sibling [MSD], matched unrelated [MUD], or haploidentical [haplo]) impacted outcomes. Between October 2009 and February 2018, 118 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six, 55, and 27 patients received a graft from an MSD, MUD, or haplo donor, respectively. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were the source of graft for all patients. The median age of the entire cohort was 62 years (range, 20 to 73), and the median follow-up was 31 months (range, 4.5 to 106). All patients engrafted except 1 haplo recipient. Neutrophils (>.5 x 10(9)/L) and platelets (50 x 10(9)/L) recoveries were significantly delayed in the haplo group (P=.0003 and P < .0001) compared with MSD and MUD. Acute grades II to IV or III to IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidences were similar between the 3 groups as well as the incidence of moderate or severe chronic GVHD. Also, similar 2-year overall survival (OS; 64.7% versus 73.9% versus 60.2%, P=.39), disease-free survival (DFS; 57.7% versus 70.9% versus and 53.6%, P=.1), and GVHD relapse-free survival (37.9% versus 54.3% versus 38.9%, P=.23) were observed between MSD versus MUD versus haplo groups. The same was true when considering only acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. In multivariate analysis the type of donor remained independent of outcomes in this series, whereas myelodysplastic syndrome (versus AML), high disease risk index, and older donor (>/=50 years) were associated with lower OS and DFS.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment and is of particular interest in patients at high risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In MDS, CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells possess MDS stem cell potential, and secondary AML (sAML) clones originate from the MDS disease stage. However, the prognostic impact of the pretreatment stem cell population burden in MDS remains unknown. We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic impact of the pretreatment CD34(+)/CD38(-) cell burden in 124 MDS patients who received allogeneic HSCT at our institution. A high pretreatment bone marrow CD34(+)/CD38(-) cell burden (>/=1%) was associated with worse genetic risk and a higher incidence of blast excess. Patients with a high CD34(+)/CD38(-) cell burden had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of MDS relapse, a higher cumulative incidence of secondary AML, and a trend for shorter overall survival after allogeneic HSCT. In multivariable analyses this prognostic impact was shown to be independent of other clinical and cytogenetic risk factors in MDS. Patients suffering MDS relapse or progression to AML also had a higher pre-treatment CD34(+)/CD38(-) cell burden as a continuous variable. The observed prognostic impact is likely mediated by MDS stem cells within the CD34(+)/CD38(-) cell population initiating MDS relapse or progression to AML. New therapeutic strategies targeting MDS stem cells might improve outcomes.","['Jentzsch, Madlen', 'Geus, Ulrike', 'Grimm, Juliane', 'Vucinic, Vladan', 'Ponisch, Wolfram', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Behre, Gerhard', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Schwind, Sebastian']","['Jentzsch M', 'Geus U', 'Grimm J', 'Vucinic V', 'Ponisch W', 'Franke GN', 'Behre G', 'Niederwieser D', 'Schwind S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.

Emerging data has begun to elucidate who may be at highest risk of developing t-MNs, which ideally will enable us to develop preventative strategies for this devastating disease. As t-MNs may not be avoidable, novel therapies are urgently needed for this patient group and are underway as exemplified by recent investigation in restoring wild-type p53 function as well as directly targeting TP53 mutant variants.

Treatment of patients with tAML is challenging. The key initial clinical decision is whether a patient is a candidate for or likely to benefit from intensive induction chemotherapy, a determination which we argue should not be predicated on chronologic age alone. For those determined likely to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy, CPX-351 is likely superior to conventional induction with cytarabine and daunorubicin. For those deemed inappropriate for intensive induction, hypomethylating agents have the strongest evidence base in elderly adults with AML, and are an attractive option in tAML. This is particularly true in patients with TP53 mutations who are less likely to respond to conventional induction chemotherapy. Exciting options on the therapeutic horizon for tAML include combination therapies incorporating BCL2 inhibitors, Hedgehog pathway inhibitors, and isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors.","['Shea, Lauren K', 'Uy, Geoffrey L']","['Shea LK', 'Uy GL']","['Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

The excess risk of myelodysplastic syndromes and/or acute myeloid leukemia is observed across several AD types, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disorders, multiple sclerosis, among others. The risk of developing myeloid neoplasms (MNs) is dependent on several variables, including the specific AD type, chronicity and severity of the AD, type and duration of exposure of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or cytotoxics/immunosuppressives, and genetic predisposition risk. Putative triggering factors linking AD to elevated MN risk include AD-directed medications, shared genetic susceptibilities between the two disease entities, and chronic immune stimulation or bone marrow infiltration by the AD. Molecular mechanisms underpinning leukemogenesis remain largely speculative and warrant further investigation. Leukemias arising in patients with AD are not always 'therapy-related' in that MNs may develop in certain AD subtypes even among patients with no prior therapy exposure. Only a few studies have attempted to determine factors associated with MN development in AD but failed to demonstrate consistent characteristic clinical or paraclinical features. These reports have failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between individual agent exposure and subsequent leukemia development due to the low rates of therapy exposure compounded by the rarity of MN occurrence.

Both patient-specific and treatment-specific factors likely impact the risk of t-MN development after diagnosis and treatment of PCD. Alkylating chemotherapy, especially melphalan, has been strongly tied to the risk of t-MN. More recently, there has been a shift away from long-term alkylating therapies to immunomodulatory agents and high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant (HD-ASCT). This shift has led to improved survival and long-term outcomes for most MM patients. However, the risks of t-MN remain despite the improved efficacy of these treatments, and patients who develop t-MN have a poor prognosis. Understanding the risk factors predisposing MM patients to t-MN can thus help to tailor individualized therapy to maximize anti-myeloma efficacy and minimize the risks of t-MN.","['Chung, Alfred', 'Liedtke, Michaela']","['Chung A', 'Liedtke M']","['Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA, USA.

The survival for t-MDS/AML is extremely poor. Multiple heterogeneous retrospective studies have reported risk factors for the development of t-MDS/AML. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been most closely examined as possible t-MDS/AML risk factors. In this paper, we will review the risks of t-MDS/AML for HL and NHL patients as reported in the literature and assess for any changes over time. In HL patients, the incidence of t-MDS/AML has decreased with a reduction in alkylating agents. In indolent NHL patients, we anticipate decreased incidence of t-MDS/AML as targeted therapies begin to replace cytotoxic chemotherapy.","['Al-Juhaishi, Taha', 'Khurana, Arushi', 'Shafer, Danielle']","['Al-Juhaishi T', 'Khurana A', 'Shafer D']","['Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond VA, United States.', 'Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond VA, United States.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond VA, United States.

It is a pity that two resistant mutations (I502L and V468F) have been found during the clinical trial, which is a challenge for the curative effect of Asciminib. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GB/SA) calculations were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Asciminib resistance induced by the two mutants. The obtained results indicate that the mutations have adversely influence on the binding of Asciminib to BCR-ABL, as the nonpolar contributions decline in the two mutants. In addition, I502L mutation causes alpha-helix I' (alphaI') to shift away from the helical bundle composed of alphaE, alphaF, and alphaH, making the distance between alphaI' and Asciminib increased. For V468F mutant, the side chain of Phe468 occupies the bottom of the myristoyl pocket (MP), which drives Asciminib to shift toward the outside of MP. Our results provide the molecular insights of Asciminib resistance mechanism in BCR-ABL mutants, which may help the design of novel inhibitors.","['Zhan, Jiu-Yu', 'Ma, Jie', 'Zheng, Qing-Chuan']","['Zhan JY', 'Ma J', 'Zheng QC']","[""International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry, Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Institute of Theoretical Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130023, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry, Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Institute of Theoretical Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130023, People's Republic of China; Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Jilin University, Changchun, 130023, People's Republic of China.

The cell viability assay revealed that most of the s-triazine compounds induced cytotoxicity in all four types of human cancer cell lines, however, compounds 4a, and 6g, both of them have a piperidine moiety in their structure were most effective. These two compounds affected the cell viability of cancer cells, with IC50 values within the range between 5 to 9microM. The cell cycle analysis showed that 4a and 6g induced S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in K562 cells. This could be the mechanism by which these molecules induced cytotoxicity in tested cancer cells. The prepared compounds were tested in zebrafish embryos to evaluate in vivo and developmental toxicity of the pyrazolyl-s-triazine derivatives in animals.

Here, we report that inducible PMLIV expression inhibits cell proliferation as well as self-renewal and impairs cell cycle progression of breast cancer cell lines in a reversible manner. Transcriptomic profiling identified a large number of PML-deregulated genes associated with various cell processes. Among them, cell cycle- and division-related genes and their cognitive regulators are highly ranked. In this study, we focused on previously unknown PML targets, namely the Forkhead transcription factors. PML suppresses the Forkhead box subclass M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor at both the RNA and protein levels, along with many of its gene targets. We show that FOXM1 interacts with PMLIV primarily via its DNA-binding domain and dynamically colocalizes in PML nuclear bodies. In parallel, PML modulates the activity of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), a factor opposing certain FOXM1 activities, to promote cell survival and stress resistance. Thus, PMLIV affects the balance of FOXO3 and FOXM1 transcriptional programs by acting on discrete gene subsets to favor both growth inhibition and survival. Interestingly, PMLIV-specific knockdown mimicked ectopic expression vis-a-vis loss of proliferative ability and self-renewal, but also led to loss of survival ability as shown by increased apoptosis. We propose that divergent or similar effects on cell physiology may be elicited by high or low PMLIV levels dictated by other concurrent genetic or epigenetic cancer cell states that may additionally account for its disparate effects in various cancer types.","['Sachini, Nikoleta', 'Arampatzi, Panagiota', 'Klonizakis, Antonios', 'Nikolaou, Christoforos', 'Makatounakis, Takis', 'Lam, Eric W-F', 'Kretsovali, Androniki', 'Papamatheakis, Joseph']","['Sachini N', 'Arampatzi P', 'Klonizakis A', 'Nikolaou C', 'Makatounakis T', 'Lam EW', 'Kretsovali A', 'Papamatheakis J']","['Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, UK.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, UK.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190516,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1/genetics/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6547613,['NOTNLM'],"['* PML', '*FOXO3-FOXM1 network', '*breast cancer', '*growth arrest', '*transcriptomics']",,2019/03/31 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/03/31 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12486 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2019 Jun;13(6):1369-1387. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12486.

This is especially true for patients with previously limited treatment options due to disease characteristics or coexisting diseases. Ibrutinib was the first orally available, nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of BTK approved for the treatment of patients with various B-cell malignancies. Newer and more selective BTK inhibitors are currently in clinical development, including acalabrutinib, which is currently US FDA approved for previously treated mantle cell lymphoma. Significant efforts are underway to investigate the optimal combinations, timing, and sequencing of BTK inhibitors with other regimens and targeted agents, and to capitalize on the immunomodulatory modes of action of BTK inhibitors to correct tumor-induced immune defects and to achieve long-lasting tumor control. This review describes the major milestones in the clinical development of BTK inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell malignancies, highlights the most recent long-term follow-up results, and evaluates the role of BTK inhibitors and their combination with other agents in B-cell malignancies and other indications.","['Lucas, Fabienne', 'Woyach, Jennifer A']","['Lucas F', 'Woyach JA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, 455D Wiseman Hall, 410 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, 455D Wiseman Hall, 410 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. jennifer.woyach@osumc.edu.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. jennifer.woyach@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,,,2019/03/31 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/03/31 06:00'],"['2019/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11523-019-00635-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11523-019-00635-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Target Oncol. 2019 Apr;14(2):125-138. doi: 10.1007/s11523-019-00635-7.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4388-0349'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), and head and neck cancer (HNC) were evaluated for taste function. Chemical gustometry was conducted assessing chemosensory qualities that included sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami, and spicy. NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 and the Scale of Subjective Total Taste Acuity (STTA) were used to describe taste symptoms. Saliva flow rates were measured to determine the presence of hyposalivation. Patients were provided treatment trials for taste dysfunction, including zinc supplements, or medications that included clonazepam, megestrol acetate, and the cannabinoid dronabinol. RESULTS: According to STTA, hematology cases reported the incidence of grades 2 and 3 taste disturbances as 60% and 40%, respectively. For HNC patients, the incidence of grades 2 and 3 was 44% each. Gustometry tests confirmed dysgeusia in all patients evaluated. In the hematology group, 80% of patients exhibited a decrease in sweet taste perception, and no patients correctly identified umami taste. In the HNC group, most patients could not identify salt taste, 66% of patients reported ""no sensation"" with spicy taste, bitter taste was reduced in some, and increased or altered in others, while only one patient could identify umami taste. In the hematologic and HNC patient groups, 80% and 66% reported grade 2 dry mouth, respectively, according to CTCAE 4.0. After treatment for taste dysfunction, 71% of all patients in the present study reported improvements in taste function. CONCLUSIONS: Persisting dysgeusia in cancer survivors may be assessed by patient report and taste testing. The taste most affected in our patients was umami. Treatment trials with current interventions for dysgeusia appeared effective and should be considered in cancer survivors. Understanding taste and flavor function during and following cancer treatment is important in developing rational prospective preventive and interventional strategies.","['Epstein, Joel B', 'de Andrade E Silva, Safira Marques', 'Epstein, Geena L', 'Leal, Jorge Henrique Santos', 'Barasch, Andrei', 'Smutzer, Gregory']","['Epstein JB', 'de Andrade E Silva SM', 'Epstein GL', 'Leal JHS', 'Barasch A', 'Smutzer G']","[', Beverly Hills, CA, USA. jepstein@coh.org.', 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA. jepstein@coh.org.', 'City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA. jepstein@coh.org.', ', Beverly Hills, CA, USA.', 'Medical Dental at CLION - CAM Group, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', ', Beverly Hills, CA, USA.', 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'CLION - CAM Group, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19122, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190329,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Taste Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Taste Perception/physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Dysgeusia', 'Radiotherapy', 'Taste tasting']",,2019/03/31 06:00,2019/11/23 06:00,['2019/03/31 06:00'],"['2018/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-019-04758-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-019-04758-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Dec;27(12):4587-4595. doi: 10.1007/s00520-019-04758-5.

An epigenetic regulator, Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), is one of the most frequently mutated genes in all subtypes of myeloid malignancies. ASXL1 mutations are also frequently detected in clonal hematopoiesis, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important to understand how ASXL1 mutations contribute to clonal expansion and myeloid transformation in hematopoietic cells. Studies using ASXL1-depleted human hematopoietic cells and Asxl1 knockout mice have shown that deletion of wild-type ASXL1 protein leads to impaired hematopoiesis and accelerates myeloid malignancies via loss of interaction with polycomb repressive complex 2 proteins. On the other hand, ASXL1 mutations in myeloid neoplasms typically occur near the last exon and result in the expression of C-terminally truncated mutant ASXL1 protein. Biological studies and biochemical analyses of this variant have shed light on its dominant-negative and gain-of-function features in myeloid transformation via a variety of epigenetic changes. Based on these results, it would be possible to establish novel promising therapeutic strategies for myeloid malignancies harboring ASXL1 mutations by blocking interactions between ASXL1 and associating epigenetic regulators. Here, we summarize the clinical implications of ASXL1 mutations, the role of wild-type ASXL1 in normal hematopoiesis, and oncogenic functions of mutant ASXL1 in myeloid neoplasms.","['Asada, Shuhei', 'Fujino, Takeshi', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Asada S', 'Fujino T', 'Goyama S', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, and Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 1088639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, and Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 1088639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, and Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 1088639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, and Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 1088639, Japan. kitamura@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190330,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'ASXL1', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BAP1', 'CMML', 'HOX', 'MDS', 'MPN', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome']",,2019/03/31 06:00,2019/07/06 06:00,['2019/03/31 06:00'],"['2018/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00018-019-03084-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00018-019-03084-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2019 Jul;76(13):2511-2523. doi: 10.1007/s00018-019-03084-7.

We compared genomic features of 159 childhood and adult AEL cases with non-AEL myeloid disorders and defined five age-related subgroups with distinct transcriptional profiles: adult, TP53 mutated; NPM1 mutated; KMT2A mutated/rearranged; adult, DDX41 mutated; and pediatric, NUP98 rearranged. Genomic features influenced outcome, with NPM1 mutations and HOXB9 overexpression being associated with a favorable prognosis and TP53, FLT3 or RB1 alterations associated with poor survival. Targetable signaling mutations were present in 45% of cases and included recurrent mutations of ALK and NTRK1, the latter of which drives erythroid leukemogenesis sensitive to TRK inhibition. This genomic landscape of AEL provides the framework for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of this disease, and the rationale for testing targeted therapies in this high-risk

Here, we investigated cross-talk between the miR-221 network and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in doxorubicin-induced drug resistance of leukemia cells. Multifunctional gold nanoparticles were designed and synthesized to co-deliver three anticancer agents, AS1411, doxorubicin and anti-221, for improving leukemia treatment efficacy. These nanoparticles significantly inhibited the proliferation and clonogenic potential, and induced apoptosis of drug-resistant leukemia cells. The decreased growth of drug-resistant cells induced by these nanoparticles was associated with marked downregulation of miR-221 and DNMT1, leading to restored p27kip1 and p15ink4b tumor suppressor expression, as well as miR-221-mediated reduction of P-gp expression. Finally, primary blasts derived from leukemia patients experiencing chemoresistant relapse that were exposed to these nanoparticles were sensitized to doxorubicin, as evidenced by suppression of leukemic cell growth and a significant reduction of the doxorubicin IC50 value. Our findings provide proof of concept that this novel drug delivery system can precisely reverse the multidrug resistant leukemia phenotype based on preclinical models of leukemia, providing the framework for future clinical trials aimed at overcoming drug resistance and improving patient outcome.","['Deng, Rong', 'Ji, Bai', 'Yu, Hongliang', 'Bao, Wei', 'Yang, Zhuoqi', 'Yu, Ying', 'Cui, Yahan', 'Du, Yangyang', 'Song, Meiyu', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Meguellati, Kamel', 'Yan, Fei']","['Deng R', 'Ji B', 'Yu H', 'Bao W', 'Yang Z', 'Yu Y', 'Cui Y', 'Du Y', 'Song M', 'Liu S', 'Meguellati K', 'Yan F']","['State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, International Research Center for Chemistry-Medicine Joint Innovation, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry (NMAC), College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry (NMAC), College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, International Research Center for Chemistry-Medicine Joint Innovation, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry (NMAC), College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, International Research Center for Chemistry-Medicine Joint Innovation, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry (NMAC), College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, International Research Center for Chemistry-Medicine Joint Innovation, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, International Research Center for Chemistry-Medicine Joint Innovation, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, 801 16th Avenue NE, Austin, MN, 55912, USA.', 'International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry (NMAC), College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China. kameljilin@yahoo.fr.', 'State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, International Research Center for Chemistry-Medicine Joint Innovation, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China. feiyan@jlu.edu.cn.', 'International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry (NMAC), College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun, 130012, China. feiyan@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190329,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Gold', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', '*Metal Nanoparticles', 'MicroRNAs/administration & dosage/*genetics']",PMC6440980,,,,2019/03/31 06:00,2020/10/10 06:00,['2019/03/31 06:00'],"['2018/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-41866-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-41866-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 29;9(1):5348. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-41866-y.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4750-1200'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of the KDEL motif, an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, and generation of many positively charged amino acids (AAs) in the mutated C-terminus are thought to be important for disease induction. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice harboring a Calr frameshift mutation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Deletion of 19-base pairs in exon 9 (c.1099-1117del), designated the del19 mutation, induced loss of the KDEL motif and generated many positively charged AAs, similar to human mutants. Calr del19 mice exhibited mild thrombocytosis, slightly increased megakaryocytes, and mild splenomegaly. In vitro experiments revealed that the murine CALR del19 mutant had a weaker ability to combine with murine MPL than the human CALR del52 mutant. Consequently, STAT5 activation was also very weak downstream of the murine mutant and murine MPL, and may be the reason for the mild disease severity. In summary, loss of the KDEL motif and positively charged AAs in the C-terminus of CALR is insufficient for MPL binding and ET development.","['Shide, Kotaro', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Kamiunten, Ayako', 'Oji, Asami', 'Ozono, Yoshinori', 'Sekine, Masaaki', 'Honda, Arata', 'Kitanaka, Akira', 'Akizuki, Keiichi', 'Tahira, Yuki', 'Nakamura, Kenichi', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Abe, Hiroo', 'Miike, Tadashi', 'Iwakiri, Hisayoshi', 'Tahara, Yoshihiro', 'Sueta, Mitsue', 'Hasuike, Satoru', 'Yamamoto, Shojiro', 'Nagata, Kenji', 'Ikawa, Masahito', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Shide K', 'Kameda T', 'Kamiunten A', 'Oji A', 'Ozono Y', 'Sekine M', 'Honda A', 'Kitanaka A', 'Akizuki K', 'Tahira Y', 'Nakamura K', 'Hidaka T', 'Kubuki Y', 'Abe H', 'Miike T', 'Iwakiri H', 'Tahara Y', 'Sueta M', 'Hasuike S', 'Yamamoto S', 'Nagata K', 'Ikawa M', 'Shimoda K']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Experimental Genome Research, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'RIKEN BioResource Center, Ibaraki, Tsukuba, 305-0074, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Experimental Genome Research, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan. kshimoda@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190329,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Thrombocytosis/*etiology']",PMC6440999,,,,2019/03/31 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/03/31 06:00'],"['2018/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0202-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0202-z [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2019 Mar 29;9(4):42. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0202-z.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0046-3254', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9859-6217']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 123 patients with AML treated at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University were examined for mutations in DNMT3A, FLT3, and NPM1 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and allele-specific PCR to detect DNMT3A and NPM1A mutations. Two-way direct sequencing and Gene Mapper version 4.0 software (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) sequencing were used as confirmatory tests for DNMT3A and NPM1A mutations, respectively. RESULTS: DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, and NPM1A gene mutations were detected in 22 (17.9%), 22 (17.9%), and 24 (19.5%) patients, respectively. DNMT3A/FLT3, NPM1A/FLT3, and DNMT3A/NPM1A combined mutant genotypes were detected in 5 (4.1%), 9 (7.3%), and 3 (2.4%) patients, respectively. Two patients (1.6%) had triple mutant genotypes (DNMT3A/FLT3/NPM1A). FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations had a significant negative effect on complete response (CR) rates (P = .016). FLT3-ITD mutation was significantly associated with older age (P = .029), and lower overall survival (OS) rates (P = .046). DNMT3A/FLT3 combined mutant genotypes were significantly associated with a lower OS rate (P = .016). Mutant NPM1/wild type FLT3, wild type DNMT3A/FLT3, and mutant NPM1A/wild type DNMT3A combinations were significantly associated with higher CR rates (P = .006, P = .006, and P = .023, respectively). CONCLUSION: DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, and NPM1A are frequent mutations in Egyptian AML. FLT3-ITD mutations are frequent in older patients. DNMT3A and FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with an unfavorable prognosis, but the NPM1A mutation has tendency to indicate a good prognosis.","['El Gammal, Mosaad M', 'Ebid, Gamal T', 'Madney, Youssef M', 'Abo-Elazm, Omnia M', 'Kelany, Ayda K', 'Torra, Olga S', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['El Gammal MM', 'Ebid GT', 'Madney YM', 'Abo-Elazm OM', 'Kelany AK', 'Torra OS', 'Radich JP']","['Medical Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt.

In contrast with the current model, we have demonstrated that Id2(+)Zbtb16(+) ILCPs included multi-potent ILCPs that retained NK-cell potential. Late-stage ILC2P and ILC3P compartments could be defined by differential Zbtb16 and Bcl11b expression. We suggest a revised model for ILC differentiation that redefines the cell-fate potential of helper-ILC-restricted Zbtb16(+) ILCPs.","['Xu, Wei', 'Cherrier, Dylan E', 'Chea, Sylvestre', 'Vosshenrich, Christian', 'Serafini, Nicolas', 'Petit, Maxime', 'Liu, Pentao', 'Golub, Rachel', 'Di Santo, James P']","['Xu W', 'Cherrier DE', 'Chea S', 'Vosshenrich C', 'Serafini N', 'Petit M', 'Liu P', 'Golub R', 'Di Santo JP']","['Innate Immunity Unit, Institut Pasteur, Paris 75724, France; Inserm U1223, Institut Pasteur, Paris 75724, France; Department of Immunology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.

The extensive high-resolution genomic data generated to characterize AML have been instrumental in revealing the tremendous biological complexity of the disease, dictated in part by mutational, clonal, and epigenetic heterogeneity. This is further complicated by the antecedent nonleukemic state of clonal hematopoiesis that nevertheless is associated with an increased risk of developing a hematologic malignancy and with a greater risk of mortality from ischemic cardiovascular disease. Here in this review, we discuss developments in the field of AML biology and therapeutics, with a focus on advances in our understanding of how genetic and epigenetic determinants of AML have influenced prognostication and recent shifts in treatment paradigms, particularly within the context of precision oncology, for this highly complex group of hematologic malignancies.","['Cai, Sheng F', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Cai SF', 'Levine RL']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.

Estimated as relative risk, the graft-vs-leukemia effect of alloHSCT is associated with a hazard ratio of approximately 0.35 with endpoint relapse compared with autologous HSCT or postremission chemotherapy in comparative studies. Strikingly, that hazard ratio is similarly operational in favorable and adverse-risk AML. It suggests that only in case of excessive nonrelapse mortality (NRM) alloHSCT should be withheld as postremission treatment. Therefore, the application of alloHSCT in patients with AML in first CR should be personalized and based on both risks and benefits of alloHSCT, which are on the one hand the risk for NRM and on the other hand the risk of relapse. The risk of NRM can be estimated by a dedicated score for patients with AML in first CR, whereas the latest European LeukemiaNET risk classification may be applied for estimating the risk of relapse. In addition, the assessment of measurable residual disease further discriminates patients with a low vs high risk of relapse and may be incorporated in decision making.","['Versluis, Jurjen', 'Cornelissen, Jan J']","['Versluis J', 'Cornelissen JJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

While chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) have been successful in improving treatment outcomes for B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia by targeting CD19, the success of this strategy necessitates a cell surface antigen whose depletion can be clinically tolerated. The primary barrier currently preventing the use of CART therapy for AML is the lack of a myeloid equivalent to CD19-that is, an ""expendable"" antigen. All currently known cell surface targets on leukemic blasts are shared with healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells or their progeny. Hence, while targeting CD19-expressing cells leads to prolonged B-cell aplasia which is clinically benign, targeting myeloid antigens would lead to prolonged myeloablation which is not clinically tolerable. Creative solutions are being developed to try to circumvent these challenges, using not only CART but a range of adoptive cellular immunotherapy modalities and novel transplant-related approaches to try to extend the successes of CART therapy to patients with AML.","['Cummins, Katherine D', 'Gill, Saar']","['Cummins KD', 'Gill S']","['Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is an effective, and sometimes the only, curative postremission therapy for AML patients. Based on genetic risk classification, the published data have suggested that allo-SCT be recommended for high- and most intermediate-risk AML but not for low-risk AML in first complete remission (CR1). Recently, the role of allo-SCT in low-risk AML in CR1 is being established with the development of a risk-directed, minimal residual disease-based strategy. Though human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling transplantation remains the preferred therapeutic option for AML, modern approaches and developments pre-, peri- and post-transplant have facilitated other transplant modalities, especially haploidentical SCT, as promising valid alternative choices. In this paper, we review recent advances in allo-SCT for AML, weigh the benefits of allo-SCT for high-, intermediate-, and even low-risk AML in CR1, discuss the best choice of allo-SCT donor for the treatment of AML, and summarize new approaches for refractory and relapsed AML pre- or post-allo-SCT.","['Pei, Xuying', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Pei X', 'Huang X']","[""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.

The role of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) in the PRT setting is controversial and is largely based on older trials that were hampered by low transplant realization rates and relatively high nonrelapse mortality rates as compared to chemotherapy-based approaches. In this review we summarize current data regarding autoHCT in the PRT setting. Most current studies demonstrate that autoHCT is better than chemotherapy-based PRT in terms of leukemia free survival. In most recent studies, autoHCT results in comparable outcomes to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) from matched sibling or matched unrelated donors in patients with intermediate-risk AML in first complete remission and can be considered as a valid alternative. Adverse-risk AML patients do not benefit from autoHCT and should be referred to alloHCT. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a powerful prognostic factor and may identify patients that could benefit from an autoHCT PRT.

Indeed, mounting evidence supports the notion that HMAs are not ""just another kind of low-dose Ara-C."" Not only patient factors (age, performance status, comorbidities, etc.), blast counts, and early platelet response, but also adverse genetics (monosomal karyotype and/or a TP53 mutation) have predictive potential. Given the surprising-and initially counterintuitive-responses observed in patients with the latter features, these are subject to mechanistic studies to elucidate their as yet unresolved interaction with HMAs. Finally, other potential biomarkers for HMA response such as elevated fetal hemoglobin might also contribute to overcome the present challenges in predicting responsiveness to HMAs.","['Stomper, Julia', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Stomper J', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Research Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.

The 5-year survival of AML patients over age 65 years has remained 5% for decades. However, for the first time since the development of 7+3 induction chemotherapy in the 1970s, there is reason to believe that outcomes can and will improve. The understanding of the biology of AML has led to the development of targeted therapies that have shown great promise in this regard. Therapeutic interventions can lead to meaningful responses with improvement in hematopoietic function and much more acceptable toxicity profiles compared with intensive therapy. The therapeutic paradigms for older AML patients have shifted. Nevertheless, the diagnosis most often comes late in life, when patients are more likely to have impaired functional status and suffer from other comorbid illnesses. Therefore, the oncologist must be fully engaged with the patient, discussing goals of therapy and end-of-life issues, in a shared decision making process.","['LeBlanc, Thomas W', 'Erba, Harry P']","['LeBlanc TW', 'Erba HP']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC.

A number of approaches to maintenance therapy for AML have been studied with the goal of finding an agent with a tolerable side effect profile that may be given to patients in remission, typically for a prolonged period of time, in order to decrease the risk of relapse. Numerous trials that evaluated cytotoxic agents as maintenance therapy did not find any improvement in survival, but more recent studies of alternative approaches to maintenance including immunomodulation, epigenetic reprogramming, and targeted agents have been much more promising. In this article, we review the current evidence for various maintenance strategies for AML including immunotherapy, hypomethylating agents, and targeted therapies, particularly FLT3 inhibitors.

This dose-escalation study, guided by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations, evaluated whether simultaneous oral administration with the novel CDA inhibitor cedazuridine increases decitabine bioavailability for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Eligible patients were assigned to cohorts to receive escalating oral doses of decitabine and cedazuridine. The starting dose was decitabine 20 mg and cedazuridine 40 mg. Treatment cycles lasted 28 days, with 5 days of drug administration. In cycle 1, each patient received a cohort-defined dose of oral decitabine on day -3, a 1-h intravenous infusion of decitabine 20 mg/m(2) on day 1, and cohort-defined doses of oral decitabine plus cedazuridine on days 2-5. In cycles 2 and beyond, the oral decitabine and cedazuridine were given on days 1-5. The dose of cedazuridine was escalated first and decitabine was escalated once CDA inhibition by cedazuridine approached the maximum effect. The drug dose was escalated if mean decitabine area under the curve (AUC) of the oral drug was less than 90% of that for intravenous decitabine in the cohort and if no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a grade 3 or greater non-haematologic toxicity or grade 4 haematologic toxicity lasting more than 14 days and unrelated to the underlying disease. Once the decitabine AUC target range set as the primary endpoint, and established with intravenous decitabine, was reached at a dose deemed to be safe, the cohort that most closely approximated intravenous decitabine exposure was expanded to 18 evaluable patients. The primary objectives were to assess the safety of decitabine plus cedazuridine, and to determine the dose of each drug needed to achieve a mean AUC for decitabine exposure similar to that for intravenous decitabine exposure. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02103478. FINDINGS: Between Oct 28, 2014, and Nov 13, 2015, we enrolled 44 eligible patients (of 75 screened) with previously treated or newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia; 43 of the enrolled patients were evaluable. Participants were treated in five cohorts: cohorts 1-4 included six evaluable patients each; cohort 5 included 19 patients in a 13-patient expansion. Dose-dependent increases in decitabine AUC and peak plasma concentration occurred with each cohort dose escalation. There was no evident increase in toxicity compared with that reported for intravenous decitabine. Decitabine 30 mg and 40 mg plus cedazuridine 100 mg produced mean day-5 decitabine AUCs (146 ng x h/mL for decitabine 30 mg, and 221 ng x h/mL for decitabine 40 mg) closest to the mean intravenous-decitabine AUC (164 ng x h/mL). The most common grade 3 or more adverse events were thrombocytopenia (18 [41%] of 44 patients), neutropenia (13 [30%]), anaemia (11 [25%]), leukopenia (seven [16%]), febrile neutropenia (seven [16%]), and pneumonia (seven [16%]). Four (9%) patients died because of adverse events, none of which was considered drug related, and three (7%) patients died more than 30 days after discontinuing treatment because of progressive disease (two [5%]) and respiratory failure (one [2%]). INTERPRETATION: Oral decitabine plus cedazuridine emulated the pharmacokinetics of intravenous decitabine, with a similar safety profile and dose-dependent demethylation. Clinical responses were similar to intravenous decitabine treatment for 5 days. Further study of decitabine plus cedazuridine as an alternative to parenteral therapy or in combination with other new oral agents for myeloid disorders is warranted.

Developing effective computational models to identify potential relationships between lncRNAs and diseases can not only help us understand disease mechanisms at the lncRNA molecular level, but also promote the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of human diseases. For this paper, a network-based model called NBLDA was proposed to discover potential lncRNA(-)disease associations, in which two novel lncRNA(-)disease weighted networks were constructed. They were first based on known lncRNA(-)disease associations and topological similarity of the lncRNA(-)disease association network, and then an lncRNA(-)lncRNA weighted matrix and a disease(-)disease weighted matrix were obtained based on a resource allocation strategy of unequal allocation and unbiased consistence. Finally, a label propagation algorithm was applied to predict associated lncRNAs for the investigated diseases. Moreover, in order to estimate the prediction performance of NBLDA, the framework of leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was implemented on NBLDA, and simulation results showed that NBLDA can achieve reliable areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.8846, 0.8273, and 0.8075 in three known lncRNA(-)disease association datasets downloaded from the lncRNADisease database, respectively. Furthermore, in case studies of lung cancer, leukemia, and colorectal cancer, simulation results demonstrated that NBLDA can be a powerful tool for identifying potential lncRNA(-)disease associations as well.","['Liu, Yang', 'Feng, Xiang', 'Zhao, Haochen', 'Xuan, Zhanwei', 'Wang, Lei']","['Liu Y', 'Feng X', 'Zhao H', 'Xuan Z', 'Wang L']","['College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha 410000, China. y1006480772@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan 411100, China. y1006480772@163.com.', 'College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha 410000, China. fengxiang@xtu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan 411100, China. fengxiang@xtu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan 411100, China. zhaohc940702@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan 411100, China. zhanwei_xuan@163.com.', 'College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha 410000, China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan 411100, China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190328,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",,"['Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Computer Simulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",PMC6480945,['NOTNLM'],"['association prediction', 'disease', 'label propagation', 'lncRNA', 'resource allocation']",,2019/03/31 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2019/03/31 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20071549 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20071549 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Mar 28;20(7). pii: ijms20071549. doi: 10.3390/ijms20071549.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8794-3148', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5065-8447']",,,"['No.61873221, No. 61672447, No.61472282/National Natural Science Foundation of', 'China', 'No.2018JJ4058, No.2017JJ5036/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province', 'No. NGII20160305, No. NGII20170109/CERNET Next Generation Internet Technology', 'Innovation Project']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, by means of computer-aided drug design, we discovered a novel chemical series of GSK-3alpha inhibitors with an IC50 value of 0.033-2.804muM. The preliminary structure-activity relationship was concluded and, notably, the most potent and isoform-selective compound G28_14 was identified with IC50 values of 33nM and 218nM against GSK-3alpha and -3beta, respectively, exhibiting a nearly ten-fold isoform-selectivity. Further cell viability assays and colony formation assays revealed that G28_14 suppressed cell survival by impairing cell proliferation by up to 90% in two AML cell lines. Moreover, surface marker expression analysis demonstrated that G28_14 induced terminal differentiation with a high level of CD11b, CD11c, and CD14. Western immunoblotting showed that G28_14 isoform-selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of GSK-3alpha in-cell without activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In addition, to elucidate its structure-activity relationship, the binding mode of this chemical series was proposed using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, this chemical series is worth developing as differentiation therapies for the treatment of AML.","['Wang, Yanxing', 'Dou, Xiaodong', 'Jiang, Lan', 'Jin, Hongwei', 'Zhang, Lihe', 'Zhang, Liangren', 'Liu, Zhenming']","['Wang Y', 'Dou X', 'Jiang L', 'Jin H', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang L', 'Liu Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, PR China.

We assessed the effect of taxifolin on the activation of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells induced by immunoglobulin E (IgE)/antigen (Ag), and the activation of human mast cell line (HMC-1) induced by PMA plus A23187. Taxifolin inhibited degranulation, generation of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), production of interlukin-6 (IL-6), and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) through blocking intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), and Akt/IKK/NF-kappaB pathway, in BMMC cells. Furthermore, taxifolin suppressed phosphorylation of Syk, but without effect on Fyn and Lyn. Taxifolin also inhibited activation of RBL-2H3 and HMC-1 cells via Akt/IKK/NF-kappaB and MAPKs/cPLA2 signal pathway. Treatment with taxifolin attenuated the mast cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction.

Identifying new prognostic biomarkers is necessary to help select the best therapeutic schedules and to improve prognosis. We performed bioinformatics analyses of transcriptomic data to identify aberrantly-expressed mRNA transcripts in B-ALL and focused on RASD1 (Ras-related dexamethasone-induced 1). To date, no information is available on the prognostic value of RASD1 in B-ALL. Fifty-three consecutive adults with de novo B-ALL were enrolled in this study. Our data suggested that RASD1 was abnormally overexpressed in B-ALL. High RASD1 transcript levels at diagnosis were associated with lower survival probabilities (44% [20%-61%] vs. 79% [60%-97%]; P = 0.037) and were also an independent prognostic factor in adult B-ALL (HR = 4.9 [1.5-15.9]; P = 0.008). Functional in vitro analyses and bioinformatic analyses indicated that RASD1 promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and chemotherapy resistance and inhibited cell apoptosis. These data demonstrated that RASD1 might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for adult B-ALL and as a potential therapeutic target in adult B-ALL patients.","['Wang, Shujuan', 'Wang, Chong', 'Wang, Weiqiong', 'Hao, Qianqian', 'Liu, Yanfang']","['Wang S', 'Wang C', 'Wang W', 'Hao Q', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.

It is highly expressed in many cancers including breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, melanoma, leukemia, and neuroblastoma, suggesting it promotes cancer cell survival. TRPM2 is activated by production of ADP-ribose (ADPR) following oxidative stress, which binds to the C-terminus of TRPM2, resulting in channel opening. In a number of cancers including neuroblastoma, TRPM2 has been shown to preserve viability and mechanisms have been identified. Activation of TRPM2 results in expression of transcription factors and kinases important in cell proliferation and survival including HIF-1/2alpha, CREB, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor-2 (Nrf2), and Pyk2, and Src phosphorylation. Together, HIF-1/2alpha and CREB regulate expression of genes encoding proteins with roles in mitochondrial function including members of the electron transport complex involved in ATP production. These contribute to lower mitochondrial ROS production while expression of antioxidants regulated by HIF-1/2alpha, FOXO3a, CREB, and Nrf2 is maintained. CREB is also important in control of expression of key proteins involved in autophagy. When TRPM2-mediated calcium influx is inhibited, mitochondria are dysfunctional, cellular bioenergetics are reduced, production of ROS is increased, and autophagy and DNA repair are impaired, decreasing tumor growth and increasing chemotherapy sensitivity. Inhibition of TRPM2 expression or function results in decreased tumor proliferation and/or viability in many malignancies including breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, head and neck cancers, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and T-cell and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, in a small number of malignancies, activation of TRPM2 rather than inhibition has been reported to reduce tumor cell survival. Here, TRPM2-mediated Ca(2+) signaling and mechanisms of regulation of cancer cell growth and survival are reviewed and controversies discussed.

The focus was on potential etiologic relations between environmental chemical exposures and cancer risks. We searched the epidemiologic literature on environmental chemicals classified as carcinogens in which cancer risks were described in relation to ""peak"" exposures. These articles were evaluated to identify some of the challenges associated with defining and describing cancer risks in relation to peak exposures. We found that definitions of peak exposure varied considerably across studies. Of nine chemical agents included in our review of peak exposure, six had epidemiologic data used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in dose-response assessments to derive inhalation unit risk values. These were benzene, formaldehyde, styrene, trichloroethylene, acrylonitrile, and ethylene oxide. All derived unit risks relied on cumulative exposure for dose-response estimation and none, to our knowledge, considered peak exposure metrics. This is not surprising, given the historical linear no-threshold default model (generally based on cumulative exposure) used in regulatory risk assessments. With newly proposed US EPA rule language, fuller consideration of alternative exposure and dose-response metrics will be supported. ""Peak"" exposure has not been consistently defined and rarely has been evaluated in epidemiologic studies of cancer risks. We recommend developing uniform definitions of ""peak"" exposure to facilitate fuller evaluation of dose response for environmental chemicals and cancer risks, especially where mechanistic understanding indicates that the dose response is unlikely linear and that short-term high-intensity exposures increase risk.","['Checkoway, Harvey', 'Lees, Peter S J', 'Dell, Linda D', 'Gentry, P Robinan', 'Mundt, Kenneth A']","['Checkoway H', 'Lees PSJ', 'Dell LD', 'Gentry PR', 'Mundt KA']","['Department of Family Medicine & Public Health, San Diego School of Medicine, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Ramboll, Amherst, MA (LDD) and Monroe, LA, USA.', 'Ramboll, Amherst, MA (LDD) and Monroe, LA, USA.', 'Cardno Chemrisk, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190329,United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '290YE8AR51 (Trichloroethylene)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', '588X2YUY0A (Methylene Chloride)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)', 'MP1U0D42PE (Acrylonitrile)']",IM,"['Acrylonitrile', 'Air Pollutants/analysis', 'Benzene', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethylene Oxide', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Methylene Chloride', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Styrene', 'Trichloroethylene', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency']",PMC6850123,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer epidemiology', '*peak exposure', '*risk assessment']",,2019/03/30 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2019/03/30 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/risa.13294 [doi]'],ppublish,Risk Anal. 2019 Jul;39(7):1441-1464. doi: 10.1111/risa.13294.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-one patients aged over 65 years diagnosed with lymphoma and treated in Bezmialem Vakif University Medical Faculty Hospital and Haseki Training and Research Hospital between 2008 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. Finally, 63 patients for whom data could be reached were included in the study. RESULTS: Examining the results, histological diagnoses of our patients were as follows: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (50.8%), follicular lymphoma (23.8%), marginal zone lymphoma (12.7%), mantle cell lymphoma (4.8%), T-cell lymphoma (4.8%), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (1.6%) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (1.6%). Stages at the time of diagnosis were early stage by 33.3% and late stage by 66.7%. Of the patients, 36.5% had a low-intermediate and 63.5% a high-intermediate International Prognostic Index score. According to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring, 34.9% of the patients have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 2-4. Activities of daily living score of 33.3% patients was under 5. Looking at the responses to treatment, the complete response was found in 50.8%, partial response in 4.8%, stable disease in 1.6% and progressive disease in 9.5% of the patients. The mean follow-up duration of patients was found as 25.2 months and disease-free survival after remission as 20.2 months. CONCLUSION: We found that we have achieved a complete remission in more than half of our patients (50.8%). Based on this, treatment should aim remission in elderly patients.","['Cetin, Guven', 'Ece Dogan, Elif', 'Samanci, Nilay Sengul', 'Ayer, Mesut', 'Ozkan, Tuba', 'Ekinci, Iskender', 'Bag, Rabia', 'Turgut, Seda', 'Uysal, Omer']","['Cetin G', 'Ece Dogan E', 'Samanci NS', 'Ayer M', 'Ozkan T', 'Ekinci I', 'Bag R', 'Turgut S', 'Uysal O']","['Department of Hematology, Bezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Bayrampasa Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Haseki Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yahyali Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kanuni Training and Research Hospital Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Bezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Bezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190329,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,IM,"['*Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Geriatric population', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'retrospective', 'two-center experience']",,2019/03/30 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/03/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219839460 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Jan;26(1):99-104. doi: 10.1177/1078155219839460.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a service redesign on resident perceptions of (a) the educational value of the rotation and (b) the safety of patient care. As a secondary objective, we evaluated the impact on the time of day of patient discharge. PROCEDURE: A bundled intervention on the IHM service was instituted, including decreased patient volumes, intentional patient assignment, intentional faculty selection, and increased weekend staffing. We distributed an annual survey to end-of-the-year junior residents. We compared responses from residents who experienced the redesign (2017) with residents whose experience predated the redesign (2016). We compared the time of day of patient discharge before and after the redesign. RESULTS: Survey completion rates were 70% (28/40) in 2016 and 57% (29/51) in 2017. Redesign residents rated their educational experience and perceived ability to care for patients on the nights and weekends significantly higher than previous residents. Redesign residents reported that their clinical education was compromised by excessive service less frequently than previous residents (24% vs 82%, P < 0.001). The time of day of patient discharge after the redesign was 35 minutes earlier than before the redesign (4:06 pm vs 4:41 pm, P = 0.01, 95% CI = -63, -6). CONCLUSIONS: A redesign initiative of an oncology service led to improved resident perceptions of the educational value of the rotation and ability to provide safe care to patients, along with earlier discharge times.","['Winn, Ariel S', 'Gross, Caroline J', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Kesselheim, Jennifer C']","['Winn AS', 'Gross CJ', 'Silverman LB', 'Kesselheim JC']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of General Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20190329,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Internship and Residency', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*education', 'Pediatrics/*education']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*leukemia', '*oncology', '*trainee education']",,2019/03/30 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/30 06:00'],"['2019/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27738 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jul;66(7):e27738. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27738.

A total of 680 blood or bone marrow samples underwent targeted sequencing of 29 genes previously identified as being mutated in CLL, which were correlated to known prognostic clinical characteristics. Overall, 400 (59%) patients were treatment-naive (TN) and 280 (41%) were relapsed/refractory (R/R). Most patients (70%) had >/=1 mutation, with TP53 (22%), SF3B1 (18%), NOTCH1 (13%) and ATM (13%) being the most commonly mutated genes. A higher proportion of R/R patients had mutations in SF3B1 (P = 0.01) and TP53 (P < 0.001). Patients with mutated IGHV CLL more often had mutations in KLHL6 (P = 0.001) and MYD88 (P < 0.001). Pairwise associations showed mutational co-occurrences in the TN group including SF3B1/ATM [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05] and NOTCH1/POT1 (FDR < 0.01). Recurrent mutations resulting in premature truncation prior to the ubiquitination domains of NOTCH1 in its PEST domain and BIRC3 in its RING domain can produce proteins that constitutively activate CLL. Frequent missense mutations, such as K700E in SF3B1 and E571K in XPO1, have unknown function but are most likely to be activating mutations. Future directions include using these mutations to identify pathways for therapeutic targeting and rational drug design.","['Hu, Boyu', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Chen, Hsiang-Chun', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Wang, Feng', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Medeiros, Leonard J', 'Yin, Cheng C', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Ok, Chi Y', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Tambaro, Francesco P', 'Thompson, Philip', 'Burger, Jan', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G']","['Hu B', 'Patel KP', 'Chen HC', 'Wang X', 'Wang F', 'Luthra R', 'Routbort MJ', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Yin CC', 'Zuo Z', 'Ok CY', 'Loghavi S', 'Tang G', 'Tambaro FP', 'Thompson P', 'Burger J', 'Jain N', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Bose P', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG']","['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute/University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'S.S.D.

Here we show that this lysine is massively hyperacetylated in peripheral neutrophils. Genome-wide mapping of H4K16ac in terminally differentiated blood cells, along with functional experiments, supported a role for this histone post-translational modification in the regulation of cell differentiation and apoptosis in the hematopoietic system. Furthermore, in neutrophils, H4K16ac was enriched at specific DNA repeats. These DNA regions presented an accessible chromatin conformation and were associated with the cleavage sites that generate the 50 kb DNA fragments during the first stages of programmed cell death. Our results thus suggest that H4K16ac plays a dual role in myeloid cells as it not only regulates differentiation and apoptosis, but it also exhibits a non-canonical structural role in poising chromatin for cleavage at an early stage of neutrophil cell death.","['Urdinguio, Rocio G', 'Lopez, Virginia', 'Bayon, Gustavo F', 'Diaz de la Guardia, Rafael', 'Sierra, Marta I', 'Garcia-Torano,

In general, the prognosis of AML remains poor despite new discoveries in its pathogenesis and treatment. It is crucial to find early and sensitive biomarkers and continue to explore active targeted treatments. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) family is an important part of the interferon signaling pathway and participate in the regulation of immune cell signaling, adhesion, cancer, and liver cell migration. However, the clinical and prognostic value of the IFITM family in AML has rarely been studied. We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas database and found 155 AML patients with IFITM family (IFITM1-5) expression data. In patients who only received chemotherapy, those with high IFITM3 expression had significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low expression (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high IFITM3 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS in patients only received chemotherapy (all P < 0.05). In patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), however, all IFITM members had no impact on either EFS or OS. In conclusion, our study elucidated that high IFITM3 expression could be an adverse prognostic factor for AML, whose effect might be overcome by allo-HSCT.","['Liu, Yan', 'Lu, Rongjian', 'Cui, Wei', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Liu, Chaojun', 'Cui, Longzhen', 'Qian, Tingting', 'Quan, Liang', 'Dai, Yifeng', 'Jiao, Yang', 'Pan, Yue', 'Ye, Xu', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Fu, Lin']","['Liu Y', 'Lu R', 'Cui W', 'Pang Y', 'Liu C', 'Cui L', 'Qian T', 'Quan L', 'Dai Y', 'Jiao Y', 'Pan Y', 'Ye X', 'Shi J', 'Cheng Z', 'Fu L']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Stomatology, The Fifth Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of the PLA), Beijing, 100071, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Haidian Hospital, Beijing Haidian Section of Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100080, China.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, 48073, USA.', 'Zhongyuan Union Clinical Laborotory Co., Ltd, Tianjin, 300304, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Immunoendocrinology, Division of Medical Biology, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Life Sciences Institute and Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Beijing Haidian Hospital, Beijing Haidian Section of Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China. fulin022@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190329,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IFITM3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/03/30 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2019/03/30 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-019-0093-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-019-0093-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2020 Feb;27(1-2):38-44. doi: 10.1038/s41417-019-0093-y.

We performed the first comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analysis of MDS with dic(1;7)(q10;p10) compared to normal controls and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs). RNA-seq showed a unique downregulated signature in dic(1;7) cases, affecting more than 80% of differentially expressed genes. As revealed by pathway and gene ontology analyses, downregulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and lipid-related genes and upregulation of p53 signaling were the most relevant biological features of dic(1;7). Epigenetic supervised analysis revealed hypermethylation at intronic enhancers in the dicentric subgroup, in which low expression levels of enhancer putative target genes accounted for around 35% of the downregulated signature. Enrichment of Kruppel-like transcription factor binding sites emerged at enhancers. Furthermore, a specific hypermethylated pattern on 1q was found to underlie the hypo-expression of more than 50% of 1q-deregulated genes, despite trisomy.

Although clinicians often perceive intensive chemotherapy as more burdensome, research is lacking on patients' quality of life (QOL) and psychological distress. We conducted a longitudinal study of older patients (>/=60 years) newly diagnosed with AML receiving intensive (cytarabine/anthracycline combination) or non-intensive (hypomethylating agents) chemotherapy. We assessed patients' QOL [Functional-Assessment-of-Cancer-Therapy-Leukemia] and psychological distress [Hospital-Anxiety-and-Depression-Scale] at baseline and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after diagnosis. We enrolled 75.2% (100/133) of eligible patients within 72-hours of initiating intensive (n = 50) or non-intensive (n = 50) chemotherapy. Patient QOL improved over time (beta = 0.32, P = 0.013). At baseline, 33.3% (33/100) and 30.0% (30/100) of patients reported clinically significant depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively, with no differences between groups. Patients' depression symptoms did not change over time, while their anxiety symptoms decreased over time (beta = -0.08, P < 0.001). Patient-reported QOL, depression and anxiety symptoms did not differ significantly at any time point between those who received intensive versus non-intensive chemotherapy. Older patients with AML experience improvements in their QOL and anxiety while undergoing treatment. Patients receiving intensive and non-intensive chemotherapy have similar QOL and mood trajectories.","['El-Jawahri, Areej', 'Abel, Gregory A', 'Traeger, Lara', 'Waldman, Lauren', 'Markovitz, Netana', 'VanDusen, Harry', 'Fathi, Amir', 'Steensma, David P', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W', 'Horick, Nora K', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Hobbs, Gabriela', 'Foster, Julia', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Amrein, Philip', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Temel, Jennifer S', 'Greer, Joseph A']","['El-Jawahri A', 'Abel GA', 'Traeger L', 'Waldman L', 'Markovitz N', 'VanDusen H', 'Fathi A', 'Steensma DP', 'LeBlanc TW', 'Horick NK', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Wadleigh M', 'Hobbs G', 'Foster J', 'Brunner AM', 'Amrein P', 'Stone RM', 'Temel JS', 'Greer JA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. ael-jawahri@partners.org.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. ael-jawahri@partners.org.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190328,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Affect/*physiology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Anxiety/physiopathology', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Depression/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life']",,,,,2019/03/30 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/03/30 06:00'],"['2018/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0449-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0449-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Oct;33(10):2393-2402. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0449-1.

FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are promising for targeted therapy. Here, we investigated mechanisms dampening the response to the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib, which is specific to the hematopoietic niche. Using AML primary samples and cell lines, we demonstrate that convergent signals from the hematopoietic microenvironment drive FLT3-ITD cell resistance to quizartinib through the expression and activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor AXL. Indeed, cytokines sustained phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT5 in quizartinib-treated cells, which enhanced AXL expression by direct binding of a conserved motif in its genomic sequence. Likewise, hypoxia, another well-known hematopoietic niche hallmark, also enhanced AXL expression. Finally, in a xenograft mouse model, inhibition of AXL significantly increased the response of FLT3-ITD cells to quizartinib exclusively within a bone marrow environment. These data highlight a new bypass mechanism specific to the hematopoietic niche that hampers the response to quizartinib through combined upregulation of AXL activity. Targeting this signaling offers the prospect of a new therapy to eradicate resistant FLT3-ITD leukemic cells hidden within their specific microenvironment, thereby preventing relapses from FLT3-ITD clones.","['Dumas, Pierre-Yves', 'Naudin, Cecile', 'Martin-Lanneree, Severine', 'Izac, Brigitte', 'Casetti, Luana', 'Mansier, Olivier', 'Rousseau, Benoit', 'Artus, Alexandre', 'Dufossee, Melody',

In order to determine more accurately the frequency of monitoring required, we performed a 'real-life' retrospective single-center cohort study of 450 patients with CML in at least major molecular remission (MR3) to analyze the risk of loss of MR3 [defined as at least 2 consecutive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results >0.1% International Scale (IS)]. Patients who achieved sustained MR4 (sMR4, BCR-ABL1 RT-qPCR <0.01% IS for 12 months) had a probability of loss of MR3 at 1 and 5 years of 0 and 2.6% (95%CI: 1.2-5.4) respectively, compared to 4.4% (95%CI: 1.9-9.8) and 25.4% (95%CI: 16.7-36.7) respectively, in those who achieved sustained MR3 (sMR3) but not sMR4 (P<0.001). No patient who improved their response to a deep molecular level (at least MR4) lost MR3 if they were considered compliant, had no history of resistance and remained on standard dose tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). MR4 maintained for at least one year represents a secure response threshold for patients with CML, after which no MR3 loss occurs if certain conditions are satisfied (standard TKI dose, full compliance, and lack of previous TKI resistance). This finding may justify reduction of the frequency of hospital interaction, with an associated positive impact on quality of life, survivorship, and economic burden to both patients and healthcare providers.","['Claudiani, Simone', 'Gatenby, Aoife', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Nesr, George', 'Abulafia, Adi Shacham', 'Palanicawandar, Renuka', 'Nteliopoulos, Georgios', 'Khorashad, Jamshid', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Milojkovic, Dragana']","['Claudiani S', 'Gatenby A', 'Szydlo R', 'Nesr G', 'Abulafia AS', 'Palanicawandar R', 'Nteliopoulos G', 'Khorashad J', 'Foroni L', 'Apperley JF', 'Milojkovic D']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK simone.claudiani@nhs.net.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah-Tiqva, Israel.', 'Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190328,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",PMC6821602,,,,2019/03/30 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/03/30 06:00'],"['2018/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.214809 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.214809 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Nov;104(11):2206-2214. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.214809.

Patients underwent PET-CT at screening and were not enrolled/treated if Richter's transformation was confirmed pathologically. Of 167 patients screened, 57 met criteria for biopsy after PET-CT. Of 35 patients who underwent biopsy, eight had Richter's transformation, two had another malignancy, and 25 had CLL. A PET-CT maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) >/=10 had 71% sensitivity and 50% specificity for detecting Richter's transformation [Odds Ratio (OR): 2.5, 95%CI: 0.4-15; P=0.318]. Response rate to venetoclax was similar for screening SUVmax <10 versus >/=10 (65% vs. 62%) (n=127 enrolled), though median progression-free survival was longer at <10 months (24.7 vs. 15.4 months; P=0.0335). Six patients developed Richter's transformation on venetoclax, of whom two had screening biopsy demonstrating CLL (others did not have a biopsy) and five had screening SUVmax <10. We have defined the test characteristics for PET-CT to distinguish progression of CLL as compared to Richter's transformation when biopsied in patients treated with B-cell receptor signaling pathway inhibitors. Overall diminished sensitivity and specificity as compared to prior reports of patients treated with chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy suggest it has diminished ability to discriminate these two diagnoses using a SUVmax >/=10 cutoff. This cutoff did not identify venetoclax-treated patients with an inferior response but may be predictive of inferior progression-free survival.

Consistent with this finding, there was a significant association between the presence of these mutations and the expression of GLI1 (chi(2) test, P < .0001), reflecting activation of the Hh pathway. However, we discovered that 38% of cases without identified mutations also were GLI1(+) Patients with GLI1(+) CLL cells had a shorter median treatment-free survival than patients with CLL cells lacking expression of GLI1 independent of IGHV mutation status. We found that GANT61, a small molecule that can inhibit GLI1, was highly cytotoxic for GLI1(+) CLL cells relative to that of CLL cells without GLI1. Collectively, this study shows that a large proportion of patients have CLL cells with activated Hh signaling, which is associated with early disease progression and enhanced sensitivity to inhibition of GLI1.","['Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Blanco, Alejandro', 'Yousif, Fouad', 'Smith, Erin N', 'McPherson, John D', 'Hudson, Thomas J', 'Harismendy, Olivier', 'Frazer, Kelly A', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Ghia EM', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Neuberg DS', 'Blanco A', 'Yousif F', 'Smith EN', 'McPherson JD', 'Hudson TJ', 'Harismendy O', 'Frazer KA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Programa de Genetica Humana, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics and Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA; and.', 'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', ""Department of Pediatrics and Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA."", 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190328,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GANT 61)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/*metabolism']",PMC6587306,,,,2019/03/30 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/03/30 06:00'],"['2018/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42471-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-09-873695 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Jun 20;133(25):2651-2663. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-09-873695.

The diagnosis of de novo MS can be challenging, particularly in patients with no prior history of hematologic malignancies or when MS involves unusual anatomic sites. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 53-year-old woman with a history of uterine fibroids and vaginal bleeding for many years who presented with a vaginal wall mass. The tumor had histologic and phenotypic features of histiocytic sarcoma, however, overlapping with a possible extramedullary MS. Using a comprehensive genomic profiling, we were able to identify recurrent chromosomal aberrations associated with MS including a rare KMT2A-ELL fusion, losses of chromosomes 1p, 9, 10, 15, 18, and gain of chromosome 1q and mutations in FLT3 and PTPN11, and achived the final diagnosis of a de novo MS. The patient received standard treatment for acute myeloid leukemia regimen with stem cell transplantation and achieved complete remission. CONCLUSION: Our case illustrates the clinical utility of comprehensive genomic profiling in assisting the diagnosis or differential diagnosis of challenging MS or histiocytic sarcoma cases, and in providing important information in tumor biology for appropriate clinical management.","['Bao, Haiyan', 'Gao, Juehua', 'Chen, Yi-Hua', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Wilson, Amanda L', 'Sukhanova, Madina', 'Chen, Qing', 'Lu, Xinyan']","['Bao H', 'Gao J', 'Chen YH', 'Altman JK', 'Frankfurt O', 'Wilson AL', 'Sukhanova M', 'Chen Q', 'Lu X']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 East Chicago Avenue, ward 3-140, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The first affiliated hospital of Soochow Univervisty, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 East Chicago Avenue, ward 3-140, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 East Chicago Avenue, ward 3-140, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Aurora Medical Center, Pathology, Kenosha, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 East Chicago Avenue, ward 3-140, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 East Chicago Avenue, ward 3-140, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 East Chicago Avenue, ward 3-140, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.

Whether polymorphisms of SETD2 affect prognosis and chemotherapy response of AML remains elusive. METHODS: Three tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) of SETD2 were genotyped in 579 AML patients by using Sequenom Massarray system. Association of the SNPs with complete remission (CR) rate after Ara-C based induction therapy, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were analyzed. RESULT: Survival analysis indicated that SETD2 rs76208147 TT genotype was significantly associated with poor prognosis of AML (TT vs. CC + CT hazard ratio: HR = 1.838, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.005-3.360, p = 0.048). After adjusting for the known prognostic factors including risk stratification, age, allo-SCT, WBC count and LDH count, rs76208147 TT genotype was still associated with OS in the multivariate analysis (TT vs. CC + CT HR = 1.923, 95% CI 1.007-3.675, p = 0.048). In addition, after adjusting by other clinical features, patients with rs4082155 allele G carries showed higher rate of complete remission which indicated by CR rate (AG + GG vs. AA odd ratio (OR) = 0.544, 95% CI 0.338-0.876, p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: SETD2 genetic polymorphism is associated with AML prognosis and chemotherapy outcome, suggesting the possibility for development in AML diagnostics and therapeutics towards SETD2.","['Wang, Suwei', 'Yuan, Xiaoqing', 'Liu, Yazhen', 'Zhu, Kewei', 'Chen, Peng', 'Yan, Han', 'Zhang, Daoyu', 'Li, Xi', 'Zeng, Hui', 'Zhao, Xielan', 'Chen, Xiaoping', 'Zhou, Gan', 'Cao,

However, the prognostic value of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) that are repressed early in LSC remains largely unknown. METHODS: We compared the public available expression/methylation profiling data of LSCs with that of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), in order to identify potential tumor suppressor genes in LSC. The prognostic relevance of PCDH17 was analyzed on a cohort of 173 AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and further validated in three independent cohorts (n = 339). RESULTS: We identified protocadherin17 (PCDH17) and demonstrated that it was significantly down-regulated and hypermethylated in LSCs compared with HSCs. Our analyses of primary AML patient samples also confirmed these deregulations. Clinically, low PCDH17 expression was associated with female sex (P = 0.01), higher WBC (P < 0.0001), higher percentages of blasts in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) (P = 0.04 and < 0.001, respectively), presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplications (P = 0.002), mutated NPM1 (P = 0.02), and wild-type TP53 (P = 0.005). Moreover, low PCDH17 expression predicted worse overall survival (OS) in four independent cohorts as well as in the molecularly defined subgroups of AML patients. In multivariable analyses, low PCDH17 expression retained independent prognostic value for OS. Biologically, PCDH17 expression-associated gene signatures were characterized by deregulations of EMT- and Wnt pathway-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: PCDH17 gene was silenced by DNA methylation in AML. Low PCDH17 expression is associated with distinct clinical and biological features and improves risk stratification in patients with AML.","['Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Wen,

This study aimed to investigate the utilization of palliative care (PC) in patients undergoing HSCT during hospitalization. METHODS: The 2008-2014 National Inpatient Sample was queried for eligible participants. Demographics, hospital characteristics, comorbidities, posttransplantation complications, and inpatient procedures were compared between patients with and without PC. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors associated with PC use. RESULTS: Among 21 458 patients undergoing HSCT during hospitalization, 278 (1.30%) received PC. The rate of PC use has significantly increased from 0.64% in 2008 to 1.95% in 2014. Patients receiving PC had more co-comorbidities, posttransplantation complications, inpatient procedures, and were more likely to carry a diagnosis of leukemia. In allogeneic HSCT, large bed size (odds ratio [OR] =2.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-6.70), stem cell source from cord blood (OR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.15-3.24), and graft-versus-host disease (OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.36-3.06) were predictors of PC use. In a subset analysis of 783 patients who died during hospitalization, 166 (21.20%) received PC. Among the decedents, Hispanic race had lower odds of PC use (OR = 0.20; 95% CI: 0.05-0.82) in allogeneic HSCT and women had higher odds of PC (OR = 2.70; 95% CI: 1.35-5.41) in autologous HSCT.

Their antiproliferative activities were tested against SGC-7901, Bel-7402, HL-60, PC-3, A549 and K562 cancer cell lines and L-02 normal liver cells. The results showed that compound 19 possessed the most potent cytotoxicity with IC50s at sub-micromolar level against human hepatoma Bel-7402 and chronic myelogenous leukemia K562cells and more potent than l-alanine-(14-oridonin) ester (23). More importantly, 19 displayed 70-fold less cytotoxicity than parent 3 (IC50=25.47muM) against L-02cells, which exhibited certain selectivity. Further mechanism study in Bel-7402cells revealed that 19 could induce apoptosis, G1 phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial dysfunction. Western blot results of caspase-3, Bax and cytochrome c upregulation and pro-caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL downregulation confirmed the intrinsic pathways. Overall, these data collectively demonstrated the high efficiency and selectivity of 19, l-phenylalanine-enmein-type diterpenoid ester, which inspires further and effective application as a potential antitumor candidate.","['Hu, Xu', 'Bai, Ziyi', 'Qiao, Jian', 'Li, Haonan', 'Xu, Shengtao', 'Wang, Xianhua', 'Xu, Yongnan', 'Xu, Jinyi', 'Hua, Huiming', 'Li, Dahong']","['Hu X', 'Bai Z', 'Qiao J', 'Li H', 'Xu S', 'Wang X', 'Xu Y', 'Xu J', 'Hua H', 'Li D']","['Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China; School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China; School of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China; School of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China; School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tong Jia Xiang, Nanjing, 210009, PR China.', 'School of Public Health, Qingdao University, 38 Dengzhou Road, Qingdao, 266021, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China; School of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature aiming to identify observational studies and randomized trials describing treatment of VTE in the setting of AL including, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Due to the heterogeneity of findings, no meta-analysis was attempted. RESULTS: A total of 13 observational studies (11 cohorts and 2 case-control) totaling 5359 participants were included. The number of patients with VTE among the total population was 304 (5.7%; 95% CI 5.1-6.3). In patients with VTE, 221 patients received treatment with anticoagulation using either of low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, and/or vitamin K antagonists. Most studies adjusted the anticoagulant dose based on platelet count. The reported recurrence rate ranged from 0 to 29% among different studies and varied according to the duration of anticoagulant treatment and follow up. Bleeding events were not uniformly reported but the total number was low among anti-coagulated patients. CONCLUSION: There is a significant lack of data in this area with a high degree of heterogeneity in the choice of anticoagulant, dose adjustments for thrombocytopenia, and duration of anticoagulation. Further studies are required to develop guidelines and suggestions for treatment of VTE in AL.","['Ahrari, Azin', 'Al-Ani, Fatimah', 'Wang, Yimin Pearl', 'Lazo-Langner, Alejandro']","['Ahrari A', 'Al-Ani F', 'Wang YP', 'Lazo-Langner A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Western University, London, ON, Canada; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University, London, ON, Canada.

It is involved in many cellular processes and its gene is mutated in ~ 50-60% of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. These mutations cause its cytoplasmic mislocation and accumulation (referred to as NPM1c+) and open the door to rational targeted therapy for AML diseases with mutated NPM1. Currently, there is limited knowledge on the mechanism of action of NPM1c+ and on structural determinants of the leukemogenic potential of AML mutations. Numerous previous studies outlined an unexpected amyloid-like aggregation tendency of several regions located in the C-terminal domain that, in wild-type form, fold as a three-helical-bundle. Here, using a combination of different techniques including Thioflavin T fluorescence, congo red absorbance, CD spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and wide-angle X-ray scattering on a series of peptides bearing mutations, we evidence that the amyloidogenicity of NPM1 mutants is directly linked to AML. Noticeably, AML point mutations strongly affect the amyloid cytotoxic effects in neuroblastoma cells and the morphologies of deriving fibrils. This study paves the way to deepen our understanding of AML-associated NPM1 mutants, and could help to break new ground for the identification of novel drugs targeting NPM1c+ for treatment of AML.","['La Manna, Sara', 'Scognamiglio, Pasqualina Liana', 'Roviello, Valentina', 'Borbone, Fabio', 'Florio, Daniele', 'Di Natale, Concetta', 'Bigi, Alessandra', 'Cecchi, Cristina', 'Cascella, Roberta', 'Giannini, Cinzia', 'Sibillano, Teresa', 'Novellino, Ettore', 'Marasco, Daniela']","['La Manna S', 'Scognamiglio PL', 'Roviello V', 'Borbone F', 'Florio D', 'Di Natale C', 'Bigi A', 'Cecchi C', 'Cascella R', 'Giannini C', 'Sibillano T', 'Novellino E', 'Marasco D']","['Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.', 'Analytical Chemistry for the Environment and CeSMA (Advanced Metrologic Service Center), University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, Section of Biochemistry, University of Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, Section of Biochemistry, University of Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, Section of Biochemistry, University of Florence, Italy.', 'Institute of Crystallography (IC), National Research Council, Bari, Italy.', 'Institute of Crystallography (IC), National Research Council, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190408,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Amyloid)', '0 (Amyloidogenic Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Amyloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Amyloidogenic Proteins/*genetics', 'Amyloidosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Domains/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Nucleophosmin 1', '*ThT assay', '*WAXS', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*aggregation']",,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2018/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.14815 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2019 Jun;286(12):2311-2328. doi: 10.1111/febs.14815.

Patients were identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry spanning the years from 1980 to 2015, including 8788 individuals with primary TC and their SPCs. Relative risks (RRs) for SPC were calculated using the generalized Poisson regression model. SPCs were diagnosed in 9.4% of patients with TC and half of them were late onset cancers not common in the population in their 40s. Overall RR of SPCs (excluding second TC) was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.20-1.40), including high risks for seven solid cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia. Second TC was the most common SPC and the RR of 17.19 (95%CI: 14.89-19.85) was the highest recorded. Cancers known to be fatal as first primary cancers were also fatal as SPC in TC patients. Survival at 30 years of follow-up was approximately 80% for TC patients without SPC but it decreased to 40% for patients with SPC. The unexpected finding that half of the identified SPCs were typical late onset cancers in the middle-aged population raises concerns that therapy may facilitate premature aging. The risks of SPC are clinically important for the long-term management of TC patients and the high-mortality calls for a future management strategy.","['Zhang, Luyao', 'Hemminki, Otto', 'Chen, Tianhui', 'Yu, Hongyao', 'Zheng, Guoqiao', 'Chattopadhyay, Subhayan', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Sundquist, Kristina', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Zhang L', 'Hemminki O', 'Chen T', 'Yu H', 'Zheng G', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Forsti A', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Group, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Group of Molecular Epidemiology and Cancer Precision Prevention, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences (ZJAMS), Hangzhou, China.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, United States of America.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Shimane, Japan.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, United States of America.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Shimane, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Group of Molecular Epidemiology and Cancer Precision Prevention, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences (ZJAMS), Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190328,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Seminoma/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology']",PMC6438485,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/03/29 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0214410 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-33236 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Mar 28;14(3):e0214410. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0214410. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3434-523X'],,,,,,,,,,,,['J Urol. 2019 Nov;202(5):867-868.

However, their suppressive characteristics against autologous and allogeneic T effector cells (Teff) have rarely been documented. The exact role of UCB-Treg in hematologic malignancies is also uncertain. Here, we investigated the direct effects of UCB-Treg on the proliferation of autologous Teff, as compared with allogeneic Teff, and also determined cellular fates of lymphoblasts after UCB-Treg co-culture. UCB-Treg were isolated from 8 UCB samples using 2-step immunomagnetic bead sorting. After 10-day ex vivo expansion, up to 60-fold increase in cell number with 76.7%+/-4.9% of CD4CD25CD127FoxP UCB-Treg was obtained. Further characterization showed that ex vivo-expanded UCB-Treg contained a higher proportion of CD95CD45RACCR4Treg-B subpopulation compared with the CD95CD45RACCR4Treg-A subpopulation (13.0%+/-4.8% vs. 0.8%+/-0.7%; P<0.05), along with the detecting of substantial amounts of secretory IL-10 (57.7+/-17.8 pg/mL) and TGF-beta1 (196.5+/-29.7 pg/mL) in culture supernatants. After 4 days co-culture with UCB-Treg (at the ratio of 1:1), the proliferation of autologous and allogeneic Teff was decreased comparably (43.6%+/-17.5% vs. 37.6+/-17.7%; P=0.437). Suppression was independent of HLA-A, B, and DRB1 compatibility between UCB-Treg and Teff. UCB-Treg co-culture with various lymphoblasts showed proliferative suppression of Jurkat T lymphoblasts (45.4%+/-20.5% at the ratio of 1:1), but not Namalwa and Raji B lymphoblasts. All lymphoblasts had no significant cell apoptosis or death after co-culture. In conclusion, the ex vivo-expanded UCB-Treg had no difference in autologous and allogeneic Teff suppression.

Although the treatment of AML has brought promising outcomes for younger patients, prognosis of the elderly remains dismal. Innovative regimens are increasingly necessary to be investigated. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present an 86-year-old AML patient with fever, cough, and sputum production. DIAGNOSES: A diagnosis of AML with maturation (AML-M2) and AML1/ETO was made. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with a regimen of Homoharringtonine coupled with arsenic trioxide. OUTCOMES: The AML-M2 patient with AML1/ETO achieved incomplete remission, but showed few toxic side effects and improved survival. Besides, we analyzed the dynamic counts of complete blood cells during the treatment. The count of white blood cell had a positive correlation with the percentage of blast cells (r = 0.65), both of which had a negative correlation with the percentage of segmented neutrophils (r = -0.63, -0.89). LESSONS: Homoharringtonine and arsenic trioxide may induce both the apoptosis and differentiation of leukemic cells in AML-M2 with AML1/ETO.","['He, Zhipeng', 'Chen, Meiling', 'Huang, Yiping', 'Chen, Lili', 'Wang, Bixin', 'Wang, Huixian', 'Yang, Mengting', 'Xiao, Xueting', 'Lu, Yanhong', 'Chen, Jiaying', 'Wu, Yong']","['He Z', 'Chen M', 'Huang Y', 'Chen L', 'Wang B', 'Wang H', 'Yang M', 'Xiao X', 'Lu Y', 'Chen J', 'Wu Y']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Homoharringtonine/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*drug effects', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*drug effects']",PMC6456030,,,,2019/03/29 06:00,2019/04/05 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000014998 [doi]', '00005792-201903290-00042 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Mar;98(13):e14998. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000014998.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The INotuzumab Ozogamicin trial to inVestigAte Tolerability and Efficacy (INO-VATE) previously reported improved outcomes with InO versus standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapy. This article reports the final INO-VATE results (>/=2 years of follow-up) and additional analyses of patient characteristics associated with improved outcomes. METHODS: Between August 27, 2012, and January 4, 2015, this multicenter, parallel, open-label, phase 3 trial randomized 326 adults with relapsed/refractory ALL to InO (n = 164) or SoC (n = 162); 307 received 1 or more doses of the study drug (164 in the InO arm and 143 in the SoC arm). RESULTS: The complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate was higher with InO versus SoC (73.8% vs 30.9%; 1-sided P < .0001), with consistent CR/CRi rates across patient subgroups. The median overall survival (OS) was 7.7 months with InO and 6.2 months with SoC, with 2-year OS rates of 22.8% and 10.0%, respectively (overall hazard ratio, 0.75; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.99; 1-sided P = .0105). The predictors of OS with InO were the best minimal residual disease status, baseline platelet count, duration of first remission, achievement of CR/CRi, and follow-up hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; all 2-sided P values < .05). More InO arm patients proceeded directly to HSCT after achieving CR/CRi before any follow-up induction therapy (39.6% [95% CI, 32.1%-47.6%] vs 10.5% [6.2%-16.3%]; 1-sided P < .0001). The most frequent all-grade and grade 3 or higher adverse events in both arms were hematologic. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) was more frequent with InO (23 of 164 [14.0%] vs 3 of 143 [2.1%]). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with relapsed/refractory BCP ALL in INO-VATE, InO was associated with a greater likelihood of CR/CRi across key patient subgroups, and it served as a bridge to HSCT. Potential VOD/SOS risk factors must be considered when InO treatment decisions are being made.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Liedtke, Michaela', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Wang, Tao', 'Liang White, Jane', 'Sleight, Barbara', 'Vandendries, Erik', 'Advani, Anjali S']","['Kantarjian HM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stelljes M', 'Liedtke M', 'Stock W', 'Gokbuget N', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Jabbour E', 'Wang T', 'Liang White J', 'Sleight B', 'Vandendries E', 'Advani AS']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, California.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Irvine Medical Center, University of California, Orange, California.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Pfizer Inc, Groton, Connecticut.', 'Pfizer Inc, Groton, Connecticut.', 'Pfizer Inc, Groton, Connecticut.', 'Pfizer Inc, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190328,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Standard of Care', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC6618133,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adults', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*hepatic veno-occlusive disease', '*inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*remission induction']",,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32116 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Jul 15;125(14):2474-2487. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32116.

Solid benign tumors may be cancer precursors; benign tumors and cancers may share etiologic factors. However, comprehensive data on the risk for solid benign tumors are lacking. Objective: To quantify the incidence of and treatment-related risk factors for histologically confirmed solid nonskin benign tumors among CCSs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This record linkage study involves the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group-Long-Term Effects After Childhood Cancer (DCOG-LATER) cohort of 6165 individuals diagnosed with childhood cancer at younger than 18 years from January 1, 1963, through December 31, 2001, in 7 Dutch pediatric centers and who survived at least 5 years after the diagnosis. Study groups eligible for record linkage from 1990 onward included 5843 CCSs (94.8%) and 883 siblings. Benign tumors were identified from the population-based Dutch histopathology and cytopathology registry (PALGA). Follow-up was completed on May 1, 2015. Data were analyzed from January 1, 1990, through May 1, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative incidence of any subsequent benign tumor for cohort strata and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models (hazard ratios [HRs]) were used to evaluate potential risk factors for 8 major benign tumor subtypes. Results: Of the 5843 eligible CCSs (55.9% male), 542 (9.3%) developed a histologically confirmed subsequent benign tumor after a median follow-up of 22.7 years (range, 5.0-52.2 years). Among women, abdominopelvic radiotherapy inferred dose-dependent increased risks for uterine leiomyoma (n = 43) for doses of less than 20 Gy (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.5-7.0), 20 to less than 30 Gy (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.4), and at least 30 Gy (HR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.4-12.4) compared with no abdominopelvic radiotherapy (P = .002 for trend). High-dose radiotherapy to the trunk was not associated with breast fibroadenoma (n = 45). Of 23 osseous and/or chondromatous neoplasms, 16 occurred among leukemia survivors, including 11 after total body irradiation (HR, 37.4; 95% CI, 14.8-94.7). Nerve sheath tumors (n = 55) were associated with radiotherapy (HR at 31 years of age, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.5) and a crude indicator of neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 status (HR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.3-13.7). Subsequent risk for benign tumors was higher than the risks for subsequent nonskin solid malignant neoplasms and for benign tumors among siblings. Conclusions and Relevance: This record linkage study uses a unique resource for valid and complete outcome assessment and shows that CCSs have an approximately 2-fold risk of developing subsequent benign tumors compared with siblings. Site-specific new findings, including for uterine leiomyoma, osteochondroma, and nervous system tumors, are important to enable early diagnosis; this information will be the first step for future surveillance guidelines that include some benign tumors in CCSs and will provide leads for in-depth etiologic studies.","['Kok, Judith L', 'Teepen, Jop C', 'van der Pal, Helena J', 'van Leeuwen, Flora

This review analyses the correlation between specific defects and polymorphisms of immunity genes with susceptibility for pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations in BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a disease characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia. BTK inhibitors, which are used for treatment of leukemia, have pneumonia as side effect. Polymorphisms in B lymphocyte growth and differentiation factors, including IL-6 and IL-10, Fcg RIIa receptors, as well as genetic variants of ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme, also are associated with increased susceptibility for pneumonia. SUMMARY: Delineation of underlying genetic defects and polymorphisms may add in diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia. In case of humoral immunodeficiency, antibody replacement therapy may be indicated.","['Rijkers, Ger T', 'Holzer, Lara', 'Dusselier, Tiara']","['Rijkers GT', 'Holzer L', 'Dusselier T']","['Department of Sciences, University College Roosevelt, Middelburg.', 'Laboratory for Medical Microbiology and Immunology, St Elisabeth Hospital, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Sciences, University College Roosevelt, Middelburg.', 'Department of Sciences, University College Roosevelt, Middelburg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pulm Med,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,9503765,"['0 (FCGR2A protein, human)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/*genetics', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/genetics', 'Community-Acquired Infections/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Interleukin-10/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Pneumonia/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics']",,,,,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MCP.0000000000000580 [doi]', '00063198-201905000-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2019 May;25(3):323-329. doi: 10.1097/MCP.0000000000000580.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that the critical drug metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and cytidine deaminase (CDA) are highly expressed by BM stroma, and play an important role in this resistance to chemotherapy. However, what factors influence the chemoprotective capacity of the BM microenvironment, specifically related to CYP3A4 and CDA expression, are unknown. In this study, we found that the presence of AML cells decreases BM stromal expression of CYP3A4 and CDA, and this effect appears to be at least partially the result of cytokines secreted by AML cells. We also observed that stromal CYP3A4 expression is up-regulated by drugs commonly used in AML induction therapy, cytarabine, etoposide and daunorubicin, resulting in cross-resistance. Cytarabine also up-regulated CDA expression. The up-regulation of CYP3A4 associated with disease control was reversed by clarithromycin, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Our data suggest that minimal residual disease states are characterized by high levels of stromal drug metabolizing enzymes and thus, strong microenvironment-mediated drug resistance. These results further suggest a potential role for clinically targeting drug metabolizing enzymes in the microenvironment.","['Su, Meng', 'Chang, Yu-Ting', 'Hernandez, Daniela', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel']","['Su M', 'Chang YT', 'Hernandez D', 'Jones RJ', 'Ghiaur G']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190328,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Etoposide/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",PMC6533513,,,,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14298 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2019 Jun;23(6):4111-4117. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14298.

Twenty years of experience at a single center.,630-637,10.1111/aogs.13616 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: The preservation of fertility is an integral part of care of children requiring gonadotoxic treatments for cancer or non-malignant diseases. In France, the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue has been considered and has been offered as a clinical treatment since its inception. The aim of this study is to review 20 years of activity in fertility preservation by ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) for children and the feasibility of oocyte isolation and cryopreservation from the ovarian tissue at a single center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study including patients aged 15 years or younger who underwent OTC, combined for some with oocyte cryopreservation of isolated oocytes, before a highly gonadotoxic treatment for malignant or non-malignant disease was initiated. We describe the evolution of activities in our program for fertility preservation and patient characteristics at the time of OTC and follow up. RESULTS: From April 1998 to December 2018, 418 girls and adolescents younger than 15 years of age underwent OTC, representing 40.5% of all females who have had ovarian tissue cryopreserved at our center. In all, 313 patients had malignant diseases and 105 had benign conditions. Between November 2009 and July 2013, oocytes were isolated and also cryopreserved in 50 cases. The mean age of patients was 6.9 years (range 0.3-15). The most frequent diagnoses in this cohort included neuroblastoma, acute leukemia and hemoglobinopathies; neuroblastoma being the most common diagnosis in very young patients. During follow up, three patients requested the use of their cryopreserved ovarian tissue. All had undergone ovarian tissue transplantation, one for puberty induction and the two others for restoring fertility. So far, no pregnancies have been achieved. Eighty-four patients who had OTC died. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is the only available technique for preserving fertility of girls. To our knowledge this is the largest series of girls and adolescents younger than 15 years so far reported on procedures of OTC before highly gonadotoxic treatment in a single center.","['Poirot, Catherine', 'Brugieres, Laurence', 'Yakouben, Karima', 'Prades-Borio, Marie', 'Marzouk, Flora', 'de Lambert, Guenolee', 'Pacquement, Helene', 'Bernaudin, Francoise', 'Neven, Benedicte', 'Paye-Jaouen, Annabel', 'Pondarre, Corinne', 'Dhedin, Nathalie', 'Drouineaud, Veronique', 'Chalas, Celine', 'Martelli, Helene', 'Michon, Jean', 'Minard, Veronique', 'Lezeau, Harry', 'Doz, Francois', 'Sarnacki, Sabine', 'Philippe-Chomette, Pascale', 'Dufour, Christelle', 'Laurence, Valerie', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Wolf, Jean-Philippe', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Valteau-Couanet, Dominique', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues']","['Poirot C', 'Brugieres L', 'Yakouben K', 'Prades-Borio M', 'Marzouk F', 'de Lambert G', 'Pacquement H', 'Bernaudin F', 'Neven B', 'Paye-Jaouen A', 'Pondarre C', 'Dhedin N', 'Drouineaud V', 'Chalas C', 'Martelli H', 'Michon J', 'Minard V', 'Lezeau H', 'Doz F', 'Sarnacki S', 'Philippe-Chomette P', 'Dufour C', 'Laurence V', 'Baruchel A', 'Wolf JP', 'Boissel N', 'Valteau-Couanet D', 'Dalle JH']","['AYA Unit, Department of Hematology, Fertility Preservation, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Immunology, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Hospital Tenon, Paris, France.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Hospital Delafontaine, St Denis, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Center Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Immunology, Hospital Necker, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Center Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil, France.', 'AYA Unit, Department of Hematology, Fertility Preservation, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Hospital Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Hospital Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Bicetre, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Paris-Sud University, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Center Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Necker, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Immunology, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, Hospital Cochin, Paris, France.', 'AYA Unit, Department of Hematology, Fertility Preservation, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Immunology, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Diderot University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190414,United States,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,0370343,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cryopreservation/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Fertility Preservation/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/therapy', 'Oocyte Retrieval', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', '*Ovary', 'Procedures and Techniques Utilization/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*children', '*fertility preservation', '*gonadotoxic treatment', '*ovarian tissue cryopreservation']",,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/01/29 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/aogs.13616 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2019 May;98(5):630-637. doi: 10.1111/aogs.13616.

There are 27 different subtypes of peripheral NK and T cell neoplasms, each of which is relatively uncommon. Treatment has been largely extrapolated from case series, retrospective reports, and paradigms developed for the aggressive B cell lymphomas. This review explores the current knowledge of the characteristics, outcome, and treatment of CNS T cell and NK neoplasms. RECENT FINDINGS: Primary and secondary CNS NK and T cell malignancies confer significant morbidity and poor prognosis. Despite clinical heterogeneity between the 27 subtypes, high-dose methotrexate-based regimens seem most effective overall. The role of prophylaxis against secondary CNS involvement remains controversial. Autologous stem cell transplant and immunotherapy are potential for promising future therapies. Current understanding of incidence, outcome, and optimal treatment strategies for CNS T cell and NK neoplasms is limited, in large part due to their diversity and rarity. Prognosis is poor, except in a few reports of long-term survival in patients most often treated with combination therapy including high-dose methotrexate. A future prospective study on treatment and outcome in CNS T cell and NK neoplasms is needed to better define these diseases.","['Aaroe, Ashley E', 'Nevel, Kathryn S']","['Aaroe AE', 'Nevel KS']","['Department of Neurology, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medicine, 528 East 68th Street, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Indiana University Health, Indiana University School of Medicine, 355 W. 16th St., Ste 3200, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA. knevel@iupui.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190327,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Brain metastasis', '*CNS', '*Central nervous system diseases', '*Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis', '*T cell leukemia', '*T cell lymphoma']",,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-019-0794-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-019-0794-2 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2019 Mar 27;21(5):40. doi: 10.1007/s11912-019-0794-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, ASCT still remains only curative therapeutic modality for CLL, especially in countries with limited access to novel agents. Thirty patients with CLL at median age of 42 years at diagnosis (range 29-64) underwent ASCT between years 2002 and 2018. Thirteen patients were transplanted in complete remission (CR), ten patients achieved partial response (PR), and seven had stable disease. The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 4 years (range 0.5-12). Twenty-three patients received HLA-matched related donor stem cell grafts, and seven patients received either matched unrelated donor or HLA-mismatched grafts. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and myeloablative regimen (MAC) were used in 24 and 6 patients, respectively. Mortality to day + 100 after transplant was 16% (8% for RIC only). Acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) developed in 40% and 63% of patients, respectively. Fifteen patients relapsed or progressed after transplant. Thirteen patients (43%) are alive at last follow-up and 10 (77%) remain in clinical CR. Median follow-up for survivors was 6.8 years (range 0.4-15.2). Three-year progression-free and overall survivals were 56% and 60%, respectively. These outcomes were better for patients who received RIC conditioning: 64% and 72%, respectively. CR at transplant was found to have favorable impact on post-allograft survival. RIC should be preferred over MAC.

Resistance to HU is associated with a shortened life expectancy, intolerance has no prognostic value. We assessed the occurrence of HU resistance or intolerance comparing the original (ELNo) versus the modified European Leukemia Net (ELNm) criteria as applied in recent large clinical trials including PV patients. We retrospectively analyzed 106 patients with PV treated with HU at the University Hospitals of Leuven between 1990 and 2016 for occurrence of HU resistance/intolerance when using both ELNo as ELNm. After a mean duration of treatment of 5.1 years, when applying the ELNo 20.7% of patients had shown resistance or intolerance to HU in comparison to 39.6% when using the ELNm. When using the ELNo 4.7% of patients were resistant to HU versus 23.6% when applying the ELNm. In total, 16.0% of patients were HU intolerant. This rate was identical when using both ELNo and ELNm. 20.7% of PV patients were considered as HU-resistant or intolerant when using the original ELN criteria.

Patient-derived CAR T cells have demonstrated remarkable efficacy against a range of B-cell malignancies(1-3), and the results of early clinical trials suggest activity in multiple myeloma(4). Despite high complete response rates, relapses occur in a large fraction of patients; some of these are antigen-negative and others are antigen-low(1,2,4-9). Unlike the mechanisms that result in complete and permanent antigen loss(6,8,9), those that lead to escape of antigen-low tumours remain unclear. Here, using mouse models of leukaemia, we show that CARs provoke reversible antigen loss through trogocytosis, an active process in which the target antigen is transferred to T cells, thereby decreasing target density on tumour cells and abating T cell activity by promoting fratricide T cell killing and T cell exhaustion. These mechanisms affect both CD28- and 4-1BB-based CARs, albeit differentially, depending on antigen density. These dynamic features can be offset by cooperative killing and combinatorial targeting to augment tumour responses to immunotherapy.","['Hamieh, Mohamad', 'Dobrin, Anton', 'Cabriolu, Annalisa', 'van der Stegen, Sjoukje J C', 'Giavridis, Theodoros', 'Mansilla-Soto, Jorge', 'Eyquem, Justin', 'Zhao, Zeguo', 'Whitlock, Benjamin M', 'Miele, Matthew M', 'Li, Zhuoning', 'Cunanan, Kristen M', 'Huse, Morgan', 'Hendrickson, Ronald C', 'Wang, Xiuyan', 'Riviere, Isabelle', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Hamieh M', 'Dobrin A', 'Cabriolu A', 'van der Stegen SJC', 'Giavridis T', 'Mansilla-Soto J', 'Eyquem J', 'Zhao Z', 'Whitlock BM', 'Miele MM', 'Li Z', 'Cunanan KM', 'Huse M', 'Hendrickson RC', 'Wang X', 'Riviere I', 'Sadelain M']","['Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Microchemistry and Proteomics Core Laboratory, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Microchemistry and Proteomics Core Laboratory, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Quantitative Sciences Unit, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Microchemistry and Proteomics Core Laboratory, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. m-sadelain@ski.mskcc.org.', 'Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA. m-sadelain@ski.mskcc.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190327,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,"['4-1BB Ligand/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/*metabolism', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology']",PMC6707377,,,,2019/03/29 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2018/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41586-019-1054-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41586-019-1054-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2019 Apr;568(7750):112-116. doi: 10.1038/s41586-019-1054-1.

This phenomenon may affect how leukaemia patients respond to transplantation therapy using stem cells from cord blood (CB). It has been proposed that maternal T cells, primed to inherited paternal HLAs, are present in CB transplants and help to suppress leukaemic relapse. Several studies have reported evidence for the presence of maternal T cells in most CBs at sufficiently high numbers to lend credence to this idea. We here aimed to functionally characterise maternal T cells from CB. To our surprise, we could not isolate viable maternal cells from CB even after using state-of-the-art enrichment techniques that allow detection of viable cells in heterologous populations at frequencies that were several orders of magnitude lower than reported frequencies of maternal T cells in CB. In support of these results, we could only detect maternal DNA in a minority of samples and at insufficient amounts for reliable quantification through a sensitive PCR-based assay to measure In/Del polymorphisms. We conclude that maternal microchimerism is far less prominent than reported, at least in our cohort of CBs, and discuss possible explanations and implications.","['Opstelten, Rianne', 'Slot, Manon C', 'Lardy, Neubury M', 'Lankester, Arjan C', 'Mulder, Arend', 'Claas, Frans H J', 'van Rood, Jon J', 'Amsen, Derk']","['Opstelten R', 'Slot MC', 'Lardy NM', 'Lankester AC', 'Mulder A', 'Claas FHJ', 'van Rood JJ', 'Amsen D']","['Sanquin Research, Dept of Hematopoiesis, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Sanquin Research, Dept of Hematopoiesis, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Sanquin Diagnostics BV, Department of Immunogenetics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Willem-Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Sanquin Research, Dept of Hematopoiesis, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Landsteiner Laboratory, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. d.amsen@sanquin.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190327,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Temperature']",PMC6437214,,,,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2018/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-41733-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-41733-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 27;9(1):5247. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-41733-w.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7805-7064'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT We present a case of a 6-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with secondary hypercalcemia. She started chemotherapy following the IC-BFM ALL2002 protocol with simultaneous calcitonin, diuretics and aggressive hydration for hypercalcemia, and went into complete remission after the induction therapy. After 4 months of chemotherapy, she was diagnosed with relapse associated again with malignant hypercalcemia, and underwent chemotherapy with the relapse protocol. There was no response after the first 2 cycles, so we decided to start her on clofarabine. Due to the severe hypercalcemia and consecutive osteolysis, she developed several bone fractures and needed gypsum immobilization. We started her again on calcitonin, but she developed severe adverse reactions, so we found it necessary to start bisphosphonates, first zoledronic acid intravenously, and afterwards clodronate orally. Consolidation of bone fractures was achieved, but due to prolonged immobilization she developed bedsores, superinfected with Lichtheimia corymbifera. We started posaconazole orally, but she rapidly went into severe sepsis with multiple organ failure. The leukemia showed no response to chemotherapy, progressed rapidly, and the patient died. CONCLUSIONS Malignant hypercalcemia is associated with a poor prognosis in leukemia, and might need a more aggressive therapy.","['Bota, Madalina', 'Popa, Gheorghe', 'Neaga, Alexandra', 'Gocan, Horatiu', 'Blag, Cristina Lucia']","['Bota M', 'Popa G', 'Neaga A', 'Gocan H', 'Blag CL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery and Orthopedics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190328,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,['Humoral Hypercalcemia Of Malignancy'],IM,"['Child', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Radiography']",PMC6452782,,,,2019/03/29 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]']","['914303 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.914303 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Mar 28;20:402-405. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.914303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The orphan G protein-coupled receptor, class C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), normally expressed only in the hair follicle, was previously identified as expressed by mRNA in marrow aspirates from patients with MM, but confirmation of protein expression remained elusive. Using quantitative immunofluorescence, we determined that GPRC5D protein is expressed on CD138(+) MM cells from primary marrow samples with a distribution that was similar to, but independent of, BCMA. Panning a human B cell-derived phage display library identified seven GPRC5D-specific single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Incorporation of these into multiple CAR formats yielded 42 different constructs, which were screened for antigen-specific and antigen-independent (tonic) signaling using a Nur77-based reporter system. Nur77 reporter screen results were confirmed in vivo using a marrow-tropic MM xenograft in mice. CAR T cells incorporating GPRC5D-targeted scFv clone 109 eradicated MM and enabled long-term survival, including in a BCMA antigen escape model. GPRC5D(109) is specific for GPRC5D and resulted in MM cell line and primary MM cytotoxicity, cytokine release, and in vivo activity comparable to anti-BCMA CAR T cells. Murine and cynomolgus cross-reactive CAR T cells did not cause alopecia or other signs of GPRC5D-mediated toxicity in these species. Thus, GPRC5D(109) CAR T cell therapy shows potential for the treatment of advanced MM irrespective of previous BCMA-targeted therapy.","['Smith, Eric L', 'Harrington, Kim', 'Staehr, Mette',

However, the mechanisms by which MOV10 promotes or inhibits the replication of particular viruses have not been well defined. A recent paper published in the Biochemical Journal by Li et al. [Biochem. J. (2019) 476, 467-481] provides insight regarding the mechanisms by which MOV10 restricts influenza A virus (IAV) infection in host cells. First, the authors confirm that MOV10 binds to the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and sequesters the viral ribonucleoprotein complex in cytoplasmic granules called processing (P)-bodies, thus inhibiting IAV replication. Second, they demonstrate that the non-structural (NS)1 protein of IAV can act as an antagonist of MOV10, inhibiting the association of MOV10 with NP and promoting MOV10 degradation through the lysosomal pathway. Further research will determine if cellular RNA helicases such as MOV10 represent suitable targets for the development of novel anti-IAV therapies.","['Villalon-Letelier, Fernando', 'Reading, Patrick C']","['Villalon-Letelier F', 'Reading PC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia preading@unimelb.edu.au.', 'WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, 792 Elizabeth St, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",20190327,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['EC 2.7.7.- (Mov10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Cytoplasm', 'Humans', '*Infections', '*Influenza A virus', 'RNA Helicases']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*RNA helicase', '*antiviral', '*influenza']",,2019/03/29 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['BCJ20190018 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20190018 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2019 Mar 27;476(6):1005-1008. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20190018.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8860-5308'],"['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

In addition to imatinib, which was approved for pediatric CML in 2003, the second-generation TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib were recently approved for use in children, expanding the therapeutic options and pushing allogeneic stem cell transplantation to a third-line treatment of most pediatric cases. Yet, without sufficient data on efficacy and safety specific to pediatric patients, the selection of a TKI continues to rely on clinical experience in adults. Here, we present 4 case scenarios highlighting common yet challenging issues encountered in the treatment of pediatric CML (suboptimal response, poor treatment adherence, growth retardation, and presentation in advanced phases). Limited experience with very young children, the transition of teenagers to adult medicine, and the goal of achieving treatment-free remission for this rare leukemia are additional significant obstacles that require further clinical investigation through international collaboration.","['Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Suttorp, Meinolf']","['Hijiya N', 'Suttorp M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Medical Faculty, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190327,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,,,2019/03/29 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2018/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42516-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2018882233 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 May 30;133(22):2374-2384. doi: 10.1182/blood.2018882233.

The nuclear translocation of AhR was assessed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Real-time RT-PCR was conducted using AhR target genes. The ratio of Cholesterol:Span 60 (1:1) niosomal formulations with the highest significant EE% were selected. I3C exerted cytotoxic effects on THP-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while administration of niosomal I3C reduced these effects. Both niosomal and free I3C formulations facilitated the nuclear translocation of AhR. CYP1A1 was overexpressed in response to both free and niosomal I3C treatments, while IL1beta was overexpressed merely in niosomal I3C-treated THP-1 cells. Niosomal formulation of I3C resulted in reduced cytotoxicity effects by enhancing the functional effects of I3C on AhR in THP-1 cells, including its nuclear translocation and overexpression of the target genes.","['Abbaspour Sani, Neda', 'Hasani, Mahsa', 'Kianmehr, Anvarsadat', 'Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Sheikh Arabi, Mehdi', 'Yazdani, Yaghoub']","['Abbaspour Sani N', 'Hasani M', 'Kianmehr A', 'Mohammadi S', 'Sheikh Arabi M', 'Yazdani Y']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Metabolic Disorders Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Medical Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Laboratory Science Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190527,England,J Liposome Res,Journal of liposome research,9001952,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', 'C11E72455F (indole-3-carbinol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Liposomes/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface Properties', 'Surface-Active Agents/chemistry', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)', 'THP-1', 'drug delivery', 'indole-3-carbinol (I3C)', 'niosome']",,2019/03/29 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2019/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08982104.2019.1600545 [doi]'],ppublish,J Liposome Res. 2020 Jun;30(2):117-125. doi: 10.1080/08982104.2019.1600545.

Methods: IKZF1 mutation was detected in 63 adult Ph1 positive ALL patients at diagnosis using capillary electrophoresis. Recruited patients were treated in our center and other three hospitals in Ningbo from January 2014 to January 2017. Clinical data were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Results: Thirty-nine (61.9%) patients were positive IKZF1 mutation in this cohort. The white blood cell (WBC) count in IKZF1 mutation group was significantly higher than that of mutation negative group [(64.6+/-11.3)x10(9)/L vs. (33.7+/-5.6)x10(9)/L, P<0.05]. Patients with WBC count over 30x10(9)/L accounted for 56.4% in IKZF1 mutation group. Complete remission (CR) rate in the IKZF1 mutation group was also lower than that of negative group after induction chemotherapy (64.1% vs. 75.0%, P>0.05). IKZF1 was a negative prognostic factor but not independent factor for survival by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients were divided into chemotherapy and allogeneic transplantation groups. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate in IKZF1 mutation group were significantly lower than those of negative group in both transplantation group (42.3% vs. 59.3%; 31.2% vs. 50.0%; respectively, both P<0.05) and chemotherapy group (24.8% vs. 40.0%; 19.0% vs. 34.3%; respectively, both P<0.05). Conclusion: IKZF1 mutation is a poor prognostic factor for adult Ph1 positive ALL patients.","['Tang, S H', 'Lu, Y', 'Zhang, P S', 'Liu, X H', 'Du, X H', 'Chen, D', 'Li, S Y', 'Cao, J J', 'Chen, L G', 'Le, J', 'Qian, S Y', 'Hong, Y W', 'Pei, R Z']","['Tang SH', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang PS', 'Liu XH', 'Du XH', 'Chen D', 'Li SY', 'Cao JJ', 'Chen LG', 'Le J', 'Qian SY', 'Hong YW', 'Pei RZ']","[""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Eastern Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, Ningbo 315010, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou No.2 Hospital, Ningbo 315192, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Zinc Fingers']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Ikaros family zinc finger 1 gene', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'Prognosis']",,2019/03/29 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2019.04.012 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Apr 1;58(4):301-306. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2019.04.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVs are released from all cell types and have been shown to regulate normal physiological homeostasis, as well as pathological states by influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, organ homing, injury and recovery, as well as disease progression. In this review, we focus on the bidirectional actions of vesicles from normal and diseased cells on normal or leukemic target cells; and on the leukemic microenvironment as a whole. EVs from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can have a healing effect, reversing the malignant phenotype in prostate and colorectal cancer, as well as mitigating radiation damage to marrow. The role of EVs in leukemia and their bimodal cross talk with the encompassing microenvironment remains to be fully characterized. This may provide insight for clinical advances via the application of EVs as potential therapy and the employment of statistical and machine learning models to capture the pleiotropic effects EVs endow to a dynamic microenvironment, possibly allowing for precise therapeutic intervention.","['Borgovan, Theodor', 'Crawford, Lorin', 'Nwizu, Chibuikem', 'Quesenberry, Peter']","['Borgovan T', 'Crawford L', 'Nwizu C', 'Quesenberry P']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', 'School of Public Health, Center for Computational Molecular Biology, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190327,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Postrenal transplant cancers usually originate from recipient cells, but donor-related cancers have been rarely reported. We report the case of 49-year-old woman who developed multiple myeloma of donor origin 7 years after kidney transplantation. The donor was the mother of the recipient and also developed multiple myeloma 1 year after kidney donation. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was based on IgG lambda monoclonal protein and the infiltration of plasma cells in bone marrow. The renal biopsy did not reveal plasmacytoma in the transplanted kidney. Epstein-Barr virus DNA load was negative in peripheral blood. The patient responded to lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and subsequently received autologous stem cell transplantation. Donor chimerism was detected in the recipient marrow by short tandem repeat analysis; however, studies of Ig gene rearrangement were inconclusive due to insufficient DNA quality. The chromosomal abnormalities in the two myelomas were different. This case suggests that donor cells with myeloma-initiating potential can be transferred to a recipient via a renal graft and can lead to the development of donor-derived multiple myeloma in the recipient under immunosuppression.","['Fujiwara, Shin-Ichiro', 'Ikeda, Takashi', 'Morita, Kaoru', 'Shinzato, Takahiro', 'Ishikawa, Nobuo', 'Nakamura, Naoya', 'Yagisawa, Takashi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Fujiwara SI', 'Ikeda T', 'Morita K', 'Shinzato T', 'Ishikawa N', 'Nakamura N', 'Yagisawa T', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotuke, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotuke, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotuke, Japan.', 'Division of Renal Surgery and Transplantation, Jichi Medical University, Shimotuke, Japan.', 'Division of Renal Surgery and Transplantation, Jichi Medical University, Shimotuke, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Renal Surgery and Transplantation, Jichi Medical University, Shimotuke, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotuke, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190419,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Chimerism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Multiple Myeloma/*etiology/pathology', 'Nephrectomy/*adverse effects', 'Postoperative Complications/*etiology/pathology', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*adverse effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia: hematogenous/leukemia/lymphoma', '*clinical research/practice', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*kidney transplantation: living donor']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2018/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajt.15373 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2019 Aug;19(8):2374-2377. doi: 10.1111/ajt.15373.

However, cardiotoxicities remain important adverse consequences of treatment with chemotherapy and radiation, although the burden of cardiovascular mortality (CVM) in such patients remains unknown. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients greater than or equal to 20 years of age diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) between 2000 and 2013 using data extracted from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Our primary endpoint was CVM. The association between NHL and CVM was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjusting for other patient characteristics. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for CVM, comparing NHL patients with the general population. We identified 153 983 patients who met the inclusion criteria (69 329 with DLBCL, 48 650 with CLL/SLL, and 36 004 with FL). The median follow-up was 37 months (interquartile range, 10-78 months); the mean patient age was 66.24 (+/-14.69) years; 84 924 (55.2%) were men; 134 720 (87.5%) were White, and 131 912 (85.7%) did not receive radiation therapy. Overall, 9017 patients (5.8%) died from cardiovascular disease, and we found that NHL patients had a higher risk of CVM than the general population, after adjusting for age (SMR 15.2, 95% confidence interval: 14.89-15.52). The rates of CVM were 5.1%, 8%, and 4.4% in patients with DLBCL, CLL/SLL, and FL, respectively. Furthermore, across all NHL subtypes, older age, higher stage at the time of diagnosis (particularly stage 4), male sex, and living in the south were associated with higher risks of CVM. Our data suggest that risk assessment and careful cardiac monitoring are recommended for NHL patients, particularly those with the CLL/SLL subtypes.","['Abuamsha, Hasan', 'Kadri, Amer N', 'Hernandez, Adrian V']","['Abuamsha H', 'Kadri AN', 'Hernandez AV']","['Department of Medicine, St. Vincent Charity Medical Center - Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Hospital Medicine, Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.', 'University of Connecticut/Hartford Hospital Evidence-based Practice Center, Hartford, Connecticut, United States of America.', 'School of Medicine, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC), Lima, Peru.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190412,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*complications/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'SEER Program', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['SEER', 'cardiotoxicity', 'cardiovascular mortality', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2607 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Aug;37(3):261-269. doi: 10.1002/hon.2607.

Moreover, patients with higher-risk genetic abnormalities continue to experience poorer outcomes and lower survival. Recently, novel targeted therapies have been developed to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. Areas covered: Ibrutinib is an oral irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a mediator of B-cell receptor signaling, which plays a vital role in various B-cell neoplasms. The drug has been approved for the treatment of several hematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, where large trials have shown outcomes never seen before even in high-risk patients. The safety profile appeared furthermore favorable, even in elderly and unfit patients. Expert opinion: Therapy with ibrutinib rarely provides MRD-negative complete remission; an indefinite maintenance is therefore needed, with the risk of developing adverse events (AE) or resistance resulting in treatment interruption or discontinuation. Novel, extremely promising, combination strategies, based on the association of ibrutinib with chemoimmunotherapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody or other targeted agents, are currently being investigated, with the goal of achieving greater depth of remission, especially MRD-negativity, and removing the need for indefinite treatment.","['Deodato, Marina', 'Frustaci, Anna Maria', 'Zamprogna, Giulia', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra']","['Deodato M', 'Frustaci AM', 'Zamprogna G', 'Cairoli R', 'Montillo M', 'Tedeschi A']","['a Department of Hematology , Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda , Milano , Italy.', 'a Department of Hematology , Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda , Milano , Italy.', 'a Department of Hematology , Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda , Milano , Italy.', 'a Department of Hematology , Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda , Milano , Italy.', 'a Department of Hematology , Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda , Milano , Italy.', 'a Department of Hematology , Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda , Milano , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190411,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BTK inhibitor', '*chemoimmunotherapy', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*ibrutinib', '*minimal residual disease', '*targeted therapies']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2020/05/22 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1597703 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 May;12(5):273-284. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1597703.

The encoded fusion protein may be important for leukemogenesis; clinical studies show that dasatinib has an antileukemic effect in combination with steroids alone or intensive chemotherapy. Areas covered: Relevant publications were identified through literature searches (the used terms being acute lymphoblastic leukemia plus dasatinib) in the PubMed database. We searched for original articles and reviews describing the pharmacology and clinical use of dasatinib in ALL with BCR-ABL1. The mechanism of action, pharmacology and clinical study findings are examined. Expert opinion: Dasatinib is associated with a high complete remission rate in ALL when used alone and in combination with steroids or intensive chemotherapy. However, mutations at T315 and F317 are associated with dasatinib resistance. Overall toxicity has been acceptable in these studies and no unexpected toxicity was observed. It is not known whether the antileukemic effect of dasatinib differs between subsets of BCR-ABL1(+) patients or is attributed to inhibition of the fusion protein alone, or a combined effect on several kinases, and whether dasatinib-containing combination treatment should be preferred in these patients instead of other emerging strategies, e.g. monoclonal antibodies.","['Brattas, Marte Karen', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Tvedt, Tor Henrik Anderson', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brattas MK', 'Reikvam H', 'Tvedt THA', 'Bruserud O']","['a Department of Medicine , Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'c Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190405,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drugs, Investigational/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BCR-ABL', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical studies', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'immunomodulation']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2019.1597052 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2019 May;28(5):411-420. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2019.1597052.

Here, we have found that undertreatment of curcumin or daunorubicin, the cross-talk through MVs of KG-1-bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), significantly downregulates the expression of the survival gene osteopontin (OPN), CXCL-12, IL-6 (interleukin-6), STAT-3, and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) in treated-KG-1 cells as well as exclusively upregulates CXCL-12 in BMSCs. Drug treated-cell populations' MVs of both single cultured osteoblasts (OBs) and cocultured KG-1 + BMSCs + OBs similarly upregulate survival mediators' OPN, CXCL-12, IL-6, STAT-3, and VCAM-1 in treated-KG-1 cells. Likewise, isolated MVs from KG-1 cells or communication between KG-1, BMSCs, and OBs treated by drugs increase the expression of genes OPN, CXCL-12, IL-6, STAT3, and VCAM-1 by OBs. MVs derived from KG-1 + BMSCs + OBs reduce drug-induced apoptosis in KG-1 cells. This suggests MVs-mediated information transfer is a procedure whereby OBs could overcome BMSCs-induced apoptosis in drug-treated-KG-1 cells.","['Zahedpanah, Mahdi', 'Takanlu, Javid Sabour', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen', 'Rad, Fariba', 'Farhid, Fatemeh', 'Mousavi, Seyed Asadollah', 'Rad, Soroush', 'Fumani, Hosein Kamranzadeh', 'Hosseini Rad, Seyed Mohammad Ali', 'Mohammadi, Saeed']","['Zahedpanah M', 'Takanlu JS', 'Nikbakht M', 'Rad F', 'Farhid F', 'Mousavi SA', 'Rad S', 'Fumani HK', 'Hosseini Rad SMA', 'Mohammadi S']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190327,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Dynamic Light Scattering', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*chemoresistance', '*microvesicles', '*niche cells']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28511 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(10):18707-18719. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28511.

Usually, DLIs are collected from naive donors as steady-state lymphocytes. When donor lymphocytes are collected during stem cell apheresis, donors are pre-treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). However, the impact of G-CSF stimulation and the resulting composition of DLIs on beneficial anti-leukaemic responses and survival remain elusive. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the role of G-CSF-DLIs: 44 patients received either steady-state DLIs or G-CSF-DLIs to prevent and treat relapse or establish full donor chimerism after allo-HCT. The G-CSF-DLI patient cohort showed an improved conversion to full donor chimerism and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse or disease progression without a significantly increased cumulative incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). CD34(+) cells, monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and monocytes as well as donor age and the subsequent occurrence of chronic GVHD were identified as risk factors that significantly improve overall survival after DLI administration. In conclusion, our data suggest that administration of G-CSF-DLIs results in graft-versus-leukaemia effects without exacerbating GVHD, therefore, improving survival after DLIs.","['Schneidawind, Corina', 'Jahnke, Simona', 'Schober-Melms, Irmtraud', 'Schumm, Michael', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Faul, Christoph', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Bethge, Wolfgang', 'Schneidawind, Dominik']","['Schneidawind C', 'Jahnke S', 'Schober-Melms I', 'Schumm M', 'Handgretinger R', 'Faul C', 'Kanz L', 'Bethge W', 'Schneidawind D']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""University Children's Hospital, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany."", 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190327,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*donor lymphocyte infusion', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukaemia effects', '*granulocyte colony-stimulating factor', '*haematopoietic cell transplantation']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15881 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Jul;186(1):60-71. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15881.

Abnormal S100 calcium binding protein A16 (S100A16) has been implicated in various cancers, but its function remains unclear. We found S100A16 transcript levels were higher in 130 adults with newly-diagnosed Ph-negative B-cell ALL compared with 33 healthy controls. In 115 of 130 patients who achieved first complete remission, those with high S100A16 transcript levels displayed a lower 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; 34% [21, 47%] vs. 40% [48, 72%]; P = 0.012) and higher 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS; 65% [53, 78%] vs. 35% [23, 46%]; P = 0.012), especially when receiving chemotherapy only. In multivariate analysis a low S100A16 transcript level was independently-associated with a higher CIR (Hazard ratio [HR] = 3.74 [1.01-13.82]; P = 0.048) and inferior RFS (HR = 5.78 [1.91, 17.84]; P < 0.001). Function analysis indicated that knockdown of S100A16 promoted proliferation and anti-apoptosis and reduced chemosensitivity. S100A16 over-expression revealed an opposite trend, especially in a xeno-transplant mouse model. Western blotting analysis showed upregulation of PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 in S100A16-knockdown and S100A16-overexpression B-cell ALL cell lines respectively. Inhibition assays suggested these two signalling pathways participated in the S100A16-mediated proliferation and survival effects in B-cell ALL cell lines.

Like AML, MS has a poor prognosis, but due to the rare nature of MS there are limited studies examining potential prognostic factors. We report our institutional experience, with the aim of investigating and establishing salient clinicopathological and molecular features of MS. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively examined all clinicopathological and molecular data on MS patients between 2001 and 2017 from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) electronic medical records. The UAB electronic medical records were also reviewed and compared with the literature for other potential prognostic factors. Sixty-three patients were included in the study. The median overall survival was 24 months in the group with normal karyotype and 12 months in patients with an abnormal karyotype.

However, their expressions and the relationship between HAND2-AS1 and miR-1275 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remain unknown and to be further investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 30 CML patients and 10 healthy donors were collected; HAND2-AS1 and miR-1275 were detected by RT-PCR. The correlation between HAND2-AS1 and miR-1275 was analyzed. After lentiviral (LV) HAND2-AS1 and miR-1275 inhibitors were respectively transfected into KCL22 and K562 cells, the expressions of HAND2-AS1 and miR-1275 were detected by RT-PCR. MTT assay was performed to evaluate cell viability and mRNA and proteins levels of Bcl-2, Caspase-3, MMP-2, MMP-9 were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot (WB). Luciferase reporter assay was performed to explore the binding site of HAND2-AS1 and miR-1275. RESULTS: Results showed that HAND2-AS1 was significantly downregulated than healthy control (p<0.05), and HAND2-AS1 expressions on stages of AP and BP were much lower than that of CP (p<0.05). The miR-1275 expression was significantly upregulated than healthy control (p<0.05), and the expressions in stages of accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP) were much higher than that in the stage of chronic phase (CP) in CML (p<0.05). Furthermore, HAND2-AS1 was negatively correlated with miR-1275 in CML, but not in healthy control (p<0.05). After lentiviral HAND2-AS1 transfection, the HAND2-AS1 expression was significantly up-regulated while miR-1275 was significantly down-regulated (p<0.05). Then, the cell proliferation was inhibited after 72 h. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly down-regulated (p<0.05), while the expression of Caspase-3 was significantly up-regulated (p<0.05). Luciferase reporter assay showed that HAND2-AS1 was a target gene of miR-1275. And after treating with miR-1275 inhibitor, HAND2-AS1 was significantly upregulated (p<0.01) and cell proliferation was inhibited (p<0.01). Furthermore, the expressions of Bcl-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were significantly decreased, while Caspase-3 was significantly increased (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: HAND2-AS1 was downregulated and miR-1275 was upregulated in CML, and HAND2-AS1 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of CML cells by sponging with microRNA-1275, which might be a novel therapeutic target for CML.","['Yang, J-R', 'Shi, M-X', 'Zeng, Y']","['Yang JR', 'Shi MX', 'Zeng Y']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yunnan Hematology Research Center, Kunming, China. wuvh163@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN1275 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long non-coding RNA HAND2-AS1, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",,,,,2019/03/28 06:00,2020/08/14 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201903_17254 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Mar;23(5):2103-2111. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201903_17254.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we aimed to explore whether lncRNA linc-ITGB1 affected the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Linc-ITGB1 expression in both ccRCC cells and tissue samples was detected by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the association between linc-ITGB1 expression level and patients' disease-free survival rate was explored. Then, wound healing and transwell assays were conducted. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was explored through RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. RESULTS: Linc-ITGB1 expression level in ccRCC samples was markedly higher than that of the adjacent ones. The expression of linc-ITGB1 was closely related to the disease-free survival time of ccRCC patients. Moreover, the migration and invasion of ccRCC cells were remarkably enhanced after linc-ITGB1 upregulation in vitro. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression of Mcl-1 were significantly downregulated after linc-ITGB1 overexpression. Furthermore, the expression level of Mcl-1 was negatively correlated with the linc-ITGB1 expression in ccRCC tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that linc-ITGB1 could enhance ccRCC cell migration and invasion via downregulating Mcl-1. In addition, linc-ITGB1 might be a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.","['Zheng, X-L', 'Zhang, Y-Y', 'Lv, W-G']","['Zheng XL', 'Zhang YY', 'Lv WG']","['Department of Pharmacy, the Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, China. lwglaiyang@outlook.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Itgb1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*genetics', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",,,,,2019/03/28 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201903_17238 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Mar;23(5):1996-2002. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201903_17238.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 98 AML patients were enrolled. Among these subjects, 47 patients were treated with HCAG chemotherapy, while 51 patients were treated with FLAG chemotherapy. RESULT: The complete remission (CR) and overall remission (OFF) were 24% and 38%, respectively in patients with HCAG induction chemotherapy, while the corresponding percentages were 28% and 42% in subject receiving FLAG chemotherapy. The median survival time of progress-free survival (PFS) was 29.8 (95% CI 23.749-35.851) months in the HCAG group and 30.8 (95% CI 21.728-39.872) months in the FLAG group (P = 0.620). A total of 42 patients in the HCAG group suffered from grade 4 hematological toxicity, while this adverse reaction was noted for all patients who were treated with FLAG chemotherapy (P = 0.023). A total of 19 cases indicated apparent nonhematological toxicity in the HCAG group, while only 40 (78.4%) were noted with these adverse reactions in the FLAG group (P = 0.000).

We studied risk factors for mortality and survival in children with AML in a LMIC to develop strategies to improve survival for AML children in these countries. This retrospective cohort (2000-2014) analyzed newly diagnosed AML patients (age < 19 years) at a reference center in Brazil. Demographic and clinical variables were reviewed by AML subtype: acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), AML with Down syndrome (AML-DS), and other AML subtypes. Cumulative hazard risk for early death (ED) until 6 weeks of treatment and risk factors for mortality were determined by the multivariate Cox hazard models. Survival was assessed for each AML subtypes. A total of 220 patients were diagnosed: APL 50 (22.7%), AML-DS 16 (7.3%), and other AML subtypes 154 (70.0%). The cumulative hazard function values for ED for all patients with AML were 12.5% (95% CI 8.5-18.4%); for each AML patients subtypes: APL, 21.7% (95% CI 11.7-40.5%); AML-DS, 6.2% (95% CI 0.9-44.4%); and other AML subtypes, 10.2% (95% CI 6.2-17.0%). White blood cell count (cutoff 10 x 10(9)/L for APL and 100 x 10(9)/L for other AML subtypes) and Afro-descendance were significant risk factors for mortality in APL and other AML subtypes, respectively. Overall survival for patients with APL, AML-DS, and other AML subtypes was 66.8%, 62.5%, and 38.0%, respectively. APL patients had the highest incidence of ED and those with other subtypes had increased relapse risk. We also observed high rates of death in complete remission mainly due to infection.

Early consideration of the diagnosis is essential in at-risk patients, exhibiting suggestive signs and symptoms. A 56-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia initially presented with neutropenic fever before subsequently developing dense hemiplegia due to septic emboli to the spine and multifocal abscesses. These findings were later determined to be a result of a disseminated mucor infection and represented a rare manifestation of the disease. Despite the disseminated nature of the infection, identification of the causative organism was initially impeded by limitations in obtaining a tissue sample in a severely thrombocytopenic patient, as is common among hematologic malignancy patients. As a result of this limitation, diagnosis was ultimately made via PCR on bronchiolar lavage fluid. Early consideration of the diagnosis with prompt initiation of treatment is of utmost importance in this invasive infection. Further research is needed to identify and validate rapid, minimally invasive strategies for early diagnosis of mucormycosis.","['Paul, Shira R', 'Gable, Preston S']","['Paul SR', 'Gable PS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, Box 555191, Camp Pendleton, CA 92055, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Naval Medical Center San Diego, 34800 Bob Wilson Drive, San Diego, CA 92134, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190219,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,PMC6399552,,,,2019/03/28 06:00,2019/03/28 06:01,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4842150 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Feb 19;2019:4842150. doi: 10.1155/2019/4842150. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7191-2141'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We discuss here another patient diagnosed with primary cutaneous T-cell LBL at our institute. This patient was initially misdiagnosed as having peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS. Cytogenetic analysis showed the CDKN2A deletion (-9p21x2) in addition to three intact copies of ABL1 (+9q34).

We believe that this presentation of T-LBL is underreported, and many patients are likely misdiagnosed as having high-grade cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.

Results: Pardaxin also induced cell differentiation and maturation of THP-1 and U937 cells into macrophage-like cells with phagocytotic ability. Moreover, pardaxin elevated the expression of MyD88 but not toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 in both leukemic cells.

Considerable efforts have been expended toward silencing MYC, which drives many human cancers including Burkitt lymphomas (BL). Yet, the effects of MYC silencing on standard-of-care therapies are poorly understood. Here we found that inhibition of MYC transcription renders B-lymphoblastoid cells refractory to chemotherapeutic agents. This suggested that in the context of chemotherapy, stabilization of Myc protein could be more beneficial than its inactivation. We tested this hypothesis by pharmacologically inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), which normally targets Myc for proteasomal degradation. We discovered that chemorefractory BL cell lines responded better to doxorubicin and other anti-cancer drugs when Myc was transiently stabilized. In vivo, GSK3 inhibitors (GSK3i) enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in BL patient-derived xenografts (BL-PDX), as well as in murine MYC-driven lymphoma allografts. This enhancement was accompanied by and required deregulation of several key genes acting in the extrinsic, death-receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this mechanism of action, GSK3i also facilitated lymphoma cell killing by a death ligand TRAIL and by a death receptor agonist mapatumumab. Thus, GSK3i synergizes with both standard chemotherapeutics and direct engagers of death receptors and could improve outcomes in patients with refractory lymphomas.","['Harrington, Colleen T', 'Sotillo, Elena', 'Robert, Aude', 'Hayer, Katharina E', 'Bogusz, Agata M', 'Psathas, James', 'Yu, Duonan', 'Taylor, Deanne', 'Dang, Chi V', 'Klein, Peter S', 'Hogarty, Michael D', 'Geoerger, Birgit', 'El-Deiry, Wafik S', 'Wiels, Joelle', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko, Andrei']","['Harrington CT', 'Sotillo E', 'Robert A', 'Hayer KE', 'Bogusz AM', 'Psathas J', 'Yu D', 'Taylor D', 'Dang CV', 'Klein PS', 'Hogarty MD', 'Geoerger B', 'El-Deiry WS', 'Wiels J', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko A']","[""Division of Cancer Pathobiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", 'Cell & Molecular Biology Graduate Group, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', ""Division of Cancer Pathobiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", 'Stanford Cancer Institute, 265 Campus Dr., Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'CNRS UMR 8126, Univ Paris-Sud -

Using RNA-Seq we have selected 55 fusion transcripts identified by at least two of three detection methods in the same tumour. We confirmed the existence of 24 predicted novel fusions that had not been described in cancer or normal tissues yet, indicating the accuracy of the prediction. Of note, one of them involves the proto oncogene TAL1. Other confirmed fusions could explain the overexpression of driver genes such as COMMD3-BMI1, LMO1 or JAK3. Five fusions found exclusively in tumour samples could be considered pathogenic (NFYG-TAL1, RIC3-TCRBC2, SLC35A3-HIAT1, PICALM MLLT10 and MLLT10-PICALM). However, other fusions detected simultaneously in normal and tumour samples (JAK3-INSL3, KANSL1-ARL17A/B and TFG-ADGRG7) could be germ-line fusions genes involved in tumour-maintaining tasks. Notably, some fusions were confirmed in more tumour samples than predicted, indicating that the detection methods underestimated the real number of existing fusions. Our results highlight the potential of RNA-Seq to identify new cryptic fusions, which could be drivers or tumour-maintaining passenger genes. Such novel findings shed light on the searching for new T-LBL biomarkers in these haematological disorders.","['Lopez-Nieva, Pilar', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Pablo', 'Grana-Castro, Osvaldo', 'Andres-Leon, Eduardo', 'Santos, Javier', 'Villa-Morales, Maria', 'Cobos-Fernandez, Maria Angeles', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez, Laura', 'Malumbres, Marcos', 'Salazar-Roa, Maria', 'Fernandez-Piqueras, Jose']","['Lopez-Nieva P', 'Fernandez-Navarro P', 'Grana-Castro O', 'Andres-Leon E', 'Santos J', 'Villa-Morales M', 'Cobos-Fernandez MA', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez L', 'Malumbres M', 'Salazar-Roa M', 'Fernandez-Piqueras J']","['Department of Cellular Biology and Immunology, Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Center (CBMSO), CSIC-Madrid Autonomous University, Madrid, 28049, Spain.', 'Institute of Health Research Jimenez Diaz Foundation, Madrid, 28040, Spain.', 'Consortium for Biomedical Research in Rare Diseases (CIBERER), Spain.

Here we explored the possibility of a mechanistic link between the two. We observed that the expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) was elevated in HTLV-1 infected cell lines. Knocking down of Notch1 in ATL cells repressed cellular proliferation and tumor formation both in vitro and in vivo. As a mechanism for these actions, we found that Tax activated Notch1 signaling by prolonging the half-life of NICD. We then showed that Tax, NICD, and RBP-jkappa formed a ternary complex, that Tax enhanced the association of NICD with RBP-jkappa, and that Tax, NICD, and RBP-jkappa were bound to RBP-jkappa-responsive elements. Hence, our results suggest that HTLV-1 promotes cellular proliferation and tumor formation of ATL cells by modulating Notch signaling via a posttranslational mechanism that involves interactions between Tax, NICD, and RBP-jkappa.","['Cheng, Wenzhao', 'Zheng, Tingjin', 'Wang, Yong', 'Cai, Kun', 'Wu, Wencai', 'Zhao, Tiejun', 'Xu, Ruian']","['Cheng W', 'Zheng T', 'Wang Y', 'Cai K', 'Wu W', 'Zhao T', 'Xu R']","['Engineering Research Center of Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, China.

However, the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of Plzf in neural stem cell is still unclear. Herein, using P19 embryonal carcinoma cells as a model, we observed that Plzf expression was induced in the P19-derived embryonic bodies, which enrich neural stem-like cell populations, as demonstrated by the expression of neural stem cell markers, Nestin and Sox2. We then characterized the Plzf promoter and identified two E2f1 binding sites (-755/-751 and -53/-49, the transcription start site was designated as +1) are important for the activation of Plzf promoter. Finally, we found that the induction of Plzf in the neural stem-like cells derived from pluripotent P19cells is decrease by E2f1 knockdown. Taken together, we conclude that E2f1 is an important transcription factor that regulates Plzf transcription and may involve in maintaining the self-renewal ability of neural stem cells.","['Lin, Hsin-Chuan', 'Ko, Chiung-Yuan', 'Lee, Kuen-Haur', 'Chen, I-Han', 'Kao, Tzu-Jen', 'Chang, Wen-Chang', 'Hsu, Tsung-I', 'Lee, Yi-Chao']","['Lin HC', 'Ko CY', 'Lee KH', 'Chen IH', 'Kao TJ', 'Chang WC', 'Hsu TI', 'Lee YC']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program for Neural Regenerative Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chinese Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program for Neural Regenerative Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program for Neural Regenerative Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Research Center of Neuroscience, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.

OBJECTIVE: We set out to evaluate the efficacy of GDC-0980, in pre-clinical studies, against pediatric leukemia cells. METHODS: The anti-neoplastic activity of GDC-0980 was evaluated in vitro using five different pediatric leukemia cells. RESULTS: Our data show that GDC-0980 significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cell lines, KOPN8 (IC50, 532 nM), SEM (IC50,720 nM), MOLM-13 (IC50,346 nM), MV4;11 (IC50,199 nM), and TIB-202 (IC50, 848 nM), compared to normal control cells (1.23 microM). This antiproliferative activity was associated with activation of cellular apoptotic mechanism characterized by a decrease in Bcl-2 protein phosphorylation and enhanced PARP cleavage. Western blot analyses of GDC-0980 treated cells also showed decreased phosphorylation levels of mTOR, Akt and S6, but not ERK1/2. Notably, FLT3 phosphorylation was decreased in Molm-13 and MV4;11 cells following the application of GDC-0980. We further examined cellular viability of GDC-0980-treated primary leukemia cells isolated from pediatric leukemia patients. This study revealed a potential therapeutic effect of GDC-0980 on two ALL patients (IC50's, 1.23 and 0.625 microM, respectively). Drug combination analyses of GDC-0980 demonstrated a synergistic activity with the MEK inhibitor Cobimetinib (MV4-11; 11, CI, 0.25, SEM, CI, 0.32, and TIB-202, CI, 0.55) and the targeted FLT3 inhibitor, Crenolanib (MV4-11; 11, CI, 0.25, SEM, CI, 0.7, and TIB-202, CI, 0.42). CONCLUSION: These findings provide initial proof-of-concept data and rationale for further investigation of GDC-0980 in selected subgroups of pediatric leukemia patients.","['Al-Ghabkari, Abdulhameed', 'Perinpanayagam, Maneka A', 'Narendran, Aru']","['Al-Ghabkari A', 'Perinpanayagam MA', 'Narendran A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 3280 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 3280 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 3280 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0', '(1-(4-((2-(2-aminopyrimidin-5-yl)-7-methyl-4-morpholinothieno(3,2-d)pyrimidin-6-y', 'l)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropan-1-one)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (PI3KCA protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*FLT3', '*ITD', '*PI3K', '*cell cytotoxicity', '*mTOR.']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2018/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-97546 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009619666190326120833 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2019;19(10):828-837. doi: 10.2174/1568009619666190326120833.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the pathogenesis of sensorineural hearing loss in leukemia is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal bone histopathology in 1 patient with leukemia and sensorineural hearing loss. METHODS: The histopathology of the temporal bones of 1 patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who suffered well-documented bilateral sequential profound sensorineural hearing loss 4 months before death was investigated using light microscopy. RESULT: There was evidence of ischemic necrosis of the neuroepithelium and intravascular fibrin micro-thrombi suggestive of intravascular coagulation in the cochlea and vestibular labyrinth. CONCLUSION: Intravascular coagulation may be a contributing factor in the commonly reported finding of hemorrhage in the cochlea in leukemia and may play a role in the pathogenesis of sensorineural loss in some cases of leukemia.","['Okayasu, Tadao', 'Faquin, William C', 'Nadol, Joseph B Jr']","['Okayasu T', 'Faquin WC', 'Nadol JB Jr']","['1 Otopathology Laboratory, Department of Otolaryngology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Otolaryngology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '1 Otopathology Laboratory, Department of Otolaryngology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Otolaryngology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190327,United States,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",0407300,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cochlea/pathology', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Temporal Bone/pathology', 'Vestibule, Labyrinth/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['histopathology', 'human', 'intravascular coagulation', 'leukemia', 'sensorineural hearing loss', 'temporal bone pathology']",,2019/03/28 06:00,2019/07/19 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0003489419838288 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. 2019 Aug;128(8):689-695. doi: 10.1177/0003489419838288.

While ALL therapies are highly effective, western studies have shown excesses late life effects of therapies in survivors. In this survey, we recruited subjects being diagnosed as ALL before the age of 18-year-old and had been in complete continuous remission for at least 3 years. Subjects were arranged to receive three cognitive tests (Wechsler intelligence test, Conners' continuous performance test, and Wisconsin card sorting test). Standardized questionnaires were used to inquiry about attention problem in real life context. Treatment outcome were compared between the standard risk and high/very high risk groups. Final survivors were 42 subjects (26 males, 16 females) with median current age of 17.8 years. Subjects were diagnosed to be with ALL at a median age of 4.8 years. The median survival time (from discontinuation of ALL treatment to the study date) was 8.4 years. Results indicated that 17 subjects (40.5%) had chronic physical conditions in need of clinical management and six subjects (14.3%) had mental condition. For the performance-based cognitive outcome, the average full scale intelligence quotient was 91.7 +/- 13.8. Ten percent of the subjects had problem in test of attention, 20% had problem in test of impulsivity and 42.8% of the subject had problems in executive function. When judged from real life contexts, 19 subjects (42%) were with obvious attention problems. Group comparison between standard risk vs high/very high risk patients revealed no difference in neurocognitive outcomes. We hope that this information may benefit the implementation of follow-up program for Taiwanese pediatric leukemia survivors.","['Chiou, Shyh-Shin', 'Lin, Pei-Chin', 'Liao, Yu-Mei', 'Yang, Pinchen']","['Chiou SS', 'Lin PC', 'Liao YM', 'Yang P']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190326,China (Republic : 1949- ),Kaohsiung J Med Sci,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,100960562,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Attention/*drug effects', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*drug effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Executive Function/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Impulsive Behavior/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'morbidity', 'neurocognitive function', 'survivor']",,2019/03/27 06:00,2020/02/07 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/kjm2.12061 [doi]'],ppublish,Kaohsiung J Med Sci. 2019 Jun;35(6):373-378. doi: 10.1002/kjm2.12061.

Our previous work demonstrated that tungsten exposure resulted in an accumulation of pre-B cells in the bone marrow, the same cell type that accumulates in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To better understand the relevant molecular mechanisms, we performed RNA-sequencing on flow sorted pre-B cells from control and tungsten-exposed mice. Tungsten decreased the expression of multiple genes critical for B cell development, including members of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and pre-B cell receptor signaling pathways, such as Jak1, Stat5a, Pax5, Syk, and Ikzf3. These results were confirmed in an in vitro model of B cell differentiation, where tungsten arrested differentiation at the pro-B cell stage and inhibited proliferation. These changes were associated with decreased expression of multiple genes in the IL-7R signaling pathway and decreased percentage of IL-7R, phosphorylated STAT5 double-positive cells. Supplementation with IL-7 or overexpression of Pax5, the transcription factor downstream of IL-7R, rescued the tungsten-induced differentiation block. Together, these data support the hypothesis that IL-7R/Pax5 signaling axis is critical to tungsten-mediated effects on pre-B cell development. Importantly, many of these molecules are modulated in ALL.","['Wu, Ting Hua', 'Bolt, Alicia M', 'Chou, Hsiang', 'Plourde, Dany', 'De Jay, Nicolas', 'Guilbert, Cynthia', 'Young, Yoon Kow', 'Kleinman, Claudia L', 'Mann, Koren K']","['Wu TH', 'Bolt AM', 'Chou H', 'Plourde D', 'De Jay N', 'Guilbert C', 'Young YK', 'Kleinman CL', 'Mann KK']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine.', 'Department of Oncology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Tungsten Compounds)', '64LRH4405G (sodium tungstate(VI))']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Tungsten Compounds/*toxicity']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B lymphocyte', '*Differentiation', '*IL-7R', '*Pax5', '*Tungsten']",,2019/03/27 06:00,2020/07/25 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['5420169 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfz080 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2019 Jul 1;170(1):45-56. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfz080.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Several adult centers recently adopted pediatric protocols. Whether this has narrowed LOC disparities in real-world settings is unknown. METHODS: The IMPACT Cohort is an Ontario population-based cohort that captured demographic, disease and treatment (treatment protocol, chemotherapy doses) data for all 15-21 year olds diagnosed with ALL 1992-2011. Cancer outcomes were determined by chart abstraction and linkage to provincial healthcare databases. Treatment protocols were classified as pediatric- or adult-based. We examined predictors of outcome, including LOC, protocol, disease biology, and time period. RESULTS: Of 271 patients, 152 (56%) received therapy at adult centers. 5-year event-free survival (EFS +/- SE) among AYA at pediatric vs adult centers was 72% +/- 4% vs 56% +/- 4% (P = 0.03); 5-year overall survival (OS) was 82% +/- 4% vs 64% +/- 4% (P < 0.001). After adjustment, OS remained inferior at adult centers (hazard ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 1.1-6.1; P = 0.04). In the most recent period (2006-2011), 39/59 (66%) AYA treated at adult centers received pediatric protocols. These AYA had outcomes superior to the 20 AYA treated on adult protocols, but inferior to the 44 AYA treated at pediatric centers (EFS 72% +/- 5% vs 60% +/- 9% vs 81% +/- 6%; P = 0.02; OS 77% +/- 7% vs 65% +/- 11% vs 91% +/- 4%; P = 0.004). Induction deaths and treatment-related mortality did not vary by LOC. CONCLUSIONS: Survival disparities between AYA with ALL treated in pediatric vs adult centers have persisted over time, partially attributable to incomplete adoption of pediatric protocols by adult centers. Although pediatric protocol use has improved survival, residual disparities remain, perhaps due to other differences in care between adult and pediatric centers.","['Gupta, Sumit', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Baxter, Nancy N', 'Sutradhar, Rinku', 'Lau, Cindy', 'Nagamuthu, Chenthila', 'Nathan, Paul C']","['Gupta S', 'Pole JD', 'Baxter NN', 'Sutradhar R', 'Lau C', 'Nagamuthu C', 'Nathan PC']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, 480 University Ave, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of General Surgery, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."", 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190326,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Protocols', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Ontario', 'Pediatrics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC6536996,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphobastic leukemia', '*adolescents and young adults', '*locus of care', '*population-based', '*survival']",,2019/03/27 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2096 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 May;8(5):2095-2103. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2096.

Materials & methods: Community-practice hematologists/oncologists completed patient record forms for their regular AML patients. Patients were invited to complete patient self-completion forms including 3-Level EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) questionnaires. Results: Physicians provided patient record forms for 389 patients (339 newly diagnosed, 50 relapsed/refractory); 68 patients completed patient self-completion forms. Mean EQ-5D visual-analog scale and index and FACT-General scores were significantly lower than US population norms (p < 0.0001); health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores were generally lower than 11 other cancers. Conclusion: HRQoL impairment is grave in AML. Efforts are needed to improve HRQoL in affected patients.","['Mamolo, Carla M', 'Cappelleri, Joseph C', 'Hoang, Caroline J', 'Kim, Ruth', 'Hadfield, Anna', 'Middleton, Chloe', 'Rider, Alex', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Mamolo CM', 'Cappelleri JC', 'Hoang CJ', 'Kim R', 'Hadfield A', 'Middleton C', 'Rider A', 'Walter RB']","['Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, NY 10017, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, NY 10017, USA.', 'Adelphi Real World, Cheshire, SK10 5JB, UK.', 'Adelphi Real World, Cheshire, SK10 5JB, UK.', 'Adelphi Real World, Cheshire, SK10 5JB, UK.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190326,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,,IM,"['Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Public Health Surveillance', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'quality of life', 'real-world']",,2019/03/27 06:00,2019/11/28 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/fon-2018-0842 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2019 Jun;15(16):1895-1909. doi: 10.2217/fon-2018-0842.

This study was conducted to examine whether OGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism is associated with the genetic background of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in Sudan. Methods: A total of 332 CML patients and 70 healthy controls were included in this study. Overall, the genotypes (P=0.0000) and allele (C vs. G, P=0.0007) differed considerably in the frequencies of OGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism between CML patients and controls. Our study is the first to evaluate the association of polymorphism with CML risk with OGG1 rs1052133. Results: A statistically significant association was observed between the genotype distribution of OGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism and CML (P=0.0000) patients. A similar result was also observed in the allele distribution (C vs. G, P=0.0007) compared with healthy controls when compared OGG1 rs1052133 genotypes with CML stages. Results: Genotype and allele frequencies of OGG1 rs1052133 among CML patients. A statistically significant association was observed between the genotype distribution of the OGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism and CML patients (P=0.0000). A similar result was also observed in the allele distribution (C vs. G, P=0.0007) compared with healthy controls with stages of CML in OGG1 rs1052133 genotypes. Conclusion: The results suggest that single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene involved in the restoration of DNA base excision (OGG1 rs1052133) can play a key role in the risk of appearance of CML. To clarify the role of OGG1 in the genetic basis of CML, further case control with larger sample sizes and fine-mapping is required.","['Hassan, Fathelrahman M']",['Hassan FM'],"['Department of Clinical laboratory Science, College of Applied Medical Science, Imam Abdulrahman, Bin Faisal University, Saudi Arabia.

DNA methylation and changes in the microRNAs (miRNAs) expression are known to be important causes of B-ALL. Decitabine as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor agent is able to induce hypomethylation in several tumor suppressor genes. Much evidence has proven BTG2, PPP1CA, and PTEN act as tumor suppressor genes in many malignancies. In this case control study, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of PPP1CA, BTG2, and PTEN genes using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in Nalm6 cell line and five patients suffer from ALL with mean age 5.6 years were determined in compare with seven normal healthy donors age and sex matched. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of PPP1CA, BTG2, and PTEN genes were significantly decreased in Nalm6 ([FC] = 0.46, [FC] = 0.046, [FC] = 0.54) and according to the Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis, these genes were hypermethylated in Nalm6. In next step, the effects of decitabine treatment on the methylation and expression of these genes in association with changes in miR-125b, miR-17, and miR-181b expression levels were evaluated in optimal concentration 2.5 microM of decitabine. Our data showed that decitabine is able to restore the expression levels of aforementioned genes and downregulate expression levels of oncomiRs; including miR-125b, miR-17, and miR-181b in Nalm6 cell line. Therefore, it seems that decitabine can be used as a potential drug for the first line treatment of patients with B-ALL, but further in vivo investigation is necessary.","['Vafadar, Asma', 'Mokaram, Pooneh', 'Erfani, Mehran', 'Yousefi, Zahra', 'Farhadi, Ali', 'Elham Shirazi, Tehrani', 'Tamaddon, Gholamhossein']","['Vafadar A', 'Mokaram P', 'Erfani M', 'Yousefi Z', 'Farhadi A', 'Elham Shirazi T', 'Tamaddon G']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190325,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN17 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1CA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Decitabine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*DNA methylation', '*NALM6', '*decitabine', '*microRNA']",,2019/03/27 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.28590 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Aug;120(8):13156-13167. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28590.
